                                  are probationary members, and not full members 
                                  of the clan they are usually picked on and ordered 
                                  around a little, but never so much that they 
                                  would lose interest in joining the Clan. Recruits

                                  2. They are added to the Recruit Roster List 
                                  on the web site.<br>
                                  3. They are guild invited by their race officer

                                  4. They have one month to find a mentor of Brother/Sister 
                                  or Higher rank. If after a month has passed 
                                  they cannot find a mentor they are booted. This 
                                  makes them meet members to find a mentor. <br>
                                  5. It is common practice to seek out mentors 
                                  of the recruit's own profession and race, but 
                                  is not necessary. <br>
                                  6. When they have a mentor they are made an 
                                  Apprentice. They need to contact the officers 
                                  to get their title changed to Apprentice, to 
                                  get them full board access, to move to their 
                                  race's roster, and to make it known who their 
                                  mentor is so it can be noted on the rosters 
                                  as well.<br>
                                  7. The change from Recruit top Apprentice can 
                                  happen at anytime, one does not have to wait 
                                  until the Gathering though it is acceptable 
                                  to announce a choosing of an apprentice there.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">ShadowClan is not democratic. However,

all its members are encouraged to participate in discussions of clan policy.

Votes on clan policy will ultimately be made by the Elders, Dark Cabals,

the Race Captains,&nbsp; and the Oracle. Votes can be over-ridden

by the 2 Clan Elders if they choose to do so and only if the Elders agree

to do so. The Elders are their own balancing system since they must be

in agreement in order to have any power. The Elders' positions are intended

to be filled by individuals who "bump heads" often, so to speak. Their

actions should always be motivated by the most basic beliefs of the founders

of the clan.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Policy discussion threads can be started

by a Dark Cabal member or their designee in order to query the membership

for different opinions and ideas. Votes will then be held by a Dark Cabal

member when they feel discussion is over. If you have an issue you believe

needs to be discussed, submit a request to your Dark Cabal member.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Election of Dark Cabal - is accomplished

by a vote of the clan members who are of that race. There is one Dark Cabal

member per each of the four evil races... Tier'dal, Iksar, Ogre, and Troll. So,

for example, if we need a new Ogre Dark Cabal member, then all Ogres of

Minion status would get to vote on nominees approved by the current Cabal.&nbsp;
The vote will be posted by a current member of&nbsp; Dark Cabal rank.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Nominees for Dark Cabal positions can

be sent to the current Cabal members. The Dark Cabal may interview the

candidates if they wish, and will then pick those that they feel can best

handle the position. The nominees approved by the Cabal will then be voted

on.</font>

This has never been attempted, therefore it can also be said that there

have never been any survivors!&nbsp;&nbsp; The second,

The Clan leaders may take the issue to discussion amongst themselves an

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The gods have willed that once a Norrathian

Year* a new Shadow Lord will rise to power from the ashes of the old. This

prevents the clan from drifting away from the gods under the banner of

a single powerful and charismatic leader. As such it is the will of the

Gods that on or around the dawning of a Norrathian Year* a competition

will be held to decide who is worthy to lead the clan.&nbsp;This takes place
each month on the 15th day.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The clansmen competing announce their

desire to compete and from those hopefuls, the ones who will compete are

selected by the Dark Cabal. They then compete in a series of one on one

elimination battles, until only one remains standing... this is the New

Shadowlord.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The Shadow Lord competition is open

to Warriors types only, no mage or priest may enter. It is feared that

if a Dark Elf was allowed to compete he might rise to power through the

use of trickery and underhanded tactics. If this happened he might not

have the backing to lead the brutes and could instead lead the clan to

civil war. Hence it is not common to see a Dark Elf in this battle. The

competition is a brute force match although it's not uncommon for everything

from throwing axes and poisons to make it into the battle. Shadowknights

are known to use the powers of their god in the battle as well. The Shadow

Lord is regarded by the Ogres and Trolls as the most powerful figure in

the clan. He is to be feared and his every command to be followed to the

letter. Rarely is he directly challenged. Dark Elves have been known to

feign more respect then they actually have for him though, privately regarding

him as a puppet.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">From time to time figureheads of various

titles among the mystics and priests have risen to power and become powerful

advisers to the Shadow Lord. There is no set means for how this happens,

nor does this always occur. Sometimes the figure comes to power as an adviser

to the current Shadow Lord. At other times it has been known to occur when

a weaker Shadow Lord comes to power shifting the balance more in favor

of the Dark Elves. This Grand Mystic or High Prophet is most commonly a

Dark Elf but has been known to be a shaman from time to time as well, depending

on who the Shadow Lord favors.&nbsp;</font>
