<br>
I've played EQ since day 1 on and off depending on my mood and have been in a lot of guilds during that time.<br>
<br>
The first ever guild I was in was based on meeting new friends in EQ along with a few RL friends I had in MN.  The guild had nothing in common really other then we worked well together and enjoyed each others company.  My friend and I in MN were the only two gay men in the guild that I know of.  We really didn't bother we talking about our orientation because it really wasn't a big deal.  A vast majority of them actually became RL friends from the guild and have met, but the two of us really never tried to pursue that.  Anyways, we lost alot of memebers during this time because the GL didn't want to focus on recruiting or on trying to do new things because he wanted to keep it a family.<br>
<br>
Eventually when we decided to move off of Fennin Ro during the first ever movelog, we all ended up joining another guild that was much more established and contained higher levels.  During that time, the people in my old guild had alot of growing pains and some quit, moved onto other characters etc. and I ended up taking my first break.  <br>
<br>
While I was gone, the all left the old guild and created a new guild.   That lasted for a while, but eventually the draw of being in a bigger guild becomes too strong and a vast majority of them went to two different guilds.  One of the guilds was the uber guild on the server, the other more of a 2nd tier guild, but very up and coming.<br>
<br>
Anyways, forward to today.  The uber guild that they all moved too split into two guilds and now has become Township Rebellion (for those that dont' know TR is the uber guild on Stormhammer (legends server)).  All of my friends ended up moving into the guild that the other part moved into and now some of htem are officers.<br>
<br>
However, for me and my friend, the lack of a family was starting to show and it became apparant that we would always come last no matter how much we did for everyone.  So, during my first break, my friend actually moved from Druzzil Ro to The Nameless.  Joined one of the gay guilds that is out there (Nameless Love).  <br>
<br>
Nameless Love went through the same thing you are going through and I think alot of little guilds go through.   For small guilds, a lot of players level at different rates and it becomes very hard for the family to stay together.  Lower level members feel left out of the high level stuff or don't understand why they can't come along.  High level members feel sometimes the low level members are riding their coattails.<br>
<br>
Anyways, When I came back, my friend had left Namless Love and moved onto The Nameless of Mercy.  Its really a great guild, its grown over the last couple of years and has started doing places like Hall of Testing, etc.  Its growing, and they eventually had to make the decision what to do.  If they kep tthe guild at its current size, there would be alot of things that were not doable.  If we could recruit some good high level players we might have a shot at doing alot more stuff.  <br>
<br>
The decision was made to do alot more active recruitment and so far its worked out well.  Players are told right up front that we are a very open guild and any bashing of any sort will not be tolerated.  Members have either left or been kicked out because of it, but that's part of the growing process.  However, we've found that a vast majority of the players that are adults have no problems with the rules.<br>
<br>
I know I've probably rambled alot, but its really a tough battle in EQ to keep a small guild together.  If the guild has levels spread all over, it in all honesty becomes more of a chat channel then anything else.  There is nothing wrong with that, but the one thing I can say is never hold any grudges against anyone for leaving because they want to grow with their character (I can give an example of a bear from NY that has a level 59 epic bard who has come/joined NoM several times).  As long as they leave on good terms and don't bash the guild, never hold it against them.  We all play the game differently and after all, it should be fun.<br>
