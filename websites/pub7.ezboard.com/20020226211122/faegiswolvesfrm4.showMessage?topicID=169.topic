<br>
I've seen this worked at alot in various methods by various guilds and I want to make a couple of points:<br>
<br>
(1)  The system is cumbersome and someone has to keep track.  Given our current track record on keeping track of things, this would be a serious burden to take up.<br>
<br>
(2)  No matter what you do, people will be miffed over loot distributions.<br>
<br>
(3)  Point systems tend to be heavily waited towards those that can play alot.  Given that we have a lot of players who are part time (at best), we'll end up with a stratified point system.<br>
<br>
(4)  No matter what you do, people will be miffed over loot distributions.<br>
<br>
(5)  Balancing a point system will take a ton of time.<br>
<br>
(6)  No matter what you do, people will be miffed over loot distributions.<br>
<br>
Given all of the above, I propose that we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  do not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> adopt a point system.<br>
<br>
Rather, I would rather us take up a system which is representative of how loot is distributed on most of the common group raid areas - the loot council.<br>
<br>
The loot council should consist of the group leaders and raid leader for the given raid.  Loot should be awarded on a &quot;need&quot; basis for affected characters and should only be awarded to characters present (not secondaries of players present).  If the council can't decide, then /random it.<br>
<br>
Also, if we're going to do this, we need to address cost.  High level spells have spell components which require lots of money to buy for a raid.  We need to adopt a system which renumerates casters for spell components, otherwise, they will bear the brunt of the cost while others gain the rewards.  Some raids cover this by splitting all gems amongst the casters only, we can look at this or other alternatives.<br>
<br>
Just food for thought...<br>

<br>
the main concern we as elders should want is a fair but easy loot system. this assumes we can get raiding working right 8P<br>
<br>
I agree with the component cost of spells. i am trying to get into the habit of bringing gems for the cleric. i have also tithed so to speak to them. my biggest problem is knowing when they cast something on me that requires a particular gem.<br>
<br>
anyway it is something we need to discuss. i dont know if we should have a officers meeting over it that is for others to decide. but you are absolutly right Forin.<br>
<br>
Also if i jumped the gun please forgive me. my main concern was to at least for this raid have some rules for better orginization in hopes to avoid what happened last weekend.<br>

<br>
Costs can get prohibitive quickly - for example:<br>
<br>
Let's say that you've got this really neat spell that eats a peridot when it's cast - like say, the high level cleric symbol, dragon lure, etc.....<br>
<br>
Let's say you've got a raid of 5 groups, each requiring symbol to be cast on at least 4 members of the party.  That's 20 symbols cast on a spell with a duration of 54 minutes.  For the sake of arguement, let's call it an hour even....  So, we've got 20 peridots being consumed each hour (with more in the event of deaths).  To cover the death issue, let's assume an average increase of 20% in consumables.  This means that our theoretical raid will consume 22 peridots an hour at a cost of approximately 12 per peridot or 262 PP per hour.  And that's just for the clerics!<br>
<br>
Raid costs can get very high, very quickly.... <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Forin Ironshield</B><BR>

<br>
262 / 5 = 52.4 plat an hour per group.<br>
<br>
now do we pay for those 52 plat in gems by the buffee's (if that is a word) paying the cleric with plat or gems to replace. ie.. Warrioress in group either gives the cleric at the end of a 5 hour event the following plat (again using your numbers with 4 tanks in group)<br>
<br>
52.4 / 4 = 13.1 * 5 = 65.5 Platinum pieces.<br>
<br>
Or do we require that all tanks bring with them 10 perdots to every event. this provides a larger outlay fo cash for the tanks up front.<br>
<br>
12 * 10 = 120 plat.<br>
<br>
at the end of the night they take the gems used and subtract that from their 10 and purchase those gems needed to get themselves back to 10. ie..<br>
<br>
10 - 5 = 5<br>
5 * 12 = 60 plat to purcahse 5 gems to refill to 10 gems in inventory.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Do we split the cost of the stones amonth the entire group? i mean the cleric will be (hopefully) gaining plat and exp off the work of his spells and the tanks. this of course is also true of the 6th member of the group. Again numbers are 4 tanks, 1 cleric and someone else (whome is not using stones of some sort)<br>
<br>
so this way you have 52.4 / 6 = 8.75 (rounded slighty up) per person in the group.<br>
<br>
8.75 * 5 = 43.67 plat per person.<br>
<br>
43.67 * 5 = 218.35<br>
with the cleric being responsable for the last 43.67<br>
<br>
218.35 + 43.67 = 262.02<br>
<br>
to me the best solution is to have everyone who is coming to the raid bring 10 stones for every buff that will be cast upon them. provide those stones to the cleric and have him be responsible for any stones for buffs for himself.<br>
<br>
IE warrioress arrives at Raid point. group is formed. warrioress knows that the raid will last 5 hours gets 5 perdoits out and gives them to cleric and says these are for my buffs.<br>
<br>
Now the warrioress Dies in hour 3. when she gets back to group gets her stuff she hands the cleric another stone for her rebuff or waits till the cleric is out of stones for her then hands him a new one.<br>
<br>
to me this would be best. because then the other 5 members of their party have already paid for their buffs. and no worry about money or tithing has to take place during the raid.<br>
<br>
the hard part is the initial outlay of cash. but beyond that it just becomes a matter of covering yourself for buffs.<br>
<br>
anyway comments welcome. <br>
<br>
see you tonight<br>

<br>
First, the Thrar and Co. way (or the small single group method):  Party commie loots and the cost of spell components is ripped off of the top before split.  This is the best way to handle a small group of characters run by friends.<br>
<br>
Second, the Pickup Raid method:  All persons joining raid are required to &quot;buy&quot; in with the appropriate stones which are collected by the raid leader and distributed to the casters.  This is the best method if you aren't sure who's coming and if you don't want to levy some dues system on the guild.  The draw back here is that there can be NO exceptions.  You are relying on the raid members to provide materials needed for the raid, showing up with 120PP instead of 10 peridots won't cut it.  Showing up empty handed won't cut it either.<br>
<br>
Third, the casters loot gems method:  all gem drops are scooped up by the casters, commie pooled and split at the end of the night to cover costs.  This works great in some areas and not so great in others.  Frequently used in Hate where gem drops are common.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the euber system:  Guild fronts cost of all gems.  This cost requires and extensive guild treasury which is funded by either guild dues or selling euber loot in GBay. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Forin Ironshield</B><BR>

<br>
Loot systems -<br>
<br>
Just about every major guild I know of uses point systems.  Most of them are based on the point system developed my Afterlife.  In fact, I only know of one major guild that does not use a point system - and that is my guild - Vae Inimicus.  I don't like point systems for two reasons - First, the loot goes to the person with the most points, not where the loot will most benefit the guild or its memebers.  Second, loot rots.  We are always hearing about loot rotting on *someuberguild*'s raid because no one is willing to spend the points on it.  Sometimes that is loot that would be an improvement.  For instance, I not too long ago got a very minimal upgrade to my arms from crystal chiton to PoG.  I got 2 points of ac some mana and maybe 25 to 30 hitpoints.  No other primary in the guild would have benefited from them.  If I had needed to spend points to get them, they would have rotted.  <br>
<br>
That being said, every other raiding guild I know of uses a point system except maybe OEM, and they are just becoming a raiding guild.  This tells me that apparently there is something about it that seems to work.<br>
<br>
Costs<br>
<br>
Clerics will rarely make gem costs on a raid other than maybe hate or seb.  Be as generous as you can with them, but be prepared to be generous with them outside of raids as well.  Also, at lower levels you won't be casting symbol on everyone, at least not symbols requiring a peridot.<br>
<br>
General comments<br>
<br>
Raiding is a whole different thing from grinding <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As much as miss so many of you, I was never really content in EQ until I started to raid.  My on line time belongs first to my guild.  But when I can (and it won't be as often as I might) I would be happy to discuss raiding with you, and maybe even drop by to buff occasionally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Need before greed.<br>
<br>
I detest the point system. Usually, as Forin stated, it benefits the player who is on the most instead of the player that truly needs the item. We are pretty good at donating items that we aquire and dont need to other guild members (or selling at a discount rate if we need cash), and in raids we usually have a good idea of who needs what before we begin. If more than one person needs an item, I feel it should go in an order something like this:<br>
<br>
1) Primary characters. <br>
2) Character level.<br>
3) Seniority. &lt;=This does not necessarily mean time with the guild. Participation and involvement mean more to me than how long you have worn your tag.<br>
<br>
Anyway...thats a generalization of my viewpoint. I can break it down more if needed. <br>

<br>
Okies i have received a lot of negitive feed back both here and in game that we as elders should not look at that ave at least at this time if ever.<br>
<br>
My feelings are this.<br>
<br>
Loot should be given to who ever needs it. group one kills something that drops a dagger that rogue in group 2 could use  then rogue gets it.<br>
<br>
If Something Drops and No one can use it then it is randomed to everyone. who ever wins it can do with it as they please.<br>
<br>
Also i dont want to see us doing the Let Loot Rot route. <br>
as long as it is not no drop and no one needs it there is no reason everybody cant random for the Breast Plate of Elvish Destruction. We need money. and the money gained from the sale of afore mentioned Breast Plate of Elvish Destruction might buy Mr. Mage his next set of spells or maybe get him a dropped spell someone has found.<br>
<br>
Something else that has been expressed to me that people dont want to see us handing a Looted Breast Plate Of Elvish Destruction (Warrior) to Leetah the Druid to twink her warrior twink. If no one needs it then if Leetah wants a chance at she can Random for it. If she loses said random she can go talk to Mr. MoMo the Winner and Work a Deal for it. (why is it i think of Don Rickles in Kelly's Heros when i say that 8P) Other wise Leetah can bring her twink to the event and not Leetah.<br>
<br>
I dont know if that makes sense but i kind of agree with it. and can see where they are coming from. the other side of the coin (playing devils advocate here.) if we loot a Breast PLate of Elvish Destruction(tm) and we did give it to Leetah to Put on her twink it would better a guild char. <br>
<br>
but that is something for us to decide.<br>
<br>
anyway hasta <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/ujonan32.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jonan32</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/3/02 3:04:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvesfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well..</span><hr size=1> I like the commie looter rule, and I agree with the paying back of casters first.  Lord Brell knows that clerics in random groups almost never get repayment of gems.  After that, it should be equal share.  The only problem with this is if someone needs to leave early.  They must not be forgotten when it is time to hand out the loot.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Loot should to the player that is at the raid that NEEDS it.  Next in order, IMHO, should go to the primary guild member that needs it, and then after that random roll.  I would also like to add, since I know a few people that SUCK at rolling, once someone wins a random, they are out for the next random until the entire raid gets something.  I don't like seeing people leave a raid empty-handed.<br>
<br>
I have seen these rules in place in Hate and in CoM and it works well.  The only problem is if you have someone outside the guild, they might have a ligit gripe about other guild primaries getting the loot.<br>
