<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Objectives:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A: develope team work and coordinatin required to do more sophisticated raids.<br>
<br>
B: Work our way down to some point on the lowest level and hold it<br>
<br>
C: Have Fun in each others company <br>
<br>
this is for all levels from mid 20s up. this raid is to work on tactics and working together in groups. it is also to learn to coordinate groups. i will try and have a cleric on stand by who can reserect anyone who dies. assuming i can talk shaune into doing it 8P<br>
<br>
some simple rules for the get together.<br>
<br>
1) the time the raid starts is 2pm ergo be at the entrance to Runnyeye in misty Thicket no later that 130 pm est. we will form our groups at this time. if you snooze you lose. dont log in at 205 and say im coming because you wont be admited to the raid.<br>
<br>
that is harsh but if people really want to start doing these events they require a commitment from not only the raid organizers but from the members also. that means commiting the time required to do the raid properly. and if we really want to eventually go on plans raids whether it is an invitation by another guild or even if we get large enough to run our own we will need to have this down. dont start on time and you run the risk of someone sniping your raid.<br>
<br>
2)Go/No Go at 1:55 the raid leader (me in this case) will call a go/no go for the raid. not enough people show up raid will be called. in this case the only way a no go will be called is if we have less than 6 people. however if a no go is called i will have a plan for those who bracketed the time to do the raid. we will go somewhere and do something fun. even if it is just go to unrest work our way down to the ghost and get us a bunch of dwarven workboots.<br>
<br>
3)Run/Evac calls. only 3 people can call a run/evac. the group leader, the puller, and the healer. If anyone of these calls a run/evac then you do exactly that. No stopping to make sure anyone is following you. no staying back to aid so and so.<br>
<br>
I know when i see it get called it is hard for me to turn and run on a wolf. i want to stay by their side and help them. well we cant do that on raids. especially on high level zone/planes raids. so if a run is called you go. dont look back dont do anything but run to the zone or if you have a wizzy or druid keep the stuff aggroed on you till they can get the evac spell off.<br>
<br>
One more note on this subject. i am of the mind that if ANYONE calls a Run/Evac the group goes. better it be an accident and have finger pointing later than everyone die.<br>
<br>
4) Teamwork. Raids are about team work. whether they are 1 group or a whole guild. so that means no running off to do your own thing. no pulling because your bored while the raid gets going. No goofing off or out exploring. you sit with your group and wait. once the raid gets moving there will be communcations over both /g say and /gu say so try and keep close watch on whats said. if it means not talking as much well so be it but coordination is one of the keys. and if you miss something you could get yourself or your group killed. So be observant.<br>
<br>
5)Raid/Group leaders: the Order of Power in the Universe at a raid is this. 1st there is God. 2nd the Raid Leader. 3rd your Group leader. Because God grants Raid Leaders and Group leaders so much power they also carry a heavy burden. that burden is the responsability of ensure a safe and fun time for all participants. If a member of a group is not working with the team then the Raid/Group leader can ask them to leave. they will be escorted to some place safe and disbanded from the group.<br>
<br>
again this is harsh. However if we want to really do raids then we must learn to work together as a team. people who dont work as a team will get people who are working as a team killed. I wont stand for that. So i would rather hurt one persons feelings than watch 4 people have to do CR's and Rezes.<br>
<br>
6) Pulling to Safe Areas or Zone lines. this is a NO NO unless it is absolutly required for the tactical situation such as in hate. so no pulling to Safe Areas or Zone lines.<br>
<br>
7)Pullers. I have seen on well organized planes raids that the really good pullers wont ever bring a miss pull back to the group. they will take it someplace near but away from the group and let it kill them. then the raiders will send in a rogue to get the body and a rez will be administered.<br>
<br>
on this raid this should not be a problem. we should be able to muster the forces needed to handle anything you pull. but this is a note for future endevours and to keep it in mind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Loot. Loot will be administered by the prospective groups. <br>
<br>
Now these are my Rules for this raid. they are Harsh and they are Hard. they are not set in mud they are carved in stone. Many people complain that we dont do enough events. well that is true because we have zero coordination, no real commitment, and we are a group of individuals not a team. On any raid i lead these rules will apply (plus any more that i find need to be made as we go)<br>
<br>
So if your really ready to start raiding. if your really ready to commit the time and effort into doing this so that we can raid with our packmates then sign up below stating you have read these and are willing to abide by them. <br>
<br>
Hope to see you there<br>

I want to go with BOTH my characters! lol. Anyway, I will be there with whomever works best for this raid. Or if we can manage it, I will bring both and switch at some point.<br>
<br>
Two points of order for this and future raids. We might want to give people an idea of how long the raid is supposed to last, ie 1hr, 3hr, 6hr, whatever. Helps with planning so no one has to leave early.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't know about Burroch, but I know that if either of my characters managed to get to the Misty Thicket/Runneye line there would be a train behind them of mythical proportions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Might want to have an alt location for those of us who are KOS to halflings. I would suggest either the Runneye/Beholders Maze zone line or on the Runneye side of the Misty Thicket entrance. I will just run through to there. If there are no guards on the Misty Thicket side, I can zone in from this way, but don't want to risk it without further info. I know I am the exception in the guild for playing mostly evil classes/races, but I enjoy the challenges they present. If on some future raids something can't be worked out because of my race/class, I'll understand that it was my choice, so no problems there. Look forward to a GREAT raid, see you all there.<br>

<br>
as for which char you will play that is up to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

On Length of time another good point ill figure out a length of time and post it. and will add that to the template for posting raids. thank you for the catch on that.<br>
<br>
Also thought of something else. even though i am looking for a map of Runnyeye, i think all people going on the raid should have a map also. looks like another possible future rule. <p><img src="http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/personalpics/2hbpic3.jpg"><br><br>
