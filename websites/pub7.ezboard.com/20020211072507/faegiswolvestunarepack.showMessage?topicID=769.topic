<br>
Well the 3rd annual Tunare Reindeer games went over fairly well. Some places faired better than others.<br>
<br>
Sable and Harmonae had Kitty city. there they had a little trouble getting people to participate at first. However somewhere along the line Alcohol was produced as an enticement to the Kitties. well it worlked wonders and the Kitties and They had a blast.<br>
<br>
Many Gifts were given away and many newbies live made a little more fun.<br>
<br>
Mistmoor Raid:<br>
<br>
well we did nto fair as well here. we are not sue to working together as a guild and mistakes were made. as a result some people Died. and im sure this caused some concern and fustration. However thanks to Stonesbuster and Shaune we were able to get rezes and most of peoples experiance was recovered.<br>
<br>
This was a valuable Lesson to us. Many people have complained about the fact that we dont do enough events. So  here we have an event that should have been fairly easy. Yet because we are use to running around and doing our own thing so to speak we are not use to working as a group and using tactics. I know i made at least 2 mistakes during that Event. Stupid mistakes. Mistakes that I as a Druid know better about.<br>
<br>
1st) we were in this hall way. normally when we engage a mob i snare it. well we had 3 or 4 there. and we taking them down one at a time. i snared the first 3. some how i did not snare the 4th one. not sure why. but it turned and ran. this aggroed a ton more mobs. Group leader whos commands i was following said &quot;Evac!&quot;<br>
<br>
2nd ) Enter my second and fatal mistake to 2 wolves. I did not have evac memmed. I &quot;should&quot; have asked kronen (group 1's Leader) which evac he wanted up. but i forgot or got lazy or was over confidant. what ever it was it was bad.<br>
<br>
it is these Little things that cause us to waste a lot of time doing CR's and not having fun. If we really want to do events and if we really want to be able to aid our guildmates with raids and such we have all got to start working on tactics. this means we start out by doing raids on dungeons much lower than the chars. Such as Runnyeye. <br>
<br>
We must go in with a preset goals. and tactics to win those goals. we must practice our classes learn how to use them to their best ability. we must coordinate. <br>
<br>
Now. I may be jumping over my authority as an Elder. but i am going to work up some raid rules. these rules will be posted here or on a raids board. this will be simple rules and if followed should help us to solve some of the problems we had last night.<br>
<br>
anyway Did have some fun otherwise. and i think we can do a lot better at raids. if we start getting our abilities down and working together as a team i dont see why we cant start doing some of the hard stuff like Kedge someday.<br>
<br>
anyway hasta<br>

or XIcotl for the Hilt.Anyway let me know if my help is needed on this or anything wolves want to get done.<br>

Especially the castle.<br>
<br>
I know 60's that won't go in there unless they have absolute confidence in their group support.<br>
<br>
Its gotten much worse (on the dangerous scale) now that the zone isn't camped at all.  However, as an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> exclusive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hunting ground for raids, it can't be matched - no contests on drops, no campers, etc.<br>
<br>
You can't safely invis into the back of the castle <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> unless</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you luck out and there isn't an undead guard posted out in the main hall.  The only way you can 100% punch through with reliability is to have a high level (45+?) puller single pull the mobs in the hall out to an area where you can attack them cleanly or have multiple groups and serious crowd control (2+ enchanters w/ AOE mez up and ready).  The ambassador room just chain pulls too easily.  Thrar and his friends couldn't reliably fight through the hall without agroing the ambassador room at level 33-37.  That is principly why they left to go to the Tower of Frozen Shadow and Crystal Caverns.  They won't go back until the group as a whole is 40+.<br>
<br>
Some added complexities:  warping or &quot;ghosting&quot; patrols, idiots training the castle, etc, make this zone what it is.<br>
<br>
One thing that everyone going on a raid into a dungeon must be willing to deal with is party deaths and CRs.  It goes with the territory.  While it would be perfect to have a guild raid with no deaths, if we are looking for specific valuable drops or quest components, the &quot;risk&quot; involved is character death.  That's the way of the game.  It's how &quot;Risk vs. Reward&quot; is balanced.<br>
