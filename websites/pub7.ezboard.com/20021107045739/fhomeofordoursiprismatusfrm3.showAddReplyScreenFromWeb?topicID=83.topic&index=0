(longish, but hang in there...)</span><hr size=1> Ok... I'm back from Florida!  It was a great time, Mark and I enjoyed ourselves and our time together IMMENSELY.  So much so that now he's asking me to give up a majority of my time on EQ.<br>
<br>
Allow me to explain in a nutshell:  Mark and I had a real dreamy vacation and we both came away from it with a renewed sense of love and companionship for each other.  We REALLY enjoyed spending time with each other.  <br>
So now the vacation is over and it's back to the old grindstone and Mark does not want go back to the way it was before we went on vacation.  He wants to continue the closeness we felt while we were on vacation.  To do this he wants me to stop playing EQ on weekends, inculding Friday.  The problem is that I had Friday nights as my commited EQ game night.  I liked Friday nights because I could play late without the fear of having to get up early for work the next day.<br>
<br>
He put it into a &quot;I should be more important than your game&quot; kinda situation.  He doesn't want me to quit, he just wants me to stop playing on the one night of the week that I look forward to, to &quot;get away&quot;.  He feels I should want to &quot;get away&quot; with him.  I just want a break from reaility but he doesn't seem to understand that.  He's taking it personally and I've tried very HARD to make him understand that I'm NOT choosing the game over him... But it certainly seems that way to him.  And that's because I would still be able to play Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, and Thrus nights.  But its not the same... putting in piece-meal time like that (3 hours here, 4 hours there) really doesn't add up or get you anywere in this game.  And that's not to say that I'd get to play every one of those weekday nights, there are nights where I have Summer Session classes, other obligations to family and friends, maybe Mark may want to watch a new DVD with me or maybe I'll just be too tired from a day of work to play EQ.  SO we're looking at one or two weeknights a week I'll be playing total.<br>
<br>
What am I paying my $13.00 bucks for?<br>
<br>
What exactly is my problem?  I guess I just feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  I honestly did/do enjoy our closeness.  I want to make him happy but I need to make me happy too.  I want both him and my gaming (in the capacity and times that I want them) but he makes me feel guilty that I want as much time to play EQ that I do.<br>
<br>
Is there a solution I'm not thinking of?  Is playing only two week-nights a week not so bad?  <br>
<br>
Am I doing myself a dis-service cutting down my EQ time when I really don't want to?  Am I a bad person for wanting to spend time on EQ when my husbear only wants to spend time with me?<br>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> It's a balancing act like so many other things - you just need to find your spot. From my perspective, &gt;&gt;any&lt;&lt; time you spend with us in Norrath is grand, even if it's &quot;only&quot; a couple hours a week. Whether or not that's worth the $13/mo is really your call. <br>
<br>
I wax and wane with my time online, both on Lanys and Stormhammer, so I'm nowhere near the 8hrs/night crowd (and I'm not so sure we have any of those anyway.) <br>
<br>
So... being with your man IRL has got to be a priority, just remember that your Ordo chums will be pleased as punch for you to be happy in Norrath or that weird (otherworldly?) place called Massachusetts. And certainly being happy with your huzbear is all that much better. We'll still be there when you want to get away, or just have some fun barshin' stuff. We have many member who are only on every now and again, and they are just as much part of the Ordo Family as the power levellers... <br>
<br>
So take whatever time you need to adjust your life and play schedules, and be sure we'll keep the ovens and forges hot, and the mobs poppin' in SK or Oasis or LOIO or wherever... <br>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> Wow, Eric, I hear your pain.  It sounds like you're in a place where you have two things in your life that you value.   And they're both asking you to choose (yes, EverQuest is a jealous bitch that demands much of us, her lovers).  <br>
<br>
It's difficult to get non players to understand the appeal of EverQuest.  I have a coworker that insists she's doing me a favor by making me work late.  <br>
<br>
Folks say "It's just a game".  I've always hated this.  It's not.  It's not Pac Man or Might & Magic (gawd, one time my sister demanded that I pause EQ in the middle of a raid so I could talk to her, "Um, hon, the 2000 other players would get seriously pissed if I did that.").  If you find yourself on Norrath unguilded, maybe it's easy to walk away.  But once you've joined a guild you've joined a Community.  If you stay with/in that community, it's because it usually adds some value to your experience.  And that value, despite it's "digital" aspect, can be a valid priority for you.  As much as a weekly golf habit or bridge with the ladies.  <br>
<br>
That said, would you risk your relationship over golf or bridge?  Would your partner?  These, of course, aren't easy answers.  I've seen people stop playing because a lover got too upset (I know one couple that is now playing DAoC together).  I've seen spouses sucked in to EverQuest because of the same issues.  I've also heard from people that, while leaving EQ behind them was painful, they've come to not miss it.  <br>
<br>
I know I haven't been helpful, giving advice and such.  I really can't give you any advice here.  I don't know you or your partner well enough to make assumptions about your value systems. All I can do is highlight some perspectives from a fellow EverCrack Addict.  If you feel the need to rail at somebody while you're suffering through this conflict, my e-mail's RawBear@twors.net, my AIM handle is RawBearNY and you can always /tell me in game.  I can listen.  Can't really give advice, but can listen. :) <p>Ray,<BR>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> Hey Eric,<br>
    First off, Glad you are back. You were missed!<br>
<br>
Now on to the meat of the matter. Most of you know my partner attempts playing EQ himself. I am one of those 4-5 hours a night players. One of the biggest reasons I can play that much is beacuse Mike does understand how important the game is to me. I make sure and make time for him. We've got several things planned for my upcoming time off, but a lot of it will be EQ as well. The big key yo all of this is Respect. Just as you respect Mark and give in to his wanting this or that, he should respect you enough to allow you to play EQ. Two nights a week? If that's what you two work out it's between you two. I know when Mike and I got into all this I pretty much set the rules that I would be playing hard core on weekends. I also know that I can set the rules with Mike a little easier than you can with Mark, but it's still about respect. If you collected stamps and dedicated so many hours a week to stamp collecting, would he have a problem with it? I know a lot of partners have issues with EQ because it's &quot;Just a silly video game&quot;. That only tells me they have no idea what EQ is. Maybe trying to show that part to Mark might help. Once Mike got the idea that when I log into EQ it's like hanging out with my buddies he got a lot easier about it. It wasn't so much that I was playing the game all the time, it was more spending time with my circle of friends, and the only way to do so is in Norrath. <br>
I hope I don't get too personal or step on any toes with this next few, but you put up with a lot from Mark. I don't see you being ungrateful or dissing him in anyway by asking that you be allowed to powerplay one night a week. If he wants Friday to be &quot;Couple's night&quot;, then have Saturday as a play day. Or sunday. It's give and take, and maybe you should ask him to give a little. I know my partner is more understanding than most, but I'm not exagerating to say that I wouldn't even be in a relationship that didn't allow me to do the things that I enjoy. A relationship is two individuals coming together on common ground, not one inviting the otehr to live the way they insist. As an Idividual, my partner has to understand that I play video games a lot. I also smoke, smoke pot, and like porn. All of those things have to be understood and dealt with. It's part of who I am. Yes, work on things with Mark, but to thine own self be true. Just tell him how important it is to you, not only on a game level, but on a socail level as well. I can only hope he'll understand and be a little more felxable than he has been. =)<br>
<br>
Good luck little cub. Not an easy one to be in.<br>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> Well, I've made up my mind.  The long and short of it is that The few times I've played EQ since I've come back from vacation, It's been kinda dull.  I think I've plateaued insomuchas my ability to play the game to and enjoyable extent.  I don't think that giving up Friday nights EQ life is such a sacrifice considering how much I gain on the other end in real life.<br>
<br>
So, bottom line is that I wont be on EQ Friday nights anymore.  I will be on weeknights when I can fit it in.  <br>
<br>
I suppose I should probably take my name off the ballot for Guild Officer tho, considering my time online is going to be diminished somewhat.<br>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> on playing: as I said, you need to find your balance. Playing only now and again is no different than many others in the guild, so you shouldn't feel non-Ordo in the least. I will say that it will be harder to find Ordos to group with if we don't know when that'll be, so if you can, post ahead when/if you'll be on at a certain time and I promise I'll do my best to group with ya with any alts I can. I suspect others will do the same - so check the roster!<br>
<br>
on Officering: again, your choice. Although it is true that having officers who play a lot is better than having those who don't, I think you need to make that decision (being in the running) on your own, and just be up front about your play schedule (which you have) and then let the membership decide if that's ok or not. Ultimately, we need to have mature and level-headed officers to help new players and resolve guildish questions. If you can read/post to the officer forum enough (can you?) then it seems to me that you can fulfill that part of the job pretty easily whatever your play schedule.<br>

(longish, but hang in there..</span><hr size=1> EQ is called Evercrack for a reason.  It sucks you in, steals the life from you and makes you its bitch.<br>
<br>
While I've enjoyed the 3 years I've played, if I could go back now and not play, I probably would.  Why you ask, the biggest reason is the wedge it put between me and my ex.  He couldn't understand why I would rather sit in front of a computer on a gorgeous sunny day then go out and do something with him.  I think the last straw for him was when I woke up early on a saturday morning (like 7am, logged on and didn't log off until 4 am sunday night/mondy morning).<br>
<br>
After that, we started drifting farther and farther apart as he stopped asking me to do things.  I was so involved in the game that I didn't even realize that.  <br>
<br>
People will probably disagree with me on this, but as I've come to realize, alot of people use EQ as an escape from their lives.  Instead of dealing with the problems they have, they pour themselves into a fantasy based reality so they can hide away from the RL.  Once you have done that, its very hard to go back.  Plus, I've noticed that if you ever do fix what might be wrong in RL, the draw to log on EQ suddenly dimishes as you realize that you have other things.<br>
<br>
I've made the decision myself to completely quit.  No more going back for me as I will probably delete my characters and tear up the CD's.  Once that is done, I will never go back and I'll probably be the better for it.<br>

Instead of dealing with the problems they have, they pour themselves into a fantasy based reality so they can hide away from the RL.</I><br>
<br>
You’re right, a lot of people do use this as an escape. I know I did. /shrug<br>
When it was time to return to RL, I went back to RL. If anything, I enjoy the game more now, since it’s not <I>survival</I> anymore... it’s a game, a pasttime...<br>
<br>
Addictive games attract addictive people and in turn encourage addictive behavior. I have a hard time believing that anyone can get “sucked in” and have their lives turned upside-down by EQ. The problem was extant, then magnified when the escape of EQ presented itself. People with addictive personalities have trouble escaping EQ’s grasp, sometimes “quitting” four, five, or six times and still never completely letting go. They need the fiction that they are important, needed, and/or special. But really, if you tell random_joe_02 walking by that you play a 60 monk with an epic and full NtoV armor, does anyone care?<br>
<br>
It’s a game. It’s a game with a strong community feel to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>I've made the decision myself to completely quit. No more going back for me as I will probably delete my characters and tear up the CD's. Once that is done, I will never go back and I'll probably be the better for it.</I><br>
<br>
If that is your decision, then I’m sure we’ll all wish you well. Your community and your friends will miss you.<br>

<br>
I probably sound too harsh, but I've seen what EQ has done to people and its really amazing a &quot;game&quot; can have so much hold onto your life.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way.  The vast majority of people that are in Ordo are so called casual gamers.   Playing 2-3 hours a night while doing some exping, some trade skills, talking with friends really isn't that big of a deal.  Compared to the people that log on right after work, play til they go to bed at 3 am, get up, work, etc.  Friday night is log on, play til late, saturday log on all day, sunday same thing.<br>
<br>
To them, the game has become their life.  <br>
<br>
I see nothign wrong with playing EQ as long as you don't get sucked in too far.  I know, I've been there, done that many times and keep getting sucked back in.  For me the only way to break it is to delete.  I've tried cancelling, but that didn't work.<br>
