Why Clan Spiritslammer isn't Uber!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I've seen some posts from people putting Clan Spiritslammer in the same Uber neighborhood as the Watchers, SR and LOH.<br>
<br>
Well just to throw a dose of reality on all of you, here is a list why Clan Spiritslammer is NOT uber (all true).<br>
<br>
1) Planning a Severilous raid 9/10s of the guild had to ask what zone he was in.<br>
<br>
2) Getting a group of 6 together for Disco in Sebelis. Upon arrival, 4 of the 6 forgot their Seb keys at the bank. One of them forgot to camp his Seb key altogether.<br>
<br>
3) At a Vox raid, our cleric had to heal his party from the pit while fending off bears and spiders.<br>
<br>
4) One of our warriors asked and got irate at a shaman's pet when the pet wouldn't answer a request for a port.<br>
<br>
5) A group of us asked a Necro's pet once for a corpse summons.<br>
<br>
6) We constantly make the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it with 1 group, how hard can it be?!&quot;<br>
<br>
7) One of druids has fallen into the same pit trap in Howling Stones 9 times.<br>
<br>
One of our warriors, after receiving a 10 minute lecture about being careful of where you walk in Sol A, promptly took a nose dive into the lava 30 seconds after zoning.<br>
<br>
9) The same warrior then proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.<br>
<br>
10) We always forget we need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.<br>
<br>
11) The guides and GMs of Brell know all our names by heart because we manage to find every single terminal bug in any zone.<br>
<br>
12) Our justification for doing Chardok zone when we were all in our late 40s was &quot;Well we can always just zone out&quot;.<br>
<br>
13) Same for Sebelis.<br>
<br>
14) Same for Howling Stones.<br>
<br>
15) One of our druids was so worried about forgetting his Howling Stones key, he accidently destroyed.<br>
<br>
16) We've sold an SMR, a Dragoon Dirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar Cloak, a Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye Bag (full at the time too) to various merchants all around Norrath.<br>
<br>
17) Our druids (all of them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for EJ?&quot;.<br>
<br>
1 In Sky we killed eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to discover that there was no one for corpse summoning and revives left.<br>
<br>
19) Our paladin (cough) looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.<br>
<br>
20) No single person in our guild quite knows the entire family tree... even after reading it.<br>
<br>
21) We can do Fear in less then 3 hours, but can't get to any place in Velious in under 5.<br>
<br>
22) To this day, when someone says &quot;Can we pull something?&quot; 3 people head out in different directions to pull.<br>
<br>
23) Camping the AC in south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage (there were 5 of us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).<br>
<br>
24) When a particular druid of ours attempts to port us, it is truly a mystery if we will actually port somewhere, port to the desired location, or watch the druid gate there while we go no where.<br>
<br>
25) While trying to port to Gfay once, we ported to Hate.<br>
<br>
26) Most people power level their alts and lower level guildmembers by helping to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We just train ours and go conveniently link dead.<br>
<br>
27) We once petitioned that the Noble Dojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem Staff. We later found out that Thorondar gave the Noble Dojorn the staff so it would have a worse damage/delay.<br>
<br>
2 We constantly sell extra loot and then try to buy it back when we realize that we actually needed that item.<br>
<br>
29) We can kill Trakanon, however most of our members have died to green cons while trying to cross most of the zones in Kunark and Velious.<br>
<br>
30) One of the criteria for membership is &quot;What's the largest train you have ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at something /shrug. (P.S. - Conanb still owns this record /rude).<br>
<br>
31) One of our warriors was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.<br>
<br>
32) One of our paladins (sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a purposeful attack).<br>
<br>
33) One of our druids tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.<br>
<br>
34) One of our druids has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times MORE then any other person.... ever.<br>
<br>
35) One of our warriors and one of our mages were lost in Lake Rathe for over 2 hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming around the zone.<br>
<br>
36) Our 60th level shaman still can't find his way through everfrost to find Halas.<br>
<br>
37) A raid newbie once asked me &quot;What's a death touch&quot; to which Cazic Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.<br>
<br>
3 One of our paladins (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the fight.....forgetting to loot his corpse.<br>
<br>
39) One of our paladins (like we have more then 1) once got rezzed and proceeded to continue to pull Fear.... naked.<br>
<br>
40) All of our clerics and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of our melee do.<br>
<br>
41) Cartumandua continually takes most of our phat lewt and just oggles it an hour out of every day.<br>
<br>
42) One of our clerics continually complains about the crappy BP he has (he has a Trak BP).<br>
<br>
43) We have one high level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he says it's for his back).<br>
<br>
44) Our bard seems to go LD only when playing his levitate or EB song.<br>
<br>
45) Our other enchanter goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said in guild/group/say/ooc/shout.<br>
<br>
46) Ruut (our troll SK) joined the guild because he heard we got phat lewt alot and thought we were all pretty skinny compared to him.<br>
<br>
47) None of us day to day can decide what the hell faction we want in Velious, so we usually wind up at Karnors.<br>
<br>
4 One a few occasions we've told a guildmate we're camping the Hand (in Karnors) and they proceeded to go to Lguk.<br>
<br>
49) One of our Necros paid 2K for a purchaseable spell.<br>
<br>
50) One of our Necros spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable spell.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; PASTE INFO ENDED THERE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
