<br>
I want to post this now so we can start planning I know Ugod may be planning to make a presence I would like to assist if at all possible Please add any ne warning signs to this tread.  This information comes to use from '1st of light' guild and their excelent work.  My guess is halloween like Kith last year.  Look for more information here www.1fol.cjb.net<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings everyone. I have spent the past few weeks or so looking into some rather strange happenings in the game that seem to hint there will be another war in game. War? No not a player run war. How many people ever heard of what was called &quot;Bloody Kithicor&quot;? It was the GM run event of 1999 that ended with the plane of hate opening. The core of the battle involved Lanys, Innoruuks daughter...pitched against Firiona Vie and the result of that battle was a fabric torn in reality that left open the plane of hate for adventurers from Norrath. <br>
<br>
Now as of late I have been following things that have been happening. Lately the appearance of a mysterious bard who keeps contacting me named Melondar and &quot;forsoothes&quot; of a great war to come that is to pinnacle Bloody Kithicor and end in the plane of decay opening, the thesis...the attempt to summon Bertoxuulous into Norrath by the Bloodsabres.<br>
<br>
Now I know alot about this storyline as I had the luck and pleasure to become directly involved in it. I ended up being commanded by word of Mithaniel Marr to raise an army to defend high keep...so that being the case...I ended up learning every detail of the war. I know things most don't and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if I knew things no one else knew on any server...I know some very obscure facts...but I also know that from my role as leader of the defense forces of high keep when Lanys attacked and we met her forces in Kithicor. What strikes me the most odd is thie Melondar seems to know these same facts...and FYI...Druzzil Ro started as a split server...the war never happened on Druzzil Ro...but it did happen on Solusek Ro and Fennin Ro of which Druzzil Ro was made initially for.<br>
<br>
<br>
The facts that lead up to the belief there will be war, in order (all of which HAVE occured and BEEN occuring in game):<br>
<br>
1. Lets start with Bloody Kithicor. I was commanded to defend high keep. In doing so I set up sentries in varying locations throughout Norrath. So I knew everything that happened as it evolved. Nurgles Stones (see everquest.com), an ogre flees high keep heading from Neriak taking precious ore stones delievered to him by way of Tyrana Sil.<br>
<br>
2. Sightings of Lanys throughout Nektulous forest, the daughter of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
3. Sightings of Firiona Vie, daughter of Tunare and King Thex.<br>
<br>
4. Firiona Vie and delegates from Kaladim and Felwithe come to High Pass to meet and discuss the stolen stones and the rumors of war pouring out from Neriak. Lord Tephys pledges the aid of the Koa'dal and Firiona Vie along with the dwarves of Kaladim. Firiona Vie was raised at birth to battle Lanys by Lord Tephys.<br>
<br>
5. I become commanded to defend high keep by Mithaniel Marr as a result of a dark elf betraying the council of the gods and ascending as Innoruuks avatar of hate. He proclaims my end and swears norrath will be bathed in blood. I ride out and sit and wait the next week to a week and a half out and send out sentries through Norrath to keep watch.<br>
<br>
6. King Thex appears to the masses in Felwithe and addresses Firiona Vie in response to the war. Mayong Mistmoore sends fiends to attack both Kelethin and Felwithe. Sentries alert me and heroes are dispatched swiftly to repel the assault.<br>
<br>
7. repeated forboding appearances by the Avatar of Hate.<br>
<br>
8. Diplomats from Felwithe arrive, Carson McCabe the leader of High Keep requests a caravan guard sent to freeport to protect the dignitaries on their journey. I send scouts to Nektulous forest and a full compliment of guards are sent to Freeport. Dark elves attack the caravan but are stopped in their tracks.<br>
<br>
9. The day before the war. Scouts report the dark elven army assembles for battle in the Nektulous Forest. Scouts I sent report General Laarthtik, the Avatar of Hate, Lanys T'Vyll, Donk Crushbone the son of Emporer Crush and an unknown Troll from Grobb also known to be present. The Avatar of Hate and General kill any spies and scouts found on site and all those that appear at the Wizard pyramid. <br>
<br>
10. The battle that becomes etched in history as Bloody Kithicor. My spies see the armies riding in Nektulous Forest moving for the east commons. I deploy all assembled fighting units to the commonlands. War breaks out. Faydwere remains silent all the while. The core of the battle takes place in Kithicor woods. My unit held the gates of high keep and kept the generals from advancing into the karana plains. Another group of heroes was sent into rivervale to stop the dark elven armies as they entered rivervale and a wholesale slaughter commenced against the halflings. <br>
<br>
The armies pushed past rivervale into the Misty Thicket. It was obvious their intent was to circle through runnyeye and into the east karanas. They were pushed back from Misty Thicket, back into Rivervale and finally back out into the kithicor wood.<br>
<br>
My group summoned reinforcements to keep the gates of high pass secure as we began our fight against various generals in the pass and succeeded in keeping the gates of high pass secure. The remaining feir dal forces engaged the bridge that lead to north karana to secure it. <br>
<br>
In Kithicor wood, General Laarthtik opens a gateway into Innoruuks realm tearing a hole into the fabric of reality that unleashes not only a permanent rift between Norrath and the plane of hate...but the touch of Innoruuk himself which manifests itself ever eve when the sun sets upon the woods. Firiona Vie slays Lanys T'Vyll. General Laarthtik and Lord Tephys both fall in battle. Neither Donk Crushbone or the unknown Troll are seen in battle, whereabouts unknown. A herald of Marr bestows a blade from on high to wield into battle as reward for valoros service rendered and the 1st Fist of Light is born having won its first victory in the name of all that is good. The Avatar of Hate, vanishes into the unknown never to be heard from again.<br>
<br>
11. Lanys is returned from the grave with the help of an unknown necromancer. she is placed into the body of a fallen Teir Dal that is not her own.<br>
<br>
12. Sometime later Firiona Vie is kidnapped by the Iksar in response to the elves &quot;meddling&quot; into the affairs of the Iksar people. Ring of Scale &quot;relieves&quot; the Iksar people of the elven princess. All goes silent.<br>
<br>
13. &quot;Rude Individuals&quot; appear outside the gates of qeynos. These individulas multiply and begin to set up camp outside of the city limits in the hills, and are now termed &quot;Loathsome Individuals&quot;. It is believed they are members of some cult as strange weapons are found in their posession seemingly bearing signifigance of rank. Initiates Longsword, Adepts Longsword, Befouled Longsword.<br>
<br>
14. A &quot;Loathsome Messenger&quot; is seen dissappearing into the aqaducts which lead into the catacombs. He is intercepted and in his possession is a letter to the Bloodsabres informing them of their arrival to the temple. It is believed they are the soon to be &quot;troops&quot; of the Bloodsabres, in service to Bertoxuulous. In the letter one Mordavin Telase is implicated as the High Priest of Decay.<br>
<br>
15. Following day all the Loathsome Individual camps are &quot;empty&quot; and not a soul is found within. Strange mermers are now heard within the sewers as the &quot;Loathsome Individuals&quot; now have resurfaced as the guardians to the Bloodsabres Citidel within the Qeynos Catacombs. Also seen within the sewers are &quot;the necro lord&quot; and &quot;Mordavin Telase&quot;. The necro lord vanishes and is never seen again; presumed a lich who is lain to rest by adventurers.<br>
<br>
16. The capture of Mordavin Telase. Antonius Bayle summons the local magistrate and demands the capture of Mordavin Telase. He is seen fleeing into the west karanas, believed to be heading for a camp of strange bandits who have been noted to been taking up camp within the mountains. Mordavin Telase is captured and brought in. His last words are, &quot;my capture will not stop the coming of Bertoxuulous&quot;. That camp of bandits by the way still stands. They are comprise a necromancer and a shadow knight, all believed to be Bloodsabres.<br>
<br>
16. Firiona Vie is &quot;freed&quot; from Veeshans Peak. <br>
<br>
17. Lanys begins to appear in Nektulous Forest again, as she did before Bloody Kithicor...she slays all who are not of &quot;dark blood&quot; as she had in her initial appearances when she first revealed herself. It is said some Teir Dal do not believe she is the true Lanys do to her &quot;ressurection&quot; in a newer form.<br>
<br>
18. Lanys proclaims there will be war. When I attempted to confront her in the Nektulous Forest she told the others (having never seen me and note I always use the /roleplay tag), &quot;he is only a paladin.&quot; She then vanished before I could reach her.<br>
<br>
All of the aforementioned are all actual GM/Verant events that occured in game. Note, this ALL HAPPENED and there is MORE...Keep reading.<br>
<br>
So the 1FOL gets curious, it being an RP guild. We start investigating one evening, &quot;wondering&quot; about what &quot;adventures&quot; we could possibly have. We decide to start looking around. The facts as we discovered them in order of appearance. Note some of this all appeared BEFORE Bloody Kithicor and some of this is all VERY recent, new.<br>
<br>
1. We notice first one of the faction hits against the undead that now guard the bloodsabres citadel is Opal Darkbriar. Who is Opal Darkbriar? She is two people or one operating in disguise. She appears within the casters guild in freeport as a high elf, and a dark elven priestess within the Church of the Dismal Rage (mostly human followers of Innoruuk) under Freeport as a Liason from the Church of the Firstborn (followers of Innoruuk from Neriak).<br>
<br>
2. Later there is rumor about Drosco, supposedly turning in his note and the amulet of thunder begins a long quest for a warhammer known only as &quot;thunder&quot;. Thunder when recieved is &quot;not&quot; complete in its workmanship of material or arcane/holyness. I've spent about a week now and cannot get Drosco to drop an Amulet of Thunder, only his letter.<br>
<br>
Drosco for those that do not know is a spy sent from the Temple of Thunder to spy upon the Bloodsabres. Sir Wolten gives a quest to find him near the temple. The note you are to give Drosco says only &quot;The Storm is Near&quot;. When you turn in the letter from Drosco you are given a note to take to the knights of truth in freeport. If you read the note for the knights of truth it mentiones that their spy may be endangered. Who is their spy? Now it is known the knights of truth do have a spyt amidst the Freeport Militia, but is it him or a spy within the Church of the Dismal Rage?<br>
<br>
3. Also note the following. Lieutenant Arathur is from Freeport and a member of the Qeynos guard and worships Mithaniel Marr. The guard of Qeynos seems split between followers of Rodcet Nife and you guessed it, Bertoxuulous.<br>
<br>
4. Kane Bayle is the brother and blood heir to Antonius Bayle. If Antonius is ever killed then Kane Bayle takes the throne and becomes ruler of the Kingdom of Qeynos. He would not only rule the city but also the plains as well. On a side note for those that do not know, Antonica was named after Antonius Bayle. The one on the throne now is the 3rd, so presumably the 1st was the namesake. Kane Bayle is also captain of the guard. There are rumors in abundance about Kane Bayle supposedly consorting with &quot;strange things&quot; in the night. He is the ward of Nerissa Clothspinner who &quot;fears&quot; him. She also states her fear in Qeynos's safety. Kane sent the core of its defenses out into the plains leaving Qeynos vulnerable to an attack.<br>
<br>
5. Captain Rohand of the mermaids lure speaks of Mayong Mistmoore. Mayong Mistmoore is a fallen high elf that was touched by Innoruuk and turned into his current state. Note, Mayong Mistmoore is larger then most dark elves...now you know why. When talking with Rohand...Madame Serena interviened and asked me what faith I followed. When I spoke &quot;I follow Mithaniel Marr&quot; she said for me to go into the sewers and &quot;hail Mister Bloodheart&quot;. Mister Bloodheart is none other then Sraag Bloodheart the leader of the Bloodsabres and the champion of Bertoxuulous. It is believed Mordavin Telase may have only been a stool to take the fall to grant more time for the Bloodsabres to unfold their plan of summoning Bertoxuulous.<br>
<br>
6. Ravenspirit discovers Tovax Vmar walking a path he doesn't usually walk. She kills him and retrieves a note from his body proclaiming an alliance between the Bloodsabres and the Church of the Firstborn. The note by the way is addressed to Opal Darkbriar of the Church of the Dismal Rage.<br>
<br>
7. Later its discovered Kizdean Gix carries a letter on him. This supposedly one of the items for the burning rapier quest. It is written in orc and has yet to be translated but what little we have deciphered from it, it talks about an alliance with the dark elves and the Kingdom of Crushbone, sealed with none other then Donk Crushbone. It is unknown as to wether this is referring to the day BEFORE Bloody Kithicor or is something recent or something about to happen. Note in Crushbone is &quot;Ambassador&quot; D'Vinn and The Prophet who also has a note written in orc that discusses the alliance.<br>
<br>
8. Miscellaneos lore of Qeynos that may or may not be associated. Sir Wolten (same person that asks you to find Drosco) also gives a quest to find the rat king. Supposedly the rat king has never been found on any server. In medieval times that was also slang for a king of the beggars often found lairing in either sewer ducts or dillapadated buildings. I found him in the guise of &quot;Beggar Wyllin&quot; in the sewers. He IS a Bloodsabre and had been sending his rats up to plague the city. Also note rats in medieval times were the prime carriers of diseases. When you turn in the rat kings head you are rewarded with a newbie item and take a faction hit against the bloodsabres.<br>
<br>
Missing Children. There are THREE missing children. How these all tie in together is somewhat uncertain. One of which has to do with someone from the Ironforge estates wherever that is. A daughter who is found in, NERIAK! Note the tie into Neriak? Another (a guards daughter, presumed paladin) is swollowed whole by cubert. A third is MURDERED by order of Sraag Bloodheart. All that is known is that you can hail Zamel by the bank in Qeynos to get the quest for the paladins daughter and that the child in Neriak can only be talked to once her guard is killed outside her chambers which are still a mystery. Now heres the question, are these all tied together and WHY would Sraag Bloodheart want a child slain? Where is the threat of a child or children? No one knows yet.<br>
<br>
Note the scrawlings in sewers. I believe its actually important. They mention &quot;a stupid ogre&quot;, &quot;The Iron Toe Brigade&quot; which is believed to be &quot;Trumpy, Clumpy and Dumpy&quot;. Also there is note of &quot;Aradune&quot; and warnings about the bloodsabres along with one final interesting note, &quot;Kane is one of them&quot;. Who is Dumpy and Clumpy and where are they?<br>
<br>
9. Trumpy Irontoe. Also associated with one of the individuals that Sraag orders to murder. Who is Trumpy Irontoe. Get him drunk and he starts talking. He actually is a lacky under emply of guess who? Sraag Bloodheart. He also reveals that Kane Bayle is none other then a servant/lacky/pawn to none other then Sraag Bloodheart. So if Kane ever succeeds his brother Antonius and becomes king, then the Bloodsabres hold power over the Kingdom of Qeynos. Notice, all things always seem to end at who? Sraag Bloodheart. <br>
<br>
Also note Trumpy has talked on more then one occassion and Sraag puts out a hit on Trumpy for revealing too much information. This is discovered via the Bloodforge Hammer quest.<br>
<br>
10. Smugglers Ring. Note in high pass their is a Lieutenant there that is a Bloodsabre (shadow knight SK) and the guards of both freeport and qeynos both have an unusually keen interest. Someone also pointed out that there are also dwarves in the Kaladim area associated with the ring? Possible involvement with Trumpy? Also note in qeynos the smugglers den inside the sewers. Question is this, if they are smuggling in this ring...what exactly are they smuggling and why?<br>
<br>
Thats what all the information we have discovered at this point in time. Note most of this goes all the way back to the very beginning of EQ from two years ago and is just now adding up. <br>
<br>
I keep hearing rumors about an attack against Felwithe by the Crushbone Orcs. This happens around the time Lanys proclaims war.<br>
<br>
Now lets enter Melondar. A strange bard that appeared seemingly knowing more then any I have ever met about the events that happened and Bloody Kithicor. When we first meet I ask him &quot;why me?&quot; and he says &quot;why not?&quot; and then goes on to say &quot;we have been watching a while now&quot; and I say &quot;who is we?&quot; and he goes on to note my perceptions. He never answers but rather says &quot;the gods are fickle and quick to anger&quot;. He tells me there is a portal opening into another realm of darkness and I will be paramount and ready to take my place as a legend. <br>
<br>
What strikes me the most is how he knows such obscure facts. Until very recently most people even in 1st Fist of Light did not know exactly what I knew and this bard seemed to know &quot;everything&quot; before I even spoke the words. Also note Druzzil Ro is a split server. Bloody Kithicor never happened as a &quot;GM Event&quot; here because the server wasn't made until some time AFTER the Bloody Kithicor event had already passed.<br>
<br>
He has appeared again speaking of someone from the light that is a traitor. I am not sure who this is yet. Perhaps the good Opal Darkbriar seen in the casters guild? He also keeps mentioning of a storm gathering and he too also sounded suggestive as a battle against Felwithe by Crushbone and in a message to another said the Storm gathers in the east and darkness would be falling. The east is Kunark and Faydwere, I am betting its Faydwere. Something else he said when we discussed Lanys, &quot;Lanys is only a pawn&quot;. Keep in mind the Bloodsabre/Church of the Firstborn alliance. He also said Bloody Kithicor was only a test. <br>
<br>
Mel also stated that others would be needed in the &quot;final hour&quot; meaning there was a great battle of paramount. He told me I would need many to stand my side and if we all failed that the bloodshed of many would be upon us. Also something else to chew on. &quot;Drowned Citizens&quot; are now found in the water pit in the tunnels leading to east freeport. These &quot;drowned citizens&quot; are undead and have a touch which...causes disease; imagine that. Keep in mind also in the tunnels lies the Church of the Dismal Rage.<br>
<br>
I also have this feeling that this may be a three way assault. I could be wrong but it would make sense strategicly. The elves of Kelethin and Felwithe are cut off from an attack by the Kingdom of Crushbone, which would probably bring the aid of the dwarves. High Keep will be attacked yet again by Lanys's armies. This will leave Qeynos completely cut off and with their troops in the field...ripe for an attack...by who? The bloodsabres and their new army formed by their former Loathsome Individuals which will end in an attempted summoning of Bertoxuulous/opening of the plane of decay. <br>
<br>
And no Halas won't get involved as A, they would have to go through Blackburrow and they are a group of Clansmen with no known leader to unite them. Erudin is cut off by sea which means by the time they would be able to react the damage would already be done.<br>
<br>
So there you have it. I realize this is alot...but yes...it looks like war could be happening...and a rather in depth well planned out one at that. Only time will tell what will happen. I know when things unfold with Mel they will go to the 1FOL boards located at www.1fol.cjb.net and if anyone hears or finds out anything further please contact me. <br>

--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I'm not sure on the significance of this but I thought it was worth noting:<br>
<br>
If you talk to Weligon Steelherder(Erudin Palace), you will learn that he is concerned about the plans to build a bridge linking Antonica and Odus. He wants you to eliminate the three engineers who have conceived this plan so that Odus will be safe from the influence of the other races. <br>
<br>
Weligon wants you to bring him the plans and the head of each of the three engineers and promises a nice reward. To obtain the list with the engineers names on it, go to South Qeynos and enter Hansl Bigroon's house opposite the Tax Collector's house. When Hansl leaves the house he will drop the list, which has the names of the three engineers scribed on it. You must kill each of the following npc's and collect their heads. <br>
<br>
<br>
Trantor Everhot, who wanders around North Kaladim near the mines.<br>
<br>
Joogl Doobrough, who lives near the windmills in Steamfont.<br>
<br>
Purchin Oddsbot, who can be found in West Freeport near the Academy of Arcane Science.<br>
<br>
Who is Hansl Bigroon allied with?<br>
<br>
Note: All of the above npc's are on the appropriate fraction. <br>

<br>
This war has started faster than you think. This has come up on everlore.com today!!!!<br>
<br>
Earlier this evening, the sinister Lanys T'vyl reared her head in Oasis, calling forth all supporters of the Teir'Dal to aid her once more. It seems she is interested in yet another personal quest, but slickly worded as if it was for the greater good of all Teir'Dals and their allies. Similar to her first defeat in Bloody Kithicor, Lanys is willing to throw away the lives of those loyal to her so that she may gain.<br>
<br>
A large crowd of inquisitive travelers and followers gathered closely around her, while forces of light cautiously watched from the outskirts of the group. Lanys informed everyone that she was after an item called the Eye of Judgement. It was one of three components needed to piece together the Governor of the Wicked, a staff supposedly much more powerful than the one Firiona Vie once held, Lifeguide. The Teir’Dal owned the staff for eons, but valiant Knights from the Hall of Truth obtained it, corrupted and altered its powers, broke it into 3 pieces, then dispersed it across Norrath.<br>
<br>
Lanys then said that the Eye of Judgement could be found on Nyaphet Sijer, a Sphinx located in the Rathe Mountains. She lead her group of followers on their journey towards the Rathe Mountains, while the forces of light who listened in made their own party in hopes of thwarting her plans.<br>
<br>
When both parties arrived in the Rathe Mountains, trackers found Nyaphet waiting by the beetle pillar. Originally, the Lightbearers were anticipating a battle in order to protect Nyaphet Sijer from Lanys, but he would have of that, for he was overconfident in his own strengths.<br>
<br>
After brushing off the Lightbearers, Nyaphet offered the Eye of Judgement to Lanys if she could play his game by solving a riddle. If the answer were wrong, she would pay with her life. Lanys, feigning confidence, opted to choose a champion to answer for her anyway. Many desperate volunteers begged to champion Lanys T'vyl, and she finally chose a young Ogre named Dhast. Good and evil alike doubted his wisdom and did not think he would have the capacity to solve the riddle, but they were wrong, and Dhast solved it easily. Despite the Lightbearers protests and threats to what was happening, Nyaphet regretfully honored her side of the agreement by removing her right eye out of its socket and handing it to Lanys. Some Lightbearers at this point tried attacking Nyaphet and Lanys, but found that they were unable to. Lanys awarded Dhast for his efforts by naming him Dhast the Discerning. Lanys then went off to study the Eye of Judgement some more, stating that she would be back when the time was right to pursue the second piece of the staff.&quot;<br>

<br>
Is there a war coming that involves Bertox? I believe so. The sewers under Qeynos are alive with activity and the recent plague outbreak in the Plains of Karana could only be the work or the Plaguebringer. There is a large beetle that still terrorizes the farms in the West Karanas at night (just listen for the shouts). The thing is, this is something that has been building since the opening of EQ, so I wouldn't hold my breath for a resolution soon. <br>
<br>
Does the recent appearance of Lanys have anything to do with this upcoming Bertox war? Unless there is a member of the Plaguebringers that is holding a piece of the staff, I don't believe the two events are related. The Teir'Dal have never shown an interest in anything west of High Hold. They have plenty of mundane humans to toy with in Freeport and their interests in humilation have almost always been aimed at Faydwer (high elves in particular).<br>
<br>
Also of particular note is the Verant decision to avoid events the size of Bloody Kithicor and go with smaller scale events. Large wars are fun, but bringing server hardware and a net connection to its knees is not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However, that won't keep this ranger from going and investigating the Qeynos/Karana area again for anything new.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info, Rochambeaux. <p><TABLE>

If any wish to know what happened in the forever damned woods of the Kithicor Forrest, just ask me. For that Halloween night in 1999 I was not yet known as Kronenburg of the Aegis Wolves, I would not join your ranks until the following Spring.<br>
<br>
I was then known as Wylan Sylvermoon, Wood Elf Druid of Mother Tunare and Senior Assistant Guide of Tribunal server. I was there that night when Innoruuk's spawn laid seige on the fortress of Highkeep. I was there as Carson McCabe, and organized the Highkeep militia in a defensive effort against the countless hellspawn that assulted the pass while Firiona Vie herself lead the offensive charge into the Kithicor wood, where many of her bravest troops would never return...<br>
<br>
...but that is a story for another time. Wylan Sylvermoon has departed this realm. I now face the arising danger not as an immortal Guide, but as one of Lord Brell's chosen Knights. I shall stand with my brother and sister Wolf, and together we will drive the hellspawn of Bertoxxulous back to the plague infested wastelands from whence they came!<br>
<br>
Whatever happens...know that I, Kronenburg, will always be at your side, defending you to the death.<br>

<br>
I just got a copy of the Erudin newspaper.  It relates that the priests of the Temple of Life in Qeynos have developed a magical method to expunge the plague from an object or localized area.  Accordingly, they have begun preparations for a massive magical effort to be undertaken over all of the Karanas.  They are going to distribute braziers which are capable of cleansing a localized area, then light them all simultaneously to completely rid the plains of the pestulence.  This will result in the massive release of magical energy.  The mystics in Erudin have raised concerns over this, but the Temple of Life claims that they have it all under control..... <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Forin Ironshield</B><BR>
