I did in no way mean to upset you the way I did. I was just trying to have alittle fun and be myself, If I had known it would have upset you the way it did I would have never done it.<br>
<br>
Your comments after the fact did strike a bone and I had a talk with Leetah about it. So.....Let's ALL be adults about this. It happend and I'm sorry you took it so serious, I will no longer act in this manner (Picking, playing, or joking) toward you or your characters.<br>

Yes, I was watching over the procedings as Draeg was talking and sentenced.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what others think I do not *Clean Up* after Shawn. I know that I have the advantage of knowiung Shawn in RL as he is my husband.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that to you if Shawn expressing the hurt that he also felt in the situations that have come to this were offensive to you I would have thought that you would have talked to him about it. That did not happen I have seen and heard of lot of negative things in the last few weeks when I was able to be on that are very hurtful to both Me and My family. I have been judgeded based on everyone's feelings towards Shawns actions. <br>
<br>
When I just reread that Apology to Kas what I saw was a very hurt person TRYING to reach out and make amends. It may not have been the most sugary sweet apology out there but he did try. Please do not condemn him for having a hard time wording things.<br>
<br>
I am able to see the meaning behind alot of the things that he has said and done that may have been misinterpreted ( not everything he has done has been 100% wolf like) the platform that we have for communicating has many flaws as there are no tones of voice or body langue to clue us in on the actual intent of what we are trying to get across. It is very easy to be harsh and inappropriate at times as there is not another person sitting there wihth you to let you know that you might need to take a break before going on. Alot of things are different when you feel that you are backed into a corner and at the mercy of what others think about you. some people come out of a situation like that Blasting aways while others take a step back. I urge you to take a step back now that all is said and done and consider Shawn's feelings towards this Guild and what it means (meant) to him as to why he would react the way he did in certain situation. Cast your final judgement on him once you truly know how he feels and Why does he react the way he does. I would expect this of anyone faced in a similar situation.<br>
<br>
I myself have been in a nasty situation due to an oppposition that I once had with the Guild After a good while I and the person involved came to a conclusion that we were both wrong in some way and have come to terms with one another and have been working on a friendship that was once very close. The level of closeness that we once had will be gone forever but at least we can still remain friends and help each other out when or if ever needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long post but it was something that I felt I needed to. <br>

I do not know about all of the things surrounding you and your relationship with the Wolves, so I can only speak from my experience with you.  I enjoyed myself each and every time I was in your vicinity and found your comments to be meant as nothing but humor.  I agree with Nadianye that it is easy for things to be misunderstood in a text-only communication forum.  For what its worth, you are still A-OK in my book.<br>
