Neo sat at his computer, sprawled out over his<br>
keyboard in a death like sleep. It had been two weeks since he had left this<br>
spot. The chair reeked of his own filth, and the floor around him was<br>
littered with pizza delivery boxes. The joys of EverCamp.<br>
Suddenly his screen went black. Instantly he awoke, hands already on the<br>
macro's, auto attack on. &quot;Had I been blinded?&quot; he asked. He had heard no<br>
spells being cast. After a moment of silence, he checked to see if his<br>
monitor was on. It was...and then horror struck Neo. &quot;Not my Voodoo card!!<br>
NOOOOO!!!&quot; But his fears were quickly washed away when suddenly DOS text<br>
appeared on his screen.<br>
Wake up Neo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The Vision(TM) has you.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Neo asked. He hit the esc key.<br>
<br>
Knock Knock.<br>
<br>
Suddenly their came a knocking sound on the door. After a moment Neo got up<br>
and opened the door. A middle aged man was there, look about anxiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your late,&quot; Neo said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah, sorry.&quot; The man said. &quot;I got the cash, you got it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah...hang on.&quot; Neo said and went back into his room. Going to a bookshelf<br>
he pulled off the EQ manual and took out a scrap piece of paper.<br>
<br>
51st DE Necro<br>
Name: Darkdeath<br>
Pass: phatlewt<br>
<br>
Neo returned to the man at the door, and traded the paper for a wad of cash.<br>
He put the 2 grand in the EQ manual and closed the book.<br>
<br>
&quot;Man, your my savior, my own personal Jesus Christ.&quot; The man said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah well..if your caught using that...&quot; Neo began.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know I know...I got him off of Ebay.&quot; The man looked at Neo in concern.<br>
&quot;Dude, you look a little pale. You alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Neo replied. &quot;Its just...did you ever think...do you know that<br>
place between being awake and asleep?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah...all the time....Evercamp man, best **** for that.&quot; The man said.<br>
&quot;Dude, maybe you just need to get out. Why don't you come to the cyber cafe<br>
with me. Mad EQ tournament going on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I...EQ? Oh okay&quot; Neo said.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
All the computers were in use when Neo arrived at the club, and being the<br>
antisocial person he was Neo just stood in the corner doing nothing.<br>
Suddenly a woman came up to him, the first ever that he had seen since EQ.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Neo.&quot; She said.<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; Neo asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw it floating above your head.&quot; She replied. &quot;Your in danger, Neo.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From what?&quot; Neo asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;From them,&quot; she replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is the most completly vague answer I have ever heard in my life. In no<br>
way at all am I even remotely concerned for my saftey because you have given<br>
me nothing to base my fears on.&quot; Neo said. &quot;Whats your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trinity.&quot; She replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;THE Trinity? The one on Tallon?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, thats me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jesus Christ, I thought you were a guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most guys do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trinity came up to Neo then, and began whispering in his ear. &quot;I know what<br>
it is that drives you, Neo. I know why you live alone, and why night after<br>
night you sit at your computer. Its the question that drives you, Neo.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the Vision(TM)&quot; Neo whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;The answer is looking for you Neo.&quot; She said, then with a smile turned and<br>
left.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh ****!&quot; Neo said waking up. The alarm said 9:15.<br>
<br>
After he arrived at work, his boss quickly called him into the office.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Anderson... there seems to be a problem. When there is a problem with<br>
an employee, there is a problem with the company. If you can't get over your<br>
EQ addiction and come to work on time, then don't bother coming to work at<br>
all. Understand?&quot; his boss said calmley.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sweet...I'm going home then.&quot; Neo said.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?? No no I'm saying don't come back ever!&quot; the older man said, looking<br>
angerly at Neo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright. I got a camp to break anyways, later.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Neo left the building. After he returned home he logged on to<br>
EQ. Suddenly he got a telepath!<br>
<br>
Gorden tells you, &quot;Hello, Neo.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;Gordon...&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Yes....I've been looking for you Neo. Do you want to meet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Very well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Gordon appeared in a bright flash of light, fully decked out in his<br>
Necro gear.<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Welcome Neo. It is an honor to meet you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo only stared in awe. &quot;Your actually real..&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon smiled. &quot;I bet your feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the<br>
rabbit hole, hrm?&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;Sorta.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;You have the look of a man who accepts what he see's because he's<br>
been playing EQ to long. You're delusional from lack of sleep and have lost<br>
focus on reality. You lost your wife and job to EQ, and soon your mind will<br>
be gone as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;Yeah..thats pretty much it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;I bet you have some questions for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;What is the Vision(TM)?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;The Vision(TM) is all around us. Its everything. From the Paladin's<br>
broken quests to the Necro's getting so many over powering items they don't<br>
know what to do with them. Its the 1000k fall bug, and the teleporting mobs.<br>
Its the world thats been pulled over your eyes to hide you from the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;What truth?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;That you are a slave, Neo. That your only purpose is to give Verant<br>
your money. You are in a prison, a prison for your mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a sigh, Gordon leaned back.<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Unfornantly, no one can be told what the Vision(TM) is...you have<br>
to see if for yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Gordon pulled out two pills and showed them to Neo.<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Take the blue pill, and you wake up in your chair, and think<br>
whatever you want. Take the red pill, and I show you how deep the bullsh!t<br>
goes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo began to reach for the red pill, when Gordon stopped him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember, I'm only offering the truth. And Alchemy is fixed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo, with a shrug, ate the red pill.<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two men entered the next room. It was fully decked out with the latest<br>
governement gear, including a full VR imersion chair. To this Gordon<br>
directed Neo.<br>
<br>
Neo sat down into the chair while Gordon pulled the helmet over him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Buckle your saftey belt, because Reality is going bye bye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Neo was hit with incredible lag, as the zone was loading. After<br>
about 10 minutes, he found himself in East Commons. Gordon was there as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your in MY world now. The world thats been pulled over your eyes. In<br>
reality this is what it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the beautiful graphics were replaced with a conferance table of<br>
middle aged men. A sign on the wall said Verant.<br>
<br>
ManA: &quot;Customers 12321-90322 has paid their 10 dollars.&quot;<br>
<br>
ManB: &quot;Excelent.&quot;<br>
<br>
ManC: &quot;Sir, Wizards are complaining about how bad they suck.&quot;<br>
<br>
ManB: &quot;Bah...nerf Rangers so the wizards shut up. As long as we get the<br>
cash, it dosn't matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;No...no this can't be!! YOU LIE!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;I'm sorry...this is the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;NOOOOO!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;This is the reason the GM's don't help anyone. To delay them as<br>
long as possible so that they pay more. I will be honest with you Neo. No<br>
one has ever convinced a GM to help them. But where they failed, you will<br>
succeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;What are you saying, that I can dodge spells?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gordon: &quot;No Neo....your a ranger..you couldn't dodge a dead horse. But<br>
imagine if you could.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly a GM appeared. &quot;Neo, I'm going to have to ban you. You're hacking<br>
into the system.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;What?<br>
<br>
GM: &quot;Unless you can prove otherwise...&quot;<br>
<br>
Neo: &quot;Um...GO TO HELL!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Neo let out a volley of arrows, firing off one after the other. The<br>
GM dodged quickly, and all but one missed.<br>
<br>
GM: hit by non-melee for 1 point of damage.<br>
<br>
Then the GM countered attack with a heavy melee. Luckily the ranger was a<br>
speedy and dodge like warrior, just as the Vision(TM) had declared them to<br>
be.<br>
<br>
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!<br>
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!<br>
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!<br>
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!<br>
<br>
Staggering from the blow, Neo fell to the ground. The GM stood above him,<br>
prepared to finish him off, when suddenly Gordon placed his hand on the GM.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dodge this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; the GM shouted as the 20,000 life tap spell<br>
instantly destroyed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I feel better.&quot; Gordon said.<br>
<br>
Neo blinked in amazement.<br>
