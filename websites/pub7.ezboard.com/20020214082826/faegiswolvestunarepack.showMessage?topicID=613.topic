All summoned from across the face of Norrath but the Pack master. Many talking quietly amongst themselves. wondering what could cause the pack master to summon them at such short notice. Were the Teir’dal up to something again? Had the Orcs committed some injustice that needed to be corrected?<br>
<br>
Slowly the voices died down. A wolf stood in the entryway to the guildhall. Slowly she padded in. Her step not as quick as it use to be. Her ears marked from many fights to save pack mates and to save the honor of the pack. The gray fur of her muzzle has slowly turned white over the years. You realize that she seems to walk as if burdened with a great weight. A weight almost more than she can carry.<br>
<br>
Slowly she makes her way to her furs. She turns to the pack and slowly sits down. Her gaze slowly flows across the room. And you then see it. No matter the age the fire in her eyes has not dimmed. It is there strong and burning bright. It is a fire that says she will die for any member of the pack. She will travel the hardest roads for them. It says she will do all that is needed and more. You realize that she is Mama Wolf.<br>
<br>
Slowly the wolf changes form into Leetah. She slowly gets up off her furs and looks to her gathered family.<br>
<br>
“Pack mates I have called you here today for a special reason. This is not a time of war. This is not a time of danger. It is a time of rejoicing. You see for over 2 years I have lead this family of ours. But recently I have been finding myself called by the wild. I find myself drawn more and more to the woods and the dark forests. This has put me in a position. Where I had to make a choice. A choice for me and for the pack as a whole.”<br>
<br>
“Our wild cousins deal with this very simply. When the pack leader is no longer able to do the job he is replaced by the wolf best able to do it. This new blood leads the pack and brings new life to the pack. And so shall my replacement. They will lead our family in new directions and hopefully bring new life and new ideas to it.”<br>
<br>
“Now I know many of you are worried. That Mama Wolf is leaving. Well Mama Wolf is not leaving. Mama Wolf will always be here for you. But Mama Wolf knows there comes a time for the cubs to step forward and carry on. To take the things she has taught and carry them forward.”<br>
<br>
“Now many of you are wondering who has been selected to replace me. Well the decision was not easy. There are many who would make good leaders. After much thought I came to this conclusion. The elders decide who among the wolves shall be raised to elder. This is our custom. Has been for a long time now. Since that is the case it seemed appropriate that I should decide upon the next leader from the elders.”<br>
<br>
Leetah begins to walk the circle of wolves. She stops next to Forin.<br>
<br>
“So I approached Forin, I said to him Forin I am beginning to be unable to do my job as Leader. Would you consider taking command of this guild? He said he would consider it but that he felt with his current obligations he would not be able to give it the attention it deserved. This told me that I had chosen wisely for he understood the obligations and responsibilities leader of our family requires.”<br>
<br>
Leetah continues around the room. Stopping next to Kronenburg.<br>
<br>
“Next I approached Kronenburg. I said to him I am beginning to be unable to fulfill my duties and obligations as leader of our family. Would you consider taking leadership of our family? His reply was that he would do it but only for short term. He said that he felt it would be better for a long-term leader to be selected for the pack. Again proof to me that I had chosen wisely.”<br>
<br>
“So I asked them. How do I choose one from the rest? All of them would make good leaders. They said we couldn’t tell you whom to choose. Just give you our opinions of the elders. They agreed with me all would make good leaders but I had to find the one who seemed to shine above the rest.”<br>
<br>
Leetah continues around the room. She finally stops in front of Adlehardt.<br>
<br>
“It came down to a decision between two elders. It took a lot of time to make the decision. Adlehardt I have chosen you to replace me. You shall be next leader of the Aegis Wolves here in Norrath.”<br>
<br>
“Kneel before me Adlehardt.”<br>
<br>
Slowly Leetah takes off the Wolf hide cap she has worn for so long. She places the cape on his shoulders clasping it in the front.<br>
<br>
“This is the symbol of your office. It was passed down to me from Svarinya. It represents to you the burden you now carry of the pack on your shoulders. May it keep you warm during the times you are alone with the decisions you must make. Wear it with pride.”<br>
<br>
Next Leetah takes off the golden wolf head badge from her tunic. The Ruby red gems set in the eyes sparkling hotly in the fires of the guildhall.<br>
<br>
“This is the badge of your office. You will see on the back are three names. The first is Svarinya the first leader. The second is mine. The next is yours Adlehardt. When someday you pass leadership on you shall inscribe the name of the next leader here underneath yours.”<br>
<br>
Slowly she pins the badge to Adlehardt’s Tunic. Then she places both her hands on Adlehardt’s head.<br>
<br>
“I here by charge you as Leader of the Aegis Wolves on Tunare with all duties, responsibilities, and privileges there of. Arise Pack Master Adlehardt!”<br>
<br>
Leetah Throws back her head and howls the call of the wild for the entire world to hear. Then she reverts to wolf form goes over to her furs and lies down and goes to sleep. Her paws twitch as she dreams of days when the pack ruled unrest and the hunting was good.  <p><img src="http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/personalpics/2hbpic3.jpg"><br><br>

For many moons I have hunted the evil that plagues the lands of Norrath. For much of that time, it has been at Leetah's side.  We have fought, sweat, bled, cried, and cheered together for the Pack, and she will always be a dear friend to me. I understand this decision she has made all too well. The fight is a hard one and it takes its toll on you. <br>
<br>
When Leetah approached me about the decision she was making, I was a bit shocked when she asked me, as I would assume any would be. It is a great honor to have been considered, and I thank Leetah for her faith in me. However...I too am getting old in my years. To be honest, I don't know how many fights this Dwarf has left in him. There are other things in my life that have started to keep me away from the adventuring life. Perhaps the fact that my wife, Yonder, is not there to share in those adventures with me. Perhaps it is the still I keep in my private chambers deep within North Kaladim. Whatever the reasons, my Ale or my bride, the flame of youth is waning from this Paladin's eye...and I count the days until I meet Lord Brell in the halls of Underfoot. <br>
<br>
The rank of Packmaster is not for one such as me...one that is worn from years of battle. I would follow a Wolf to the ends of the Earth, and sacrifice my life to save their own. I am and always will be the protector of every Wolf that runs with the Pack and the champion of every cause, but Packmaster? No. With respect, I must decline.<br>
<br>
The rank of Packmaster calls for one who still feels the flames of youth blaze in their soul. Who is not afraid to lead, to accept responsibility, to listen to suggestion, and heed the advise of their Elders. As for Adlehardt, I have watched him for a long time. I have known him since he was a pup and helped raise him in the ways of the Aegis Wolf. He has come a long way since those days on the hills overlooking the Lake of Ill Omen. It was there that he found a chunk of dirt and called it &quot;Adle's Rock&quot;. But that rock is so much more than just a stone. It is a symbol of his determination, and his loyalty. He is always ready to come to the aid of any in need, and help those who are less fortunate. He has come a long way indeed...he has come of age, he has become a leader amongst the Wolves. For this old Dwarf, it was a hard decision. But I feel Adlehardt is up to the challenge, and will do all that he has to for the glory of the Pack.<br>
<br>
&lt;Kronenburg unsheathes Ghoulbane, and places it at Adlehardt's feet&gt;<br>
<br>
Lord Adlehardt, accept this as my approval of your succession. I have been and always will be your friend, and I will always help support and guide you in this new dawn for the Aegis Wolves of Tunare.<br>
<br>
I salute you, Packmaster Adlehardt.<br>

       Mandilloran howls at the MOON on a deserted hill top far from the fire of the Guild hall,he has run for many , many miles trying to push his thoughts away but they keep coming back<br>
to him...... Leetah not pack Mother , his feelings churn inside  his Fur covered chest like a summer storm as he comes to grips with this change in the Pack.Is it pain he feels or is it just the shock to new change , he is not sure.Slowly the pain in his chest fades and he feels a fire inside growing,change makes one feel alive.It is the soul blood of life and Mandilloran is not one to fear change.If Mother has picked my Brother to replace her and become Father then so be it..... Adlehardt now Pack Father......  says Mandilloran to himself listening to it inside his head , it sounds right somehow ,as if the forest were listening to his thoughts,the wind picks up in a gust which ruffles his white fur and brings the sound of a Pack of wolves on the hunt in the distance.hehehe His pack with a new wolf leading in the front... Mandilloran runs quickly to catch up too them his brothers and sisters the Aegis wolves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/upaladium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paladium</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Umbra Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/9/01 4:19:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=613.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://aegiswolves.ens.net/images/paladium.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mama Wolf calls you to the Guildhall.....</span><hr size=1> The old Wizard has listened to the words carefully, and with a knowing smile, nodds indicating that he understands the decision that the mother Wolf has made.

The look in the old wizards eyes reflects his age, reflections of many things seen and done, of many paths traveled, and now all but forgotten. He is ready to hang up his cloak permanently....Yet...<br>

To start again fresh, to leave the baggage of past battles behind intrigues him.
