Everquest no longer holds the enchantment for me that it once did. Those that found the equipment I dropped in Queynos and on wisp island, I wish you well and may God bless. It was left there with the hope someone would find and use it, rather than fading into the great abyss with my characters.<br>
<br>
Oddly, I feel no remorse over this decision, instead feeling freed of an obligation that was becoming to restrictive.<br>

In parting, I offer this link as a glimpse into my soul. I have been told that I live this, not just believe it.<br>

Not only you were, and are still , my best friend and Ceby's husband; but you brought enjoyment to me playing the game and fun of having someone to talk to during a heavy battle. I hope that someday you will forget all that was bad and decide to start fresh in Norrath again. I already miss you terribly.<br>
I am also sad that no-one, even people that Paladium considered good friends, post a farewell ; Or even a word of encouragement or anything.<br>
I must say this. To everyone that reads this board and I am talking ,especially, to ALL former AW members.<br>
When I met Paladium ,he had a dream. That dream soon became a nightmare.But a nightmare that forces a person to delete his chatacters and cancel his account?! <br>
Paladium almost lost his guild once due to differences of opinion between him and Ceby. But he perseviered and built it back up. Only to have  the  nightmare continue. He had many members which he thought were his friends turn thier backs on him. The story about Dews and the concequences were the harshest and most cold  hearted thing I ever heard. Paladium was only doing his duty as the guild leader to  protect his guild from what seemed to be a bad seed among members. And He was trying to appease some of his members that wrote him many emails asking, begging him, to let Dews go. I even saw and have in my files one of Teliana's emails to him about that matter. But You just stood there  and allowed that &quot;abuse&quot; to continue.<br>
Shame on you. Shame on you for not standing up for him. Pal considered you all his friends and buddies, and you let him down. If that is  how  you treat your friends in RL, then I am glad  I am not your friend.<br>
What really hurts even worse is that you ALL went and formed a new &quot;Wolves&quot; guild. You are a disgrace to be called  wolves. Wolves stick together . You ran. You are not wolves, you are sheep that wolves will eat for dinner one day.And the plague that brought down AW will bring you down eventually.<br>
You hurt him bad. Bad enough for him to delete and cancel his account. You should be ashamed of yourselves.<br>
I have much more to say, but I think I said enough already.<br>
<br>
Good luck Pal in whatever you decide to do. You are certainly a great friend and I am glad I got to meet you and hunt with you. And most of all you gave me the pleasure of being your wife in game. I wouldn't want anyone else other than you. You are the true meaning of husband, a friend and a confidant. Thank you.<br>

ps. Ceby's user name was banned, so I created one in my other characters name. I had to say good-bye. Sorry if I offended you by doing that Kavi.<br>

<br>
If this is directed at them then i suggest you locate their message board and Post there. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ceby I have no problem with you saying goodbye. Im not a heartless person. You and I may not see Eye to eye but all you needed to do was email me told me and i would have unbanned you.<br>
<br>
I personally can't even express my words at the loss of Pal. But i know he is doing what is right for him. and i back that just as i did with Dews.<br>

<br>
I Appologize for my post if it came across harsh please accept my appologies.<br>
<br>
Im going to edit it out or parts of it that could be a bit harsh.<br>
<br>
I was just afraid you were mad at me and the wolves for this situation. truth is i know many have talked about the situation on Tunare and Drinal. <br>
<br>
I know at least 2 who have contacted Pal and asked him to come to Drinal or Tunare. One was a post on one of the boards. And this was from a person who knew nothing other than Pal was a wolf and was packless.<br>
<br>
I know Pal is making the decision that is right for him. He will be missed but he gets to go back to RL now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As for Erollisi Marr. The Officers (both Tunare and Drinal)Dont like walking away from EM it feels to much like walking away from a fight with our tails between our legs. there is talk on Drinal and Tunare of doing a guild wipe in the next few weeks and then trying to rebuild. Whether this will happen is still in the air.<br>
<br>
anyway again Sorry about my ramblings. and sorry if i came across Harsh. again please accept my appologies.<br>
<br>
