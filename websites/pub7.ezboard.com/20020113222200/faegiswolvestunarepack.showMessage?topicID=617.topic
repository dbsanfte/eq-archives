<br>
Mandillorian has left the Pack. I could tell he was struggling yesterday but I was not in the frame of mind to really talk to him about it. I truly regret that as Mandi was a fine example of a Wolf and good and loyal friend. The Pack is diminished without him.<br>
<br>
As for me, my interest in EQ is fading. Yonder's little stunt really pushed me to the edge. I haven't been playing much at all lately and I can't say I really miss it. But I do miss you folks.<br>
<br>
Ah well, we shall see. Hopefull Mandi will come back to us. I know I will always welcome him.<br>
<br>
Mandi, I salute you.<br>

You make it sound like a joke.  It wasn't a stunt, it was goodbye.  They locked me in the psych ward for 4 days because I told my therapist about it.  The feelings were real.  Do you need me to fax you a copy of the paper that declares me mentally incompetant and incapable of seeking treatment for myself?  I personally feel it was a ton of bull that they stuck me in there, but if you ask anyone I was having those thoughts/feelings for a while, and they are a bit more deep rooted than a &quot;stunt.&quot;  That note was not to put people in an uproar, for I didn't expect anyone to see it until I was gone.  Lacking the means (which my friend fortunately took away from me a week before because she knew what kinds of thoughts I was having and saw the shape of the rope while snooping) I had a choice of going out and buying the means after most stores were closed, being rational enough and together enough to drive, purchase, and drive back, or to go unload on a friend who now thinks way less of me for it.  I chose to destroy friendships, and I have now apparently destroyed more than one.<br>
<br>
It was no a hoax, it was not a joke.  I'm not sure how much of the circumstances you know, but if you want to contact me in AIM (yonderwolf) I'll tell you whatever you want to know.  As much as I am willing to put on a public ezboard under an anonymous name is that at that point in my life, my only family in the world was some grandparents who lived over 500 miles away and a brother who lives down the street but whom I am not allowed to talk to, both of whom I felt slipping away under outside influences.  I went from a National Merit Scholar, valedictorian, 1510 SAT blah blah blah to a B student at a step up from the community college, finding that everything I enjoyed about life (EQ, Computer Science, job, friends) no longer brought me pleasure.  Throw on top of that the fact that my boyfriend of 3 years left me, I had malnourishment complications, I was getting nothing done at work and people were taking note and ready to fire me, initial antidepressants had a negative effect on me increasing depression, and the therapists weren't listening to me, and I was ready to kill myself.<br>
<br>
Seeing the effect it had on people who I thought could really care less showed me that there was possibly something woth sticking around for.  It was an intellectual battle as much an emotional one.  The only reason I wasn't gone several months ago was the thought that maybe somewhere, beyond my knowledge, there was a reason to go on.  Learning what a selfish, hurtful act it was is the reason I'm here now, chucking olive branches at everyone in the world who has ever told me I'm worthless and asking to get back in their lives.  <br>
<br>
I wish there were some way to appologize to the Janet and Suzi who live in Patriots Village, because those two were not the ones involved in this.  Fluke coincidence discovered by the other Suzi on her way to the PVs as she was stopped by police officers looking for the parties involved as she headed over to her boyfriend's house (she doesn't live in the PVs, nor do I).<br>
<br>
If you think this is a &quot;stunt&quot; to upset all the people I have ever loved, push my distant friends father away, send a ton of people on campus in a frenzy trying to find me, and get myself locked into a hospital trying to find a way to contact a ton of people I don't have numbers for letting them know that I'm okay, then you clearly don't know me very well.  I may be somewhat of an escapist, fleeing before fighting, but I never ever hurt my friends for no reason.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry that my actions have had that kind of an impact on you.  They were not at all justified, any more than they were a &quot;stunt.&quot;  It was an awful thing of me to do.  Having seen the impact, it hurts me deeply.  It was a desperate scream, not a game, but at the same time it was not called for.  I wish there were some way to make it up to the people that I hurt, though I know my loved ones will never look at me the same way.  Either that or they don't understand or care, which is the more difficult reaction I've gotten out of some.  If you want to talk to me about it, I'd be glad to share.  If you don't want any part of my life anymore, I wish that were not the case, but I can't stop you there either and will have to understand.  <br>
<br>

I'm thinking of coming back to EQ possibly at the end of the summer.  A lot of issues have to be resolved, the least of which is connectivity to the patch server hehe.  Considering I forsee my wolf quest as involving bringing Adle an Elder Spiritist BP, I'm not sure if I will ever be a wolf again.  Nowadays it's more doubting my own honor than my belongingness in the pack.  Maslow would call that progress =P.<br>
<br>
Do what you want.  The wolves are a great bunch of people.  If things haven't changed in the last couple of months, I doubt you could find a better group in Norrath.  My issues are RL issues and can't be resolved by being in or out of the Aegis Wolves (trust, me, I've tried those solutions).  The only reason I posted and unfortunately derailed this thread is that I was offended by the word &quot;stunt&quot; being used to describe the deepest thoughts and emotions I've ever had in my life.<br>
<br>
Mandilloran, you made a great wolf.  The pack is at a lost without you, but you have to find your own way.  However, once a wolf, always a wolf, you will carry that spirit with you wherever you go, and perhaps will someday find yourself back in the Tunare pack.  You have to find your own way.

<br>
You're right, I don't know you very well. I have never considered you a friend (merely an aquantaince) but I'll be god-damned if I'm going to let someone hurt themselves before doing everything in my power to stop them. I tried contacting Verant to assist us in discovering your identity. When they wouldn't help, I called the police. I spent 2 or 3 (does it even matter?) on the phone with the cops, desperately trying to reach you. For me, every moment of that night was spent in terror. Terror that we were wasting time, terror that we weren't going to be quick enough, terror that all our efforts were not enough. Why do you think I was asking about campus and such? Because the cop was trying to get me to have you reveal your location. I was screaming at the monitor, screaming at the cops and just screaming in general because I have never felt fear like I did that night.<br>
<br>
And here's what I just don't understand, while you are willing to leave us that little note of doom, you are unwilling to let us know who and where you are. Why? What could you possibly fear from the rest of us that you aren't ready to do to yourself?<br>
<br>
Whatever. I told you long ago what I thought you should do. You saw fit to ignore me until you ended up in a hospital anyway. I accecpt your apology. I hope you heal and I wish you well in the future. But I consider my duty done and I won't be going to back #aegiswolves.<br>
<br>
You don't have to know someone to care about them Yonder. Hell, you don't even have to bloody-well like them. Next time, all you have to do is ask for help. Do you think any of us (even me) so cold that we would not do EVERYTHING in our power to help you? If you do, then, you clearly don't know me very well. <br>

An anger reaction is very justified in this case, so as harsh as his words look, understand that they are acceptable and quite possibly what I need to hear.<br>

Once again, I am sorry.  I am working through what was going on with me back then, and trying to pull things together, and I understand and even agree with the anger I caused.<br>
