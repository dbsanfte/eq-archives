<br>
to me a guild is...<br>
<br>
1) family/friends<br>
2) people who will go out of their way for each other.<br>
3) a place where events are planned for the entire groups enjoyment.<br>
<br>
truth is to me it is all of these things and more.<br>
<br>
it is when someone leaves  the heart ache you feel.<br>
<br>
When someone leaves even if only with their primary it is a hurt. you know you can send them a tell when you get on. but it is not the same as that Hello across guildsay.<br>
<br>
truth is #2 and #3 probably truly best describe a regular guild. #1 in my opinion fits only a few of them on the server.<br>
<br>
you can recruit a bunch of people fast and make a big guild. or you can recruit slower and make a big family.<br>
<br>
youll end up with some friction here and there. is going to happen any time you get a group together. the diffrence is how the two handle it.<br>
<br>
any way i cant describe what im feeling. or how i feel about the wolves. <br>
<br>
Maybe someone else can. <p><img src="http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/personalpics/2hbpic3.jpg"><br><br>

<br>
We have few events.  We are a role-play guild.  But there is no pressure for anyone to do something that is not fun for *them,* and that is something I really appreciate about them.  There is a lot of freedom ... and yet, we are there for each other if needed.  It is one of the loosest looking groups, examining it from the outside ... but if you start to hang around with us, you will find we are as a tight a group of friends you will ever find.<br>
<br>
Leaving a guild with your primary ... is leaving a guild.  I still have alts in Sisterhood, Stormravens, and I think my bard is still even hanging around with an Aegis Wolves tag.  I rarely play them.  It isn't that I don't miss the other guilds, because frankly, I do ... a lot.  I have met so many people in my walks in Norrath, it is difficult for me to keep up with them.  30 people on a friends list is *nothing* ... I regularly also do /who all sister, /who all stormr, and /who all aegis ... just to see who is around.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Most of all, a guild should provide a sense of center, of home.  When I founded the Sisterhood, it was home for a long time, but then it lost that feel to me.  It is still home for many, but cannot be home for me.  Stormravens was never really &quot;comfortable&quot; in that way.  Aegis Wolves was VERY homey to me, and I still miss that feel some days.  But, as a relationship between Aziev and Shizandra developed ... it was a bit less comfortable.  It had nothing to do with how we were treated by any stretch -- it was just who we were and where we were.  AN is home for them.<br>

  Although i am a newer member of the guild, i am not a new member of EQ and one of the members of the guild has been my friend since the start.  I have played EQ since it was first realeased, many have i know, but i left EQ for about 2years, didnt play it one bit, deleted it from my pc.  the reason i bring that history up, is that I have a love/hate relationship with EQ, and being in the Aegis Wolves has been..... a unique experience.<br>
  I'm not going to get all sentimental and sloppy, although in this case i believe it to be warranted.  I completely agree with the two previous posts that i have seen, but would like to take it a step further.  Their posts were roleplaying responses, which i enjoy greatly, but when i read the question, my first though was of a RL nature so let me explain.<br>
   I think that many people look at a guild as something that you get something out of... what will i get by joining this guild, what will happen to me, etc etc.  which is a very normal and understandable response.  I even asked myself those questions when searching for guilds to join.  You may not be asking about material things, but you are asking what's in it for me, none-the-less.  I have found that in life, often the most rewarding times of my life have been when i have given to something, when i have applied myself and created, helped, just GIVEN.  And i think that might be important to think about now.  Maybe a guild is a place where we, as players, can GIVE something.  EQ is such a selfish game, hunt to increase YOUR level, buy to increase YOUR armor, YOUR bank account, YOUR this and that.  It is very difficult to really give in EQ, sure you can give away the free bind, the free sow, the free armor to a nice newbie, but it is shallow and often unappreciated by the recipient as well as the giver.  I think a guild is a place where you can have family and friends and truly give, and through that giving, recieve something that e <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uscenariusshakarey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scenarius ShaKarey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/16/01 12:00:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=560.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is a guild?</span><hr size=1> i apologize, my cat seemed to think that i should finish my response and hit &quot;enter&quot; for me.

I love this guild and will but everything i have into it, and by doing that, i often recieve the best times i've had on EQ.  Thank you for making EQ fun again, and thank you for accepting me as one of your own.  dont think about what you can get out of a guild, think about what you can bring to it, what you can give.  You just might find your in the best damn guild when you do. =)  That's my thoughts on guilds.  thanks for the listen.  Good luck and may your Gods bless you.<br>

Now I'm sure everyone has a dictionary and didn't need me to look it up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   For me, a guild is what Webster's says it is, and a whole lot more.  For me, a guild is a family.  Just like our Mundane World families, we're closer to some than others, but you share something in common with all of the members.  When you belong to a guild you know that if you're feeling great, there's someone to share the happiness, and when you're down, there's a shoulder to lean on.  When you belong to a guild you know you always have someone that can help you, and you know that no matter what EQ level you are, you can also help someone. This can range from helping a group get somewhere, or vanquishing an evil critter, or just running an errand or helping transfer coin or equipment.  When you are in a guild, you basically feel like you have purpose.  You know you're not alone.  Even if you play a solo-style character and prefer to hunt alone, you know that friends are just a /guildsay away, just in case. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tomorrow morning if you wake up<br>
And the future is unclear<br>
I will be here<br>
If in the dark we loose sight of love<br>
Hold my hand, and have no fear<br>
Cause I will be here<br>
<br>
I will be here, when you feel like being quiet.<br>
When you need to speak your mind, I will listen.<br>
And I will be here, when the laughter turns to crying,<br>
Through the winning, loosing and trying<br>
We'll be together....cause I will be here.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow morning if you wake up<br>
And the future is unclear<br>
I will be here<br>
As sure as seasons are made for change<br>
Our lifetimes are made for years<br>
So I will be here<br>
<br>
I will be here, and you can cry on my shoulder<br>
When the mirror tells us were older I will hold you<br>
And I will be here, to watch you grow in beauty<br>
And tell you all the things you are to me<br>
I will be here<br>
<br>
I will be true to the promises I have made<br>
To you and to the ones, who gave you to me<br>
And just as sure as seasons are made for change<br>
Our lifetimes are made for years<br>
So I will be here...we'll be together,<br>
Cause I will be here<br>

What is a guild? Webster is right, it is a society of common interests...but with us it is so much more. We are a family, you are my brothers and sisters. I have never cared for anyone as much as I care for my friends in EverQuest. That is what a guild is to me. For me it is not about level, raid or loot. It is about friendship.<br>
