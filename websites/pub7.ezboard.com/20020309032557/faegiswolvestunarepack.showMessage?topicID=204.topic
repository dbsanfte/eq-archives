<br>
<br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
We the Aegis Wolves as family and friends seek to make time on line as enjoyable and entertaining as possible for everyone online.  In order to establish this goal and to become a more honorable and respected guild, we realize that a certain basic vision needs to be established for basic conduct, belief, and purpose.  We have come together as pack and guild because we share this vision for what we feel to be online utopia.  For this purpose we have composed the following articles to describe our beliefs and establish a basic code of conduct and organization to make our pack stand proud and honorable amongst the guilds of norrath and the lands beyond.  <br>
<br>
Charter: E Pluribus Unum.  <br>
<br>
Article I:<br>
Respect of the pack and the online community.   Membership as an Aegis wolf is second only to real life and loved ones in danger.  Personal honor, pride, vengeance and beliefs are secondary to your devotion to the guild and your pack mates.   You have the right to have these feelings and to voice them, but your loyalty to the pack is first and foremost.  Once a member of the wolves you have accepted full responsibility for representing the guilds honor in all situations and to look after the interests of our guild.  You will uphold the decision and stance of the guild one any subject online.  We are many wolves but we are one pack.   <br>
<br>
Article II:<br>
Discrimination is not an option.  The Aegis wolves do not and will not discriminate any player on any grounds.  Each player is entitled to there own individual opinions, belief and religion.  Players of all backgrounds, cultures, races, sexes, ages and lifestyles are welcome with the Aegis wolves, both as members and fellow adventurers.   No wolf will be apart of or involve themselves with actions or groups that violate this article.   Any action in defiance of this article will result in disciplinary action up to being stripped of membership.<br>
<br>
Article III:<br>
Bring Honor to the pack.  All Members represent the guild at all times. This means that they must, to the best of their ability, to follow the guild’s charter.  Never do anything to bring dishonor on the guild. This will include, but not limited to, “kill stealing”, stealing from members, bug abusing, flaming, Item farming without sharing a spawn, corpse looting, spamming players and other miscellaneous inappropriate behavior or disrespect. These actions will not be tolerated could result in disciplinary action up to removal from the Aegis Wolves.<br>
<br>
Article IV:<br>
There are no secrets in the guild.  Secrets are evil things that promote mistrust and avoidance of issues.   If you can not say it or do it in front of another wolf, then you should not be doing it.  As a wolf you are always expected to speak your peace and give your opinion then resign to the decision of the pack.  All members are trusted members with there own beliefs but the decisions of the guild are for the good of the pack not the individual.  Not presenting a problem before the guild or anonymously to the officers is not a crime, but you are the only one to blame when the problem continues.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Article V:<br>
The Aegis Wolves are a role-playing guild. As such members of the Aegis Wolves should develop a character and must try to stay in character while playing.  Also As the guild grows role-playing scenarios may be created and role-playing events and games may be done between guilds.  It is not mandatory that you participate in role-playing but would be appreciated.  Also though the spirit of role-play might include character based conflicts, These are character based and not player.  Anything done in the spirit of role-playing should remain so and not violate article III.<br>
<br>
Article VI:<br>
Protect the pack.  You will protect and assist any wolf in distress to the best of your ability.  As a member of the wolves you have a blood oath to your brethren in the pack.  If in dire need of assistance from a class or level of character you can turn to another wolf and in return must offer the same selfless support to the other members.  This is a privilege and not to be abused, Wolves are only required to help other wolves in need not in greed.  You do not have the right to have people camp for you.  It is not frowned upon to camp for a friend but it is a choice not a requirement.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Article VII:<br>
All wolves will assist the pack in times of war. Guild wars can only be initiated by a 50% vote of the Elder Wolves Council. Once the Elders vote to begin such a war notice must be sent immediately to all members. All members must be notified at least 24 hours in advance.   There are two types of guild wars we recognize.  The first is a hunt.  This is a war for honor and justice to punish those who Harass or other wise aggresses on our pack.   The second is a Quest war.   This is used in role-playing scenarios.  This is a sparring war in which we fight only to 50% health.  The first below 50% should yield or flee.   If a bought should be fought to the death then it should be agreed upon before hand.  <br>
<br>
Article VIII:<br>
Contribute to the pack.  The guild will maintain holdings for the protection, empowerment and role-playing use.  These items will be kept on mules and can be checked out as needed through the treasurer.   To check items out you must be of wolf rank or greater.  These Items are for the guild and are not to be dropped, traded or sold.  These Items will also be used to reequip members that have lost their holdings due to bugs, theft or lost corpse.  If you leave you return any Items.  The only contribution required is from rank quests all others are voluntary and appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Article IX:<br>
The Call of the wild will always be answered.  The Aegis wolves pack signal.  It is a howl on guild say.  It is given with important announcements and guild member successes.   Every wolf should have this hot keyed.  If this is seen every wolf online will respond ASAP and pay attention to guild say for a minute or to for any important information on the howl.<br>
<br>
<br>
Article X:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Motto:  Mean well, Do well, Speak well<br>
<br>
This charter was made as a guideline for the moral code of a wolf.  We understand that some scenarios may bend or stretch the solidity of these basic truths.   For more detailed guide on rules and behavior that seem too complex to choose the right path refer to the Aegis wolves guidelines for an in-depth explanation.  <br>

<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
Aegis wolves Guidelines: We understand that there is always a gray area with rules sometimes.  Hopefully this more detailed account of rules and procedures will be helpful.  Most are just a recount of what we feel to be common sense.  Any conflicts with these feel free to discuss at meeting and with officers.  These are guidelines, which means in some situations there may need to be some weighting done, above all do the right thing.<br>
<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your first online duty is to your guild.  The only exceptions being loved ones in danger.  If your guild needs you or your pack mates are in distress, refer to rule 4 for more on this.  You should be willing to leave a group to help a wolf.  This devotion does not require supplying fellow wolves with weapons and armor, or you to go out of your way to buff them.  It does however mean you should be willing to donate time and items you don’t need to the guild for other wolves to use as needed.  It only makes the guild stronger.  We realize you have friends out side the guild, but we are family and if you are needed you will get to a safe point and take your leave.  If at any time you feel your devotion lies with others over the guild you will be sorely missed but you are free to leave just notify any officer and tell them why and return all guild items.<br>
<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your fellow wolves are your online family.  You are expected to support them at all times. If they are in dire need you are required to assist them and remember next time it may be you who needs help.  Do not abuse this privilege.  No members of the guild are required to camp items for you or buff another member.  If they are standing right next to you they should assist with binds and such but it is not required that they do so.  If your require a buff you should go to them for it and not expect them to come to you.  We do not frown upon twinking or helping others in the guild with leveling and buffs, but it is the choice of the giver not the receiver.  Members are required to help members in need, not members in greed.  Another topic to discuss is pack mate behavior. If you feel that a member has dishonored the and there actions inappropriate then you need to get a non partial witness to confirm it and screen shots then bring it up to an officer. If the member was out of line it will be dealt with promptly.  If it is determined that he was not out of line no one will be punished and the matter will be dropped.<br>
<br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If any slanderous comments are seen or received by any wolf about a fellow wolf or the guild.  You are expected to make a screen shot of it.  This way if any conflict should arise there is evidence of the innocent.   In return no wolf is to slander another guild or guild member if they are rude and or arrogant then screen shots should be taken and the guild leader will take up their actions with the other guild leader.  Dueling is allowed and of course you have the right to disagree with some one or not like them but don’t slander or flame it is against our charter.  We are better than that.<br>
<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If a wolf calls for help or a hot trot is called by the pack master, Then every member of wolf rank or better, within three zones is expected to go if needed.  If no one is within three zones and a fellow wolf needs help you are expected to stop and assist them.  I realize this may be an inconvenience to us but these are our pack mates or allies and next time it may be us that needs the help.  So exceptions will be noted doing corpse recovery, need to get the group your with to a safe place so you can leave them safely, you will be online long enough to reach the destination etc.  Hot trots are calls by the guild leader for every available wolf to go to the assistance of a member or ally for a reason or another.  These do not happen often there has only been one to date.  But if this is called what should occur is not a few wolves that go help, but should be a mass migration of all wolves.  Assuming you will be online long enough to reach the destination.  These will only be called for serious reasons such as a war.  <br>
<br>
5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secondary character has become an issue and the guild has decided on the following course of action.  We want our members to be able to experience other races and classes without being separated from the guild.  But also we don’t want an influx of some many new characters with new members that we loose control of the guild and who everybody is.  So currently allowed to those of wolf rank or greater only two characters. This is ruffly four or five month’s time. Guild characters are not counted in this such as mules.  Officers due to duties are allowed only one that can have officer powers.  If you have your maximums allowed and wish to add another then you must remove one from the guild we would like to allow exceptions for those amongst use that tire more easily of a limited number of characters.  But at the same time we do not want people joining with eight characters and not being able to establish them selves in the guild, or leaving and us having eight characters with guild tags on the drop list we have to chase down.  As well as not being able to track down who is who<br>
<br>
<br>
6)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Disrespect to other players and guilds including but not limited to Thefts, scamming, training, kill stealing and leading people into traps or disrespectful dialog is not acceptable behavior for a wolf.  Any of the above with evidence will result in a broken paw council, and termination of membership.  Any accusations without a creditable witness, or a screen shot will not be taken seriously.  <br>
<br>
7)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rank structure does have power.  Disobedience to a guild officer in a reasonable situation can result in a broken paw council.  Officers and higher ranks are not allowed to order you to do unethical things, they are not allowed to give orders that are impossible or unethical (I.E Asking you to die so they can flee, asking you to camp items for them etc. . .).  It is the opinion of the guild that orders should not ever be necessary.  As the team we are if something needs to be done it should be done because you where asked and should never be asked unless it is the right thing.   If you feel an officer is abusing power report it immediately.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Role-playing evil.  If you are going to role-play evil that is fine as long as you do it within reason.  Any role-playing that involves making the game un-enjoyable for others then it is not acceptable.  Some examples include Failing to give assistance when able, Spaming with rude messages, kill stealing, training and anything that hinders newbies.  Role-playing is between characters not players.  If a player is hurt or hindered by the role-playing it is not appropriate.<br>
<br>
9)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officers have ten positions available.   These represent the ten original elders.  As positions are available new officers will be selected.  The guild master will nominate the members that they believe to be the best for the position.  Then the Officers will vote to the guild leader for each open position and the votes will be tallied.  Though the nominated members don’t need to be present the officers have to be present at the meeting to vote.   <br>
<br>
10)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Guild meetings are not mandatory.  They are an if you are online basis.  They are a chance for the guild to get together and discuss guild business, bring up problems, and share thoughts.   If you can’t make the meeting you will not be punished.  If you are online then you can participate via guildsay if you don’t want to travel.  Though if you can make it to the location it would be nice to see every one.  All wolves have a voice in the guild and this is the best time but you will not be punished or reprimanded for not attending or not having thoughts for the day.  Guild meetings cover a few things some of which are:<br>
A)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voting on issues that effect the guild for the empowerment of the guild.  If you are not present however you will not be able to vote on what the issues of the day.  If you are not present and a vote is held for something then you must except the decision of the guild.  <br>
B)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  If you have problems you need to place them on the table at guild meetings.  If you have a problem and you wish to council with an officer before hand feel free.  But this guild does not operate behind the scenes or in secret if you want it to change you need to lay it on the table for all to see.  Everything a wolf does if they can’t do it in front of the guild then they shouldn’t be doing it.   If you are going to accuse someone of actions not acceptable to the guild, you are expected to have a creditable witnesses and proof.  Random accusations are not acceptable. As any trial broken paws evaluate evidence based on it’s solidity not on he said she said. <br>
C)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp New ideas and point of views are always expected and looked forward to.  Questions and the.  Can also be brought up at this time.  So feel free to present both especially if it is in resolution to a mentioned problem. <br>
<br>
11)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As a member of the wolves you are always expected to speak your heart.  There are no secrets in the guild.  We do not want any rumors or people secretly harassing other members.  If you have something to say you should be willing to say it in a guild meeting or over guild say.  Or even anonymously to an officer.  When the officer discusses the situation they will refer to the parties involved as themselves and the guild leader or another officer.   It is not against the rules to stay quiet.  But when the problem continues you have only yourself to blame.  <br>
<br>
12)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Den Loot is guild holdings for the protection and support of the guild and the members. They are kept on the mule and inventories audited buy he treasurers.  These are to be used by wolves to assist our Pups and to replace items for wolves that have lost them or they where stolen.  Wolves of wolf rank or greater may borrow from the mule at any time with permission with permission from the treasurer.  But the item borrowed belongs to your fellow wolves as well.  If you decide to remove the character or leave the guild the item goes back to the mule.  These items are not to be sold or given away.  Any act of not returning an item will be considered theft from the guild and could lead to a broken paw council.  If you wish to give an item to another wolf you need to confirm it with the treasurer in guild say or first return it to the mule you received it from.   These Items are also used to refit wolves that have lost their personal items due to, looting, accident, or unrecoverable corpse.<br>
<br>
13)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Respect and honor should be shown to all members and fellow gamers.  Letting temper get the better of you is not excusable.  We define respect as conventional or correct behavior and a willingness to show consideration and appreciation to others.  We understand that sometimes situations become bad but wolves will not be dragged down.  Exploding only serves to make us less creditable and devalue your point of view.  Honor to us is Distinction or personal and group integrity, dignity and pride maintained without any form of enforcement.<br>
<br>
14)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All wolves will assist the pack in times of war. Guild wars can only be initiated by a 50% vote of the Elder Wolves Council. Once the Elders vote to begin such a war notice must be sent immediately to all members. All members must be notified at least 24 hours in advance.   There are two types of guild wars we recognize.  The first is a hunt.  This is a war for honor and justice to punish those who Harass or other wise aggresses on our pack.   The second is a Quest war.   This is used in role-playing scenarios.  This is a sparring war in which we fight only to 50% health.  The first below 50% should yield or flee.   If a bought should be fought to the death then it should be agreed upon before hand.<br>
<br>
15)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Howl is our guild say.  It is an internal form of communication like the wolves howl in the wild is used to communicate across miles of forest.  There are a few important things about the howl.  No profanity.  This is a family guild and has children both watching and playing if you feel the need to use vulgarity do it in the privacy of your home.  Obey the Call Of the Wild.  The COW is the wolves howl (AAAAAAWWWOOOOOO!!!) when this is seen all wolves should respond (have it hot keyed if nessacery) .  Then pay attention for the next few minutes for important news about the guild or it’s members.   Important information will be put out this way about trouble, hottrots, guild wars or member successes.  If you find your self stuck with no way to see what the information was follow up with a guild mate.<br>

<br>
hasta<br>
<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
These are the ranks for the Aegis wolves.  There is two rank structures one for the officers and one for the members.  The two are separate due to a difference in responsibilities.  All wolves have the responsibilities of bringing honor to the guild.  To protect and stand by their fellow wolf no matter what.   To support and assist the leaders in all tasks asked of them.  <br>
<br>
Member Ranks: Members are the generals group of wolves they are the heartbeat of the guild.  They participate in the role playing events.  There not required to do more than be a member of the family and help each other and our allies until they get to higher levels.  As they approach seniority in the guild they are expected to be of more assistance to the officers.  Where as in they have earned greater respect and will be looked upon for advice for guild decisions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cub = Applying to be a wolf, under super vision.  After Cub procedures are finished, they will be promoted to pup.<br>
<br>
Pup = Beginning wolf will be promoted to wolf status when completing 4 weeks time as pup and Finding an item of appropriate level to donate to the guilds protection fund.  They are not allowed to borrow directly from mules.  Though if requested Items may be given at the pack master’s discretion but no more than one item at a time till they have donated one item and become a wolf.  They may only have one character.<br>
<br>
Wolf = Full-fledged wolf.  Has responsibility of mentoring guild cubs they are assigned, may have some minimal miscellaneous future duties.   Will be promoted to Protector after 3 months time as wolf and having proven them selves to be a dedicated member and valued friend of the guild.  You will be given a task to complete and at its completion will be promoted.   Must be at least wolf rank or higher to become an officer or receive titles.  If you are pursuing an officer ship then you must be willing to donate online time to the guild.  As an officer you have to be one of the most dedicated members.  Possible willing to sacrifice small amounts of RL time to the guilds structure.  Wolfs are allowed two characters, not including work charaters such as mules. <br>
<br>
Protector = With obtaining of this rank and future ranks all duties of the previous ranks are to be met as well.  As a protector wolf you are expected to be an active member of the guild.
