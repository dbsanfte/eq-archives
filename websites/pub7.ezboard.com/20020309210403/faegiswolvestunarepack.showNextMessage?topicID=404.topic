We have a lot of pack members still running around in *gasp* small bronze, banded, and otherwise outdated armor.  As Aegis Wolves, I think it should be our responsibilty to look our best at all times. Granted, most of the Wolves can't have such a nice fur coat as I do most times, but a nice set of Ro Armor or the equivalent certainly makes an impression on both established players and newbies alike.  <br><br>     So, what I'd like to do is start helping members with their quests.  I offer my services for teleports, Spirit of Wolf &amp; Wolf Form and even help with defeating whatever challenges are required to attain the required components for my packmates to attain their quest armors.  The only thing I ask is that the person asking for help knows all pertinent information on the items we'll be attaining.  This would include what critter has said item, what other critters may be involved, locations of items that are not carried on a critter, etc.  <br><br>     If enough packmates are interested, I think we can turn these individual quests into a fun group activity, which will encourage teamwork, camaraderie, and the overall pack spirit I see when I'm hunting with my regular hunting pack ( You know who you are! )<br><br>     If anyone IS interested in AFS (Adle's Fashion Service for short), please e-mail me at AdlehardtAW@aol.com and we can work on scheduling a specific date to attain the items YOU need to look your best!  Alternatively, just send me a howl over guildchat and we can work something out. I have a few quest related items that may be of use to young folks, so don't be afraid to ask what I've collected. *looks mournfully at his overflowing bank vault*<br><br>     Also, any comments, questions or advice would be much appreciated here!<br><br>*curls up on top of his rock and waits for his first customer*<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uyonderwendobrayxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yonder Wendobrayxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/6/01 5:55:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> count me in</span><hr size=1> Although we don't get any class specific armor (unless Foo* wants to power me up to fight Gorgons =P) I'd be glad to help on this.

I'm not going to go out and get 10 items and dish them out at random to packmates who haven't even asked for them.  The idea behind this is that we learn to work together to attain items that may otherwise be difficult to attain alone.  Of course, I do have a quest parts in my bank vaults that I'd like to get rid of, rather than destroying, so if I have an item for a quest, I'm going to let you know. <br><br>For example, late yesterday night (actually, early this morning) Yonder, Kronenburg and myself happened to kill Choon and Froon a few times apiece and each of us acquired the No Drop Lore Item: Rune of the One Eye from each of the Cyclops.  I believe these are parts for a Ranger Quest Item and would be happy to help to use them up rather than destroy them.  <br><br>If no one has a use for such stored items, we could always complete the quest and have some Quest Armor in the Aegis Wolves armory for new cubs who have proven their valor under special circumstances, or for special ceremonial occasions when we want to wear something special.<br><br>I'd just like to reiterate that this service is not going to be a case of sending Ol' Adlehardt out to get an entire set of quest parts by my lonesome.  I'd like to see the person requesting the service actually make the kill/find the item themselves, with the aid of packmates to fight along side them or watch their backs as the case may be.  It's a rewarding experience to actually earn your own quest gear rather than have it handed to you as if it were just another &quot;expected&quot; item.<br><br>Yonder, I'd love the help!  If we can yoyo kite a big red Cyclops named Proon and live through it, I'm sure most of the tough quest critters shouldn't be any more difficult.
