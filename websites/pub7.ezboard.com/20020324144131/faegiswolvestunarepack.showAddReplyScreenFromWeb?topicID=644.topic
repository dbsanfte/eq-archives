<br>
Second, I wrote what I did because I really expected never to post here again, but I do feel I have to. The Main reasons I wrote what I did is simple I saw a problem with the Pack, and tried to point it out, at no point did I intend for this to become such a debate, but the fact that there was a debate only suggest to me that there is more important thing for the wolves to worried about then Language, and that is what I tried to express.  I want everyone in the wolves and out who posted in my last trend to think for a second on this, at one point we were, and on some level are still all a family, Yes some member feel the need to move on, and nothing can or will change that. Some are even forced to move on for valid or invalid reasons, but like any family Feelings are hurt and feeling are mended but no matter what we learn and grow on what we learned in our family.  I however am very ashamed of what my last post cause, I never expected it to turn in such a match of I am right and you are wrong. It was meant to point out a problem I saw in the pack.<br>
<br>
I know Yonder I could have stayed and tried to fix it, however Remoris had at that point been stuck at the lvl he was for a little over 6 months without ever moving up in exp, the few times he went out to play with pack members he actually ended up loosing exp!!! through no fault of the Pack, but only after I got out of the guild did I ever see Wolves of High lvl hunt together  and that was in EW were I was invited to Join in the group since I was looking for a group at the time. Now how do you fix something that no one think is broken but you, and while everyone else is busy trying to enforce rules regarding expression and language? not that there is really nothing wrong with that mind you, but to me it was never a priority,  The new Guild Leader, no offense meant Adle you are a very good Leader and a Good example of what a Wolf should be, made Clear that the Language Rule was to be one of his first Priority. His choice his Right, it is his Guild and he has every right to Decide what the priority is. However at that point in time I was so close to Deleting Remoris because he was becoming something for me to be ashamed of.....  For those of you who have known him when he Was young Remoris never sat still for Very long, he made from 1 st lvl to lvl 42 in Little over a year and of that I was away at sea for 6 months.... for some reasons other then Hunting with Leetah Remoris never hunted wit anyone of the pack once he got past his 35th lvl. Why well many reasons everyone was busy doing their own thing people wanted him to come and group with them, but were unable or unwilling to leave the group for a few minute to pick him up across the world even though  they could tp, he would make his way via boat and by the time he got there the group would be disbanded, the only time this was not truth was when Ashrai, and Leetah were in the Guild, and Later Argent and Adle, I am excluding Rematus of this list because he is a RL friend and if I needed a TP I could call him even if he was not online and he would log on to tp me around if I needed it.   But in short Remoris has been feeling since the day that he got his 42nd lvl that the reasons was he was stuck were he was was his own fault and in a way yes it is, in  major way, but then again he got used at a very young age to hunt with Brother and Sisters of the pack, and without them he was totally lost unsure of his own capabilities, he was depending on his family and was willing to lay his life for any of them. Many of you have seen him die trying, and I say trying to because it was not always successful, to cover someone flight from a mob. Anyhow since I have left the pack and decided to stand on my own 4 legs.... no pun intended, I now have wolf form, I have attain the 50th lvl, some of you may think that moving from 42 second lvl to 50th lvl in a month is somewhat like the Old Remoris, well yes it is.  <br>
<br>
The reasons why I want to apologize is 2 fold one I apologize for getting angry about the language rule enforcement thing and for stating my opinion in such a way, second I want to apologize for all the rocus my last Post caused.  It was never my intention to caused old wound to be open and old pack affair to be dusted from the shelf. It happens and that is entirely my fault I realize this and apologize for that.<br>
<br>
I want to point out that it is not because I disagree with a rule, or think the priority is wrong that I am right. I am certainly no geniuses.<br>
<br>
I hope that all the wolves old and new Be they current or ex wolves can accept my apologies for what I caused to happen, I did not mean to open wound or closet doors.<br>
<br>
I know I have broken my last post promise that I would not post here anymore and for that to I must apologize.  To all My friends I hope you can still call me a friend and I am sorry for all the trouble I have caused many of you.<br>
<br>
and to Teir I return the Salute and I am glad to have news of you pls for you and any wolves use My new e-mail address and send me a message once in a blue moon I miss a whole lot of you.  My e-mail is s.cote@ns.sympatico.ca  Everyone feel free to use it<br>

 <br>
Shaune you will always be one of My closest Friend and you will always have a special place in my heart.  You also know that anytime you need help or just to talk all you have to do is tell me and I will be there for you Bro.  Also Bro I want you to know that if you ever disapear from this Game, Like you did for awhile in the past, I will curse you and try to find you, I have your phone Number and I will Hound you till you  comme back..... Just Joking, but seriously Believe that to a lot of people you are very Important and a very good friend, and i will be honest one of the main Reasons I did not Join is that no one other then you and Nadi talk to me about it, would I have been approach by someone, I might have join them.<br>
<br>
Yonder I have also the outmost respect for you, and never intend to be rude or to implie anything about you, I simply ment  that I agreed with you that it was an option, but I was not ready to take that one.  I also hope that we are still friends, I used to have your email Address but that got lost during of the many Reload of windows which I was forced to do in the last 6 months or so, so pls if you choose to send me an email with your address on it thank you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/baegiswolves>Aegis Wolves</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack>Wolves Den - Tunare</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
