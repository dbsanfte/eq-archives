I hope you had fun.  This event was less laid-back than I'd envisioned for most of us.  The hassle-reward ratio kinda stunk, but I think we just didn't get very lucky.  <br>
<br>
If I had it to do over again, I'd approach the NW corner with a bit more respect.  Nalena deserves a huge gold star for pulling this extremely difficult area where the mobs don't behave very well and adds come by the boatload.  Thank you, Sis... I just couldn't do it, but you did a fantastic job!  I understand that at times the mobs wouldn't follow you and you had to kill them where they were on your own while getting smacked around by adds.  I doubt many people know how hard you worked to keep the cycle running.  Jonan, you got stuck leading the understaffed and swamped corner of the zone, and you (and later Kron) made it happen.  *hug*  Thank you. <br>
<br>
The SW corner group was a model of good communication and teamwork.  Gallowsward, I've seen you in action as a group leader several times now - you are a gem.  We're very lucky to have you in the guild.  When you gonna start leading raids, Bro?<br>
<br>
The SE corner group was at times one AW plus guests, at other times was me and Sable running around half-dead.  Burroch was swamped keeping his group safe and informed on what the pack was doing, and he must have done great because our guests seemed to have fun. <br>
<br>
Complaints: where was the loot?  Gar.  None of the tasty mobs spawned for us.  It happens.<br>
<br>
Recommendation for future raids: every raid leader should get a secretary.  Thank you, Sablefox, for being patient when I didn't get to your CR right away, left you at DL for like 15 minutes, and basically took you for granted all afternoon.  Thank you for handling things for me that weren't getting handled.  Thank you for being you. *hug*<br>
<br>
Request for feedback: what did the Pack think of how I handled loot at the end, other than the fact that I totally forgot about Jonan and Burroch who had left early (whoops)?  Please pull no punches - this is kind of what I've been doing in xp groups I'm leading and if people hate it, I'd like to know.<br>

I Was Not There For Loot... As Everyone Know, i Take Handmedowns... heh.. Loot And Stuff Is All Xtra... Im My Little Group In The SE Corner The Only &quot;Noticable&quot; Loot Was A Dustscryer Ball.. And After I Did a /gu Anybody Need It? And Everyone Said No, We Just Gave It To The Chanter That Had Nothing In His Range Slot.. Decent Stats For A Range INT Item...  Overall, I Was There For The Fun.  Mandilloran Says I &quot;Solo&quot; Too Much And I Also Wanted To Keep My Pulling/Tanking/Keeping Other People Alive Skills Hined To The Perfection That They Are At. :-).  All In All I Was There For The Fun And The Oppourtunity To Hunt With The Pack... Needless To Say, I Enjoyed It Very Much.  As Did My Groupmates That I Was With.  Sorry I Had Ta Leave Early, But RL Dictates EQ for Me. I Have To Keep The Lovely Lady, That Has No Idea As To How Fun  &quot;Games&quot; Can Be, Happy  It Was My Pleasure And My Honour To Hunt With The Pack<br>
