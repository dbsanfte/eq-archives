Rochambeaux was thankful sweating in his Armor.  He was almost back home.  He looked foward to a bed.  Though there was nothing comfortable about it.  His Armor still hot to the touch from the baking heat was sinking deep into the warm sand as he walked.  He saw the light woodland area that signaled home.  He past a few solitary inns as he made his way to the town gate.  He new straight where he was headed.  To the Seafarers roost where the ale was well made and the rooms where clean.  He opened the door and walked in noticing the place was much more lively than it used to be.  Tumpy was still there getting people to buy him tonics.  The taverns regulars where hanging out near the bar.  The irregulars huddled conspicuously in the corners.  Rochambeaux unstrapped his sword, shield and helm laying them on the table with a clunk.  <br>
&quot;Whats your poison&quot; asked a young bar maiden named Lydia Nyasin.  <br>
&quot;Just plain ale&quot; He replied, dropping a few plat on the table.  &quot;Keep'em comming&quot; he added.  Now after a long journey he sat down to relax hoping for a bit of rest before getting a room. <br>

      Skywise stood there waiting for the stormbreaker to be moored at the dock.  He looked at the Greenish blue waters around the dock.  Not very clear but you could see about three feet down.  The gulls shrieked over head.  The smell of salt water never set well with him.  He was from the forest, not Freeport.  He loved the moist clean air, not the dry salty breeze.  He was proverbially a fish out of water.  <br>
      &quot;Ships moored!&quot; shouted the harbormaster.  Signaling that the debarking could begin.  The warm sun gleamed on his elven features.  He had never left the shores of Faydwer before. So far other than a mix up with a rather depressing fellow about whose bag the skeleton was carrying every thing went fine. The dockworkers and other travelers had not even seemed to notice him.  It was uncanny how people bustled along mostly avoiding eye contact.  For so many people it seemed an unfriendly place for most.  <br>
Some kids ran past kicking a ball along the harbor docks leading his eye to a Tavern.  He examined the name as he saw a man lean out a window and empty some sort of bucket on to the pier below.  A drink and a rest could be good to say the least.  He walked up to the building and read the sign. <br>
      “The Seafarers Roost” it said.  He opened the door and stepped in.  The smell of salt pork, ale and smoke washed over him making his hair stand up on his neck.  A barbarian ran past him quickly followed by another.  The force of their run pushed him against the wall knocking a picture sideways.  He was about to say something but they where gone.  He turned the corner and saw and ogre in full plate drinking at the bar.  He was shocked.  He was drinking with a Teir’dal.  He had never seen either one before.  He had heard stories but never actually seen them before.  He quickly glanced away before either or took a fancy to him.  Low profile he decided would be a good idea. <br>
        As he turned the corned to the left he realized a lot of different people come here.  The tavern had just about every race.  All busy about their conversations and quaffing.   Some singing in languages he had never even heard.  Then behind a small barmaid he saw a familiar face, much to his surprise. He grinned as he headed for the table.  <br>
        “Hail Brother” he said as he approached.  Rochambeaux saw him a stood up to greet him inviting Skywise to his table. <br>
        “Sit brother and have a drink on me, ‘tis good to see you well.” Rochambeaux said.  <br>
        “Aye, and you.” Skywise replied.<br>
        “What brings you so far from home young brother” the warrior queried the bard.  “Faydwer be a good distance from here.”<br>
        “I have come bringing mail, I’m a runner running messages for my guild.  I have been on the road for three days now”.  Skywise said then asked the barmaid for a flagon.<br>
        “Rochambeaux threw some coins on the table.  Young halflings eyes lit up as she heard the jingle.  Then looked away when she realized she’d been seen.<br>
        “I have heard the bards are have some concern right now regarding the disappearance of one of their kin near the forest of Nektulos.  That true?” Rochambeaux asked.   Skywise made a gesture to answer but just then. . .<br>
