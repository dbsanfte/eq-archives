/OOC I have detagged from the Wolves to allow my character more roleplaying oppertunities.  Zhazam is my main character and his big troll butt did not fit well in the Wolves.  I have had very little contact over the last few months with the Wolves.  I have be meaning to place a post on this board since I detagged, which was 2 weeks ago by the way.  It was not until last night when I shouted for something in a that Leetah was also in that anyone noticed I was gone.  I do not mean this as a slam but only to point out that I have not been active in the guild.<br>
So saying that I bid you all farewell.<br>

I hope you can find a better place to roleplay.  One of the problems with the chat inteface is that we can't always see who's on.  I personally do /who all aegis commands frequently to see who's up, but that only works for people who aren't /anon.  Give me a tell in game - maybe we can hook you up with some people who roleplay the dark side of life and would have more people for Zhazam to group with.<br>

If you are looking for evil role-playing, you may want to look into them.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry about your experience in the wolves.  Personally, I never really got to know you and all I can really say is that I'm sorry about that.  Quite honestly though, the entire guild with the exception of maybe one person could detag right now and I wouldn't know anything was up until I actually saw one of them without a tag.  No offense, but none of you guys are on my friends list, because all of you are on my guild list =).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I hope you don't take personal offense to that, and I hope you find a good new home. <p>Yonder Wendobrayxe<BR>

and Like Yonder i never put guild on my friends list. Friends list is only 20 slots and whole guild would not fit. It is why i ask Guild to turn on RP tags if they wish to go anon.<br>

If i dont See you come up on the Who all Aegis i do during the night (which is quite often) I assume your not on line.<br>

People Assume that we will realised they detagged. well we are not anyones keeper. we Know that RL comes up and people have to do things. for all i knew you were on vacation. However as i said to Forin last night &quot;That explains why i havent seen him recently&quot;. So even though i did not look for you to be detagged I did notice you had been gone.<br>

<br>
Ancienne Noblesse is another possible choice. They many of the folks there roleplay rather well (and they lean towards the evil side of neutral most of the time). They can be found at www.anciennenoblesse.net.<br>
<br>
The Wind Riders and Shadow Striders are good as well. I haven't seen a whole lot of activity from them as of late, but I know they are still around. They can be found at www.windriders.com.<br>
<br>
Take care and have fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As I said in the message if I was involved in the guild more it would have been more obvious that I was gone.  I do not mean to imply or say that I am hurt or upset and nothing said here has changed that in fact the opposite is true.  I like the Wolves but have not seemed to be able to group with many of you and for that I take the blame.<br>
As for another guild I have been looking the last two weeks and have joined the DoD.  From some of the posts I have read they are a RP guild but I will wait and see on that.  <br>
I still have Wamorf tagged but I am concerned about being in two guilds with different characters.  I am not sure this works but if I am playing each one as a different entity it may work.  I am still pondering this one.<br>
As for the anon I normally did not use this nor did I keep wolves in my friends list for the same reasons listed.<br>

I've said a few times it's too bad we don't have a 'dark' brotherhood like the Black Wolves where evil chars of the Aegis can get together.  I have two evils myself and while Syl is no problem (She's primarily a merchant and so makes nice on the surface anyway) I would never put my Iskar in the guild (although whether they are evil or just foreigners I don't know).<br>
<br>
Anyway, please give me a tell now and again and let me know how you're doing.  The number of friends you're allowed is too short to keep everyone I'd like to on there but I'll try to remember to look for you from time to time.  I hope that you find a home that makes you very happy.  And I'll always remember the good times we've had together.  Give Wamorf a hug for me will you? That's a goo er bad troll.. hehe<br>
