It's taken me a long time to realize what things are important to me.  I ... I have to confess a few things to you all.<br><br>Once upon a time, some of you knew me as confidence, security, surety, and some have even said grace.  All manner of flattery was bestowed upon me when I founded the Sisterhood, and I hated all of it.  People asked me to do things, looked to me as an authority figure (for crying out loud, Svarinya had the GALL to ask me to marry her and Luxbane!), but all I wanted was to love them.  To the Sisters, I was &quot;Mom,&quot; and that title meant everything.  Other names, other platitudes meant nothing.<br><br>Then, I fell in love.  I didn't realize it then.  I had never felt that way toward a single person.  And who had the time!  With all the Sisters, the duties I performed, the items I sought to increase in power, the hunts and gatherings I was invited to--who had time for a relationship?  In my heart, I loved this person more than any other ... but I lied to myself.  I told myself it wasn't real ... but I found myself spending more and more time with this person, and less time with my guild.  Eventually, I made some very poor choices.  Some Sisters who had been hiding very bad attitudes came to the surface, and, for all intents and purposes, destroyed me as the leader of that guild.  There was a power struggle, and after it was all said and done ... I could no longer call the Sisterhood my home.  My family, most of them, anyway, had abandoned me.  The very family I raised for most of my time in Norrath!<br><br>But it was okay ...  I joined the Stormravens, who were a powerful guild at one time.  I wanted to see the lofty places of Norrath, the places I had yet to journey, and they could provide me that.  So I thought ... they, too, were having trouble internally.  Eventually, they also fell apart.<br><br>During my time in Stormravens, I saw my love more and more ... and ... it was beginning to dawn on me the depth of our passion.<br><br>*eyes cast down*<br><br>H- ... her name is ... Shizandra.  I ... we kept our love a secret, for fear of what people might think or say.  There is such a double-standard in Felwithe, for instance.  And I was still quite a popular figure.  The Stormravens were giving me exposure to new faces in Norrath, and I was regularly going on good camping trips.  I was learning much in the ways of magic.  But there were too many people ... and there was my image ... and ... well ... it was so complicated.<br><br>Finally ... we quit seeing each other.  I *wanted* to see her.  I wanted to feel her against me again ... I ... I am sorry.  I will spare you the details.  I ached for her.  I was lost without her.  I quit the Stormravens.  I met up with my sister Paazabel one day.  She had joined a wonderful group called the Aegis Wolves, and she said I would be welcome there.  I joined ... but ... still, I was lost.<br><br>Last week, I snapped.  I had fallen so far.  Once an easily recognized icon in Norrath ... now, no one, drowning in self-pity, sitting on the harbor walls in Firiona Vie, wishing I could slip into the sea and never resurface ... I would be forgotten.  But ... I decided that I was not going to.  I decided that appearances be damned, I was going to find Shizandra.  I was going to confess my never-ending love for her.  I was going to embrace her again, and I was going to be whole.<br><br>When I first met her, two days ago, now, she was ... evil.  I was so confused.  She wanted me to hate her.  She said the cruellest things.  She wounded me to my very foundations, and like a sick animal, I came back to be wounded again and again and again.  She had changed, and she had no love to give back to me, or so she said.<br><br>I had such hopes for our first meeting in so long ... I ... to have it so far in the opposite direction ... was excruciating.  I didn't know why she felt that way.  It wasn't the same person I fell in love with.  They had the same face, and the same name, and the same scent ... but they were *not* the same.<br><br>Yesterday ... I was going to meet her again.  The first day, I went to her broken.  The second day, I went to her in confidence.  I would not be the gibbering heap any longer.  Somewhere in this Elven frame are bones of steel, and I had started to realize ... I may actually be as strong as other people thought I was.  I faced her again, her assault unwavering, unchanged.  But she saw that this time, she wasn't getting the same reaction.  She saw that I was merely trying to understand what was happening.<br><br>Finally, I got to the root of it.  All the time we were separated ... she hated me.  I left her.  She felt abandoned by her one and only love.  Unlike me, she had ... ummm ... well, she had many relationships.  But I was the only one she ever cared for so deeply.  I was the one that took her heart when I left.  And she had nothing to give me ... because I already had taken it ... stolen it from her.<br><br>I forced her to face me ... to look me in the eye ... and tell me that she hated me.  She refused.  Finally, her anger full-throttle, she did just that.  Afterward, she was a trembling wreck ... and I knew she didn't mean it.  I saw the glimmer of love that still remained in her.  I grabbed her hair, rocked back her head, and kissed her ... and ... she kissed me back.  We wept for a time at our reunion, begging forgiveness of the other, vowing never to be parted again.<br><br>To all of you who have tried to gain my attention in the last couple of days, I appologize.  Please understand that Shizzie is, and always will be, my number one priority.  Re-gaining her took my undivided attention and complete focus ... and ... it was worth it.<br><br>I know that some of you may now see me much differently than before.  I'm not the role-model I used to be.  I am someone completely changed by this.  Not all of those changes were good, either.  My behavior may be a bit stormy, but probably no worse than any other wizard.  We aren't exactly known for our even temper.  *smirking*<br><br>If you see Aziev in game, chances are high that you will see Shizandra.  We are ... a physical couple.  If our relationship offends you, you may want to steer wide.  We refuse to hold it inside any longer, and that sometimes shocks the people around us.  *smiling, eye's gleaming*  Sometimes ... we do it for the express purpose *of* shocking them ... but I digress.<br><br>I hope that you all can accept what I have become.  If not, that is okay.  I have my home, now, even if it is not in the Wolves' den.  I know Paazabel has no plans to ever leave.  She thinks you all are just the best group anywhere, and who knows, she may just be right.  *another smirk*<br><br>(OOC -- Aziev is an emotionally charged character for me.  I have nearly 85 days played into her.  I want you to see a strange calculation: that is reaching up to 1% of my life!!!!  And if you take away the time I spend sleeping, plus the first, say, 3 years of my life, that's a pretty large chunk of my memory.  I have not been able to play, and enjoy, Aziev for a long time.  Paazabel is 34 as a direct result.  However, if Shizandra is around, Aziev will be with her.  I caution you to not take my warning lightly.  IRL, I am a hetero-sexual male.  This relationship was something the two of us wanted to pursue in game for a long time, but there were many obstacles.  I do have RL feelings for Shizandra, she is an exceptional friend, a one-of-a-kind person that I feel privilidged to have met in EQ.  The relationship between Aziev and Shizandra is very, very special, but don't assume too much about the players if you happen to see us together, okay?  Certainly, it would be an easy assumption to make.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uaziev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aziev</A> at: 10/3/00 2:16:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/usvarinya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svarinya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Pack Master</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/3/00 11:22:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mousetrap.net/~selena/minerva.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In Character, Out of Character</span><hr size=1> INC:<br><br>Leetah listens as Azieve tells her story.

However, right now, we sort of want to be alone together.  Our true friends are always welcome, and if *any* of you ever need a hand, Aziev is at your beck and call.  And, for the price of one wizard, chances are, you now get a pretty handy druid, too.  *smirk*<br><br>Love is where you find it.  I ... it isn't that I couldn't love a man, I don't think.

She holds her head high, her entire being *radiating* some other-worldly power, commanding respect in her presense.  She smiles and nods respectfully to those present.  Her eyes convey kindness, and yet, visibly within their violet depths, a dangerous storm rages...***<br><br>***She speaks, her voice both gravel and lyric...falling from her lips in a sensual timbre***<br><br>Greetings, friends.  Thank you for your hospitality this lovely evening.  I... I should also thank you all for caring for Aziev while we were...when she and I... *shifting uncomfortably* *inhaling deeply, exhaling slowly* .. while we were apart...<br><br>***Shizandra paces silently for a moment, her fingertips pressed to her mouth thoughtfully.  She sits on her haunches almost *too* close to the fire, her eyes fixed on the licking flames...the light playing tricks in her violet pools***<br><br>I... I respect u all very much.  I have always endeared to The Wolves, and had someday hoped to join your ranks.  That, however, may be moot after what I'm about to tell you...<br><br><br>My earliest memories are of Them.  Despite the rolling green hills, the sheer *beauty* of my birthplace, I only remember the evil and wickedness of my Unkempt brothers and sisters.  We lived in a commune of sorts in the center of Rathe Mountains.  The area was dangerous, yet, not as dangerous as Them.  As a small child, I learned early what it meant to feel true fear, shaking you to your very core.  Growing up, I never knew if I would ever experience my next breath...<br><br>*eyes cast down*  I never knew my mother or my father.  They say mother was nothing more than a pathetic whore.  She had more children scattered over Norrath than could be counted.  Certainly, the reality of knowing my father was an impossibility.  Irregardless, The Unkempt took me in, raised me, and educated me in the Dark Arts.<br><br>*shifting stiffly*  I...was one of Them.  In fact, in time, I became one of the most dangerous of their ranks.  My appearance, was for all dual purposes, disarming.  I was a seductress, a learned and dangerous assassin.  Many, both men and women, fell under my spell.  I would seduce them, provide them with pleasures unparalleled...only to have them taste my cold dagger before they sank into the cold, unyielding arms of Death...<br><br>I lived this way most of my youth...without conscience, without regret.  I was a force to be reconned with.  For me, it was true power.  <br><br>Towards the end of my murderous tirade, I had chance to, hmmm, well, experience one of the women in our commune.  *faraway look*  She was absolutely stunning.  Her talents were many *sly smile*, and certainly, she was capable at besting me in sparring.  I had a great deal of respect for her, and in some ways, in the year or so we spent together, I had begun to develop feelings for her.  These feelings were completely foreign to me...<br>  <br>One sultry night, we lay together in my makeshift tent.  She began speaking of leaving Them behind, and starting a new life elsewhere.  She didn't want to kill anymore for sport or profit.  It had become, &quot;too much&quot;.  <br><br>I argued with her.  She was obviously hallucinating.  No one *left* The Unkempt, and certainly, no one left *me*.  She continued, unwavering.  She had fallen in love with me, and wanted me to join her in her quest for forgiveness. <br><br>Love?  What was this *love*?  Love was for the weak.  Love was for thin-skinned fools at the other end of my dagger...<br><br>I stood, enraged.  She had gone mad.  Her features had taken on a serene, angelic appearance.  She reached for me, to pull me to her.  I backed away, disgusted with her weakness.  She begged me, &quot;please..please come with me...I *LOVE* you!&quot;<br><br>I covered my ears.  Love-love-love-love...the word rang in my head.  I didn't know what love was... I didn't *want* to know.  I turned from her, and she grabbed me by the arm.  I warned her to leave me be...that she had gone insane.  She refused.  She dropped to her knees, arms wrapped around my waist and uttered her final words...&quot;Shizandra, love WILL dispel the rage within you...&quot;<br><br>*choking back a sob*  I whirled around incensed, my dagger finding its mark in the soft tissue of her neck as I screamed, &quot;RAGE IS ALL I KNOW!&quot;  Her body loosed its hold on me, sliding down my shuddering frame, her expression...*tears rolling down my face*...her angelic face changed not its forgiving expression...<br><br>*pressing fingers to lips*  I ran from the camp then, her blood staining me forever.  I... I never went back again...<br><br>*sitting silently for a long while, looking at the fire forlornly*  I have the blood of many on my hands.  I... I never thought I would find forgiveness.  For many moons, I avoided it, because I felt it was ridiculous for me to seek it.  I had always associated the Dark Arts with Evil.  It wasn't until I met a small gnome Necromancer that I realized forgiveness was possible.  Perhaps one of the most kind individuals I've yet to meet in Norrath, Shokakon taught me that while one may be educated and respectful of The Dark Arts, they need not be usurped by it's power completely.  In many ways, I owe him my life.  He is truly a wonderful friend.<br><br>*barely visible smile*  I was hunting with him the day I first saw her.  *closing eyes*  Goddess...she was a vision...<br><br>In my quest for forgiveness, I sought out a women's guild called The Sisterhood.  They seemed to be a greatly reputable guild, and were primarily interested in serving others.  While the thought of serving *anyone* was a bit, well, out of character for me *chuckling*, I thought that perhaps, I should try to redeem myself.  A bit of networking with friends and I obtained the Guildmistress' name.  I spoke with her briefly, and she arranged a hunt with other sisters to better learn my abilities, as well as familiarize us all with one another.<br><br>Lake Rathe.  I shall never forget that day.  She met me at the one spawn where I was hunting with Shokakon.  I was *dumbfounded* by her beauty.  A tall statuesque blonde in a blood red robe, chin held high, almost regal in her confidence.  Then, she spoke.  Her voice was like honey.  I remember her speaking about the area, how it was so beautiful to her.  How she loved to watch the sunsets over the water...<br><br>*sitting, pulling knees into chest*  Goddess.  I struggled not to say too much, and yet, trying to say enough.  I was a wreck!  Certainly, if anyone else was listening, surely I sounded like a fool.  I didn't care.  I would have followed her anywhere...<br><br>*smiling softly*  Soon I joined The Sisterhood, quickly advancing in guildrank by the nominations of my peers.  I would have rather avoided any power.  I hadn't always behaved in kind with it...<br><br>In time, it fell apart.  Aziev did not take well to it, and I did my best to be supportive.  She had come to mean something to me, something more intense than I'd ever experienced.  I still, was not sure what to call it.  I knew only that I must be near her every moment of my life...<br><br>We began an interlude of sorts, taking solace in each other's arms.  We spent a great deal of time together.  I *basked* in her radiance.  She was all I thought about.  I would have done *anything* for her, anything she asked at all.  I dreamt of what it would be like to love her, and for her, to love me in return...<br><br>*smiling, head bowed*  I do appologize.  Methinks, I'm getting lost in my own sensations.  I'll try to spare u the legistics, as I'm sure it's not appropriate, here.<br><br>After a time, something happened.  We parted, the stranged victims of unforseen forces.  I nearly died from the pain.  I came to realize one fatal error on my part...<br><br>...I had fallen deeply in love with her.  <br><br>*exasperated expression*  Love!  I didn't know what *love* was.  I had never experienced it, nor had I wanted to.  Love makes one vulnerable and weak.  <br><br>Love.  I loved her.  With every fiber of my being, with all that I was, I loved her.  <br><br>I snapped.  I fell back into the only other place I've ever found solace, my dark past.  I joined up with another woman's guild called She of Shadows.  There, I resumed what I knew best, killing for sport and profit.  I seduced would be lovers, taking what I needed from them by way of pleasure.  Still, all I ever wanted to hear were *her* sighs...<br><br>*bashfully*  I'm sorry.  I digress again...<br><br>She of Shadows soon dispersed as often those who gather in the name of Darkness do.  I met up again with Shokakon who encouraged me to join Crusaders of Truth.  I did, reluctantly.  They knew who and what I was.  They knew what I did, yet, as long as I kept my doings to myself, they would look the other way.  <br><br>Every night, I was haunted by her memory.  She visited me like a spectre in my dreams.  I both loved her, and hated her.  She had taken my heart and my soul, and left me with nothing but a gaping hole.  I... I had thought of killing her to stop the pain...<br><br>...In dreams, I saw her blood dripping from my dagger...and her scream echoing in the air...<br><br>*tears falling again*<br><br><br>Soon too, Crusaders split, the higher ranks joining Southern Cross Alliance, the lower ranks staying within CoT.  I found myself a lone wolf, once again, with nothing to keep me company but the rage and rancor filling the black hole where my soul used to be.  <br><br>*shivering slightly, gaze fixed upon the fire*  We chanced to meet on Karnor's porch, recently.  She was every bit the vision she had ever been.  Goddess...how it *ached* to see her again.  I felt weak, that damn weakness that only love can provide you.<br><br>She begged...she pleaded.  I steeled against her.  I *would not* feel the pain of her loss again.  She was the only person in my *life* that I'd felt this way about.  She was the only person, I'd ever loved.  She owned my heart, she owned my soul...<br><br>*sighing*  Terrified.  I was terrified.  I wanted nothing more than to fall into her, to feel the swirl of our passion surrounding us.  She touched me, and I recoiled.  Her flesh against mine was like fine satin, threatening to string me up and hang me and leave me for dead.  <br><br>I shoved her away.  She asked me why I then stayed at the hunt spot.  I... I needed to be near her.  To smell her scent wafting around me in the breeze...to watch her casting in familiar fashion...to feel her eyes burning into the flesh of my back...<br><br>...bittersweet.  I needed her.  <br><br>I was afraid.  <br><br>The following day, she found me again.  My defenses were weak from lack of sleep the night before.  That robe...*sighing softly*  She wore the red robe.  I was blinded in my emotions.  She exuded that confidence...that *something* about her that made me love her in the first place...<br><br>She was different in her approach.  My defenses were caving, despite my best intentions.  I could only keep my distance from her, as best one could while hunting in Dreadlands.  She sought me out at every turn.  It was all I could do, not to strike her down...<br><br>I couldn't.  I *wanted* her near me.  When she grabbed my arm, the flesh she touched *sang*.  She cornered me, and asked me to look her in the eye and *tell* her I hated her.  I mustered every bit of strength I had left, and I did.  <br><br>Dead.  I died, then, I think.  As much as I tried to hold myself together, I fell apart, and with her as an audience.  She decended then, and kissed me, with every bit the ferocity I had come to expect from her...<br><br>*shivering visibly*  Goddess...  Can one very well ask the wind to stop blowing?  Can one ask the sun or moon to stop shining?  The grass to stop growing?  Time *stopped*.  She was all I knew, at that moment...the feel of her lips on mine, the taste of her, was Heaven...<br> <br>*smiling softly, eyes raising to look into those of her audience*  Dear wolves...know this.  I love her with everything that I am.  I am not much, if only a sinner looking for redemption.  She, she has saved me from myself, and for that, I owe her my life.  I know I do not deserve her.  I thank the Gods every day for even allowing me to have touched her once.  *Once*.  I see forever, in her eyes....<br><br>*looking for a long moment into the fire, then standing slowly*  I leave it to you, wolves, to judge us for yourselves.  It is, unorthodox to your kind, but yet, does love know any bounds?  <br><br>I wish to be near her in any way I can.  I never want to be away from her again... *never*.  If it suits u to have this Unkempt among your ranks, then, I hereby offer my pledge.  I will do my best, to do you proud.<br><br>***Shizandra bows slowly, then stands before the Wolves with chin held high.  Her eyes scan the room slowly, meeting each pair gazing back at her.  With a soft smile, she disappears silently into the darkness...***  <br> <p>Shizandra Mysticwolf<BR>Wood Elven Druidess<BR>High Hedonist<BR> Keeper of Her Burning Heart<BR><BR>"...Darkness on the Edge...Shadows Where I Stand..."<BR><BR>"If anyone up there is listening...you know I'm not much for praying, but I don't know what else to do.

His robe as purple as the Norrath sky before nightfall, he is a withered little man, his hair is frayed and his wrinkles show how long he has walked these lands such as a storybook in itself.<br><br>He walks slowly out into full view of everyone. His beady eyes peer around taking in all that they could. To the side he noticed the young woman whom he followed here has left.  The young woman whom he knew was destined for many things....  He could feel the confusion in the room as to why he was here, now, during this time.  The aged gnome was careful of who knew where he was and when, but yet, it was apparent that his appearance was necessary, here. The gnome sat down ever so slowly, his eyes now watching the fire in the middle of the room.*<br><br>         I suppose you all are wondering who I am and what I am doing here. I apologize now for my interruption. Tis not my intent. I am called Shokakon, I am a watcher of the happenings in Norrath and I have a story to tell you about one whom blessed your fire here tonight with her presence....<br><br>The gnome lowers his head for a moment...as he looks up you can see the fire of the den mirrored upon his eyes as it crackles and flares...<br><br>His low voice begins speaking, &quot;It was many moons ago when I first saw her, something, not of this land drew me to her. She was a feisty young elf with a fire in her that could compete with the power of decimation that happened in the Burning Woods. In all my days I had never seen such motivation, such inner strength blazing within her, threatening to consume her whole...<br><br>         She was not like the other Unkempt that I had watched often...She was different, not one to stick in groups, she was the Lone Wolf of the druids....and I felt then, as I do now, that she had something greater in store for her destiny.<br>The gnome relieves a heavy sigh..<br><br>         ...My calling had come to walk to new lands. I left her behind, knowing I would return in the future, when she grew up and would make a name for herself. She did not know me yet, and that was because the time had not yet come. <br><br>         Many years later I returned to the lands of Antonica, I was out wandering the deserts of Southern Ro, a place I was very familiar with.  It was there that I felt a power that I had only felt once before. Peering around the desert I noticed a woodelf, fully grown, her long hair swaying in the desert wind as her large wooden staff beat upon a desert mummy with a bludgeoned force of pure hatred.  I knew this creature would not last long. It crumbled to her feet as I silently approached.<br><br>        &quot;Good Day M'Lady, how do ye fair this eve?&quot; I said with a gracious voice.<br>She looked around, her eyes slanted and watchful. &quot;Down here&quot;, I mentioned.  She looked down upon me, the hatred burning in her eyes.  It was like I was the bug upon her feet that she was ready to squash.  The look made me shiver.  &quot;My name is Shokakon&quot; I told her, &quot;who might you be?&quot;<br>Her nose turned up,  her eyes squinted evilly.  &quot;I am Shizandra MysticWolf, whats it to you?&quot;<br>Tis true, I thought to myself, I had found her again, &quot;Nothing M'lady, I was out wandering the deserts when I saw you, and thought you might like a traveling companion for a little while.&quot;<br>She knelt down to look me in the eye and growled, &quot;I don't need ANYONE!&quot;<br>I quickly retorted &quot;I can SEE that! I just wish to help destroy some creatures with you!&quot;<br>&quot;Come if you like&quot;, she snarled. &quot;But I'll be damned if you expect me to save your small ass.&quot;<br>I nodded in agreement.<br><br>        We began walking the desert, killing various creatures.  We slowly began talking. Just various little things, what she has killed lately, what armor treasure she had won.<br>This was happening for days which turned into weeks, then months.  The two of us were becoming friends, at least in my eyes.<br><br>        One night we sat across from each other, a blazing fire such as this burning inbetween the two of us.  We had never talked about her past but I felt it was time to question it. I had gained her trust, what little she would give, so I knew she would tell me if I questioned it.<br>&quot;Shizandra, I have known you awhile now, I know your hateful and unforgiving ways, how did you come to this?&quot;<br><br>        I could see the anger and sorrow emerge as memories of her past floated to the surface.  She went on telling me about her life and things she had done.  Some parts, even catching my emotions, but not a tear was shed from her eyes.<br>After she told me, she said &quot;I realize after telling you that, you will now leave in utter disgust at the things I have done.&quot;<br><br>        My head hung down, in a whisper, &quot;No, Shizandra, I won't....for I was the same way once, many many moons ago, but I overcame it. I found forgiveness in myself and others.&quot;<br>She piped up quickly, &quot;There is NO forgiveness for what I have DONE! I have....&quot;<br>&quot;No! There is forgiveness in everything if you know the WAY!&quot;  I countered loudly, drowning her to silence.<br><br>        &quot;You must find the path and walk it, tis the only way. Death consumes those that hate, you MUST learn!&quot;  With that I stood quickly, raising my hand, I pointed it to her.  A skull formed, shooting into her chest. She screamed!  I had emparted to her a fear of *herself*, for the first time in her short life.  She collapsed in front of me. Unable to move.<br><br>        I knelt down next to her, &quot;Your path lies ahead, this feeling you are now immersed in is true fear, and this fear will drown your hatred within.  It is now time for you to fight your inner battle.&quot;  With that I took the stein I carried in my hand and knocked her unconscious.  Her body stopped shaking and went limp.<br><br>        I could only imagine what she was going through right now as I once did when this happened to me.  The fear cast upon me while I slept opened up my emotions, without hate, I saw memories past and wept about them.  The people I had killed spoke to me, and in the end, I had learned forgiveness.<br><br>        The next morning she awoke, the large bump on her head was nearly gone from my bandaging.  She sat up, silent for most of the morning. Finally, she began to speak. &quot;WHAT did you do to me? My mind lies in turmoil, my heart shaken... this is NOT what I needed!  I do not know what to do with what is in inside me....&quot;<br><br>        I said, &quot;you have been given your path, I cannot help you walk it, that is up to you now.&quot;  She looked at me, uncertainty still in her eyes, &quot;I...&quot;<br><br>        &quot;I know...&quot; my gaze softened.  &quot;Now is my time to go, I am sure we will meet again in the future and hunt together.  For now, its your journey that must begin,&quot; I said, interrupting her.<br>My hand raised high, I said a few spell incantations and disappeared, leaving her there alone with her thoughts.<br><br>        Through time I have stayed with her, unbeknownst to her, watching her walk the path of redemption, grouping with her now and then. I never talked of our experience until now. I felt the time has come for it to be told.  <br><br>        She has met the one who will help guide her during her journey, she may not see it, but I do. Their chemistry is rare indeed. I remember the day they met like it was yesterday.  A mysterious figure dressed in red, golden hair glistening in the sun.  She was known as Aziev. I had seen her before in my travels, but this time was different.  Shizandra's whole aura changed as this woman strolled up the bank of the lake. The druid's body quivered as her eyes fixed upon Aziev.  In my history, I had never seen such a transformation take place.  Was this Shizandra now standing in front of me? That strong, confident, Unkempt druid I had come to know, rendered helpless and lovestruck by this woman in red?  Introduced to Aziev by the near-bumbling druid, I greeted her and went about my business, keeping the corner of my eye set upon them over near the ridge.<br><br>        Aziev and Shizandra hunted together regularly after that day. I stayed back for the most part to let things happen as they should.  One day Aziev did not show up, I could see the utter defeat in her eyes.  She never spoke of Aziev after that, and I did not make any moves to remind her or discover what happened.<br><br>        Years later we were fighting in Dreadlands when Aziev suddenly appeared, wearing that red gown.  Shizandra froze, eyes fixed upon her.  I nearly fell to my death, my cleric so incapacitated by the wizard's presence, but defeated the creature we were fighting. I turned to see her and I.....well....I shall save such a story for another time....<br><br>        The history is now yours to hold, do what you will with it...I may return one day with more tales that I have witnessed, but for now, this is all that your ears will hear from me.....<br><br>*The gnome stood, stepping back into the shadows and disappeared.  The room...left silent.*<br><br>Shokakon<br>Gnome Necromancer of Tunare <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/ushokakon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shokakon</A> at: 10/5/00 11:13:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uaziev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aziev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/6/00 8:45:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aziev/aziev_red.jpg width=132 height=192></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> New Wolf</span><hr size=1> Shizandra would like to join the Wolves.
