(the end)</span><hr size=1> I shall tell you a story of a Dwarf a Dwarf named Hindolar Crimsonblade.  Some may know him and some may not but be as it may this wonderful paladin of norrath is one big story.<br>
<br>
We begin on a dark gloomy night (not really it just sounded good) 2 guys created a life and a life that will not soon be forgotten. The new life brought into the world of norrath was named Hindolar Crimsonblade.  Young Cimsonblade was born in the caves of kaladim where he was raised to level 1 by his parents who died while in a war with the estate of unrest. Many warriors and paladins died in this war and Hindolar vowed that if anything comes out of life he would avenge his parents deaths and put the undead of norrath at his heels.  Hindolar started by roaming the area of kaladim known as Butcherblock Muntains but soon got tired of the area and adventured into the forest of Greater Faydark.  Here in greater faydark he found numerous things he could hunt.  Hindolar trained here till the age of six then he needed a new challenge and that was about to hit him square in the face.  He stumbled upon the orc city of Crushbone and he made his way in weary of his new surrounding he entered knowing he had to do this for one day he can go into unrest and carry on the legacy of his parents.  Hindolar met many friends here and was intrigued by the number of orcs he can slay.  Hindolar hunted here till the age of thirteen till one day adventuring in butcherblock he found undead as tall as trees.  Hindolar raged in fury as he took down the first and then the second till he cleared the area of undead hindolar felt the spirits of his family entering his skin like wildfire which made him yaulp out in rage as he wanted more so he can get to unrest.  Hindolar killed these tall skeletons till the age of sixteen then had to move on then he noticed a camp of fellow dwarves but they were scowling at him, but why?  So hindolar did the right thing and put them all out of their misery at an early age before they become a threat to kaladim.  Hindolar now twenty had to move on so he went back to Crushbone to take on the highest of royalty their Emperor Crush.  The still young Crimsonblade met ambassador dvinn and Hindolar had to run like a little girl but he was ok.  Hindolar hunted these parts till the age of 29 till he finally got his chance he had been waiting for.  The time to take on unrest was here and hindolar could not wait.  Hindolar made his way down into the train-infested area of people running for their lives.  Hindolar started on and once again felt the rage run through his body as he took down skele after skele dropping them like flies.  Hindolar will avenge their deaths till the age of thirty-nine till they didn’t want him there because he was too old.  So Hindolar had to find a new place to hunt till one day he went with a few friends to a place called lower guk where hindolar is still currently hunting at the age of fifty.  Hindolar is now the age of his parents when they died and he has fulfilled his dream and wishes to prove himself to them and in their honor.  Some day Hindolar will be to old to go on and will retire in a warm cave somewhere with his armor and weapon at side but only to get food and water even some R&amp;R when he needs.  <br>
<br>
To be continued.......................<br>
<br>
The time is now in the life of Hindolar tis the end of the greatone, he retired in his cave with his axe at his side.  Through the life of this dwarf he has seen many things and been many places but the time has come and the old dwarf is tired.  He adopted a boy warrior named Hind and has blessed hind with some tools of war to help him on his training.  Hindolar’s legacy has come to an end but his memories will not be forgotten for hind is the last living proof hindolar ever existed.<br>
