I'm rethinking my role in our motley group.  Up until level 25, I was a reasonable tank-substitute.  This is less true as time goes on.<br>
<br>
When we have a monk, shadowknight and rogue, I'm not sure I should be in there swinging my claws at mobs, especially when we have an enchanter who hastes tanks far more effectively than I.<br>
<br>
The alternative would be that I twist something like this:<br>
<br>
1) 24 str/dex 6ac buff (no brainer with rogue in group)<br>
+<br>
2a) 18% slow -5 ac AE debuff (doesn't break mez) or <br>
2b) 18% slow single target snare<br>
+<br>
3a) 10 hp x3 tick healing (huge taunt factor) or<br>
3b) 19 x3 DoT -13 AC debuff  area effect does break mez<br>
3c) 13 pt bellow <br>
3d) 4 damage shield 3 ac  party buff<br>
<br>
What would we be losing?  My damage.  I dual wield (off weapon is not high damage) but don't double attack.  I suspect my DoT song will do almost as much damage as I do at this point.  Currently, I'm twisting:<br>
<br>
1) 10% haste 17str buff (haste doesn't add to enchanter haste)<br>
2) same as above<br>
3) 10 x 3 DoT -7 AC debuff AE <br>
<br>
I think the primary difference is that big str/dex/ac buff.  It requires an instrument, so pretty much precludes me tanking when I use it.<br>
<br>
What's the verdict?  Is it time for me to stop playing tank and become the blueberry buff/debuff machine?  <br>
<br>
<br>

Seriously.  Either could nicely fit; which would fit better would depend on who else was around.  Last night I was blazing around SK bard style stopping at every armored male with sharp, pointy things saying, 'Hey big boy... wanna come play in Runnyeye?'<br>

The night before that, there were so many tanks in our SK group that my little blueberry behind kept getting wedged between Burroch and this incredibly nice but remarkably burly Barbarian meat shield we met, 'cuz there just wasn't enough room ringside.

I can't really be part of your tests, but I can suggest some things from observation being a bard and from experience listening to tanks complain and overanalyze everything for 51 levels before that.<br>
<br>
Firstly, haste is one of the best things you can do to a tank.  10% doesn't sound like much but among 3 (or 4 if you choose to melee) members of a party, it adds up nicely.  You have a monk and a rogue, 2 classes that base a lot on being able to dish a lot of melee damage in a short time.  Giving them each 10% haste as well as giving the shadowknight 10% (and again, maybe yourself if you melee) is probably equivalent to having another half a warrior in there swinging away.<br>
<br>
AoE = Agro on Everything.  The only times I can see using this is when there are only one or two targets to AoE and no chance of wanderers.  If you get agro stuff starts hitting you, and bashing you, and stunning you.  There's a saying I heard somewhere &quot;a stunned bard is nothing more than a bad tank.&quot;  Maybe I'm just a little paranoid, but the only AoE I have ever used is mez, which was very much worth it.<br>
<br>
That said, I love the 18% slow + snare spell.  Your tanks are hasted to hit at 110% while the creature is only hitting at 82% and furthermore can't run away.  The thing you have to take into account here is that this spell is resisted a ton (same with other slow spell).  On some mobs it sticks most of the time, but other ones it's resisted 50% or more.  Without another person who can slow in my group I consider this to be the one spell that should always be on what we fight, so those resists mean that I can only twist 2 songs and not 3, because I can't count on it taking hold on the first try.  Another reason you want to have it up is that if you start snaring your group generally expects creatures to be snared.  It's a Bad Thing (TM) to have creatures unexpectedly not snared.<br>
<br>
For a tank the best stats/effects he or she can have are as follows in order: regeneration, haste, AC, HPs, everything else.  Hence you know my answer to the third.  Every tick you heal you are decreasing downtime after the fight, and increasing durability during the fight (if the fight lasts only 10 ticks it's as if you've given all your tanks 100 extra hps).  In my experience the regen spell hasn't been too much of a taunt problem.  With an SK and a monk there shouldn't be a huge agro problem, and if it starts to be, just wait a few ticks before you start twisting it, let the tank build up some agro first.<br>
<br>
Having song damage output or buffing/debuffing a little AC cannot nearly make up for the sacrifice of one of these three things IMHO.<br>
<br>
So, special situations aside, I would say the answer is hands down (and supported by several people I asked) to twist slow/snare, regen, and haste, with slow/snare taking highest importance.  If you have an enchanter in the group, he/she can slow and haste better than you, so 1 tick regen, 2 ticks manasong, or perhaps 1 tick snare/slow depending if you need the mobs slowed.  Never underestimate the power of manasong.<br>
<br>
Now as for your question of stepping back and being turbo-buffer, except for special circumstances (like if the tanks are taking a huge beating and you need stringed for aoe mez and regen), I think it is best to get in the fray.  The new melee upgrade means that you supposedly can dish out more than half as melee damage as a warrior your level.  Why twist dots that would have equivalent damage output to your melee when you can just step in and melee and free up that extra song in your twist?  Only one of the songs above improves with an instrument, and that is regen, though you can use the instrument freely during downtime hit point recovery.  The key to remember is something you have already discovered: you are not a tank.  Taking melee damage and dishing it out are two different things.  You can dish it out fairly well, but you can't take it and be effective at twisting/living.  With proper agro control and those 3 other tank classes in there, you shouldn't have too much of a problem of being hit.  In fact my problem lately is that I've been hit too little and my defensive skills are suffering.  <br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
snare/slow, haste, regen<br>
regen, mana, mana with enchanter<br>
tank no<br>
melee yes<br>
<br>

Yonder... thanks for the reply.  I LOVE bard geeking.  I hope my reply starts more.  I realize it's in the worst possible form to ask for suggestions than criticize those you get, but I'm going to do exactly that in the hopes that I learn something.  Feel free to /bonk and correct me.<br>
<br>
First, in a tankish group without an enchanter, I would always always twist in haste.  No brainer.  My musing about what to sing stems from the fact that we've been grouping with an enchanter who is far better at hasting tanks than I am.  Since Anthem and Melodic Binding are voice songs, I would be using weapons and in there swinging away.  I totally agree with your suggestion in the we-have-no-enchanter case.<br>
<br>
But what about when you DO have an enchanter, plus there is a rogue in the group?  Isn't that case just a horse of another color?  With enchanter, Anthem become a cruddy strength buff only.  I can arm my weapons and sing CoB and give a better str buff plus a significant dex buff.  With no cleric, perhaps Hymn as well (taunt, Burroch! taunt), plus the snare song.  Is it so clear that the group isn't better off if I use my tambourine for CoB (giving 8 more, I think, str and dex) and lute for Hymn (almost double, I think, the regen)?  Is my bard-weapon damage better than the additional buffing I can do with instruments?  Please comment.<br>
<br>
Now, here's where I argue with your advice (forgive me, please, I know this is rude but I want to learn.)  Why would I twist in Chorus of Clarity with only a SK + Enc in the group?  If a fight takes one minute, aren't I giving them a mere 6 pulses x 6 mana= 36 mana in the course of a fight?  (Why 6 pulses?  I figure I'm not hitting them every six seconds because I'm doing some other song(s) too... I'm guesstimating.)  Is that even enough for one root?  Wouldn't that slot be better-spent with a str/dex buff or a snare/slow song?  I always just BALK at being asked to sing CoC during combat, because I really really feel I can help the party more by buffing/debuffing/healing than giving a minor mana refresh.  Feel free to correct any incorrect statements.<br>
<br>
Thanks much for the help,<br>

No need to apologize whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Agreed, If you are grouping with an enchanter it's a whole different game.  I always love groups with enchanters and clerics, because I can just play manasong and take a nap =P.  Enchanter debuffs are better than bards.  Enchanter buffs are better than bards.  So enchanter slows, weakens, and pretty much puts the creature out of melee commission, handles crowd control, and hastes your tanks.  So what do you do?<br>
<br>
I should point out a couple of things.  As per the post that was recently bumped to the top of the Drinal Aegis Wolves board where Teir scares us all by telling us melee damage formulas, the extra 13 strength you provide your group by wielding a tambourine as opposed to wielding your weapons, if we are generous, will increase the MAX hit of your tank's weapons by a whopping... brace yourself... 2 damage.  Here's the math:<br>
I'm going to assume a level 27 tank with strength of 135 (probably average at your level for human tank types), maxed out offense and defense skills, and a 10 damage weapon.  Your results may vary.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
LevelBonus = (level -25)/3<br>
(Only applies to lvl 20+. If you are lower than level 20, LevelBonus = 0)<br>
<br>
Main Hand Damage<br>
-------------------------------<br>
MIN Main Hand = 1 + LevelBonus <br>
MODAL Main Hand = 2*WeaponDamage + LevelBonus <br>
MAX Main Hand = ((STR + Weaponskill)/100)*weapondamage + LevelBonus <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Level bonus = 1 (I would suppose they round up)<br>
MIN: has nothing to do with STR<br>
MODAL: has nothing to do with STR (apparently Teir is too good for the word &quot;average&quot; and has to make us think)<br>
MAX: ((125+140)/100)*10  + 1 without strength buff<br>
This totals 27 damage for a maximum hit<br>
MAX: ((138+140)/100)*10 + 1 with strength buff<br>
This totals 29 damage for a maximum hit.<br>
<br>
Now does this extra 2 points of damage once in a while (once every 20 rounds for a max hit?) worth not being in the fray, swinging your weapons for an average of maybe 10 each round?  Heck, if those numbers are right, is it even worth the effort of juggling instruments?<br>
<br>
I can't speak about dex because I don't have any good numbers.  From what I know it increases chance to hit, melee skill increases, and chance to proc.  I'm assuming you guys aren't too proc reliant nor is anyone trying to skill up a melee weapon fast, so the only reason you'd want this for regular tanks is for the increased chance to hit.  Honestly I don't have any numbers on this period.  From observation, though, chance to hit seems to be based a lot more on level relative to the creature and weapon skill rather than dex.  My bard went from having twinked out dex to having twinked out charisma, dropping dex maybe a dozen points and I never noticed a difference.<br>
<br>
Arguably the best thing that song provides is 6ac with tambourine, 3 without.<br>
<br>
I conveniently left out the part about the rogues because I honestly know next to nothing about rogues and how their backstab is calculated.<br>
<br>
You have to budget your enchanter's mana pool, but as far as the snare, our debuffs will stack with enchanters insofar as they are on the creature at the same time; however, the slow percentage doesn't stack so the only reason to use this song is to snare, and the only time you need to snare is for one or two pulses right before a creature dies (when your tanks aren't being hit anyhow).  Whenever I can get someone else to slow for a while it is wonderful because that song is resisted a lot and each resist is one less song you have in effect at any given time.  Depending on the creature, if I'm playing this song I usually can only twist two songs in combat to ensure it doesn't wear off.  Slowing a creature is one of the most important things a group can have, so it kind of stinks that the resisted song is the vital one.  Anyhow that was tangent, bottom line is I would let the enchanter slow if he/she has the mana capacity and use our slow for snaring.<br>
<br>
Now the all important hymn.  We both probably agree that it is a must.  The question is whether to use a lute or not.  The difference at level 27 is 5 points a tick without lute, 9 points with lute.  I'm not sure if sitting/standing makes a difference, but it usually does with regen.  I suppose it really depends on the group.  In a 20 tick fight, it sums to 80 points of healing.  How much are your tanks getting hit?  Can mend or life taps compensate for the lack of healing?  This one probably is a trial and error type thing.  The never ending druidic question of nuke or heal?  On one hand you dish out some damage and the creature dies faster, but on the other you give your party members more health but they get hit longer.  I say it's probably a toss up that could lean slightly in favor of just sitting back, but probably almost unnoticably.  Please test this and let me know what you find.<br>
<br>
There are selfish reasons to want to be in the fray though.  Keeping weapon skills up, and keeping up defense are 2 of them.  Patricio is about 2 levels behind in defensive skills because he doesn't get hit enough.  I can't imagine what it would be like if I sat back through fights for several levels.  Defense increases your AC and thus decreases the amount you need to be healed.  It's nice to get that occasional stray hit that bumps your AC up 4 points.<br>
<br>
As a bard I feel my damage output is pretty good.  To compensate for lack of double attack, I can haste myself and my party.  30% haste is probably as good or better than a warrior with the same weapons and skills who has double attack but no haste (or 10% before 36).  I hit pretty consistently in the upper 20s when I hit.  Helps to have a 110dd proc also.  I proced 4 times in a fight yesterday for full each time.  I ended up doing well over 500 damage that fight.  Granted I average probably 2 procs per fight, which often are partially resisted.  My damage output isn't bad.  Verant claims it should be over half what a warrior can do, which is worth being in the fray in my book.  Again, though, it all depends on the situation.  In your current situation you may need to step back.  Yesterday I was in such a group.  Our main tank was a high elf pally with way less AC than me, we had a shaman, and our healer was a druid.  We managed to end every fight near full mana and full heath because all i did was step back and twist cantata,clarity,clarity.  I say if your group facilitates your meleeing you should go for it.  Provided you aren't inconveniencing anyone else by more than a tick or two of downtime.<br>
<br>
Now, final issue (finally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), manasong.  Probably the single most annoyingly useful effect in the game: a couple points of instant mana infusion.  No duration, thus no icon, thus lots of whining from casters for me to play it when I've been playing it all along.  I was tempted to name myself Patricio I`Malreadyfrickinplayingmanasong.  I spent 51 levels as a druid and I think the power of a couple of points of mana is vastly underestimated by bards and tanks alike.  According to a post on castersrealm, breeze adds 2 points of mana ever 6 seconds or so.  Those numbers may be off but I've heard numerous people say that bard breeze is better than breeze or possibly on par with clarity if played nonstop so I'm inclined to believe that number.  Which means that 2 points of mana you are adding every 3 ticks is like making breeze give 66% more mana.  In one fight it doesn't matter, but in the end it adds up a lot.  It means the enchanter can do more and can go oom less, and have a higher mana level overall.  That 36 mana a fight you cited for a level 27 enchanter is almost a 6 second stun or a melee debuff, and much more than a magic resist debuff of appropriate level.  If one thing has to leave my twist for a tick or two it is usually manasong because it doesn't have that much direct impact on the current fight, but over the long haul I guarantee it works wonders.<br>
<br>
So for this situation, I would personally do regen, mana, mana, skipping a mana for snare when it's time for the creature to start running.  On the weapon issue I'd like to hear some empirical observations and maybe even see some log parsing data if you are feeling especially bard geeky.  I'm quite curious.<br>
<br>
Time to go see if this is the twist i suggested earlier this week... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
First, the dex buff thing.  The beauty of a big dex buff is that the rogue's backstab success is based on it.  The incremental damage may be huge, or may not - Sablefox and I will do some log parsing and get back to you on it.<br>
<br>
Regarding the manasong in fight: I understand what you're saying now, and your point is valid... IF the enchanter's mana is a bottleneck (by bottleneck I mean what made us wait for the next pull... med or health bars?)  In our group it really wasn't.  Our bottleneck was melee health, as we were sans cleric.  With this in mind, I think with an enchanter and a rogue, the best twist might be str/dex buff, hymn and ??.  What should ?? be?  Something that reduces tank wear and tear.  Maybe Psalm of warmth (for the puny damage shield) or Chords of Dissonance (faster mob death).  In this setup, I wonder whether drum-chant, lute-hymn, horn-chords would be best?  Having proposed this, let me say I've not yet tried twisting with THREE instruments.  Two I do happily.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what the correct answer is.  I'm going to rethink the manasong during combat thing.  I'll get back to you on dex buff and rogue damage output =)<br>
<br>
Cheers and keep bard-geeking... if we told Kron to look here we could have quite a bard discussion going!<br>

Anyhow the thing about mana is you can always do something with.  There is always a use for mana.  If tank health was the bottleneck you're already twisting hymn.  And if it is such a bottleneck I'd maybe even agree with you on using the lute.  Heck, gotta get those hand to hand skills up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Mine's in the mid 50's.  Twisting manasong means the enchanter can put a 6 second stun on the creature for every tick out of 3 you twist it.  I imagine a creature out of commission for 12 seconds would reduce damage.  Anyhow, I'm just a firm believer in the power of mana.<br>

If you keep cadence with the &quot;tick&quot; counter, you can twist multiple songs.

<br>
Anyhow, Lyri clearly knows what twisting is.  By my statement, I meant that in a fight for the duration that you suggested, 60 seconds if I remember correctly, for every tick in your twist that you play manasong (ie heal, mana, mana = 2 ticks in 3, or heal, haste, mana = 1 tick in 3) the enchanter will accumulate nearly enough to do a stun.  I'd give the exact numbers, but castersrealm is down for a few days.  Something looks off in those numbers though.<br>
