This is unbelievable news Teir!<br>
<br>
I would have been willing to bet my Raincaller that there was no way Verant would EVER increase the rate at which we gain exp.  To get rid of the hybrid exp penalty along with it..well, I'm almost speechless.<br>
<br>
Almost...<br>
<br>
I guess I'm a little suspicious of their motives.  Why now?  After 2 years and 2 expansions and who knows how many patches.. now..NOW they finally realize that some classes can gain exp more efficiently soloing then they could in a group.  I dont buy it..not for one second.  I wonder if subscriptions went down over the last month....<br>
<br>
And the hybrid penalty...OMG..how many posts were written..how many Hybrids screamed about the unfairness of the penalty.  A penalty for our virsatility they said.  What a crock!  And Abashi said the penalty was something that was never...NEVER going to change.  It was in the code and couldnt be changed.  And virsatility turned out to be absolutely usesless with the mechanics of the high end game.  It started to become noticeable at 40 and down right blatant at 50+.  The term being thrown about lately was efficiency. Peeps complained that Vellios mobs were too tough (hell they said that about Kunark mobs) Verant stuck its foot in its mouth by saying ...yes, mobs are tougher, but that is because we expect groups to become more efficient.  It was the only way they could &quot;challenge&quot; us.  So where did that leave the hybrid?  Out in the cold, thats where.  To be efficient you dont grab half a tank and half a cleric, You grab a tank and a cleric not a Pally.  You need those classes and peeps that are the best at what they do.  So when peeps decided to get some friends, some regular playing buddies, and start over guess which classes didnt get picked?  And these hard core players were flying through levels.  But enough about this dead horse..it was shot, buried and forgotten about...so why now did Verant decide to &quot;fix&quot; it? *shrugs*<br>
<br>
And I suppose before some of you start saying I should just shut up and not complain about a change that is obviously good for everyone, I just want to be clear that I am indeed thrilled about these changes.  However, Verant has been kickin hybrids for the past 2 year..and continually justifying their reasons for doin so. I guess when the kicking finally stops...well sure I'm glad they stopped...but I'm not gonna jump up and give Verant a big hug..sorry..but for 52 levels that really hurt.<br>
<br>
And it does nothing about the efficiency issue.  There is still no reason to include a hybrid in your group.  Yes the reason not to include on has been removed, but we still dont offer a group much in the way of efficiency.  Better grab a Warrior and Druid not a Ranger.  And before you argue..well if you've only got one spot left and already have a Warrior and Druid..then peeps would grab the Ranger, uh uh..doesnt work that way...you grab another Warrior or Druid.  They're more efficient.  <br>
<br>
The hybrid penalty is again a reason NOT to include a Ranger/Pally/SK.  The exp bonus for full groups is a reason TO have 6 people in your group, not necessarily a hybrid though.  There needs to be a compelling reason to add a hybrid to your group.  And until Verant fixes THAT problem, we'll still be at the bottom of the list when it comes to joining groups.<br>
<br>
Finally my theory on motives.  Are subscriptions dropping?  Have they looked at the number of hybrids in game post 50 and seen a skew in the bell curve?  Possibly.  However, pure and simple, I think they're tryin to build PR.  Establish some good feeling amoung the customer base.  They've got other projects in the works afterall.  On that issue..too little too late.  I will not buy another Verant product.  If I can not transfer Foo over to EQ2 I will not be buying that either.<br>
<br>
*sighs*<br>
<br>
I know, I know...looks like I copied this right out of Flameplay.  I probably should have just posted it there. For that I apologize.  I've been bitter about the mechanics for a long time.  But rather than just up and quit I've managed to enjoy this game through the people I meet.  Soon somebody else is gonna come along with a world we can all play in where the mechanics dont suck.  When someone does, I hope we can all meet up there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You've hit the nail right on the head. It's not that subscriptions are dropping (quite the opposite). It's the fact that they have a handful of projects on the near horizon that are nearing completion. If they put on the face that they are willing to listen to their playerbase about fundamental engine design flaws (the proper face to have in my opinion), then hopefully future Verant customers will be easier to acquire. Just a bit of proper PR at this point.<br>
<br>
A little late? Yes, but better late than never.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm not leaving Forin. The fates have conspired to keep me in Norrath and you just can't ignore fate... heh. <p><TABLE>

First of all, thank goodness you are not leaving me Teir.  That would have hurt more than you could imagine.  <br>
<br>
I guess I am just not nasty and suspicious enough.  I am willing to take at face value the fact that Verant finally decided/found a way to make changes.  Maybe in part it is because I don’t see a lot of alternatives on the horizon.  Many of the new games involve a PvP environment, which I just do not see me being comfortable in.  I am reserving judgement on Neverwinter Nights.  While it is full of possibilities I am not sure it gives me what attracts me to EQ – a persistent world full of basically persistent players who I have come to know and care for over the past year and a half.  <br>
<br>
That being said however, I understand what Foodang is saying.  I have only once played a hybrid – my very first character was a paladin on another server.  I played her to 12th level before I came to Tunare.  I can only speak from a cleric’s perspective.  It causes me a great deal of pain to say this but in some respects my beloved husband is right.  Hybrids are not as “efficient” as pure classes in most places.  I can make the case that a druid is not a good replacement for a ranger in the outdoors, but inside a dungeon, they just cannot substitute for a warrior and I would be a fool not to recognize that.  The same is true for paladins and SK’s, although they can at least take a few more hits than a ranger can.  <br>
<br>
I don’t like to think about the fact that the game mechanics have conspired to make Norrath a far happier and more welcoming place for me than for my beloved Foo.  I can go to Karnor for instance, and have a group in 5 minutes.  People who don’t even know me ask me to group with them just because I am a cleric.  By the wee hours of the morning, when the server population is starting to drop, people get desperate for the services of a cleric.  Foodang’s experience in the game is very different.  He can go to Karnor and be lucky if he gets a group inside an hour.  I am sure he can’t remember the last time he got a tell from a stranger asking him to come join their group just because he was a ranger.  Will the changes Verant is making change his experience?  I hope so, but probably not.  In truth, all other things being equal, there is still not much reason to have a preference for grouping with a hybrid.  <br>
<br>
In the real world though, all other things are never equal and we are not all powergamers (thank goodness!).  It is ironic.  I recently left the Aegis Wolves.  I didn’t to it to better my equipment, although that has happened.  I didn’t do it to get my epic, although I hope I will some day.  Although I had many opportunities, I gravitated toward a guild that reminds me very much of the Wolves, even down to the point where it has more than its share of rangers.  I will still insist that a good ranger is better than a bad tank.  And I will always say that grouping with people you care for and respect beats grouping with best tank in the world if she/he is a jerk.  The mechanics suck sometimes.  The people here have come into my life and made it more enjoyable.  <br>
<br>
I am not blind.  The hybrids are still broken in some respects.  Thank goodness, Foo, that you have seen beyond that these last few months to hang around with me – a crazy cleric who groups with rangers and hybrids of all sorts and loves it.    <br>
