Personally I think everyone in guild did a great job.  Everyone seemed to know there rolls and listened and acted appropriatly. <p>Alanerus Razorwind<BR>

However i believe there wer a couple things that confused people.<br>
<br>
1. There was that bard that kept jumping the gun on assists and through battle spam sometimes u cudn't even see the assist message and people saw someone other than MA hitting something so they wud think that the assist was called.<br>
<br>
2. When someone in your group goes LD or even just AFK it is good to wait till the current fight is over and address the raid in the channel that that person is AFK or LD because we might start a fight not knowing that person was gone and might need them but all we see them doing is sitting or standing there which cyd cause major problems, last time we really only had one of each class this time we had at least 2 of each class therefore this wasn't much of a problem.<br>
<br>
3. I think we got a little too hastey with moving in the beginning when we were at pit we were waiting for latecommers but that gave pullers enough time to scout what was WAY up ahead and pull accordingly therefore there were only a few mobs in the next camp area none of us knew where ALL those golems came from but i heard someone say that we shouldve pulled a couple to the previous camp area, this wouldve helped a lot because that camp area was way smaller than the previous one and there was so much going on and so much spell lag where all those golems were it was hard for the mezzers to keep control of the crowd let alone hard as hell for the tanks to see who was getting hit.  theres no way we couldve known all those golems would show up but if we take things a little slower as we go deeper in the hole we will be able to get to the back.<br>

<br>
The only problem with moving slower is that the hole has a very short repop time.  So speed is essential else your dealing with repops.  Where an how all the golems came from is a mystery to me still even after looking at all there spawn points with my hidden rogue.  I could see how we got the first three of em but the rest is still a mystery unless some 3d aggro was happening and brining entire houses down on use.  In which case we should have had elementals and not just golems.  Oh well, next time i've got a pull strategy for that section, hopefully things will go better. <p>Alanerus Razorwind<BR>

<br>
1. All of the mobs were aggroing on other people, especially  the casters, when the monk pulled he had all the aggro on him which was good.. we should have kept te aggro on him till he died, then i guess i would have taken over the tanking, then the SA.. etc... that way only the taks would have died and the casters could hav stayed alive in order to keep the camp<br>
<br>
2. As tword said there were at least 1 or 2 people everytime thatwere attacking the MoB even before i called the engaging command... the next time someone is doing that they shoudl ge 1 warning to stop ( through tells from whomever is leading th raid ) and if he does it again he is gone.<br>
<br>
3. ( the last thing ) i think that each group needs a cleric no matter what. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228251" target="_blank"><BR>Vulturek Falconzek<BR>51st Champion Of Battle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uheisenberguncertainus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heisenberg Uncertainus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Citizen</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/19/02 8:27:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/fexiledgatekeepersfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I agree</span><hr size=1>  I agree we did well but there are a few points i think we could<br>
have improved on.<br>
When we had the golem horde pile down upon us i noticed somthing having just one MA and assisting him is an effective way to deal with the much harder mobs but when you start getting all the adds, even with  the chanters mezzing trying to keep the aggro off the healers and nontankish types is impossible with just  one person doing  so. i saw vult running around with the otherr tanks tryn to keep up tryn to get aggro offa peeps and failing miserably in it but succeding in getting lotsa of excercise /snicker (note this ain't a snipe directed at vult he was doing what he was supposed to do as were the others, I am just tryn to point out that with a single point of aggro containment melee wise  we limit ourselves as too how much damge control we can handle and survive at least in this instant). The fact is all the grps could ezly handle a golem or most of the other mobs down there in singles even with a add  possibley even a third for some of the grps. i suspect if we get more than one or two on a pull it makes sense to split them off second, third, and  fourth grp so we can cut down on  the aggro on the chanters,healers and anyone else that was tryn to keep us alive. at the very least we woulda lasted a bit longer and possibley even had the time to get a few of our peeps camping  so we could reset the raid at that point ezer. now realise this is only directed at situations wherre we can get multiple pulls that grps can handle solo, in other places and situations it makes perfect sense to swamp  mobs with mass grp damge<br>
Secondly you really need to understand your role in the raid, the area where yer raiding, and the mobs that you are facing.<br>
if you dont, bug the peeps (like phalnobor alanerus bakis and sondilla /snicker not me i dunno nothing) with time on their hands with any questions about the area/mob/pathing/your role if they have an answer they will give it to ya or pass you to someone who might<br>
For example golems wont let ya med mosta of  the time depending on how close you are to them even if they have aggro on  MA SA or whomever they always like to take a sec to summon and love tap the fool that nuked healed/smiled or looked in their direction the wrong way which of course makes it hard to contain a situation if anyone needs ter med and has no where to move to do it away from the battle.<br>
 Thirdly lol we need to have some  prior plans in place as when to quit out/camp out(impossible if you are on a golems hate list by the way )/evac out and  who goes first in what order and finally who calls and what order of raid leaders. That way no matter the situation or how many leaders or secondraid leaders are dead someone down the line can look at the  situation and call it in a timely manner.<br>
 I see two better situations that could have happened on the raid realistically with better planning and organisation, one we ended up clearing the golems with half the raid dead. or two most of our peeps (prolly quitting out)camping out and surviving  according to a planned order going to an alt joining the raid chat  camping back in  5  or so minutes after the last online guildies dropped   and ressing the tanks. either way we would be looking at a minimal recover time and probably be on our way continueing into the deep of the hole without too much down time.<br>
and Finally make a separate chat window with the newui send your egraid chat to it only and you dont have to worry about spam <br>
I think we all did well down there we just need to have a bit more prior planning organisation and communication when we do these. Of course there is only one way to do that /grin more raids and more guild conversation like this.<br>
Anyways i had fun most of the time lol feel free to correct offer  constructive critiques and all that to me post as long as i don't see any useless %^$^%$#&amp;$#$#&amp; CAPS, FlAmInG, lamearse useless adjectives. cya all on the eqside /grin<br>
<br>
 dammit i just realised i had somthin else to say thanx to all the guildies and lateniter crew (you know who you are ) for helping me with me 39thlevel spell quest i got all thhe hard pieces now  and if there are certain concepts you dont understand about raiding please ask only way to find out.<br>

Those golems where a messed up pull, I believe one ran around and grabbed others, I saw after the first two 4 or 5 more come running about 30sec later than the others.  I scouted the area during the CR and the next few area's didn't even have all teh golems that I counted.  Basically it was just a bad pull, the monk who was pulling even apoligized and said he has never seen anything like it.  We did well, and I was pretty happy with where we got, especially considering that this was an impromptu raid.  Plus we had about 18 EG there, that is what really impressed me, and the last thing.  Vult is right, and the only person I saw really jumping the gun was not guildies, so if we keep that type of discipline, we will be doing much better than we anticipated.  <br>

I.E. the separate chat window being used for the raid channel only. i have never used this option yet and didn't see its advantage until heis mentioned it to use in guild raid. that would leave all the other stuff on regular chat screen and the very important and crucial communication on another bubble and would improve teamwork alot i belive. i know it would make it easier to see the info i need to see to make the right move without getting confused by someone not paying attention or just plain doing their own thing. <br>
