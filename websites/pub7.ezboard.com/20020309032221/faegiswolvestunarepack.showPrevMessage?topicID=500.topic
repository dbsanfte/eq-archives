I will be the first to tell you honestly that my membership with the Aegis Wolves has been a very rewarding one. I have really enjoyed my time with our guild. I joined when there were only a couple members and I have watched many Wolves come and go. Our guild I believe, has been one of the best member wise that you could possibly wish for, or be lucky enough to be a member of. But the time has come in Molotov's existence, that will come to each and everyone of you that reach the mid 50's and upper levels. Most of the time when people leave the Wolves they have real reasons that they speak of for leaving. However, many times there is one additional major reason they are leaving that they just skip speaking of. This reason I am going to speak of now, because I believe everyone needs to think about it and be aware of it. The Aegis Wolves is a great guild for lower to mid level players. But when you reach the high levels (51+) you will quickly learn that it will be very difficult or impossible to achieve the top level for your character much less the top level quests for your character and still remain in the Aegis Wolves guild. This is the reason I am resigning from the guild. And this is also the reason I am sad to go, because I do not want to leave this guild. I am really being forced to go. If I realistically want to get a chance for an invite to any of the major plane runs or be able to get enough people together to achieve any of my high level quests I am forced to join one of the large uber guilds that have members all above 50. This is what really disappoints me about everquest, there are certain design flaws in the game that force you to play a certain way if you want to reach level 60 and complete the top quests for you character. I would hope that the Wolves that have been here the longest have noticed that it seems always the same effect, once a member goes above level 51 they eventually have to resign and go to one of the uber guilds, it is just the way it is. So with these facts of game life as I see them I will tender my resignation as an officer and member of the Wolves. I consider myself always an Aegis Wolf, and I will gladly greet you any and every time I see any of you in game. But for now I will have to join up with one of the uber houses so I can push my character up to 60. I will continue to read the Wolves forums and try to keep up with current events with the Wolves and I would be honored to be invited to attend any hunts that you have scheduled, like I said I consider myself always an Aegis Wolf, but now I am going to be a Retired Aegis Wolf. You might want to consider a special membership category like &quot;Retired Uber Wolf&quot;, so that when wolves have to leave for this particular reason they can still keep an association and maybe one day return and be a wolf again remember anything is possible in everyquest. So I bid all Wolves wherever you roam, Good luck! And Good hunting! AAAAAAWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><br>On a side note I am moving to another state so I will be offline for as much as 2 weeks at the end of this month, but I am not quitting the game. So if you do not see Molotov for awhile I will be back online regularly again about the 2nd week of May and you can reach me then for any events you might need my help with. Larou and I are the same level and the same situation applies to her, and I am sure I can speak for Larou that we both would be happy to make special appearances to help out in any guild events that we would be invited too.<br><br>So for now I bid all Wolves a fond farewell, until next time I see you!<br><br>Molotov ShadowStorm<br>Aegis Wolves Elder (Retired)<br>52nd season Reaver (SK) <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uyonderwendobrayxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yonder Wendobrayxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/11/01 1:25:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=505.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The time has come, I raise my paw to you all.</span><hr size=1> I think that's the reason for 90% of the wolves who have left.  It's rarely that the person doesn't like the people in guild, and rarely that the guild doesn't like the person leaving.  Ever so rarely people leave in spite and anger.  Seems like almost everyone leaves with a tear and leaves the hope that he or she may someday return.<br><br>It always makes me feel like a bad and selfish person for leaving.  I always had a slight proclivity towards that attitude when people were leaving as I was in my 20s.  In the end, there are no clear answers... maybe you guys will see, I hope that most of you won't.  I made the mistake of leveling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/usong01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Song01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/11/01 11:24:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=505.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/Scatman9792?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The time has come, I raise my paw to you all.</span><hr size=1> hehe dont know why im reading this post, but what you say is not true. You dont need Uber guilds to Achieve things in EQ. It makes it harder when your not in one but its still possible. My guild is not huge, yet i have Achieved many things. <br>If you do happen to leave dont turn your backs on those you once called friends, like im sure so many do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showPrevMessage?topicID=505.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showNextMessage?topicID=505.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=505.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/buttons/addreplybtn2.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.emailToFriend?topicID=505.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.threadControl?topicID=505.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=505.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=505.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub7.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="aegiswolvesthewolvesden">The Wolves Den<option value="aegiswolvesfrm11">New Worlds<option value="aegiswolvesfrm13">Track Scents<option value="aegiswolvestunarepack">Wolves Den - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm25">Pack Call<option value="aegiswolvesfrm4">Elders Hall - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm6">The Market - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm12">The Howl<option value="aegiswolvesfrm14">Hunting Packs<option value="aegiswolvesfrm19">Cubs - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm22">Scent Markers<option value="aegiswolvesfrm24">Howls of Glory<option value="aegiswolvesfrm15">Wolves Den - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm16">Elders Hall - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm17">The Market - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm20">Cubs - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm21">Wolf Tails</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/baegiswolves>Aegis Wolves</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack>Wolves Den - Tunare</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
