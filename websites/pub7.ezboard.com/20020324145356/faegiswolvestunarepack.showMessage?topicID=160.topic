While he cursed his human eyes for their poor night vision abilities, Foodang had no worries about becoming lost in the rolling lands of his home. What did trouble him was time. He needed to get to Surefall quickly. Both his strength and his mana were dangerously depleted. Still the need was urgent. &quot;I can rest when I'm dead,&quot; he decided, half serious, half in humor.<br>
<br>
Foodang closed his eyes and concentrated. Suddenly, the air was alive with the crackle of magical energies. A kaleidoscope of colors and lights surrounded him. When they finally dissipated, Foodang was gone! In his place was a large gray wolf.<br>
<br>
With the transformation, most of his exhaustion seemed to disappear. Night vision was no longer a concern with the senses of a wolf. Foodang took a moment to adjust to the barrage of smells and odors that had become a hundred times more acute. The world was so much more alive, more real when he took the form of the wolf. &quot;Would that my Brothers and Sisters could all experience Norath in the form of our<br>
namesake,&quot; he wished. Then, remembering time was precious, he broke into an easy lope northward, paralleling the mountains, avoiding the more traveled paths leading to Surefall.<br>
<br>
He followed the mountain wall until he came upon the entrance to Black Burrow. Once again not wanting to become involved in any unnecessary confrontations, he skirted around the cave entrance. Less than a league from Surefall now, the mountains turned him westward. He began his ascent of a steep hill, atop of which lay an ancient ruins. The knowledge and history of this place had long ago been lost. Not even the Druids of Surefall possessed records of what once existed here. It was theorized, however, that this was a place of Evil, for the dead sometimes walked among these abandoned and decaying structures.<br>
<br>
As Foodang padded through the fallen stones and broken pillars he suddenly picked up a scent. Ogre! Nunzio! One of the Disciples. And if he is here it could mean only one thing. His mistress was not far away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhh...Foodang! I like you in this form&quot; a mocking voice spoke off to his right. &quot;Come! Lay by my feet, dog!&quot; <br>
<br>
It was the priestess Maluna. She sat upon a fallen pillar 10 meters away. She lounged casually, as if awaiting the arrival of a dear friend.  Foodang stared into piercing<br>
blue eyes, eyes that at one time held him in complete submission.<br>
<br>
Foodang moved a few paces closer, sniffing the air to determine if any other threats were near by. Satisfied that it was only the two Disciples that confronted him, Foodang's image shifted and bent as he reverted back to his human form. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see I will have to teach you the difference between wolf and dog, Maluna!&quot; He spat, &quot;And wolves do not make good pets&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall see, Foodang&quot; She said as a corner of her mouth twisted into a cruel half smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides, isn't one pet enough for you...Nunzio... come out and grovel at your mistress' feet. She seems to need the attention.&quot; His eyes never left hers, and he caught the quick flash of anger in them before the mocking smile returned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come out and say hello, Nunzio,&quot; she ordered.<br>
<br>
A shadow emerged from behind one of the crumbling walls. An immense shadow, as if the hill itself moved towards him. &quot;Maluna-Lady say I get bash you this time Human!&quot; his deep voice rumbled. Nunzio moved himself protectively in front of his mistress, shielding her with his bulk. While the act was meant to protect his Lady, it also served to shield Foodang from what ever deadly spells Maluna could cast against him as well.<br>
<br>
&quot; I really wish we had more time to chat Foo, but it seems I require your soul for a certain ritual,&quot; she said, her voice a trifle thoughtful, perhaps a little sad. &quot;So, I suppose it's time for goodbyes... Foodang, you were a... pleasure,&quot; she said in a seductive voice, obviously  remembering past passions between them.<br>
<br>
Foodang backed away from Nunzio's advance, making sure to keep the great ogre between Maluna and himself. &quot;If I can just get off one spell,&quot; he thought. Foodang retreated a few more steps, until he judged that Nunzio had moved far enough from Maluna. &quot;A few more steps,&quot; he prayed. Nunzio gave Foodang an evil toothy grin. Hefting his war club the Ogre took another step. Foodang let loose his final spell.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the Earth erupted around the Ogre's feet. Thick roots covered in sharp thorns entwined Nunzio's legs, immobilizing him. As the spell completed, the roots constricted, thorns piercing armor and flesh. The ogre bellowed in pain, &quot;Maluna! Me stuck! It hurts,&quot; the ogre wailed.<br>
<br>
Foodang did not hesitate. He charged Nunzio, drawing his bow as he ran. The giant warrior stopped trying to free himself as he looked up and saw Foodang racing towards him. He raised his club to strike the Ranger, but at the last instant Foodang dove past the rooted ogre, and Nunzio's swing passed harmlessly over him.<br>
<br>
Foodang rolled to his feet arrow knocked to bow and sighted on the priestess. He could see that he was already too late as Maluna completed her spell. He released his arrow anyway hoping he could buy himself some time, but his shot was off the mark.  His silver tipped arrow only managing to graze Maluna's arm. Maluna grasped her wounded arm and hissed in anger and pain.<br>
<br>
Foodang was frozen in anticipation waiting for whatever spell the cleric had unleashed to strike him. It was then that the war club smashed under his raised arm into his exposed ribs. The blow knocked him off his feet and sent his bow flying from his grasp. Foodang rolled over to see the freed Ogre again advancing on him. &quot;Fool! Her spell<br>
wasn't meant for me...she freed Nunzio!&quot; His heart raced in terror. The Ogre's blow had shattered ribs, he could feel bones piercing his lung.<br>
<br>
&quot;You hurt the Lady, I barsh you now, liddle man!&quot; Nunzio growled.<br>
<br>
Gritting his teeth in agony Foodang staggered to his feet. He drew his sword to defend himself from the enraged Nunzio... and was blasted from his feet by the unholy wrath unleashed by the evil priestess. Blood gushed from his nose and mouth. Every gasped breath was whitehot agony. <br>
<br>
He looked up into the black eyes of the sneering Nunzio. &quot;I have failed. Tallie...find me...&quot; These were his last thoughts as the Nunzio's club descended. Then darkness... cold darkness that rose up to swallow him...<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Eenymeeny awoke with a gasping start. Disorientation engulfed her as she quickly sat up and surveyed her surroundings, running shaking hands along her limbs to verify the truth. &quot;I am alive again... in the flesh.&quot;<br>
Suddenly her words came back to haunt her: &quot;We can not both physically exist in the land at the same time...while you live my spirit can not return to my physical being.&quot;<br>
<br>
The horror of this knowledge struck her like a blow.<br>
<br>
Foodang was dead! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showPrevMessage?topicID=160.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showNextMessage?topicID=160.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=160.topic><img src=http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/buttons/addreplybtn2.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.emailToFriend?topicID=160.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.threadControl?topicID=160.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=160.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=160.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub7.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="aegiswolvesthewolvesden">The Wolves Den<option value="aegiswolvesfrm11">New Worlds<option value="aegiswolvesfrm13">Track Scents<option value="aegiswolvestunarepack">Wolves Den - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm25">Pack Call<option value="aegiswolvesfrm4">Elders Hall - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm6">The Market - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm12">The Howl<option value="aegiswolvesfrm14">Hunting Packs<option value="aegiswolvesfrm19">Cubs - Tunare<option value="aegiswolvesfrm22">Scent Markers<option value="aegiswolvesfrm24">Howls of Glory<option value="aegiswolvesfrm15">Wolves Den - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm16">Elders Hall - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm17">The Market - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm20">Cubs - Drinal<option value="aegiswolvesfrm21">Wolf Tails</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/baegiswolves>Aegis Wolves</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack>Wolves Den - Tunare</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
