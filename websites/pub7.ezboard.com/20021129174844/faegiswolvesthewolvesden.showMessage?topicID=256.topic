I was makeing $3000.00 a month selling eq stuff before ebay started to remove stuff. It was great ;p&lt;p&gt;anyway, ebay is gone but a replacement might alright be here. Its a bit of a downgrade from ebay but it might be the only hope for everquest auctions.&lt;p&gt;Its a message board here is the address, check it out <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/beverquestauctionhouse">http://pub54.ezboard.com/beverquestauctionhouse</a>. Anyway, I think it was a rude mistake to take down ebay auctions for eq. They should have let the public vote on it. If anyone is haveing truble posting stuff on ebay go there and post it there.&lt;p&gt;Keep EverQuest Alive! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uyonderwendobrayxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yonder Wendobrayxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/22/01 9:30:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvesthewolvesden.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/yonderwolf/yonder.jpg width=162 height=271></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /flame E-Bay</span><hr size=1> Alright far be it for me to flame anyone, but here goes my opinion of E-Bay<br>
<br>
First, those that really want to find a way of doing it will do it, so it frankly annoys me that people seek to publicize what is essentially an underground activity that is frowned upon, especially to a guild like this where it seems like the last thing on our minds is having an uber-charcter with the phattest of lewtz.<br>
<br>
Second, take it to GFay.  I should not have to pay actual cash for the items that I want.  I pay $10 a month, that is enough as it is.  E-Bayers defend it as &quot;trying to make money back on their time and money investment in EverQuest&quot;  Essentially what this means is they are trying to make us pay more to play this game both money and timewise.  Want an FBSS?  Fine, pay $150 and you can have one.  Don't want to pay for an FBSS?  Fine, wait in line behind the 10 item farmers that want to make other people pay real cash for one.  Either way it results in more camp time in a game already dubbed &quot;EverCamp&quot; or more money spent because we can't afford to camp our lives away like some.<br>
<br>
Third, selling characters sickens me.  A level 50 character is not the same thing as a level 1 character.  It is about 40 days of hard work, an inventory full of hard earned items that reflect time spent in various difficult situations, a reputation with players in game, and a whole lot of time getting to know what it means to play your class.  For example, I had the, um, pleasure of grouping with a level 42ish druid who was playing on a friend's account.  Her own player was a level 30ish cleric.  The two classes are similar enough, right?  Level 30 and 40 aren't that different, right?  This girl (who for some reason had no pants) managed to snare mobs that were already snared, overwrite all my buffs, try to sow us all indoors, wolf form us indoors, was a totally incompetant healer, and at one point took us from our camp spot deep in Solusek B to butcherblock mountains via a druid teleport (thankfully none of the shadowknights in the group were kos) with the words &quot;hehe&quot;.  The deaths that could have resulted translated to many player-hours of work.  This game is serious.  Death is not something that can be easily shrugged off.  It's why people pay 100pp (a full dollar or so on E-Bay =P) for a rez.  I don't want to go on my first fear raid and find out the cleric next to me knows only how to play a wizard up to level 40, let alone that that person knows nothing about EverQuest.  Yes, I have seen a level 40+ player in SK ask the loc of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Fourth, like it or not, this is against the EULA we all agree to every time we log in.<br>
<br>
Fifth, E-Bay is *not* keeping EverQuest alive.  It is giving incentive for the high-level gamers to sell out and get their few hundred bucks back, incentive for mid-levelers to quit because every item they could ever hope for is farmed out, and for the low levelers to become obnoxious twinks or worse.<br>
<br>
Okay, I want a nap before class, so I'm not going to continue, but let me just say: take this elsewhere please.  I don't know of anyone in this guild who cares in the slightest about E-Bay.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
