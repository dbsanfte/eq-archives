<br>
Raids are one of the ultimate expressions of pack unity. Nothing is more exhilarating than running over the hills, across the plains or down a musty dungeon corridor with packmates.<br>
<br>
However, even this exciting moment can be shattered by poor planning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I always enjoyed leading raids in Ultima Online and Meridian 59. I've only led small, one group raids in EQ, but I've taken some time to study the aspect of the raid in EQ. Strangely enough, many of the suggestions made by experienced raid leaders hold true through out many online games. <br>
<br>
Here are some suggested guidelines for setting up a pack hunt:<br>
<br>
- Choose a hunting ground you are familiar with. The raid leader should know the raid area like the back of their hand. They should be familiar with the types of creatures<br>
present and their attack capabilities.<br>
<br>
- Clearly define the goals of the raid before embarking on the raid. One of the goals to consider is whether this is an experience making raid. Another is item acquisition.<br>
<br>
- Carefully consider the levels of participants. Even with a healer in their assigned group, it is inappropriate for a lvl 25 spellcaster to go into a situation where they would be facing lvl 35  mobs. <br>
<br>
- Carefully consider the makeup of groups in a raid. Is there an evac capable person in each group? Is there a healer in each group? A tank or other fighter capable of taunting a mob in each group? Don't be afraid to call off the raid if there is not a sufficient number of raiders to fill the jobs.<br>
<br>
- Designate authorized pullers after groups have been formed.<br>
<br>
- Designate one leader per group that reports problems and situations to the raid leader. <br>
<br>
- Plan for contingencies. What happens when player x goes linkdead? The objective is already camped, now what? Uber mob x spawns and threatens to wipe out the entire raiding party, what do you do? The raiding party is trained with everything from the dungeon, what's the command? Keep running scenarios through your mind and have a plan for what you would do for each.<br>
<br>
- Have a plan for post raid extraction. Teleporting out? Fighting back the way you came?<br>
<br>
- Have a plan for the worse case scenario... complete raiding party wipe out. Who will be retrieving the corpses? Who will be performing resurrections? Where is a safe location to drag corpses to should the dead player not be online anymore?<br>
<br>
- Designate a second in command for the raid. This person should also be familiar with the goals and location of the raid. If the leader is knocked out of action (linkdead), then it is this person's responsibility to assume leadership of the raid until the raid leader returns.<br>
<br>
- Post raid analysis. Were the objectives of the raid met? Did anyone die? If so, why? Was corpse recovery performed in a timely manner? Did everyone have fun?<br>
<br>
There are a number of other things that make for a successful raid, but these are the basics.<br>
<br>
I propose that from here on out, every raid is prefaced with a detailed plan here on the message boards. Location (both gathering and raid), time, objective(s), level requirements, class requirements. Include a link to an online map of the raid location so that participants can become more familiar with the raid location. Talk about mobs that will be encountered and what their methods of attack could be.<br>
<br>
As always, comment and suggestions are welcome <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Leading a raid is a very demanding task, one I hope to grow into someday. <br>
<br>
Let me empasize that a healer is no guarantee of safety if a group if fighting MOB's of inappropriate level.  Second, if resources fall short, abort the raid.  There is no other viable option.<br>
<br>
Third, a plan for CR's is a necessity.  Dying is a way of life in Norrath.  One of the key deciding factors in whether or not I will go an even a small one group raid is my degree of confidence that if the world goes to you know what, the CR's will get taken care of. <br>
<br>
Much as we want the guild to do things together, not every raid will be appropriate for every level.  Hopefully we can find some activities all can participate in, as well as provide good opportunites for some level-appropriate hunting.<br>

Specifically, was it the Lguk raid you did not like, if that is it then say so. If there were parts of a raid you have a problem with say specifically what problems happened so that everyone can clearly see where you believe the flaws were at, and then there can be a dialog to see if you are actually justified in your criticism. It is such an easy task after an event is done to point out the difficulties and errors in a general way.<br>
<br>
In all your example's you make the leader of a particular event solely responsible for the total outcome of said event from start to finish, but you leave out the important fact that there is more than just a leader on a raid. All participants in a raid have a huge effect on the outcome (from the very start of meeting up, to the very end of everyone leaving). If the group or groups dont stick to the plan then anything can happen no matter what the leader is trying to do. In your message, you make it sound that every moment of the raid was a problem and how can that be so. <br>
<br>
I have some issues with the event on Friday night and post event analysis to provide, but this is the first moment I have had to sit down and type it up so here it is.<br>
<br>
1) First and foremost, I would like to thank all the wolves that attended this event, we had a very challenging and lengthy camp, 12 or so wolves were the total count of participants. Overall, it was a good event and good exp was had by all, but at the very end some 5 hours later, when the group dwindled down to about 7 or so we had a night mare problem that occurred. At the very end the ones who stayed for the long haul ended up hauling out their corpses in a most painful corpse retrieval.<br>
<br>
2) The meet, well we started-off on time but very few would meet in Freeport (which was in the event instructions) for a common tele, so we had to change the meeting spot on the fly and meet up at the druid ring near guk. Just meeting at guk would have worked but there was a chance that we would not go to guk first so a common meeting point was the original idea. So with a little delay we all ended up outside guk. So far the event at this point is going well and the meeting delay is normal for this number of participants.<br>
<br>
3) I asked if there were items in guk that anyone wanted, and a few items were asked for and we made arrangements to look for the items. At this point event still going fine.<br>
<br>
4) Foodang lead the group down to Lguk and to the jail room, Foodang was most familur with layout of guk so he was tasked with leading us near our first camp which was the Froglok noble. It was a little difficult keeping the group together because sometimes participants went wandering around on there own and did not stick together. Eventually we made it to the jail room with all 12. We held this position easily with this number and all was well. We pulled as much as the group wanted and the mid levels (30 ish level) group were getting great exp from all the reds they were getting the kills for. And the upper group was getting plenty of blue stuff. All was well here at this point too.<br>
<br>
5) People start to leave.... now this is understandable when you dig into a camp (several hours) that starts to drag out while you wait for a particular mob to spawn. Now we need to keep in mind we are not on a plane run but camping lower guk. At this point our group went from 12 or so wolves (6 mid level and 6 high level) to 6 or 7  and of that number only a couple high level. This is where the situation starts to easily go beyond any leaders ability to control. You cannot force the evacers or res'ers or high level peeps to stay, if they want to go they are free to go. So you ask the hard core if they want to stay and if they all say yes then you stay, and I will remind everyone that all wanted to stay even though everyone knew it was very risky to stay.<br>
<br>
6) I asked the wolves that are left if they wanted to stay and continue to camp the jail, and the answer is yes, nobody was forced to stay but all wanted to stay because the exp was great and the camp was still going smothly. So we continue to camp jail with out any problem, we pull a steady stream of high level mobs and all goes well until a bad decision was made and more than one person started pulling.<br>
<br>
7) One moment everything was great….. and in a flash suddenly I realize one of the group had gone off wandering around alone, I franticly tell them not to do this, but in seconds they got jumped by mobs and quickly are being killed as they run back to us with the mobs in tow. When pulling to a camp you balance the power of the group against the speed/threat of the pulls and you factor in adds and all goes well. But when someone goes off and runs around a dangerous place, and brings a train back near the group, well things begin to happen fast. And of course its so late in the evening we do not have the luxury of evacer. And even if we did have evac everyone kept fighting because we had a chance to win, or so all thought because some did not know we had lost one to the train and in a small group losing one can and did lead to losing all.<br>
<br>
8) So we all die, and die and die, die die die!!!!!!! At this late hour (3ish AM cst) deep in guk there are not many there still and only one cleric I could find and the cleric did not want to help at all (. So we spent almost 2 hours trying to get 49 res's and get out of guk. And so for the ones that stayed till the bitter end I can understand them not liking that part.<br>
<br>
I was the leader of that event and yes I am disappointed that in the end it got very tough and went sour (and a specific reason why it went sour), but that is no reason to make like the whole event was a waste. The event lasted a long time and the first mob we were camping for never showed and that was just bad luck. The wolves that were left at the end wanted to be there and knew what it was like and could have left at any time. If everyone will go back and read my post I was very clear on exactly what this event was about and who should go. Of the ones that stayed till the end I would like to thank all who helped get everyone to a zone or the corpse to the zone.<br>
<br>
With all that said, the event went ok but could have been improved easily and next time it will go smother. <br>
<br>
And yes I am planning another event and this one will be a different style and more focused on one or two goals and can be completed in 3 hours or less. I will try to avoid the pitfalls of this last one but anyone that has been on dangerous raids know the risks, sometimes its glory and you will be praised and other times it will not be so good and you will be criticized but hind sight is always 20/20.<br>
<br>
I don’t want anyone that is considering starting an event but will not because they are afraid it will not go well and they might get post event criticism to just not plan one, you got to get out there and play the game, take the risks and hope for glory.<br>
<br>
Again I would like to thank all who showed up and hope you will show up on the next one as well, I had many tells from wolves that they enjoyed themselves greatly even at the bitter end. <br>
<br>
P.S. just a little hint on the next event, it will be in the next couple of weeks and will involve killing one level 54 zombie with high hit points. Spawn time fast, and kill time fast if we can get the same number of participants. More information to come.<br>

I want to thank everyone for joining this &quot;Glorious&quot; guild event.  One that will be discussed good and bad for months to come.  I have not witnessed a turnout like this in months.  Even mysef, being a ShadowKnight, felt good about the event.  Until the end of course.<br>
<br>
Trial and error is a part of these guild events.  What works, what doesn't work, and WHEN IS IT TIME TO LEAVE?<br>
<br>
I enjoyed helping the 20's and 30's kill high level mobs and give them a chance to see what LGuk is like.  Note that this is an Adventure game and it was just that.  It was an adventure game until 6 or 7CST Saturday morning when we finally all got out and passed out.  Good or bad, we now know the power of 2 or 3 Wolf Packs in a dungoen.  We came in force and conqured (for 3 hourse that is).  I wouldn't ask the less seasoned Guild Members to attend an event that would lead to eventual death.  The mobs were reasonable and the adventure was all around us.<br>
<br>
I would especially like to thank the people that stayed on much longer than most for help with corpse retrieval and ressurections.  I did my best to get +49 resses and I think everyone that stuck around got one, maybe more than one :).<br>
<br>
Please don't be afraid to request a guild event.  I don't believe that all the planning that Teir is suggesting is required.  What is required is a strong presence and cooperation.  I we need to plan all the aspects of a raid, than maybe we need to assign someone to be a Project/Guild Event manager.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

It was not prompted by your raid. I can understand that the timing of the post can lead one to believe that it was specifically meant to be a general critque of Mol's raid, but that just isn't the case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This is also not meant to be a concrete policy for raid creation. Hence the line &quot;suggested guidelines.&quot; <br>
<br>
However, if Mol would like a comparison of the proposed guidelines with his raid, here's my take on it:<br>
<br>
1 ) The raid leader was unfamiliar with the hunting area.<br>
<br>
2 ) The raid goal was clearly defined. Everyone who entered Guk knew they were heading to the Noble.<br>
<br>
3 ) Lower Guk is a dangerous place for even a group of level 50s. Perhaps a level cut off of 35 would have been warranted.<br>
<br>
4 ) Group composition was pretty good. One of the challenges of a raid that spreads across multiple levels is creating groups of like level people that can adequately service the group and still get experience.<br>
<br>
5 ) Designating authorized pullers may very well have prevented the train that ended the raid.<br>
<br>
6 ) Someone didn't give the all important &quot;Evac, evac, evac!&quot; when it was seen that the train was more than the raiding party could handle. This would have at least gotten out the lower level folks.<br>
<br>
7 ) There was no planning for the worst case scenario of complete party wipe out resulting in a five hour corpse recovery. Why it was decided that resurections should have taken place in an openly hostile area rather than a controlable zone line *shrug*<br>
<br>
8 ) Post raid analysis... what we're doing now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Other than the hideous corpse recovery, I think the raid went rather well.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank Molotov for his raid. I would also like to thank Foodang, Larou and Ashrai for help with the final corpse recovery of Yonder, Kronenburg, Myrgrath, myself and themselves for the evening (or mid-morning as the case turned out to be)<br>
<br>
It saddens me that some folks have gone on the personal defensive after I made this post. My posting history and interactions with others would lead me to think folks would have seen this for what it really was... a general discussion about raid planning and implementation.<br>

You can imagine how indignant I felt after reading it, sorry if I misunderstood your message Teir.<br>
<br>
This is a very good example why we should all take care when making posts, you should always keep in mind the readers of your message and the context and timing of the message you are trying to communicate. But to be sure, specify what you are referring to so poor ol Molotov wont get his collar in a wad and not feel appreciated for the effort <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Everyone's fur (including mine) should now be neatly back in place and I can reflect on the Guk raid a little more.<br>
<br>
What really irritated me about the raid was not really the train and the death at the end, I cant count the number of times I have been in groups where we got wacked at the last moment of a raid and then had to do CR. But the CR on this particular raid was a real pain. I had planned on CR in the event of death but after we had been there for so long (much longer than planned) and many had left, the makeup of the group was seriously changed. It would have been a safe thing to just leave but I am sure everyone knows the tunnel vision (no pun intended) a group can get after its been camping a spot for many hours. There was only one cleric in the zone at 4 or 5 am and this cleric would have us pull all the corpses to a particular room then by the time we got there he had moved and wanted us to pull them to yet another and then again to yet another. This was really infuriating us because we would have to pull the corpses through mobs and we keep getting killed pulling corpses around. This went on for what seemed like hours, and finally the cleric just split on us and left us high and dry. I felt a collective sigh of relief from everyone when all the corpses where either resed or sitting at a safe zone at this point it seemed like 6 am. <br>
<br>
So this raid was good, but had a tough end that could have been avoided, but at 4 am its very easy to loose your focus and make mistakes. Either way I am going to sponsor another raid like I said and this one will be a very focused raid on one particular mob that is never camped easy to get to and very tough to kill. More to come……<br>

<br>
But It sounds to me like it was a blast.  But then I like unexpected bumps it's the boring monotony of camping that kills me.  Of course thought the longest corpse recovery I was on was 2 hours in OOT.  <br>
<br>
Just some two cents about planning though<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Larou here a few things need to be there but niccolo macheiavelli(sp) is not needed.<br>
<br>
1) &quot;The possible risks&quot; known should be put out(not things like group death, Members go LD or trains, we're EQ players thats part of life). Thinks like level of zone, Quality of zone players, Evac or rez possible, level caps or familiarity with the area.  From these basic things a player should be able to determine if they want to go.<br>
<br>
2) &quot;Objective and basic plan&quot;.  Kill Mob, Meet here at time then go to here to kill it.  Yes this basic.<br>
<br>
3) &quot;back up or fall back spot&quot;.  This does not mean evac or rezzer those are nice when there avialible but be adaptable have a basic fall back point if &quot;fall back&quot; is yelled run to X zone or X safe place to die, again simple. Make sure every one knows the way.  But as larou says it's an adventure game were here for risks.  But keep in mind where a big guild if some one where really stuck They have 8hrs to one week if off line we can arrange for something.  Also the guild does have back up mules for the worst case scenario, which I think would be hard to make happen in this guild.<br>
<br>
4) &quot;Who gives the orders&quot;. Only one person should tell the group/groups when to attack and when to fall back.  There should be one fall back person in case the other dies first or goes LD.  If the leader misses a call because something unexpected happened well thats what happens when unexpected things happen, things don't always go like clock work.  This game is designed to prevent you from getting exp other wise it wouldn't be a challenge.<br>
<br>
5) &quot;Who does the pulling&quot;. I can only tell you how devestaded a group can be by multiple pullers.  If your going to have multiple pullers they should take ques from the leader and they should have some basic hot keys Ditch it, bring it, forget it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think any thing more than those five basic thinngs is to much. it should always be broken down afterwards  for all to see so we can learn from past successes and victories. <br>
<br>
<br>
One thing I know from stratagy games and the army Keep the plans very simple.  <br>
A) Not every one is stratigic minded and they need to be able to follow the plan<br>
B) Every plan of battle no matter how well thought out is only good until first contact with the enemy. Most the best successes in history where accidents or plans followed to closely not allowing for adaptability.  Battle of Cow pens, Battle of the buiscuts, Midway, Falkirk, Loren, Hastings,  invasion of crete and the sacking of Rome etc.... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also I don't beleive the leader is completely responsibe for the group in EQ.  this is not the Army you can't shoot people for disobaying orders or even issue orders for that matter.  I dare you to tell your only Rezzer what their &quot;going&quot; to do.  You can ask and if they do it cool. The leader is not soully responsible for everything where all in this together and if we don't work togther well die together.  If people misunderstand something don't listen to what others say or just unexpected things happen like members going LD amidst a fight or a train being dragged through your fight can be held on their head (some typical situations there are others).  Yes they are required to react and that is all that can be expected of them. However in EQ a train comming through can pretty much mean grab a /loc because there may not be any reacting.  <br>
<br>

<br>
what upset me the most was the first cleric we asked who wouldn't break camp and wanted us to bring the corpses down to VERY difficult rooms (exe,sage,etc) for resses, and I'm thinking if something goes bad, the ppl who just got res'd are goners, which did happen, bad train came to sage from my  understanding and wiped out the ones who just got their stuff back. I felt so bad for Foodang, I don't think I've ever seen anyone else take so many one way ticketts to Fironia Vie before...<br>
<br>
I think it would have went a lot more smoothly if the cleric would have just taken the time to break camp and come topside long enough to do resses, and I would have gladly helped him break the spawn again after it was done..<br>
We did all we could to try to make it as safe as possible doing CR deep in Guk and bringing the lower lvls out ASAP.<br>
<br>
Larou and Molo were very Key in helping to get the corpses together, I just really thinkn the cleric we asked was a bonehead in the nicest of terms to have us bring them down into high traffic areas of mobs and try to do it there.<br>

However, I feel somewhat obliged to defend the cleric in question's unwillingness to break his camp, although not much else.  <br>
<br>
It is unreasonable to expect a cleric to break camp to do a res.  Presumably he was with four or five other people who were his primary responsibility.  On the other hand, it is unconscionable to res someone unprotected into a hot zone without extreme extenuating circumstances.  If I am grouped, it is always my policy that if you want a res, you bring the body to me.  On the other hand, if I don't feel I can do the res safely, I simply won't do it. I have made more than one person unhappy because of that, but let's face it.  No one is entitled to a res.  I wasn't there, but as it has been described to me, the res's should never have been done.  If I am doing a res in a dungeon, you can bet I have party approval and a tacit agreement from them to protect during the res.  This also means that I have confidence in my group's ability to hold the room long enough to get the job done.  If the cleric and his group were run out of the room, then things happen.  If they decided to move after the res and before Foo had zoned back in, they should all be shot.  You can call this unamed cleric a bonehead for improperly res'ing into a hot zone, and I'll stand beside you and cheer you on.  But don't expect a cleric to break camp to come res you.  If it happens, all the more wonderful.<br>

<br>
I just wish this hadn't went down as bad as it did, I wasn't therer to do evac, and maybe if I had hung out longer maybe it wouldn't have been so bad, I can't take no more than 5 at a time, but that would have been 5 less to not worry about..<br>
<br>
Not bashing clerics or anything sis, They do a hell of a job at what they do, just like I do a hell of a job at what I do...(what that is yet, none can say ;p)<br>
Maybe he didn't realize that some of the ones were low-mid 30's and it's tough for one to hold one's own during a bad train... ah well, it's done and over with.<br>

It has more to do with grouping and group dynamics.  I have not really solo'd since I was 22nd level.  I work in groups, period.  And that means my group takes priority at all times over someone I don't know asking for a res, whether they are 30th level or 50th level.  To go do a res means leaving my group without a healer, and thus endangering their lives.  For a guild member or a friend I would try to do it; for a stranger, never.  Now again, I am not defending this particular cleric - I think at best he displayed a certain level of incompetence.  But character classes that group can have a very different perspective on things from those that can solo effectively.  If I can't get a group, I can't hunt.  If I abandon groups at the drop of a hat, I will quit getting decent groups. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure this is completely pertinent to this topic, but perhaps it can help you understand a little more the different ways class limitations affect game play.<br>

I soloed mostly for level 35 to 38. I helped alot of people travel to Ill Omen zone from FV. I was a Drachnid killing fool I tell ya! I spend alot of time now rezing around the zones I know in Kunark or wherever I'm at when I get arez request. I have been going to Overthere with Remoris alot. He and I have been picking up some good exp even when he is in 40th. I made it out of 40th grouping with him and Pixxie there.<br>
<br>
I have been on one raid to help out Remmy and had a blast. I hope I can attend more of those types of events. Let me know if my services are needed at anytime.<br>
<br>
