<br>
Sunday, I hear from my ranger friend, Kylora, that Venril Sathir was up.  Figuring that someone would kill him before too long, it was a good bet that his remains would spawn on Monday (Venril Sathri's Remains spawn 24 hours after Venril Sathir is killed).  That evening I went to Karnor's Castle and checked.  And he wasn't up...so he must have been killed.<br>
<br>
Now, both rangers and druids need "a pulsating green stone" from the spawned Venril Sathir's Remains (VSR).  The good news is that he always drops two stones (can somebody say 'testicals'?).  So, Kylora and I, being fairly close, decided we'd make it our mission to get this drop together.  We arranged to meet Monday evening in KC to check on the spawn, and if we found him up, put out a "y'all come" to see if we could take him down.<br>
<br>
Monday night, I show up, and Kylora is nowhere to be found; it appears she had to stay at work late.  And there I was, sitting in KC unable to raise the force myself.  In fact, the guild of one of the friends I called made noises of skunking me for their druids and rangers.  Fortunately, something else caught their attention.<br>
<br>
So, there I sat, wondering what I was gonna do for the evening when somebody ooc's that they're taking VSR down and they need help.  I ask if they have plans for both of his stones, and she tells me that they only need one, and will be rolling the other to whomever needed it.<br>
<br>
So I sign up, we head in to KC.  Get ready and take him downtown!!  The defaulted stone goes to the druid.  And they random the other between me, a 60 druid (I feel kind of bad about that) and a 47 ranger (I really don't feel bad about that).  And I won.  Woo hoo.<br>
<br>
Now, backing up a bit.  My packs have been completely full for 5 days.  And I kept forgetting to sell stuff off and put stuff in the bank.  <br>
<br>
After looting the stone, I ran to turn it in in FV.  Got that taken care of, and all that's needed is to give what I got in FV to Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket and I'll have my pre-epic, the Elaborate Scimitar.  <br>
<br>
One of the minor annoyances of the druid epic is that there are several mobs you have to turn items into that are on speed or something.  They're druids so you know their sow'd.  And they won't stop for you, ever.  You end up having to make the transfer in transit, which is not easy.  <br>
<br>
I've dealt with Ella before, so I know she's a pain to trade with.  But she does run to the guards in misty and turn around and run back out.  While she's doing this maneuver she's in view long enough to do the transfer.  So, I park myself in the tunnel and face the guards.  I take the stone out of my packs (from a bear skin potion bag -- small items only) and hold it on my cursor.<br>
<br>
As some of you may know, i'm a big proponent of binding certain skills to certain movement keys so that you effectively practice them whenever you move.  My druid and bard both do this with Foraging.  This has the benefit of keeping them well fed as well.  When you forage something and you have something on your cursor already, the foraged item will stack under that.<br>
<br>
Ella shows up, and I take a step forward to get her in target, activating my forage.  I hand her the stone and she gives this long speach about corrupted animals and would I go clean up the mess?  Then she hands me the scimitar she carries at her waste.<br>
<br>
But I look in my packs, and there's no scimitar.  You see, while foraged items will stack on your cursor, quest items and summoned items will NOT.  The game will simply eat them.  And that's what they did to my Elaborate Scimitar.  Doh.  <br>
<br>
I petition and talk to an apprentice guide who can only be sympathetic and she escallates it to a GM.  The GM, while on for a few hours, never talks to me, and then disappears from /who all gm.  So, I log off at 1:30 est and go to bed.  When I get to work Tuesday morning, I use the "contact a gm" link on the everquestlive.com website and explain my problem.  <br>
<br>
That afternoon the GM send me an e-mail telling me he's already put the stone into my inventory (thank god I had the wherewithall to clean out my packs).  Yay<br>
<br>
Tuesday being Buffy/Smallville night, I usually take it off from EQ, as some sort of proof that "See, i can stop anytime I want".  But the possibility that my pre-epic might be sitting on my character is too great.  As soon as Smallville ends, I log in.  Look in my inventory and there it is, the stone I got from FV.  <br>
<br>
This time more careful about what I'm doing, i hand it over to Ella and find myself the proud owner of an elaborate scimitar.<br>
<br>
Now, I find myself logged on and very happy, what do I do now?  I could just log back off...but I went through all the trouble of logging on...I should accomplish something.  All my friends are engaged but I have 4 of the harder to acquire ingredients for my 3rd attempt at my Embroidered Coldain Prayer Shawl (6th shawl).  So, I decide to head to Great Divide to get the last 3 ingredients.<br>
<br>
I get there and am ready for 2 hours of mindlessly killing giants and giant wolves to get these items.  But I hear in OOC that they're getting ready to start the 10th ring war.  The 10th ring war was one of the ideas that Verant got right.  It's really interesting.  You have to help the dwarves defend Thurgadin from the advance of an army of Storm Giants.  Left to their own devices, the dwarves would find themselves being scraped from the soles of the giants' feet.  But, hopefully, with your help, they will emerge victorious, and you and your friends will get some Phat Lewtz too.  The downside of this is that the entire zone depopulates when this war begins.  <br>
<br>
So, i know my time hunting is limited.  There are 4 wolves all dangerously close to me, so I root them in succession, snare them in succession, then dot them in succession.  By the time I got to the 4th one, the 1st one was dead.  When I checked the 1st two, I found they both had the two items I needed from them.  Woo hoo, what luck.<br>
<br>
I announced this to a chat channel of friends I belong to and tell them that I just need to kill giants for one more piece.  And they tell me that the item I need is frequently on the vendors in Thurgadin near the bank.  People sell them for decent coin.  So I go, and yes, every vendor had one.  It cost me 126p, but it was worth it, seeing as how I wasn't going to be able to farm them that night anyway.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm riding the high from having my epic advanced significantly, and the successes of getting my shawl drops very quickly.  The superstitious part of me tells me that THIS is the time I should attempt my shawl.<br>
<br>
So, off I go to Kelethin.  Because I need to use the loom to combine the ingredients.  I'm up to my nipps in containers and a sewing kit seems like a luxury I just can't afford.  I put all the ingredients into the loom including my shawl and hit combine.  <br>
<br>
"You cannot combine these items in a container of this type".  <br>
<br>
Wha?  <br>
<br>
Belar (my dog) picks that moment to be needy and he hits the back arrow on my computer.  I move away from the loom as a result, and being too far away, the loom box closes.  What do you think happens when you put no drop items into a public container like a loom or a forge and then close them?  That's right, the game eats them.  This is to make sure they're not available to the next person that comes along, thus giving us a way around the no drop flag when transfering items between characters.  <br>
<br>
I had lost some of the ingredients for my shawl.  I was dejected because two of the items were pretty rare and I was gonna have to go farm them again.  What I didn't realize was that my 5th shawl was in there too, and it was also no drop.  back to the /petition.  But I feared that the GM might think I'd found a quick way to get him to give me stuff I needed without workign for them, and he would refuse to give me my shawl back.  Plus, I don't know if putting items in a public container generated a log for them to review.<br>
<br>
I logged off immediately and used the "contact your gm" link on the website again.  Figuring that it worked so well the day before on my epic.  Today I waited and waited for an e-mail from the GM.  But I never see one.  It's the day before Thanksgiving, and I figure it'll be a few days before I hear back.<br>
<br>
I was starting to reconcile myself to never getting my 5th shawl back and decided that I wasn't going to start the quest over and put myself through that torture again.  <br>
<br>
I logged in tonight.  Repetitioned about my shawl, since I learned the night before that petitions only stay in the queue for 12 hours, after that, you won't be getting an answer.  My epic is at a comfortable place that i don't feel it needs to be a priority.  And I may never have to work on my shawl again, so there's no point on pursuing that priority at this point.  What was I left with?  Levelling (how novel?).  <br>
<br>
Find my friends and we head out to get some xp.  After about a blue, one of them tells me that he got us invited on a Plane of Innovation dragon raid.  We've  never seen that dragon before (it's clockwork and kinda funny looking), so it could be fun.  We're all sitting in the plane of tranquility outside the windmill that leads to Innovation forming groups and buffing up.  When I get a tell from a GM.  I told him my woeful story of the night before, and he says "Yeah, I know, I've brought your stuff back".  He handed me everything that I had lost in the loom.  Woo hoo.  I'm happy again. And sad, I was kind of enjoying the freedom of not having this shawl quest looming over me.<br>
<br>
We head into Innovation and participate in one of the worst run raids I've been on in a long time.  We did kill the dragon tho, and that was fun.<br>
<br>
The raid broke up, and I decided that I would try my shawl again.  this time sitting in front of the loom, so I couldn't move.  Put the ingredients in, figure out why it wouldn't combine (because you do it in two pieces, not all at once, dope).  I do the first combine, success.  Yeah, sure, but that ones trivial.  this next one is the hard one.  Put the second recipe in and, surprise, SUCCESS.  I'm now the proud owner of an Embroidered Coldain Prayer Shawl.  And forever shackled to the Coldain and their damned shawls.<br>
<br>
Finally, realizing that this success can only be followed by a stupid mistake based on my performance the rest of the week, I quickly logged off and came here to tell my tale.<br>
<br>
I hope it entertained.<br>
<br>
PS.  If you're worried about my violating my bond with Kylora to get our stones together, worry not.  Mathi, one of the people in the chat channel we're all in together, says, after I got my stone, "Oh, is that for your epic?  I have one of those in my bank".  So, with the help of an Enchanter's charm spell, Kylora is not also the owner of her pre-epic as well. <p><TABLE align="center" width="432" height="216" background="http://www.twors.net/rawbear/images/Everquest_Team_II.jpg"><TR><TD valign = "Bottom"><B>Ray,<BR>
