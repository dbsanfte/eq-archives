I have yet to meet shawn, and I have grouped with Hindo on a couple of occasions.  I hold no ill-will toward either of you, and I would come to aid either of you if you needed it.  However, I would like to ask both of you a question.  If you are angry/discouraged/unhappy/whatever with this guild, and have left for those reasons, why do you want to come back and raise dirty laundry?  Why not just move on with life with your new guild?  By this, I am not saying disassociate yourself with your old guild, but more of a live-and-let-live situation.  Not that this is some self promotion here, I am the last person to be a mediator.  Usually, I start an argument, as Yonder and Leetah have seen.  I just had a question for you, that’s all.<br>

It's nice to meet you also. Well let's see here. I'm trying to do this in a good way so bare with me. I have come to relize that no matter how hard I try now I'm never gonna make a difference in the Aegis Wolves. My reputation for being a big mouth has messed up my chances of ever becoming a Wolf again. I came back to air out the old dirty laundry this is true. The reason for it was to go ahead and release all the feelings that I held under control for some long.<br>
<br>
These were the feelings that I was told to keep to myself during the Broken Paw and just before it. I did this at the request of some Wolves that I trusted and loved. Well right after the BP hearing I kept to myself and left the game for about 2 months. I had lost my fire.... It was almost put out completely. Some may wish it would have, but I'm back here in EQ. Alive and kickin. <br>
<br>
The reason I came back was that I got nipped at a couple of times for resent posts.... the hurt started to fester up again and since I had not purged it from my system I just let it out. Blind fury I guess you could say... I just felt I was given the .... end of the stick and I had never spoken out about it. So I let it fly and I got reactions that I guess I was looking for and it went from there.<br>
<br>
No matter what I say I do miss being a Wolf...... I had so much pride that it got me in trouble. I went to the point of fearing a member of the DoD's pet in Freeport arena so it would aggro a guard or two to come back and nail him. I wanted some type of revenge for the butt whippin the DoD put on us in the FFA that happend. We were spanked from one side of Ro to the other....Exp loss and corpse camps....I was VERY MAD and upset that it had happend. I was so upset I went to the point of breakin rules to get some sort of revenge for the wrong that was done to our guild. I learned then that 2 wrongs DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT.<br>
<br>
I'm just not the type to back down really.... But it's time that I do. I felt I was done wrong by old friends but I was the one that did it, to myself. But there is a golden heart under all my talk and I'm sure all you that know me know that is true. I would give the helm off my head to someone that needs it. I will run across zones to help someone that asks for my aid in times of need. I still have the heart of a Aegis Wolve, I just have a hard time swallowin my pride and shutting up at times that I should hold my tongue. I had a problem of going chaotic and righting a wrong by doing more wrong. I think that I'm not the only one like this in the world....I'm just a more verbal than tactful person at times.<br>
<br>
My flames have subsided and I would like to say I'm sorry to my friends an to others that don't consider me their friend. Just know this.... I will help each and everyone of you out in anyway I can... All you have to do is ask for the help and if it's at all possible I will be there to aid you whole hearted and willing.<br>
<br>
I will hereby move on and forward to the next step in life. So look out Norrath....And Milinea! I'm comin for ya!<br>
<br>
&lt;Looks a the once glowing coals that started the flames and pours water on them until they no longer glow&gt;<br>
<br>
Have a great day ya'll...<br>

P.S.  If you don't want me here just post below that you would like me to go and not return and I will understand and obey your request to do so. Thank you.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/ushaunesoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaune Soulsaver</A> at: 9/5/01 1:23:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/udralof.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DRALOF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/5/01 12:11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for Hindo and Shawn</span><hr size=1> Dralof Crys........ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/umandilloranwhitewolve.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandilloran Whitewolve</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/5/01 12:42:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for Hindo and Shawn</span><hr size=1> I posted a reply to this post by mistake under must apologize by Remoris, sorry for any confusion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/urematus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rematus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/5/01 2:46:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re</span><hr size=1> Shaune I have stayed aloof from all of this for many reasons.

I am not here to flame so calm down hindolar has had a few beers since 2 months ago.  I too like shaune Held all of what I thought and felt in and for me it was more so for friends I had so many friends in the wolves that I didnt want to hurt their feelings for the past but I guess finally one day I snapped.  It had bothered me for so long but I never said anything I wish I would have vented more or something instead of acting out.  I regret what happened two months ago and realize maby I should have held it in but I could not imagine how I would feel now.  <br>
<br>
The thing that made me most angry out of all was Favoritism I was never one to please an officer just because he was an officer so I didnt kiss their feet and never will.  Thing is it proved to be bad because no matter how many normal people like you it is the officers that vote crap.  Back a long time ago when draeg was still around and ciero as well I had a chance to become an officer I had guild experience I knew everyone but I didnt kiss the officers butts, so who got elected? surveyyyy says... o the noob that hadnt been there but a couple months but blew smoke up all the officers butts except ciero.  Ciero left after that because it was unjust but I hold no grudge I did for a long time though.  <br>
<br>
I was going through all of my CD's tonight and found all my screen shots from when I was lvl 12 or so and of course I was wearing the AW tag man I was so proud then I mean I was like honored to be a wolf but then one day many days later I found out what they were all about and it hurt it really did.  I dont know why I am telling all of you this whole thing now, I know im not trying to justify the past but rather I am showing you what I thought.  I remember the day I joined the wolves I was level 9 this was back in 99 hehe been a while, anyway I think I got draeg out of a jam or he helped me I know we were at the chessboard in BBM.  By doing this he offered me a spot in AW lol I didnt even know what a guild was for but when I got in I found the greatest bunch of people.  I dont know what happened.  I held a high respect for allot of the wolves till I saw their true colors and well I was rather disappointed.  <br>
<br>
Shaune has been a good guy to me and is one of the only wolf to have stayed a friend till even present days I still talk to ciero too.  I thought by rejoining again maby things would have changed but they never did just the same all the time and it will never change I accepted this finally.  I have backed up, helped, and defended more wolves then I can count but none of that ever mattered thats also why I was so fustrated then too if I helped someone I didnt boast about it to try to get pats on the back it was just me.  Tonight I was talking to a GM a girl had either left her comp or fell asleep because she kept getting killed at her bind spot so I heard about it through OOC in Lake of ill omen well I just went over to see if i could lend a hand.  I just kicked it and kept the spawns away then a guide got there well we stood there for about an hour waiting for the lead GM to come in and disco her  they added a good mark to my account heh I had 4 previous good marks to the account with the GMs so I guess I did something right.  I dont know I just dont say things about stuff like that because I feel it is just my way so it isnt very special and well it wasnt to the guild so why try?  I dont miss the new wolves but I miss the old days heh svar, draeg, kro, ciero, and so on lol all the origionals but when the nobs came in it all got flushed and went swirley.  Sorry I talked your ear off I am out now so take care and stuff.<br>

At the time this went down I had been a wolf for over 6 months and had known the ways of the guild very well and also I never made the wolves look bad I helped everyone every chance I  got if I was in the area and still do.  Being part of the divine light has been fun I have helped numerous people and all signed up to be part of the guild because they think thats the way the guild is.  I feel that part of the past is because I am not one of the people that whenever I do something good I have to boast about it.  I think maby it will be seen anyway.  Saels who said you could take a break get back to swabbin my deck arggggggg hehehe, I wasnt really asking a question it was just more so to point out it does not need to be because of anything it is just simple put that it does not matter who you are if the officers like someone else over you then thats who they pick no matter how long you have been there or what you have done for the guild so the ones that brown nose get the perks so to speek heh had they not acted like that I think the guild would be massive and have lots of high levels and just be one of the best guilds on the server.  But when people ask what guilds i have been in the first I list is AW and they laugh their asses off and no I dont join in I tell em i still respect the wolves and stuff so calm down and they do. O well hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003030><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub7.ezboard.com/uleetahpuppypaws.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leetah Puppypaws</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Pack Master</span><br>  Posts: 752<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 9:21:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub7.ezboard.com/faegiswolvestunarepack.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.mr-bandwidth.com/aegiswolves/images/Banners/AEGIS1_medium.jpg height=150 width=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for Hindo and Shawn</span><hr size=1> You know im tired of you blaming the officers.<br>
<br>
I also remember that vote and if i remember correctly. it was not an officer vote it was a full guild vote.<br>
<br>
I asked the guild (at least those who bothered to come to the meeting) for nominations. a LOT of people where nominated. Infact I personally nominated you Hindo. You had an equal chance to win over ash and teir.<br>
<br>
well after the entire guild voted on who they wanted as their next officers. afterwards Ciero got mad because even though he was nominated he lost. His words to me &quot;I have given more items away to members of this guild than anyone. that position was mine!&quot;<br>
<br>
No one buys an officership in this guild. it is earned. the reason im sure you did not get bumped up is i believe that you had already quit the guild once and had come back. Your packmates remembered that. any time you leave it gives the rest of the guild a sense of loss. it also leaves them with a sense that you might abandon them again. <br>
<br>
As i remember it everyone who ran for officer at that meeting got 1 vote. except Ash who recieved 2 votes and teir who recieved 3.<br>
<br>
I cant remember who all ran but i know it was something along the lines of 5 wolves. for 2 positions.<br>
<br>
Ash<br>
Teir<br>
Ciero<br>
Hindo<br>
and someone else cant remember who.<br>
<br>
It was because of all the BS over that vote that I moved things to just an officer vote on who to bring up to officer. I hate politics. i hate flames. and i hate bs. I remember this vote so well because it was full of all 3.<br>
<br>
Saels. your right there are to many chiefs and not enough indians. When Guudy fixes my puter and gets it back to me ill get online and well see about fixing that. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now if this is going to turn into a flame thread im going to move it, lock it or something. maybe ill make a passworded flame board even though it goes against my gut feeling.<br>
