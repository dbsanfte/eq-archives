	 <tr><td colspan=2><blockquote><img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/ao100.gif" alt="Category: Anarchy Online" width=100 height=100 align=right>Anarchy Online has been out almost a month now.  I know there have to be some Everquest players out there wondering about Anarchy Online and how it compares to EQ.  I beta tested Everquest and have been playing it ever since.  I also beta tested Anarchy Online and have been playing it since it was released a few weeks ago.  Of course, I have seen a lot more of EQ than AO, so there are things that I can’t compare quite yet, but I still thought I would give you my initial impressions to help you decide if AO is a game you might want to try.  So here is my comparison and review.<br><PAUSE><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>This is something I feel needs to be stated right up front, because I am going to try to ignore it for the rest of the review.  At the moment, Anarchy Online is not a quality, playable game.  The game was released with Funcom fully knowing that it was bugged, incomplete and unplayable.  I was a beta tester and I was astounded when I discovered that the version we were playing those last weeks of beta was truly just a step from the release version.  Frankly, I believe that any legitimate company should hang their heads in shame after releasing a game in this bad a shape.  Funcom then rubbed salt into the wounds of even their most loyal customers by announcing that the game was “110%” playable two weeks after release, setting off the clock on the 30 days you get with your purchase and assuring that they will start charging people for a game many cannot yet play.<br><br>The lag in the game is horrendous.  Anytime you get close to more than a handful of other players, your frame rate drops to almost nothing and you find yourself standing in place.  What’s worse about this is that you can’t sit or move your curser enough to even log out of the game, and you are often forced to stand there for five minutes or more hoping to just get out of the game.  Of course, you can always alt-tab to windows and control-alt-delete the game closed, but that seems like a pretty extreme measure.  Basically, this means that you are better off just not trying to play during the typical prime time hours.<br><br>The pathing in the game is so bad that when you are in a mission your best chance is to move to a room, stand still and wait to see what starts to shoot at you.  Of course, then it is often in another room and shooting through the walls, but at least you can shoot it back that way.  Mobs can attack you through walls and across the playing field without you even seeing them or knowing where to go to fight back.  Quite often you will lag out during a fight, which makes it impossible to use your special attacks, and then come back in and find out that you died.<br><br>High patience and a low frustration level are required to play this game right now.  A high performance machine and high speed internet connection are also a lot of help.  If you go in expecting a beta quality game, you will probably still be amazed at the problems.  Still, many people are able to play the game, so for those of you who are willing to overlook the obvious problems and want to delve into the actual game lurking behind the bugs, I’ll try to give you my view of how it plays.<br><br><b>Graphics and Sound</b><br><br>	The graphics of Anarchy Online are crisper and more realistic than those of Everquest.  There are nice little touches that really add to the feel of the world.  The sky effects are pretty amazing and there are things like little robots and flying birds that add a touch of realism to the game.  The player models are stunning and the number of outfits you can wear are astonishing.  I created a female character just to experiment with the rather racy outfits you can buy at the store.  This is definitely a PG game.  With all the variety, I don’t doubt that you could really get to the point where you can recognize a person just by his or her looks.  They also programmed some fun emotes into the game, letting you really express yourself.  I know I got a lot of work out of the /anger command when the zones weren’t working right after release.<br><br>Still, even with such crisp graphics, I find the world to be a little drab.  I am sure it is by design, since Rubi-Ka is defined as a dead world that is slowly being terraformed, but there is very little color and variety amongst the cities and zones.  Part of the fun in Everquest is zoning into a new zone and seeing how different it is from the rest of the world.  Everquest has forests, plains, jungles, oceans, lakes, mountains and a whole variety of other types of terrain.  From what I have seen so far, much of Anarchy Online is the same.  So, while I like the individual graphics in AO better then EQ, overall I think I prefer the look of Norrath to the look of Rubi-Ka.<br><br>	When it comes to the sound track and sound effects, AO has EQ beat by a mile.  I always thought that the music in Everquest was almost an afterthought by the developers.  If I recall correctly, music was not even introduced into the game until several months after its release.  A good soundtrack can help get the heart thumping and add to the excitement of a battle.  AO has this and EQ doesn’t.  When I play EQ, I find myself turning down the sound, but when I play AO I like to really crank it.<br><br><b>Soloing and Grouping</b><br><br>This is an area where these two games differ significantly.  Everquest is strictly a group game.  While soloing is possible, it is difficult to do and time consuming.  In general, groups are easy to form and, because the classes are so well defined, you can form a group of total strangers and fairly quickly figure out everyone’s role in the fights to come.  <br><br>Anarchy Online is just the opposite.  It is very easy to solo, and in many ways it is preferable.  I have found it very difficult to find a group because most people have quickly discovered that you can get higher experience and better rewards by soloing.  Moreover, when you do get into a group most people are confused about what they are supposed to do and in the end everyone basically just blasts away at the mob until it is dead.  I assume as people get higher in levels and more specialized that things will change, but groups will never be as easy to define as in Everquest simply because the professions in AO are not so easily pigeonholed into defined roles.<br><br>This has led to an interesting development in the game.  Anarchy Online is simply not as social a game as Everquest.  There is no general chat like the zone chat of Everquest and with fewer groups and faster leveling, it is much harder to meet people and make friends.  It is more like a bunch of single player games being played simultaneously on the same server.  Some of this is due to the lag, which causes most people to do everything they can to avoid other players, but even without the lag, I doubt this will ever be much of a group game. <br><br>The advantage of this soloability is that Anarchy Online is able to be played in short bursts.  If you only have an hour or two to play Everquest, it is almost not worth playing.  By the time you log in, get to a zone, find a group and get into a rhythm it is time to log back out.  However, with Anarchy Online, you can grab a mission, play it through and gain a half a level’s worth of experience and a nice reward all within about a hours playing time.  This alone makes it a far better game for the casual gamer than Everquest.<br><br>Still, I like the social aspects of Everquest and find Anarchy Online really lacking in that regard.  Without more chat features and more incentive to group up with other players, the game will never really seem like a MMORPG to me.  What I have discovered is that when I have an hour to play and just want to play a quick solo game, I log onto Anarchy Online.  But when I know I can really sit down and immerse myself into the game, a find myself going back to.  So far, I don’t think AO has the same addictive hook that EQ can exert on you.<br><br><b>Classes/Professions</b><br><br>	In my opinion, Anarchy Online went the wrong way with their profession system.  I don’t doubt that there will be some significant changes as they start to see how the players deal with it.  Anarchy Online tried to overlap the professions and also, through a skill system encourage diversity even within the professions.  In and of itself, this is not a bad thing.  This supposedly lets the players determine their own destiny rather than be pigeonholed into a role determined by the game designer.  Unfortunately, from what I can see, it has had the opposite effect.  First, the professions don’t vary that much from each other at the start.  Because of the easy availability of healing and nano restoring devices, everyone in the game can heal themselves and cast multiple spells.  Plus, everyone can wear the same armor and use the same weapons.  Naturally, everyone is going to start to figure out the best weapons, armor, nanos, etc and use their skills accordingly.  This is especially true because you get so few improvement points that you feel you can’t waste any on any skill that is not strictly necessary.  So what you get are few actual variations in classes.  Maybe they will vary more in later levels.  <br><br>Also, with the sole exception of the doctor, all of the AO classes are attack classes.  With the exception of the doctor class, there are no true support classes.  There are classes that could be used in support roles, but because most players will spend a lot of time soloing, players who choose those classes will inevitably end up spending their improvement points on attack skills rather than support skills.  This really hurts the grouping process and also reduces the variety in the game.<br><br>In contrast, Everquest’s class system is very well defined, with each class getting their own specialties, armor, weapons, spells, etc.  This can sometimes be frustrating, but it builds up a very well developed reliance upon other players and encourages grouping and interaction.  It also makes it easier to know who and what you are dealing with.  When you meet a level 25 barbarian shaman, you pretty much know what he can and can’t do.  That certainty is not present in AO.<br><br>On top of that, EQ’s variety increases replay value.  The class and race you choose in EQ will significantly effect how and where you play the game.  Play an Ogre Warrior and then play a High Elf Wizard, and you will find your aproach to the game to be completely different right from the start.  In AO, the breed and profession seem to have little effect on how you play the game.  Everyone gets weapons and spells.  They may vary in name, but they all work pretty much the same.  Are you really going to stop playing your level 150 character and start over with another profession that does much the same thing, only shoots pistols instead of machine guns?<br><br>So I have to give Everquest’s system the nod over Anarchy Online.  I have a feeling others may disagree on this.  There is something to be said about having the ability to diversify your character.  Still I know that when I switch from a Rogue to a Warrior in Everquest, I will get a completely different game experience, whereas in AO switching from a fixer to a soldier will not really change your style a whole lot.  <br><br><b>Items and Quests</b><br><br>	This is an area where Anarchy Online has really improved over Everquest.  I love the generated mission system.  You go up to a mission generator, put in your parameters and request a mission.  You will then be sent to an area to perform a duty, whether it is fixing a machine, killing a traitor, finding a lost item, or some other similar quest.  When you get there, your own private dungeon is created.  It generally takes an hour to finish and at the end, you usually get a nice reward.  You can do missions privately or in a group.  This sure beats Everquest’s go camp 10 monsters for a cheesy reward quest system.  <br><br>However, the missions are better in concept in execution, which is a general theme running through much of Anarchy Online.  I know I promised not to mention this again, but right now AO is a truly flawed game.  Missions are often broken and can’t be finished.  The pathing is so bad that you have no idea which Mob will start to shoot at you and you can often find yourself firing at a Mob through a wall while another one stand right in front of you oblivious to your presence.  When you lag, the doorways disappear and can’t be crossed, stranding you in the middle of the mission.  Still, assuming all of this gets fixed, the missions may well be the best part of Anarchy Online.<br><br>	Anarchy Online also gets a huge thumbs up for making their equipment level sensitive (well actually skill level sensitive, but it works the same way).  There will be no twinking in AO, so a newcomer will not find himself wondering why everyone else in the game his level seems to be decked out in great gear while he’s scrounging for enough credits to buy the basics.  Plus, equipment drops randomly in accordance with the level of the mob, so there is no camping in AO either.  And on top of that, just about everything can be bought in the stores.  You are not going to be forced to sit in one place for 15 hours just to get that Phat Lewt.  These are huge plusses in Anarchy Online’s favor. <br><br>	There is a negative side to this though.  Because it is so easy to get the items you want by yourself, there is little trade going on.  Also, there seem to be few, if any, unique or rare items.  I always thought items in EQ should drop more randomly, but that doesn’t mean they should become more common.  I think that the lack of rare items in AO will somewhat take away from the competition that a true game player likes to feel.  While a game should not be all about Phat Lewt, that is still a fun element of EQ that seems to be missing from AO.  Still, overall I like the way AO handles quests and items better than the way EQ handles them.<br><br><b>Overall Game Play</b><br><br>	So which game is more fun to play?  That’s really the bottom line in evaluating a game.  When you are sitting at the computer looking at the AO and EQ icons side by side, which one are you more likely going to click? <br><br>Well, that’s a complex question.<br><br>	They are both fun games.  If you can afford both, I recommend you play both.  Why?  Because of the differences.  While they are supposedly of the same genre, in many ways these are completely different games.  AO is a nice solo game that has the added advantage of having other people around to occasionally chat with and interact with and even group with.  You can play it for an hour and actually accomplish something.  Plus, I haven’t even mentioned the pvp aspects, mainly because I have not tried that yet.  EQ is a great group game where you can really lose yourself in a group experience.  When you have enough time to truly immerse yourself, this is the game to play.<br><br>	In all, even after setting aside the bugs and lag and lack of playability of AO at this time, I definitely prefer Everquest over Anarchy Online.  Of course, EQ’s had more than two years to polish and hone itself to relative perfection, and I’ve also played EQ a lot more than I have played AO, but I doubt that even in four months or so when Anarchy Online finally reaches its potential and becomes a truly final product it will surpass Everquest.  This does not mean Anarchy Online is a bust.  If you can get past the bugs and the lag there is a pretty nice game in there.  If you only have the ability to purchase one more game this year, then by all means save your money and wait for The Shadows of Luclin expansion or perhaps Dark Age of Camelot.  If you don’t mind paying $50 for something that is flawed but still kind of fun, then this game is worth a try.  Whatever you do, don’t cancel your EQ account though, because you may find yourself wanting to come back in a month or two and you will want that level 60 warrior still sitting there when you return.<br><br></blockquote></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have to say I've never actually played EQ, so I can't compare it to AO. I've been playing AC on and off for the last couple years though, so I at least have something to compare it to.<br>I got AO as soon as it came out, thought the graphics were awesome compared to those in AC, and the race/face/body structure/height choice options were nice. But once I actually got into the game...<br>-Nobody really talks to each other. It's very sad.<br>-The lag is awful! Really awful. Incapacitatingly awful. Like, so bad that even on the outskirts of town you often get completely frozen and are unable to move at all (even the mouse) for a few seconds to a few minutes. Don't even think about going near the busy part of town. It once took my sister a half an hour to be able to move enough to sit down and log out. If you are not a person of infinite patience, you're not gonna like that.<br>-I had a rebel character and an omni character, and both starter cities were really cold and intimidating. Almost all of the vendors are machines who MAJORLY rip you off if you try to sell/buy anything. And like I said, nobody talks to each other. It was a scary place for a clueless newbie like me.<br>Anyway, I got sick of dealing with all the bugs in AO, so I stopped playing. I tried it again in late December to see if it had gotten any better. This time they had several hours worth of patching, and a big download that's supposed to make the graphics run faster (but from my experience, it makes no difference). The worst part is that the lag is just as bad as ever, and to add to that, there was a graphics bug that made everyone have neon green skin.<br>So basically, AO has a lot of fun stuff, the missions especially are really cool, but it's just not worth dealing with all the stuff that doesn't work.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

AO isnt a hellhole of pking as some say. just stay out of political zones. Eq isnt horrible in terms of needing groups, just pick your classes carefully. My shaman can solo, and my rogue cant. simple. I remember the bugs in eq. the endless frustration of lag with my cable modem. getting kicked off while zoning. But i never whined to other players, I never shouted the game's inadequacies from the virtual rooftops. I don't do this in AO either. Some people seem blind to the sometimes insurmountable tasks of running a MMORPG. They need to make it compatable with EVERY system, cross the globe. I have never had an eq or ao session where i didnt make new friends, new enemies, discover something new, and have a whole lot of fun. But i dont want to influence buying decisions. talk to a trusted friend or gamestore owner. They can give you a rundown of the game, pros and cons, etc. especially since sometimes people on the internet are tempted by anonymity of it, they will fill their essays or short rude comments (read "wow" and "eq addicts = morons" above) with petty critisism and completely untrue statements, making people afraid to buy games for fear of more stupidity.<br><br>-doom of death<br><br>-Will_doomslayer- 52 druid (D2)<br>-Damarill- dwarven rogue of the 24th heist (eq) E'ci server<br>-Xebeo- iskar shaman of the 20th whatever (eq) E'ci server<br>-Tigerseye- clan adventurer (15th lvl)<br>-Akraid- Omni Meta-physicist (10th lvl)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Even though I am overseas, I don't have a lag problem.  Thanks to Verant's maturity, I rarely have a bug problem.  The technologies today make these games better and better.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I recommend that if you havnt played a MMORPG before, start with Diablo2... yes.. its not a MMORPG, but you will learn how NOT to act in chat and how to be patient with "losers" who do random PKing and poor trades.<br><br> Then move to AC. Once again, you start to feel the MMO aspect, and you get to work on grouping skills now and then.  Then move to EQ. EQ has no remants of D2, and is the exact opposite of AC. Grouping and RPing are a constant in EQ.  Once you have played those 3 games(d2 is optional, but its an easy start), you can move on to AO.  I havnt played AO, but I am tired of AC and EQ. I have played both for far to long to play one game(AC for almost 2 years, and EQ for almost 1 year).<br><br>While AO is buggy... you all must realize(and most of you do by now) that games are no longer released in the full version.  EQ had one hell of a rough start, and AC had its moments of hell(although it was much smoother than EQ).  I am sorry to hear how Funcom failed to learn from both AC and EQs mistakes. But, like most producers nowadays, they released the game to make some money. You can't blame them.  You bought it, you knew it wasnt done, and you even started to pay the monthly fee when you KNEW(if you are smart enough to read a forumn) that the game was completely messed up.<br><br>All you who whine about AO in public chats and forumns... Get a life.  All you who whine about EQ... Get a life.  Al is right, both games have their strong points...<br><br>Last bit of advice... do what I said, and play the 3 games.  They are all STABLE and pretty much as good as they are going to get(expansions not included, Luclin doesnt count since I havnt even read about it yet).  After you play those for say... 6 months to a year, AO will be stable enough for you to buy it at a cheap price(19.99 or 29.99 by then) and you can try it out for the first month or two... see if you like it... if not, go back to whichever of the 3 others you liked.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed reading this :)<br><br>Fellow MMORPG lover,<br>Lonig<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Let me say two things firs..  <br>I have never played AO.<br>I have only played EQ for about 4 monthes now<br><br>EQ has pulled me in, not because of anything special, but because it is a new world with millions of people who you meet and hang with.  you never get the same group twice, and the bugs are simple annoyances and fixed fast.<br><br>If AO is buggy that is ok... Try making a game that is bugless it is hard (but still if they don't fix it in 2 monthes then that is really bad) <br><br>MY opinion on this is that EQ will rule because if you wanted a single player game there are millions of them out there and a lot of them use Random dungeons and all.  but for a social enviroment and multiplayer game get EQ, because grouping and socializing is what it is about. no man is a island, and that is a fact of reality that you have to assume.. some days in life you solo to move up slowly. some days you realize work with people and you can go faster.  If everyone was soloing EQ would be boring <br><br>(and if you don't like grouping go to PVP. I am sure that would be more exciting for you :)  )<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My personal experience..<br><br>Yes, AO is at the moment AWFULLY buggy. Hopefully that will get fixed one day. And that is also my ONLY grief with AO.<br><br>Personally to me, AO beats EQ in every way. I HATE the forced grouping mode in EQ. Yes, it's OK to group up for something nig, major, but due to the shortage of time, I also want to get my everyday exp, levels, cash and items on my own also. And I like to be a warrior type and as a warrior in EQ - forget about this! In AO I am a soldier and I can do this.<br><br>I don't agree with Allakhazam about the missing zone wide chat and such. Personally I never liked that pointless babbling in OOC in EQ. And /shout command is in AO also and works well. Also, when in guild, you can use the guild chat freely, and the whole chat system as such is much better in AO. I like especially the item reference links! Very cool! To those who don't know what it is, basically you have the item you want to sell; so you start typing, for example, the text "/shout Selling ", then you pick up the item and click with it on the textbox and the item name appears in purple color, and then you finish the text. BUT! It isn't just the 'purple name', it's the link to the stats screen. So another player just clicks on the item name and he/she will immediately see the stats of the item. Very handy.<br><br>Also I do not agree with Allakhazam about the missing 'social life', or inexperienced groups. The social life is there and it's quite active, and as for groups - well, not all there are from EQ. There are many people from AC and in AC you could do it all - most things anyway - solo. So while those people realize that in groups the XP is actually faster then solo (you can fight MUCH bigger mobs with a group), they just don't have the experience yet. They will learn. I have played EQ and AC, and know how to solo and how to group. I have also been grouped with many friends and guildmembers and just the players who have played EQ as well, or only EQ before AO, and naturally the grouping with them is easier, since it's literally all they know heh.. So Allakhazam has here missed the obvious and assumed that all the players are from EQ and now in the new world they suddenly don't want to group or remember how. Wrong.<br><br>As for enviroment.. Well I personally don't mind that so far it's mostly alike. And in reality it also is not. There are large desert areas, as well as hilly forests, plain forests, lakes etc.. I haven't even seen it all, but there is a difference and it's actually even more logical at times then in EQ, since it gradually goes over from one enviroment into another. Not like in EQ - snowy zone, then you enter another and wham! Jungle/forest/grass fields and whatever. I do admit that Kunark and Velious did bring the difference, sort of, to EQ, it was getting already totally boring and bleak and dull. Then again, every game will if you are in it since early beta heh..<br><br>I like the possibility to design your own unique char. I like the freedom of breeds (races to EQ people) and the freedom of preofessions (classes to EQ people). It's not set in stone, you can be truly a unique char. Want to be atrox doctor? Go ahead, who said atrox can be only enforcer/soldier? Want to be nano enforcer? Go ahead, no one said you must be meta-physicist. At the same time it is clear that you cannot be a jack-of-all-trades, since the skill points - IP's - are not for wasting. EQ-like restrictions at first weren't much, it was different from UO and new and so it was OK. Later though you always asked - why the heck no halfling paladins? Dwarf bards? Ogre "monks"? Troll necromancers? There is no reason to restrict all that. Those who say "it's roleplay reason", then forget it. Roleplay bah.. Check the AD&D 3rd ruleset and tell me that there cannot be halfling paladins. Roleplay is how you want to be and feel in the world, not the restrictions set on you by someone with a Vision (tm) on MS Excel 3.1 sheet.<br><br>Only thing what EQ has good at the moment and AO not, are the bugs. But I don't give that much credit to EQ here either, they have had PLENTY of time to fix much and there are still bugs in EQ since the early beta days. I personally can name quite few. So as long as Funcom keeps fixing AO, it will get better with every day. And eventually it will beat EQ, since EQ is still the same EQ with all of it's restrictions and forced rules, even with the SoL.<br><br>Oh and naturally there will be more products in future which will beat AO easily. No doubt in that.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After reading though all the posts here and after also playing both games, here are my own conclusions.<br><br>Good aspects:<br>AO has updated graphics and sound &#8211; lots of eye candy.  It is a new MMRPG and it could grow into something even better.  At best though they fix the memory leaks stabilize game play and tell a good story along the way.  I really enjoy the solo & group aspects.  I especially like the fact that I only need to invest an hour here or there when I have time vs the major setup time required in EQ.  I want to quest for quests &#8211; simple variety via solo or group but not Evercamp.  I just don&#8217;t have the time and patience for that anymore.<br><br>EQ is very stable and the biggest/best MMRPG out there.  300K of people says a lot about an MMRPG&#8217;s success.  The class layout is very clear and group dynamics are usually sorted out pretty quickly.  Playing such a seasoned game surprisingly costs less than to play AO.  You would think that AO would keep their price at an equal level to compete.  If I were to introduce a new player to MMRPG&#8217;s EQ would be first on my list due to its clarity of classes and its overall seasoning/stability.<br><br>Bad aspects:<br>Did I mention that AO is REALLY buggy?  Funcom should not have released such a buggy game so soon.  Once again we have another company displaying to everyone that people will line up and pay to be shoveled junk right out of the box.  Funcom has done some amazing patch jobs but honestly how will they circumvent the texture problems?  Looks like only people with 512ram or more will be able to play, then again with technology moving the way it is, having that much ram is pretty cheap nowadays.  PVP and the political zones are a joke.  Zone in, lag, lag dead.  As posted earlier with all the textures on each player character, add 20 players in one spot and you get instant lag.  The movie is tantalizing about the wars of clan vs Omni but other than a complete client engine rewrite, it will be amazing if they can fix these issues.  Last but not least Funcom is not doing well in the reputation department.  They have failed on some serious issues and have not made any real amends or apologized for their mistakes. One of many examples: Funcom had an unsecured registration server at game day release and all the people that were left venerable for it.  As for EQ, Verant was very apologetic during the Kunark release and even made amends for the shipping/ordering issues.<br><br>Ok EQ and Verant, where to start?  Yes EQ is very stable but the price is rigid class structure that after awhile you get tired of crashing against it all the time.  It is really hard to get your Druid to look different from all the other druids LOL.  I also played as a cleric and with all the nerfs and ability give aways, really your group is better off with a druid/shaman combo at lower to mid levels.  Yes Clerics for high levels is for Rez/heals but how is a cleric supposed to get their higher levels before this point?  I see to many shoebox clerics that are power leveled up and kept as a tool for cheap rezzs vs playing it as a character class.  Sure have we have all done this trick as well but are we not missing something here?  I have argued till I am blue in the face with Verant on class balance vs game play.  What a joke.  Lets see, I start with a warrior.  I beat the heck out of everything in front of me and I keep the monsters off my teammates.  Ok necromancer, master of the undead, I have less nukes but I can DOT and wear down my opponents.  At mid level and up I in groups am now&#8230;. A MANA BATTERY?!?  Grrr.  Other classes have their own idiosyncrasies similar to this as well but I don&#8217;t feel they are as bad.  And finally Verant &#8220; You are in our world now&#8221; plus &#8220;Keep sending me your $10 boy, my Porsche needs a wash&#8221; says everything defining about the word arrogance.   Too many times Verant responds to players pleas with lawyers and iron fisted tactics vs thinking things though first.  I guess they figure its easier to ban/sue someone than to actually look at the issue fully.  I never had that problem but I remember Eqmacro coming out and it was very cool idea that Verant refused to even look at.  I don&#8217;t know about you but I am dripping with anticipation of pressing the /loc key another time just for fun?  I can&#8217;t tell you how thrilled I was when I saw AO has a map and a compass built in &#8211; no tedious key pressing required? Wow is that possible in an MMRPG or is that breaking some unwritten law somewhere?<br><br>In summary, yea I had issues and many more to write about with EQ because that is where the last few years of the majority game play have been.  AO really sucks with all the bugs but I think so many defend it out of hope it will get better and also some definitely have some antiEQ feelings.  I had already canceled my EQ accounts (I had 2 accounts for the different classes I played) several months before I participated in the Beta 4 with AO.  If Funcom can fix the core problems then AO will be a blast to play, its actually AO fun vs EQchores.  Sure AO it has dry spots but I would take it any day over the EQ 2000 invested hours club that you have to belong to in order to get a decent set of characters to enjoy.  Don&#8217;t forget &#8220;You have no idea which direction you are facing&#8221; so keep pressing that key all over again : )<br><br>In the end we all pick our poison.  I just hope we can have the continued luxury of the variety MMRPG's for today and tomorrow.  Its really cool that we can compare our likes and dislikes vs a alternate future where we could be stuck with pong as an interractive adventure : )  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Anarchy Online vs. Everquest = AO easier winner, its a next generation game. Graphically and by sheer content size miles ahead.<br><br>Anarchy Online vs. Ruins of Kunark. Now for me Kunark was EQs saviour. I wouldnt have come back and played EQ for 14 more months if it wasnt for Kunark. But most people hated Kunark and most of its zones are totally empty of players. Only about half the zones had more the 10 players in them and only 6 zones are really popular having 50+ players. After a year Verant finally take the teleport restriction to skyfire and emerald jungle. (in my opinion a slap in the face for the players that had to put up with damn karnors tp pick for the entire year, but i guess if you bitch enough on the webboards you'll eventually get your way)<br><br>Anarchy Online vs. Scars of Velious. WOW im 60th level and theres actually more then 4 zones for me to go to. Finally Verant has some content for me to play. Only took them almost 2 years after beta was released. I have to give AO the win on the fact that after you run around seeing all the zones, all SoV is is the old lands with new textures making the original Everquest graphics look even more pathetic. WoW look at the ice griffin or that blue efreeti and that red Vox and blue Vox and green Vox and OMG a white Vox with horns (wonder how long it took there graphic production crew to add those 10 polygons).<br>Graphically AO is mind blowing. Just get to about 20th level and take a trip to Clondyke and run around that zone for abit. The views are amazing. The freedom of movement and travel is amazing. And if your lucky enough to see a full on lighting storm at night when the run starts being blown sideways, thats just crazy. Hmmmm...Didnt EQ clients crash if it started to rain in Fear.<br><br>I could make comparisons for hours and hours. Thing is all 4 games are just as fun and as frustrating. But we all love the games or we would play them for... lets see.. 1 maybe 2+ years. I dont see other games you buy for $50-60 bucks and get that kind of length of enjoyment. How many of you are sick spending money on something you dont even remember trying. Take Black and White for example. Damn it looked and played pretty good. But i think after i went through the 6 lands once as good and once as evil and finding multiplayer lame by todays standards I Ended up forgetting it even came out. That was a good $50 spent and whole 3 days of fun. In the end its which games are fun and MMORPG your best bet for a great game. AO is just the next new thing. But hey some people just dont move with the times.(Hey Ultima Online players, its called get a 3D accelerator)<br><br>All Massively Multiplay Games are a HUGE accomplishment and I thank the game developers for trying to make something really really cool. I just can't wait for AO to get a chance to mature. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I know this was a SLIGHT over sight on your behalf but if you are going to criticize one game for its problems at least point out the the other game suffered from this for alot longer.<br><br>The main problem with EQ is that the entire game revolves around equipment.... period.<br>You get your 60th level character and put all his/her equipment in the bank and equip him/her with basic SHOP bought equipment and no one will let you into there group. IF you want to get some good equipment be prepeared to spend 12 hour straight on a raid just so you can have a dice roll at this equipment !<br><br>AO revolves around equipment as well but no where as much, since you can buy it all in shops or doing missions for it.<br><br>EQ is a more social game but have you asked yourself why ?<br>Because your always sat around waiting for something to happen, whether its a spawn/mana regen/ hp regen. There is so much DOWNTIME in the game you have to socialise.<br>If you want to socialise in AO try making a temp chat group. I am in one quite often, there is usually about 10 of us in it. I remember back in EQ when i had been playing it for 3 weeks i did not know this many people. The game is as social as YOU want it to be. If your a sad person who cant make friends don't blame it on the game you only have yourself to blame.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I was going to do a pro EQ post but when I stopped to collect my thought on how much I enjoy it I reallized that I couldn't think of anytime that I just had fun playing it. <br><br>It's always about getting more power and better items. It's like a job and I'm just working at getting high enough to actually be in control of my character and not have to worry about my faction or being KOS and running to the guards. <br><br>Sense I have started playing EQ I have lost total desire for any real life experiences without even noticing. I was talking to a friend (EQ) and he commented that his exwife spent more time playing EQ than with tere son. My other friend (RL) commented that "thats why you don't have children".<br><br>He was reffering to the fact people that weren't responsible just shouldn't have kids but most people that i have met play it like anything in real life is just a bother and takes away from there EQ time (Ralinda&lt;----)<br><br>Sorry I got off the main subject and I can't say that I'm going to stop playing but i vow to see the sunlight more and EQ less.<br><br>                           Just my 2 cp<br>                        Ralinda lvl 13 SK<br>                            The Rathe<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
