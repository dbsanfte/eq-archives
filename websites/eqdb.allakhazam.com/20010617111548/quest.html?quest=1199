You must do the first two before doing this.  Ask Borannin "What chore?" and he will start you on the third quest.<br><br>Loremaster Borannin says 'Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Dyllwin . I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete. <br>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>You say, 'What chore?'<br><br>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further. <br><br>Borannin tells you to go to Mordrin, but that is a typo, he really means Mordin, the guy in the butcher shop.<br><br>You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver'<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop, Halfling. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes. <br><br>I gave Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following.<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo Dyllwin , I see you've signed on for a bit of food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget ta give him this with his meal. <br>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>He gives you a napkin named "Leif's Napkin" is No Drop.<br><br>You say, 'What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?'<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be. <br><br>Get a Tundra Kodiak meat, put it in oven with sauce and make "Saucy Kodiak Meat" (name?). Put your creation in a mixing bowl with one loaf of bread, which Mordin sells, and combine. If your skill is high enough you get the sandwich. Turn this in to Guard Leif with the napkin and get a "Used Napkin" back. It is also No Drop.<br><br>Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get "Trita's Napkin" (No Drop).<br><br>You say, 'What is Snow Bunny Stew'<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty! <br><br>The tough part here is finding a mixing bowl. I searched several cities including Thurgadin for a mixing bowl or even a mixing bowl sketch or mold. I finally found one in a shop in North Freeport near the bank. I don't recall the shop name though :(<br><br>Once you mix the ingredients in the bowl and get your "Saucy Rabbit"(name?) you put that, one spice, 2 flasks of water and a pot into the oven to make the stew. The pot can be made with the smithing skill, and maybe even pottery, although I hadn't worked on that at this point.<br><br>I gave the stew to Trita with the Napkin and received a dirty pot in return. I gave that back to Mordin and was given the next part of the quest.<br><br>Next you need to createan Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's napkin, No Drop.<br><br>You say, 'What is Ulthork Meat Pie?'<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta go. <br><br>This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible. I know the kodiak meat and bunny meat do not get eaten, but everything else seems to disappear if not below your food in your inventory. I could not find any snake eggs in Thurgadin for the clump of dough, so I ported to Misty Thicket to get them.  The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at smithing and pottery, or you have a friend who is. To smith the Pie Tin you first need to make a ceramic lining, so your pottery has to be trained somewhat. I had relatively good success with a 25 pottery, whereas my smithing is in the low 100's and I don't think the pie tin is trivial to me yet. Luckily the pie tin, and the pot in the previous step, are regular items that anyone can craft and give to you if you lack the proper skills.<br><br>Turn the pie and the napkin in to Loremaster Brita in the back of the Library and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to Mordin for the final step in this quest.<br><br>The final task is to create a Snow Griffin Souffle. The person you are making this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to be made well. I have worked my baking up to 115, and I don't remember the souffle being trivial to me.<br><br>You say, 'What is Snow Griffin Souffle?'<br><br>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen. <br><br>So now you need 4 Griffin eggs. I had never seen any drop up to this point, but I haven't killed alot of Griffs either. I set out and with a little help was able to get 4 eggs to drop in about 3 hours. It would have gone faster, but I had trouble finding the Griffins. All in all I'd say we got the 4 eggs in about 12 - 15 Griffins, maybe even less.<br><br>Once you've made the souffle turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the napkin. Here I learned something useful. I forgot to turn in the napkin when I turned in the souffle. In my excitement in creating the souffle I had completely forgotten. I was about to petition that he had eaten my item when I realized the forgotten napkin, so I gave him the napkin and to my suprise it worked.<br><br>Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Dyllwin , what a wonderful dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you power over your adversaries. <br>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl. Now here is the toughest part of the quest. I looked at the Seal thinking it would be some no stat item, to my suprise I found it is an incredibly nice item, I think better than the Frozen Orb everyone is farming in the Eastern Wastes. Stats are AC 3, Wis +3, Int +3, SvCold +3, Sv Magic +3 and Mana +30. I hesitated for a moment, but finally turned it and my Prayer Shawl in to Borannin thinking I could do the quest again to that point to get the Seal.<br><br>Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Dyllwin, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has [brewing]. <br>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>This is the best part of the quest. I looked at my inventory to check out the stats on the shawl. It is as expected, one better on each stat over the second one, just like the ring quests. What shocked me, however, is that along with the third shawl I also received back from Borannin the Seal of Thoridain. So with this third quest we get two items. The shawl, which has not quite reached the level that I would switch it out for what I have on, and the Seal which is an incredible nice item.<br><br>He alludes to the fourth quest in this series, but when questioned about it says there will soon be much to do.<br><br>You say, 'What is brewing?'<br><br>Loremaster Borannin says 'As of now they have nothing for me to tell you. Bear with me Dyllwin , there will soon be much to do! <br><br>Unfortunately I did some of the quest on a different computer, so I did not have all of the log entries to include with the correct names of some items and what some of the NPC's say. All of the steps are here, anything missed is just dialog.<br><br>For those who want it sumed up, here is a shopping list of items you will need to do the whole quest. This assumes no failures, so plan accordingly :)<br><br>1 Tundra Kodiak Meat (Non-stackable)<br>2 Jug of Sauces (Stackable)<br>1 Loaf of Bread (Stackable)<br>1 Mixing Bowl (Container)<br>4 Snow Griffin Eggs (Stackable, No Drop)<br>3 Spices (Stackable)<br>2 Snow Bunny Meat (Non-stackable)<br>2 Flasks of Water (Stackable)<br>1 Pot (Non-stackable, Not a container)<br>2 Ulthork Meat (Stackable, edible)<br>1 Vinegar (Stackable)<br>1 Snake Egg (Stackable)<br>1 Bottle of Milk (Stackable)<br>1 Cup Flower (Stackable)<br>1 Pie Tin (Non-stackable, Not a container)<br><br>One last note...I did this whole third quest without an open inventory slot, since I had to carry around a mixing bowl. So you don't have to worry about not getting an item from one of the NPC's if all of your slots are filled, anything they give you, including the shawl and the seal, fit in your backpacks.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Boy when I spoke to somone who was working on this part of the quest and they said it was tough and boring, I thought "naaaa seems easy, put batwings and fish in a container and combine, get some blocks of clay some sketches and water and combine.....no problem"  Well, even though its fun learning new tradeskills, and being one of very few who can say "I can make Fish Head Stew or Gnome Kabobs", this takes alot of time and pacience.  I spent several hours getting my baking skill up to 140 (just to be sure of no failures) and getting pottery up to 115 (plenty for this part of the quest).  Then off to get my items, luckily i was able to get the Ulthork meat, rabbit meat, and kodiak meat fairly easily, and went back to get atleast a portion of the baking and distributing done, so that i could just get my Griffin Eggs and combine and turn in for the shawl and seal.........THIS IS THE HARD PART (but as always..there are secrets)  To get the eggs, here is what you do...<br><br>First get 2 to 4 druids together in EW.  Everyone memorize the AoE Lightening spell (34 or 49)  everyone Quad kite Snow bunnies, Tundra Mammoths, and anything else (animal like) in 2 areas.  The first area you want to do this in is near the Rygorr Camp, and the other area is in between the Rygorr Camp and the hut Icefang spawns in.  After about 1 hour of quad kiting, you will begin to see several Snow Griffins on track, and even a few Elder Snow Griffins (im not sure if Elder has a better drop rate, but they are higher level, I received 2 eggs from Elders and 2 eggs from regular snow griffins, so it seems random)  now the 4 druids can either Root/Dot or Charm Mammoths (if any are left after your mass killing) and have the mammoths kill your griffins.  It took me on the upwards of 5 hours to get 1 egg by just sitting and running circles looking on track for snow griffins, but the following day i used the above tactic and ended up with 3 eggs in about 2 hours.<br><br>I hope this helps you all with getting your shawls<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Beebe Lytcaster 51 Necromancer<br>Hiyeedi Fliess 54 Druid<br>~Rallos Zek~</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I have successfully completed Feeding all the Coldain.  They are quite the hungry bunch.  There are a few very good posts about what is needed but I just wanted to add my two cents on what items are needed for this quest.<br>       ulthork Meat - Easy to get off of ulthorks in EW BTM at lvl 40<br>       Rabbit Meat - Also Easy to get, they spawn near the Ulthorks<br>      Tundra Kodiak Meat/Snow Grifin Eggs - These two were harder to get.  The Kodiak Meat was the easier of the two.   Both the Kodiaks and the Griffins seem to spawn most commonly between the base of the bridge and the Ry'Gorr Fort.  The Kodiaks I could solo with about 2 1/2 mana left.  The meat spawned on the 3rd one.  I got a few extras, just in case.<br>      Snow griffins - These are much harder.  They are as fast as a slightly weighed, sowed 40th lvl druid :-(, they are also fairly snare resistant.  The are casters as well, although not too bad.  They hit a fragile druid hard.  I soloed a few of these but they all took nearly FM to kill and a few times when snare didnt land things were pretty hairy.  Then I hooked up with a lvl 51 Monk who was hunting Kodiaks for HQ hides and we got 4 eggs in maybe 10 kills and 2 hours or so.  The bad part about where the Griffins spawn is there are Dire Wolves, Snow Dervs and Ry'Gorr.  We had to Fd/zone a few times because of adds.  I would highly recommend that you avoid Elder Snow Griffins unless you are high lvl or have good support.  Very snare resistant and very, VERY fast.<br>       Most of the baking supplies can be purchased from the Dwarven vendors in the bank.<br>       The Pot I bought in a store in FP and the Pie Tin I created, trivial with 134 pottery.<br>       A snake egg is easily gotten anywhere snakes spawn, I got 4 in Sro in just a few minutes near the druid ring.<br>      The Mixing Bowl was by far the most frustrating.  A posting here stated that they purchased a Mixing Bowl in NFP near the bank.  As far as I could tell no shop there sells a mixing bowl.  I finally tracked mine down in WFP in the bakers Shop, im sorry I dont recall the name off the top of my head.  I tried Rivervale and Thurg and was not able to find it.<br>      The three people you need to find are Guard Leif, near the entrance to the Paladins guild, Trita Coldheart, in a house very near the back door of the bank, and Loremaster Brita, found in the library very near the grand historian.  I hope you can find him :-)<br>      I did get the Seal of Thoradain and it is a very nice item for ranged slot, see postings below for stats.<br>      Skills Baking 135, Pottery 134.  All attempts successful and all trivial.<br>      A good quest with a nice bonus item, im sure many will do this quest just for the seal.<br>                              Good luck<br><br>     Irky Timbers<br>     42nd Druid<br>     Morell Thule<br>&nbsp;<br>Irky Timbers<br>Halfling Druid-Morell Thule</td></tr>

Obtaining the snow grif eggs can be a drag and i didnt try before having a baking skill of 135. BTW if you really set your mind to it getting a skill of 135 isnt that hard. My advice is go to Freeport. Youll have all the needed supplies in that area. And if you dont mind about loosing a bit of money (in fact its a very cheap skill to raise) you can call yourself a master baker in no time.

Good luck, and may Brell protect you.<br><br>Has anyone done any more on this quest or know where to begin?<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
