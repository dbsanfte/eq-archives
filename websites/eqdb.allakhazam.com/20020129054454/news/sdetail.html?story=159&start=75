	 <tr><td colspan=2><blockquote><img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/ao100.gif" alt="Category: Anarchy Online" width=100 height=100 align=right>Anarchy Online has been out almost a month now.  I know there have to be some Everquest players out there wondering about Anarchy Online and how it compares to EQ.  I beta tested Everquest and have been playing it ever since.  I also beta tested Anarchy Online and have been playing it since it was released a few weeks ago.  Of course, I have seen a lot more of EQ than AO, so there are things that I can’t compare quite yet, but I still thought I would give you my initial impressions to help you decide if AO is a game you might want to try.  So here is my comparison and review.<br><PAUSE><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>This is something I feel needs to be stated right up front, because I am going to try to ignore it for the rest of the review.  At the moment, Anarchy Online is not a quality, playable game.  The game was released with Funcom fully knowing that it was bugged, incomplete and unplayable.  I was a beta tester and I was astounded when I discovered that the version we were playing those last weeks of beta was truly just a step from the release version.  Frankly, I believe that any legitimate company should hang their heads in shame after releasing a game in this bad a shape.  Funcom then rubbed salt into the wounds of even their most loyal customers by announcing that the game was “110%” playable two weeks after release, setting off the clock on the 30 days you get with your purchase and assuring that they will start charging people for a game many cannot yet play.<br><br>The lag in the game is horrendous.  Anytime you get close to more than a handful of other players, your frame rate drops to almost nothing and you find yourself standing in place.  What’s worse about this is that you can’t sit or move your curser enough to even log out of the game, and you are often forced to stand there for five minutes or more hoping to just get out of the game.  Of course, you can always alt-tab to windows and control-alt-delete the game closed, but that seems like a pretty extreme measure.  Basically, this means that you are better off just not trying to play during the typical prime time hours.<br><br>The pathing in the game is so bad that when you are in a mission your best chance is to move to a room, stand still and wait to see what starts to shoot at you.  Of course, then it is often in another room and shooting through the walls, but at least you can shoot it back that way.  Mobs can attack you through walls and across the playing field without you even seeing them or knowing where to go to fight back.  Quite often you will lag out during a fight, which makes it impossible to use your special attacks, and then come back in and find out that you died.<br><br>High patience and a low frustration level are required to play this game right now.  A high performance machine and high speed internet connection are also a lot of help.  If you go in expecting a beta quality game, you will probably still be amazed at the problems.  Still, many people are able to play the game, so for those of you who are willing to overlook the obvious problems and want to delve into the actual game lurking behind the bugs, I’ll try to give you my view of how it plays.<br><br><b>Graphics and Sound</b><br><br>	The graphics of Anarchy Online are crisper and more realistic than those of Everquest.  There are nice little touches that really add to the feel of the world.  The sky effects are pretty amazing and there are things like little robots and flying birds that add a touch of realism to the game.  The player models are stunning and the number of outfits you can wear are astonishing.  I created a female character just to experiment with the rather racy outfits you can buy at the store.  This is definitely a PG game.  With all the variety, I don’t doubt that you could really get to the point where you can recognize a person just by his or her looks.  They also programmed some fun emotes into the game, letting you really express yourself.  I know I got a lot of work out of the /anger command when the zones weren’t working right after release.<br><br>Still, even with such crisp graphics, I find the world to be a little drab.  I am sure it is by design, since Rubi-Ka is defined as a dead world that is slowly being terraformed, but there is very little color and variety amongst the cities and zones.  Part of the fun in Everquest is zoning into a new zone and seeing how different it is from the rest of the world.  Everquest has forests, plains, jungles, oceans, lakes, mountains and a whole variety of other types of terrain.  From what I have seen so far, much of Anarchy Online is the same.  So, while I like the individual graphics in AO better then EQ, overall I think I prefer the look of Norrath to the look of Rubi-Ka.<br><br>	When it comes to the sound track and sound effects, AO has EQ beat by a mile.  I always thought that the music in Everquest was almost an afterthought by the developers.  If I recall correctly, music was not even introduced into the game until several months after its release.  A good soundtrack can help get the heart thumping and add to the excitement of a battle.  AO has this and EQ doesn’t.  When I play EQ, I find myself turning down the sound, but when I play AO I like to really crank it.<br><br><b>Soloing and Grouping</b><br><br>This is an area where these two games differ significantly.  Everquest is strictly a group game.  While soloing is possible, it is difficult to do and time consuming.  In general, groups are easy to form and, because the classes are so well defined, you can form a group of total strangers and fairly quickly figure out everyone’s role in the fights to come.  <br><br>Anarchy Online is just the opposite.  It is very easy to solo, and in many ways it is preferable.  I have found it very difficult to find a group because most people have quickly discovered that you can get higher experience and better rewards by soloing.  Moreover, when you do get into a group most people are confused about what they are supposed to do and in the end everyone basically just blasts away at the mob until it is dead.  I assume as people get higher in levels and more specialized that things will change, but groups will never be as easy to define as in Everquest simply because the professions in AO are not so easily pigeonholed into defined roles.<br><br>This has led to an interesting development in the game.  Anarchy Online is simply not as social a game as Everquest.  There is no general chat like the zone chat of Everquest and with fewer groups and faster leveling, it is much harder to meet people and make friends.  It is more like a bunch of single player games being played simultaneously on the same server.  Some of this is due to the lag, which causes most people to do everything they can to avoid other players, but even without the lag, I doubt this will ever be much of a group game. <br><br>The advantage of this soloability is that Anarchy Online is able to be played in short bursts.  If you only have an hour or two to play Everquest, it is almost not worth playing.  By the time you log in, get to a zone, find a group and get into a rhythm it is time to log back out.  However, with Anarchy Online, you can grab a mission, play it through and gain a half a level’s worth of experience and a nice reward all within about a hours playing time.  This alone makes it a far better game for the casual gamer than Everquest.<br><br>Still, I like the social aspects of Everquest and find Anarchy Online really lacking in that regard.  Without more chat features and more incentive to group up with other players, the game will never really seem like a MMORPG to me.  What I have discovered is that when I have an hour to play and just want to play a quick solo game, I log onto Anarchy Online.  But when I know I can really sit down and immerse myself into the game, a find myself going back to.  So far, I don’t think AO has the same addictive hook that EQ can exert on you.<br><br><b>Classes/Professions</b><br><br>	In my opinion, Anarchy Online went the wrong way with their profession system.  I don’t doubt that there will be some significant changes as they start to see how the players deal with it.  Anarchy Online tried to overlap the professions and also, through a skill system encourage diversity even within the professions.  In and of itself, this is not a bad thing.  This supposedly lets the players determine their own destiny rather than be pigeonholed into a role determined by the game designer.  Unfortunately, from what I can see, it has had the opposite effect.  First, the professions don’t vary that much from each other at the start.  Because of the easy availability of healing and nano restoring devices, everyone in the game can heal themselves and cast multiple spells.  Plus, everyone can wear the same armor and use the same weapons.  Naturally, everyone is going to start to figure out the best weapons, armor, nanos, etc and use their skills accordingly.  This is especially true because you get so few improvement points that you feel you can’t waste any on any skill that is not strictly necessary.  So what you get are few actual variations in classes.  Maybe they will vary more in later levels.  <br><br>Also, with the sole exception of the doctor, all of the AO classes are attack classes.  With the exception of the doctor class, there are no true support classes.  There are classes that could be used in support roles, but because most players will spend a lot of time soloing, players who choose those classes will inevitably end up spending their improvement points on attack skills rather than support skills.  This really hurts the grouping process and also reduces the variety in the game.<br><br>In contrast, Everquest’s class system is very well defined, with each class getting their own specialties, armor, weapons, spells, etc.  This can sometimes be frustrating, but it builds up a very well developed reliance upon other players and encourages grouping and interaction.  It also makes it easier to know who and what you are dealing with.  When you meet a level 25 barbarian shaman, you pretty much know what he can and can’t do.  That certainty is not present in AO.<br><br>On top of that, EQ’s variety increases replay value.  The class and race you choose in EQ will significantly effect how and where you play the game.  Play an Ogre Warrior and then play a High Elf Wizard, and you will find your aproach to the game to be completely different right from the start.  In AO, the breed and profession seem to have little effect on how you play the game.  Everyone gets weapons and spells.  They may vary in name, but they all work pretty much the same.  Are you really going to stop playing your level 150 character and start over with another profession that does much the same thing, only shoots pistols instead of machine guns?<br><br>So I have to give Everquest’s system the nod over Anarchy Online.  I have a feeling others may disagree on this.  There is something to be said about having the ability to diversify your character.  Still I know that when I switch from a Rogue to a Warrior in Everquest, I will get a completely different game experience, whereas in AO switching from a fixer to a soldier will not really change your style a whole lot.  <br><br><b>Items and Quests</b><br><br>	This is an area where Anarchy Online has really improved over Everquest.  I love the generated mission system.  You go up to a mission generator, put in your parameters and request a mission.  You will then be sent to an area to perform a duty, whether it is fixing a machine, killing a traitor, finding a lost item, or some other similar quest.  When you get there, your own private dungeon is created.  It generally takes an hour to finish and at the end, you usually get a nice reward.  You can do missions privately or in a group.  This sure beats Everquest’s go camp 10 monsters for a cheesy reward quest system.  <br><br>However, the missions are better in concept in execution, which is a general theme running through much of Anarchy Online.  I know I promised not to mention this again, but right now AO is a truly flawed game.  Missions are often broken and can’t be finished.  The pathing is so bad that you have no idea which Mob will start to shoot at you and you can often find yourself firing at a Mob through a wall while another one stand right in front of you oblivious to your presence.  When you lag, the doorways disappear and can’t be crossed, stranding you in the middle of the mission.  Still, assuming all of this gets fixed, the missions may well be the best part of Anarchy Online.<br><br>	Anarchy Online also gets a huge thumbs up for making their equipment level sensitive (well actually skill level sensitive, but it works the same way).  There will be no twinking in AO, so a newcomer will not find himself wondering why everyone else in the game his level seems to be decked out in great gear while he’s scrounging for enough credits to buy the basics.  Plus, equipment drops randomly in accordance with the level of the mob, so there is no camping in AO either.  And on top of that, just about everything can be bought in the stores.  You are not going to be forced to sit in one place for 15 hours just to get that Phat Lewt.  These are huge plusses in Anarchy Online’s favor. <br><br>	There is a negative side to this though.  Because it is so easy to get the items you want by yourself, there is little trade going on.  Also, there seem to be few, if any, unique or rare items.  I always thought items in EQ should drop more randomly, but that doesn’t mean they should become more common.  I think that the lack of rare items in AO will somewhat take away from the competition that a true game player likes to feel.  While a game should not be all about Phat Lewt, that is still a fun element of EQ that seems to be missing from AO.  Still, overall I like the way AO handles quests and items better than the way EQ handles them.<br><br><b>Overall Game Play</b><br><br>	So which game is more fun to play?  That’s really the bottom line in evaluating a game.  When you are sitting at the computer looking at the AO and EQ icons side by side, which one are you more likely going to click? <br><br>Well, that’s a complex question.<br><br>	They are both fun games.  If you can afford both, I recommend you play both.  Why?  Because of the differences.  While they are supposedly of the same genre, in many ways these are completely different games.  AO is a nice solo game that has the added advantage of having other people around to occasionally chat with and interact with and even group with.  You can play it for an hour and actually accomplish something.  Plus, I haven’t even mentioned the pvp aspects, mainly because I have not tried that yet.  EQ is a great group game where you can really lose yourself in a group experience.  When you have enough time to truly immerse yourself, this is the game to play.<br><br>	In all, even after setting aside the bugs and lag and lack of playability of AO at this time, I definitely prefer Everquest over Anarchy Online.  Of course, EQ’s had more than two years to polish and hone itself to relative perfection, and I’ve also played EQ a lot more than I have played AO, but I doubt that even in four months or so when Anarchy Online finally reaches its potential and becomes a truly final product it will surpass Everquest.  This does not mean Anarchy Online is a bust.  If you can get past the bugs and the lag there is a pretty nice game in there.  If you only have the ability to purchase one more game this year, then by all means save your money and wait for The Shadows of Luclin expansion or perhaps Dark Age of Camelot.  If you don’t mind paying $50 for something that is flawed but still kind of fun, then this game is worth a try.  Whatever you do, don’t cancel your EQ account though, because you may find yourself wanting to come back in a month or two and you will want that level 60 warrior still sitting there when you return.<br><br></blockquote></td></tr>

I'll someday help create my own mmorpg and play it instead. Til then I'll stick with EQ and my friends who play it. WWII online is interesting also, last I heard it was horribly buggy, but that was a few weeks ago. probably cleared up many of the bugs by now... I wouldn't have ever bought EQ had all my friends left "The Realm". I haven't played DragonRealms in years...I quit playing it way back when AOL had it and started charging for it :D<br><br>I really like the mission concept in AO though.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>these games can be verry addicitve. I got so disturbed watching my boss spend $600 real cash for in game currency every month.  He would buy 10,000 plat a month.  He and a lot of the people I worked with, had 4 accounts. They would play simultaneously. This is a bit too much. It can happen with AO as well, but I think there is one difference.<br><br>The reason why they bought all this for EQ was that in EQ it takes a lot of time to get something nice - which encourages a quick fix (spending real cash.)  in AO though,  you can get cool stuff without having to do this.  I can make 35,000 credits in a few hours in AO at level 12.  Althought that doesn't buy me high level gear, it does get me really nice things for my level. I dont feel a need or see a need to buy in game thigns with real cash.  my 2 cents.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Now they are few and far between. Where did all the roleplayers go???  and in DnD you had risk to yourself often from other players.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I really can't see how you enjoy EQ. But alas you do.  I played EQ for 2.5 years. Saw where it was headed and got so bored with it.<br><br>Ask yourself this: what level are you? what is your goal?  most eq players will say my goal is X level. When you reach X level you realize that, this really isn't good enough you need Y level... and when you reach Y level you realize the same thing and you want Z level... there is no pay off. <br><br>PvP looked promising but failed every time in EQ until Sullon Zek.  But still there is a MAJOR problem.  EQ does not evolve. it is static. Check out the stats for Sullon Zek on everquest.com  Go on, check out the stats. The neutrals are winning by a HUGE margin. but so what??? players repop and political boundries do not change. clearing west commons of all the human guards does not give your team control of the zone. in 30 min. all guards repop and everything resets.<br><br>This isn't so much about AO.. but EQ. EQ is a static game. I imagine you haven't played long and EQ is still fresh and new.  When you give it a couple years and find that your hell levels require you to spend 15 hours a day every weekend and 4 hours a day on weeknights - for a month to get out of the hell... then you start thinking, "why am i wasting my time for? what am I going to get if i'm 31, instead of 30? or 46 instead of 45?"  The pay off isn't there.  <br><br>Don't let the game fool you. There is no pay off. more spells/skills is a joke.  most melee classes don't get much from 30 till 50. maybe 1 skill if they are lucky. Casters get spells but the creatures they fight get harder. So everything zero's out.  There is no payoff. Sometimes my wife says, "hey I just got this high level item..." i go over and look at her character and it doesn't even show up on it!  Where is your pay off?  I played for 2 years to get a character made that fit the RP persona i made him.

Characters like monk's shouldn't have to go around and kill spiderlings and other forms of nature to level up. Paladins shouldn't group with Necromancers. and Rangers and druids shouldn't be slaughtering bears and wolves. AT every turn EQ violates it's own integrity.   <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You know, the constant comparison between EQ and AO is making me sick.  AO is in no way like EQ, other than the fact that they are Online RPG's.  Depends on how you look at it really.  AO is not a POS, I can stay connected on AO for as long as I want, Ao has just forced me to take a careful look at my windows system and tweak it a bit further.  Funny what a few changes will make.  Actually, the tweaks I have done and published actually make EQ run Smoother, not that i'll play EQ more, but AO is definately a keeper.  I've bought 2 copies myself and I in no way feel ripped off.  Funcom has excellent support, albeit no phone support, but I can live with that.  And as a side note, if you don't know how to tweak yer machine and if you Truly don't Like AO, then that will make it better for the ones that actually are playing it by having one less EQ junkie on the server lagging it down..   <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

More camping for useless crap.  Are they going to raise the level cap to 70?  Does this interest you?  Doesn't to me.  Also, to that person up there that has said Funcom was Rude to them via E-Mail.. Funcom has been nothing but TOTALLY nice to me and my wife.  They have been VERY quick, sometimes taking 3 hours for a reply back.  Also, to anyone submitting a bug report.. you have to take into consideration that the people at Funcom's english is probably a bit rusty.  You must word your bug reports in a clear and consise manner.  Cutting out the useless American lingo and chatter in your submissions will help speed the reply process up.<br><br>Take Care!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>from what i have been playing so far, AO's design is way better than EQ in many ways. It solved many problems that online RPGs had for so many years. for example, the ingame friendlist works like ICQ, i really like that idea. and offering players a bunch of dress, weapons in order to make everybody looks different, i like that very much. i mean you all wanna be unique right? that's why some people play online game because they want to show how cool or good they are (like me). there are alot to say about AO over EQ. basically, i would say AO brings RPG (no matter online or offline) into a new level of realism. there isn't really any big wrong with the game. it's the company (Funcom). if Funcom would release AO when they are all ready. i believe there won't be any arguements now. i believe all of you would say "that's right" if you have played AO...right?<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>EQ is only a challenge because it eats so much of your life away. I've played EQ for a over a year, devoting 15 hours on a Sunday or Saturday for some friggin raid, spending 3 hours sitting at the zone to Seb or KC lookin for a group, camping some uber ass item for 12 hours to make my warrior competative with others my level and the list goes on and on! EQ is a collection of stuff a friend told me in the EC tunnel the other night as I said my goodbyes (canceling account), but he pointed out that AO is gonna be the same. I agreed with him till last night on AO.<br><br>I was wandering through a 25% field (means pvp is possible) and I was jumped by a Omni faction fixer! Oh my god! I was so stoked I wanted to kick his ass LOL. EQ has never made me hunt someone through zones to try and catch them or had my attention like AO did at that moment.<br><br>I already enjoyed AO so much more than EQ (no raids, no camps, no twinking, etc) and was looking forward to pvp in AO and that made my night when I got ambushed.<br><br>If you're sick of the monotonous (spelled right?) nature of EQ then definately go with AO. People are right too, as I level it gets tougher and tougher to solo in AO and soon my friends and I will be grouping constantly. =)<br><br><br>Clatu Bladedancer<br>55th Myrmidon and Poet of Kelethin<br>Seventh Hammer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>AO is the big, new thing out currently. EQ will be losing those who are most Avant Garde obssessed to AO. AO will lose that same block of folks to DAoC, Horizons, etc.<br><br>Graphics, gameplay, etc are, IMO, are like comparing apples to oranges between the two. AO has been out a few months, EQ has been out two years. EQ has, or had, an obligation to maintain the ability to be run on the system it was initially designed for. Things have changed more than a bit since then, but EQ has kept itself back, more or less, to prevent its' customer base from suddenly being unable to play. AO was designed with today's systems in mind and thus can take advantage of Tech EQ can't gracefully use. VI is seeking to do more with today's tech level with its' intro of SoL. I will personally withhold judgement until I see it, and even then will take it with a grain of salt as it is only in the new zones. I do not expect VI to remake the entire world just for those who buy SoL.<br><br>The pigeon-holing that some of you decry is one of the strengths of EQ. Instead of looking for the same magic combo that everyone uses (ie like in AC), you are required to learn how to play your role in a group. Some folks can't take that sort of necessary effort. So sad.<br><br>As far as EQ not being an RPG, what exactly do you people expect? An RPG is not a rules set, but a mindset. If you don't believe that, cruise down to your local Game Store on RPGA night and watch the ones what are just there for the Phat Lewtz. They don't RP anymore than the d00dz in EQ. RP is an agreement, tacit or not, to suspend reality in a consensual environment. We all agree to do so, to an extent, to play this game at all, but many non-RP types are not willing to do the work necessary to properly RP and maintain a persona. For this failing on the part of the player you seek to crucify EQ? Is this logical?<br><br>I played AO in beta and decided not to buy it when it went live. I did so primarily because I realized that I do not have the patience to be a beta-tester. I did so also because I am happy with EQ and do not feel the need to rush off to somethign new and different simply because it is new and different. No reason to leave a good thing simply because I am familiar with it, but then again I have a real attention span and am not quite so distracted by the shiny objects in unproven games. Heck, I did not start playing EQ until August of 99 simply because I wanted to make sure it was not going to fold just after I dumped my hard earned cash into a new system to run it (yes my old comp was that bad).<br><br>Lastly, to those who gripe because VI "bans people without warning them", please think about the big picture. First off, the incident that you are likely referring to was an example of exploits so blatant than any normal person that plays this game would be affronted. Second, people have complained for how long that VI does not stop abusive folks? Back in the arly days when you KS, train, abuse, etc and get away with it, everyone whined that VI should not let people act this way. Then the PnP came out and those same whiners shrieked because they had a set of rules they had to conform to even when it did not suit them. People have whined for the same amount of time about how uber guilds did unfair things. VI comes down on one guild for it and everyone is up in arms. I ask again, what exactly do you expect?<br><br>Personally I consider EQ to be nothing short of the single most impressive thing to hit my computer since e-mail was invented. As of this date, none of its' competition is even close to doing what EQ does, and I doubt they will surpass it enough to draw me away any time soon.<br><br>I play EQ primarily because of the people online. Until such time as the people I enjoy playing with dissappear, I will play EQ. That simple. I will try other games (DAoC and SWG are VERY likely possibilities), but until a game far surpasses EQ (and AO is not even close), I will stay where I am at now.<br><br>Enoy em both, and good hunting.<br><br>Bulvai Hammersson, Mystic - Quellious<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I must confess straight off: I have a good amount of experience with AO (a couple of lvl 20 characters out there, and I  have played several others to about lvl 11 or so). At the same time,<br>my experience with EQ is somewhat limited - I have not had much fun with it, so I only have one character at about lvl 14, I don't even remember anymore).<br><br>I am sticking with AO. Let me tell you why.<br><br>Despite all the technical difficulties, which by the way are being cleared up at an incredible rate, Anarchy Online is not boring. I had a very interesting experience during the first month of playing. I have started a character of neutral alighnment. At the same time I had a friend who started out at Omni-Tek. I was hoping that despite of this minor difference of stance we could play together. And so I tried to get to make it all the way down south on foot.<br><br>I never made it of course but the experience of trying was incredibly exciting and real. When it says in the review that Rubi-Ka is a monotonous and uniform world - this is false. I have seen beautiful forests and mountains, rugged terrains, deserts, sunsets and sunrises (multiple suns and moons). All very detailed, complete with unique landscape features. And keep in mind, I was only lvl 8 trying to make it across the world filled with terrifying highly aggressive creatures. I had to run away from an NPC bandit gang. I also had to be very subtle trying to get direction from a group of Clan soldiers who could have killed me very easily. I did not see a whole lot, just what's around the road. It took me about three hours real time to cross the planet (teleports help). On my way, I met another fellow who was trying to cross the border between neutral zone and Omni lands, and we travelled together. We tried twice, and twice were unsuccessful. Both times we made it all the way from Newland to Four Holes just to be slayed by one kind of a wild creature or another. At the end it was well worth it. I have seen Rubi-Ka landscape unlike anything people experience when they are practicing in their newbie pen. At one point I have achieved a complete immersion into my character and into the world which surrounded me. His goals and aspirations became real to me, as well as the limitations and obstacles. For me, this is the most significant difference between AO and EQ. AO is an RPG in the true sense of the word. It is a world in which you can create a character who will struggle against his/her limitations and strive too. You are of course well advised to optimize your race/profession/skill set. At the same time you are allowed to make the choice, and not be handed over a pre-canned character who is so restricted that he/she is not really yours. In AO, there is a true sense of ownership of your character. <br><br>Oh, that's enough ranting for me. Get the game people, you will love it!<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>People Everquest was a good decent game two years ago.  But, through their policies and stances on customer support and service it is realy a turn off.  Now at first I thought EQ was a rpg, but what it realy is, is an adventure fps.  Bear with me for a second:  You hav first person view; you can deal damage to mobs; you pick up weapons and armour; and the more mobs you kill the higher in level you go.  That's an adventure game, not an rpg.  Hold on, let me define rpg.  In an rpg you create a character/persona; he has a very specific type of persona - based on race/skills/class/alignment and such; through those specific persona aspects he becomes more developed and defined and in a given situation he would "react" in a clearly identifiable way. ex: if an orc walked up to him, he would react ... like this; if the king of france walks up to him, he would react ... like this.  Also in an rpg you can tell tales about the adventures and not all adentures result in money/equipment/experience points.  Saving a puppy from a well for a little girl in a strange town doesn't render phat lewtz - that's rpg.  A little girl asking the drow (because she's young and naive about drow) to save her puppy, who then turns and casts a fireball down the well - that's rpg.<br><br>I know some of you are saying this is the best implementation that a computer can come up with, insofar as rpg's are concerned, I beg to differ.  Horizons and dark age of camelot seems to be trying to hit this very mark.<br><br>Ask yourselves this: in everquest could you truely be 'EVIL' on a blue server.  Sullong zek seems to be trying to hit this on the head, but time will tell after all the nerfs and rules changes.  Can you be truely evil, can you rape/pillage/burn/train "WITHOUT GETTING /REPORTED".  Some people say training people isn't being evil, it's being a jerk to a player.  Wouldn't a drow do that?  Wouldn't a troll bend over backwards to make you miserable?  Wouldn't a necromancer command legions of undead to decimate your lands? - that's all rpg.  <br><br>Only in EQ can a dark elf necromancer serving inoruuk walk into north freeport and hug the paladin/cleric guild master.  Only on EQ could a priest of inoruuk go to the plane of hate and be thrashed by every living being from the plane of hate.<br><br>Remember drizzt, the drow priestess'es were in fact systematically thrashed by lolths handservants, but they also visited them and had extensive conversations with them, and even came to their beck and call, depending on importance and level.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Do you really think that 33k people are playing every day a game that doesn't work?  hehe <br><br>Yes there are issues.  Just like EQ had - even now has.  They will get resolved. I respect your choice to not buy AO. But the game does work. There are specific issues to specific areas in the game. Many people dont even experience lag. Did you know that?  Some (like me) experience a LOT of lag. But yet I prefer this game to EQ. I've played EQ for 2 years. I grew to hate what the administration made it. A game with no pay off... no real goal or evolving world. The world doesn't change. New continents, but no evolution. no goal. no wars. even on pvp it's just not there yet.  <br><br>Another structure is required to simulate war and battle.  AO is making steps to that end, so is Neocron, so is Shadowbane, etc.  <br><br>With all the issues in AO, I still find myself not playing EQ. I gave AO a fair chance. what I learned was this. <br>**Even if AO doesn't improve and I end up quiting it, AO showed me a valuable lesson - EQ just give me nothing no entertainment. And most people i know who play who won't admit this are so blind to the fact they spent all of last weekend frustrated from some dragon raid, or some terible guild event, or the utter lack of Roleplaying or just hte fact there is no pay off for gaining levels.**<br><br>Ao isn't the answer, it's a pointer to the fact EQ has failed for many and it's time to move on to something better. Neocron, AO, Star Wars, DAOC, Horizons, Shadowbane.... something with better structure....<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
