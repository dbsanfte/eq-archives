	 <tr><td colspan=2><blockquote><img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/ao100.gif" alt="Category: Anarchy Online" width=100 height=100 align=right>Anarchy Online has been out almost a month now.  I know there have to be some Everquest players out there wondering about Anarchy Online and how it compares to EQ.  I beta tested Everquest and have been playing it ever since.  I also beta tested Anarchy Online and have been playing it since it was released a few weeks ago.  Of course, I have seen a lot more of EQ than AO, so there are things that I can’t compare quite yet, but I still thought I would give you my initial impressions to help you decide if AO is a game you might want to try.  So here is my comparison and review.<br><PAUSE><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>This is something I feel needs to be stated right up front, because I am going to try to ignore it for the rest of the review.  At the moment, Anarchy Online is not a quality, playable game.  The game was released with Funcom fully knowing that it was bugged, incomplete and unplayable.  I was a beta tester and I was astounded when I discovered that the version we were playing those last weeks of beta was truly just a step from the release version.  Frankly, I believe that any legitimate company should hang their heads in shame after releasing a game in this bad a shape.  Funcom then rubbed salt into the wounds of even their most loyal customers by announcing that the game was “110%” playable two weeks after release, setting off the clock on the 30 days you get with your purchase and assuring that they will start charging people for a game many cannot yet play.<br><br>The lag in the game is horrendous.  Anytime you get close to more than a handful of other players, your frame rate drops to almost nothing and you find yourself standing in place.  What’s worse about this is that you can’t sit or move your curser enough to even log out of the game, and you are often forced to stand there for five minutes or more hoping to just get out of the game.  Of course, you can always alt-tab to windows and control-alt-delete the game closed, but that seems like a pretty extreme measure.  Basically, this means that you are better off just not trying to play during the typical prime time hours.<br><br>The pathing in the game is so bad that when you are in a mission your best chance is to move to a room, stand still and wait to see what starts to shoot at you.  Of course, then it is often in another room and shooting through the walls, but at least you can shoot it back that way.  Mobs can attack you through walls and across the playing field without you even seeing them or knowing where to go to fight back.  Quite often you will lag out during a fight, which makes it impossible to use your special attacks, and then come back in and find out that you died.<br><br>High patience and a low frustration level are required to play this game right now.  A high performance machine and high speed internet connection are also a lot of help.  If you go in expecting a beta quality game, you will probably still be amazed at the problems.  Still, many people are able to play the game, so for those of you who are willing to overlook the obvious problems and want to delve into the actual game lurking behind the bugs, I’ll try to give you my view of how it plays.<br><br><b>Graphics and Sound</b><br><br>	The graphics of Anarchy Online are crisper and more realistic than those of Everquest.  There are nice little touches that really add to the feel of the world.  The sky effects are pretty amazing and there are things like little robots and flying birds that add a touch of realism to the game.  The player models are stunning and the number of outfits you can wear are astonishing.  I created a female character just to experiment with the rather racy outfits you can buy at the store.  This is definitely a PG game.  With all the variety, I don’t doubt that you could really get to the point where you can recognize a person just by his or her looks.  They also programmed some fun emotes into the game, letting you really express yourself.  I know I got a lot of work out of the /anger command when the zones weren’t working right after release.<br><br>Still, even with such crisp graphics, I find the world to be a little drab.  I am sure it is by design, since Rubi-Ka is defined as a dead world that is slowly being terraformed, but there is very little color and variety amongst the cities and zones.  Part of the fun in Everquest is zoning into a new zone and seeing how different it is from the rest of the world.  Everquest has forests, plains, jungles, oceans, lakes, mountains and a whole variety of other types of terrain.  From what I have seen so far, much of Anarchy Online is the same.  So, while I like the individual graphics in AO better then EQ, overall I think I prefer the look of Norrath to the look of Rubi-Ka.<br><br>	When it comes to the sound track and sound effects, AO has EQ beat by a mile.  I always thought that the music in Everquest was almost an afterthought by the developers.  If I recall correctly, music was not even introduced into the game until several months after its release.  A good soundtrack can help get the heart thumping and add to the excitement of a battle.  AO has this and EQ doesn’t.  When I play EQ, I find myself turning down the sound, but when I play AO I like to really crank it.<br><br><b>Soloing and Grouping</b><br><br>This is an area where these two games differ significantly.  Everquest is strictly a group game.  While soloing is possible, it is difficult to do and time consuming.  In general, groups are easy to form and, because the classes are so well defined, you can form a group of total strangers and fairly quickly figure out everyone’s role in the fights to come.  <br><br>Anarchy Online is just the opposite.  It is very easy to solo, and in many ways it is preferable.  I have found it very difficult to find a group because most people have quickly discovered that you can get higher experience and better rewards by soloing.  Moreover, when you do get into a group most people are confused about what they are supposed to do and in the end everyone basically just blasts away at the mob until it is dead.  I assume as people get higher in levels and more specialized that things will change, but groups will never be as easy to define as in Everquest simply because the professions in AO are not so easily pigeonholed into defined roles.<br><br>This has led to an interesting development in the game.  Anarchy Online is simply not as social a game as Everquest.  There is no general chat like the zone chat of Everquest and with fewer groups and faster leveling, it is much harder to meet people and make friends.  It is more like a bunch of single player games being played simultaneously on the same server.  Some of this is due to the lag, which causes most people to do everything they can to avoid other players, but even without the lag, I doubt this will ever be much of a group game. <br><br>The advantage of this soloability is that Anarchy Online is able to be played in short bursts.  If you only have an hour or two to play Everquest, it is almost not worth playing.  By the time you log in, get to a zone, find a group and get into a rhythm it is time to log back out.  However, with Anarchy Online, you can grab a mission, play it through and gain a half a level’s worth of experience and a nice reward all within about a hours playing time.  This alone makes it a far better game for the casual gamer than Everquest.<br><br>Still, I like the social aspects of Everquest and find Anarchy Online really lacking in that regard.  Without more chat features and more incentive to group up with other players, the game will never really seem like a MMORPG to me.  What I have discovered is that when I have an hour to play and just want to play a quick solo game, I log onto Anarchy Online.  But when I know I can really sit down and immerse myself into the game, a find myself going back to.  So far, I don’t think AO has the same addictive hook that EQ can exert on you.<br><br><b>Classes/Professions</b><br><br>	In my opinion, Anarchy Online went the wrong way with their profession system.  I don’t doubt that there will be some significant changes as they start to see how the players deal with it.  Anarchy Online tried to overlap the professions and also, through a skill system encourage diversity even within the professions.  In and of itself, this is not a bad thing.  This supposedly lets the players determine their own destiny rather than be pigeonholed into a role determined by the game designer.  Unfortunately, from what I can see, it has had the opposite effect.  First, the professions don’t vary that much from each other at the start.  Because of the easy availability of healing and nano restoring devices, everyone in the game can heal themselves and cast multiple spells.  Plus, everyone can wear the same armor and use the same weapons.  Naturally, everyone is going to start to figure out the best weapons, armor, nanos, etc and use their skills accordingly.  This is especially true because you get so few improvement points that you feel you can’t waste any on any skill that is not strictly necessary.  So what you get are few actual variations in classes.  Maybe they will vary more in later levels.  <br><br>Also, with the sole exception of the doctor, all of the AO classes are attack classes.  With the exception of the doctor class, there are no true support classes.  There are classes that could be used in support roles, but because most players will spend a lot of time soloing, players who choose those classes will inevitably end up spending their improvement points on attack skills rather than support skills.  This really hurts the grouping process and also reduces the variety in the game.<br><br>In contrast, Everquest’s class system is very well defined, with each class getting their own specialties, armor, weapons, spells, etc.  This can sometimes be frustrating, but it builds up a very well developed reliance upon other players and encourages grouping and interaction.  It also makes it easier to know who and what you are dealing with.  When you meet a level 25 barbarian shaman, you pretty much know what he can and can’t do.  That certainty is not present in AO.<br><br>On top of that, EQ’s variety increases replay value.  The class and race you choose in EQ will significantly effect how and where you play the game.  Play an Ogre Warrior and then play a High Elf Wizard, and you will find your aproach to the game to be completely different right from the start.  In AO, the breed and profession seem to have little effect on how you play the game.  Everyone gets weapons and spells.  They may vary in name, but they all work pretty much the same.  Are you really going to stop playing your level 150 character and start over with another profession that does much the same thing, only shoots pistols instead of machine guns?<br><br>So I have to give Everquest’s system the nod over Anarchy Online.  I have a feeling others may disagree on this.  There is something to be said about having the ability to diversify your character.  Still I know that when I switch from a Rogue to a Warrior in Everquest, I will get a completely different game experience, whereas in AO switching from a fixer to a soldier will not really change your style a whole lot.  <br><br><b>Items and Quests</b><br><br>	This is an area where Anarchy Online has really improved over Everquest.  I love the generated mission system.  You go up to a mission generator, put in your parameters and request a mission.  You will then be sent to an area to perform a duty, whether it is fixing a machine, killing a traitor, finding a lost item, or some other similar quest.  When you get there, your own private dungeon is created.  It generally takes an hour to finish and at the end, you usually get a nice reward.  You can do missions privately or in a group.  This sure beats Everquest’s go camp 10 monsters for a cheesy reward quest system.  <br><br>However, the missions are better in concept in execution, which is a general theme running through much of Anarchy Online.  I know I promised not to mention this again, but right now AO is a truly flawed game.  Missions are often broken and can’t be finished.  The pathing is so bad that you have no idea which Mob will start to shoot at you and you can often find yourself firing at a Mob through a wall while another one stand right in front of you oblivious to your presence.  When you lag, the doorways disappear and can’t be crossed, stranding you in the middle of the mission.  Still, assuming all of this gets fixed, the missions may well be the best part of Anarchy Online.<br><br>	Anarchy Online also gets a huge thumbs up for making their equipment level sensitive (well actually skill level sensitive, but it works the same way).  There will be no twinking in AO, so a newcomer will not find himself wondering why everyone else in the game his level seems to be decked out in great gear while he’s scrounging for enough credits to buy the basics.  Plus, equipment drops randomly in accordance with the level of the mob, so there is no camping in AO either.  And on top of that, just about everything can be bought in the stores.  You are not going to be forced to sit in one place for 15 hours just to get that Phat Lewt.  These are huge plusses in Anarchy Online’s favor. <br><br>	There is a negative side to this though.  Because it is so easy to get the items you want by yourself, there is little trade going on.  Also, there seem to be few, if any, unique or rare items.  I always thought items in EQ should drop more randomly, but that doesn’t mean they should become more common.  I think that the lack of rare items in AO will somewhat take away from the competition that a true game player likes to feel.  While a game should not be all about Phat Lewt, that is still a fun element of EQ that seems to be missing from AO.  Still, overall I like the way AO handles quests and items better than the way EQ handles them.<br><br><b>Overall Game Play</b><br><br>	So which game is more fun to play?  That’s really the bottom line in evaluating a game.  When you are sitting at the computer looking at the AO and EQ icons side by side, which one are you more likely going to click? <br><br>Well, that’s a complex question.<br><br>	They are both fun games.  If you can afford both, I recommend you play both.  Why?  Because of the differences.  While they are supposedly of the same genre, in many ways these are completely different games.  AO is a nice solo game that has the added advantage of having other people around to occasionally chat with and interact with and even group with.  You can play it for an hour and actually accomplish something.  Plus, I haven’t even mentioned the pvp aspects, mainly because I have not tried that yet.  EQ is a great group game where you can really lose yourself in a group experience.  When you have enough time to truly immerse yourself, this is the game to play.<br><br>	In all, even after setting aside the bugs and lag and lack of playability of AO at this time, I definitely prefer Everquest over Anarchy Online.  Of course, EQ’s had more than two years to polish and hone itself to relative perfection, and I’ve also played EQ a lot more than I have played AO, but I doubt that even in four months or so when Anarchy Online finally reaches its potential and becomes a truly final product it will surpass Everquest.  This does not mean Anarchy Online is a bust.  If you can get past the bugs and the lag there is a pretty nice game in there.  If you only have the ability to purchase one more game this year, then by all means save your money and wait for The Shadows of Luclin expansion or perhaps Dark Age of Camelot.  If you don’t mind paying $50 for something that is flawed but still kind of fun, then this game is worth a try.  Whatever you do, don’t cancel your EQ account though, because you may find yourself wanting to come back in a month or two and you will want that level 60 warrior still sitting there when you return.<br><br></blockquote></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/shrug people have this tendency to get into one camp or the other, and get so attached to it they are blind to the problems it has and blind to the benefits of the other side. Its like rooting for a college football team. <br><br>AO has serious technical problems and it was truly an insult to release a game this far from ready. But, Funcom actually pays attention to bug reports, and I haven't heard them say "It's working as intended" yet. That being said, however, if they don't start stamping out this memory leak soon I'm going to start playing AO a lot less. I have 640 mb of memory for gods sake and it eats it like candy.<br><br>There's nothing per se wrong with EQ, downtime does suck though, and the fact I can play ao for 2 hours and enjoy myself and make forward progress is fun. It's also patently true that I don't get as much social interaction in AO though, so 2 hours is about all i can do before I start growing much more bored, unless a friend or two from RL is on. <br><br>So, bottom line, EQ is way more time intensive, but I really enjoy the social aspects, and its fun to have rare/unique items, so that aspect of the "camping/ubermob" method does add some fun. <br><br>On the other hand, AO is gonna be very slick for the casual gamer once the story line starts up, and IF and ONLY IF they stamp out a ton of bugs very soon. <br><br>I honesty think the most bitter, die-hard people supporting AO right now are generally the ones who felt left out because they couldn't get into their local uberguild or whatever. So they're taking it out on EQ. /shrug whatever, they're both good games, or will be if Funcom ever gets their @#%^ together. <br><br>My dream? Funcom's attention to customers making complaints, and some of their nifty ideas, combined with a product as technically sound as EQ. Now there would be a game. It could be AO if they ever work out the bugs.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Maybe If I wasn't and never had the expectations of planes armor and dragon loot I would not have been. <br><br>EQ was just too much like punching a clock and your uber guild could get too much like a weird pyramid scam or chain letter where the people on top got rewarded and you tryed to crawl and rip your way up there punching that clock more and more. In the end, after two years, I really had more good loot that I spent less time getting on my own while I assited in getting lots of people in my guild great stuff.. yay.. and wasting lots of time. <br><br>The irony is that if I'd spent like 1/4 of that time and energy on a job in real life, I'd be like vice president of some company and filthy rich.<br><br>"So they're taking it out on EQ. /shrug whatever, they're both good games, or will be if Funcom ever gets their @#%^ together. ""<br><br>I would not call EQ a "good" game, its severely flawed because it has too much downtime and too much seperation of the haves and have nots. In some ways EQ can cease being a "game" at all. That is why I like AO more now.<br><br>AO is JUST a game, it doesn't make me yearn to get in a try to get some uber loot or camp something like EQ did.. drooling like a crack fiend. But that is a GOOD thing. Its just a game.<br><br>It might not be as good as EQ right now, but its a better "game" because that is all it is. EQ is something else entirely.<br><br>AO has some new code on the test server which should address many complaints. Of course currently that patch on the test server is making people lose like ALL of their XP and fall for huge damage when zoning and various other odd things. In AO the test server is REALLY the test server ;)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I decided to cancel my AO account.  I won't go into my reasons why, but I decided to share with you my adventure in doing so.  As it turns out, it's ridiculously easy to do.  In fact, turns out I canceled my account accidentally before I intended to without realizing it.  If you've played AO, then you know that in the login interface, among other things, there's a button that says login, and a button that says account.  Now, any reasonable person would assume that if you hit the account button, that you would be taken to a page or screen that allows you to either view or change current account info, or cancel your account if so desired.  If you click this button, however, that is not quite what happens.  Your web browser opens and you get a screen where you are asked to enter in you account name and password.  Assuming it accepts, your info, the next screen, at least for me on several occasions has two pieces of info.. aside from the banner and title bar.  To the right it says this screen is a work in progress, will be updated by July to be more funtional, etc.  This has been there since day 1.  On the other side of the screen, it says, once again at least for me, that my account has been canceled, and can be reactivated later.  Does anyone else see the problem here??  I exchanged several e-mails with Funcom tech support, and they verified that if someone clicks the aforementioned account button and logs in thinking that they would then be able to view and / or edit their account info, what they really end up doing is canceling their account unintentionally.  Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, how stupid is it for a business to set up a system where it is so easy for someone to cancel their account accidentally??  The last message I got from Funcom tech support indicated that this is yet another problem that they are aware of and are working on.  So, alot of you think of Sony / Verant as the evil corporate giant, and I'm not going to dispute that opinion.  But, in comparison to Sony / Verant, Funcom seems like a bunch of inexperienced amateurs that are in over their head.  When a company responds to a complaint letter with a canned pre-generated response, that is understandable as the company wants to make sure that the complainer has tried the obvious solutions.  However, when a company doesn't even bother to check their canned pregenerated response for gramattical and spelling errors, it makes the company look very 2nd rate and amateurish.  The first response I got from Funcom was so gramatically inept, I wish I had saved it for entertainment purposes.  So, I am giving up on AO and sticking with EQ for the time being.  Eventhough I do not like what Sony / Verant does all the time, at least they know what they are doing.  I can not say the same for Funcom.<br><br>Mortiis X'Ian of Bertoxxulous<br>46th Tier'Dal Necromancer<br><br>Vitaee Vetavegamin of Bertoxxulous<br>35th Fier'Dal Druid<br><br>P.S.

Some like their meat rare, some well done. Me? <br><br>I'm a lvl 52 druid. I'm happily cancelling my two EQ accounts for AO. Why?<br><br>1) At high levels, I can't level without spending INSANE amounts of time soloing creatures (talk about BORING- THIS IS BORING) or grouping (takes even longer).<br><br>2) At high levels, I can't get uber loot without going on plane raids, which are scheduled at one per month/2 months, coz there's a queue. And then I get a 0.01% chance of getting a piece of armor or loot.<br><br>3) If I die on plane raids etc, corpse retrieval can take many hours.<br><br>4) camping for placeholders for a chance to loot some uber loot or as part of a quest.<br><br>5) many of the spawns need a guild or group to tackle. Which means guild trouble because everyone in guild have their own epic/quests to complete. My own guild split up because of this sort of thing.<br><br>6) All of the above is great if I can spend like 8 hours a day playing, 30 days a month. I don't.<br><br>Oh, did I mention that I'm a great fan of Verant? I love the way they think EQ is their world. Actually, they are right, and they can have it back.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are many inciteful responses on this subject. Although I have to point out that if you do not have experience with both games then you should before making any judgements. <br><br>I have played EQ for over 2 years and I have played AO since release. On that note I would like to make just a few comments..<br><br>Some have stated AO is too easy, and have even gone as far as calling it more hack and slash.<br>These are from the people who have not played AO long enough or at all.. You must remember that AO is based on a storyline. The hunting may become relatively easy but unlike EQ that is not your goal. <br><br>The goal in EQ is to get level 60 and to get the best items/equipment you can.<br><br>The goal in AO is to win the war between the Omni Tek Corporation and the Rebel Clans. Getting better items/equipment along the way for an ultimate goal.<br><br>If combat with the wildlife is easier I assure you the combat against the other players is challenging. <br><br>Funcom isn't going to sit back and watch either, based on the war there will be significant changes made to the world. <br><br>Now about the review..  <br><br>AO more a solo game? flat out wrong.. you have the OPTION, but remember the game objective.. you're not going to take down Omni Tek with one Clan agent. <br>I have always been one that loved to solo.. and I play an adventurer on AO (a class more suited for solo play) yet I have grouped about 50 percent of the time online and would have grouped 90 percent if I didn't turn down many invites. <br><br>Graphics.. now this is chalked up as opinion, but IMO AO graphics make EQ look pathetic. As far as the world goes, I think its beautiful and more as if I am looking out a window rather than a monitor.<br> <br>Classes/Professions<br><br>Outstanding job on AO.. there is tremendous diversablity. Its up to you. As far as all "attack classes"  /chuckle ..all I have to say is did you actually play the same game? Fixer, Trader, Bureacrat.. these are not "attack classes" and even the Engineer and Agent can be developed as non attack classes.. I have a friend whose agent specializes fully in covert operations and his offense leaves alot to be desired but its not his specialty.. know the game before writing a review.<br><br>I had alot of fun with EQ but it left me yearning for more, mainly for a reason besides just getting stuff. I have found more with AO..<br><br>Bottom line..<br><br>play what you have fun playing.. and do not listen to all the posts here.. check them out for yourself.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Anarchy Online is boring.<br><br>That's the main problem.<br><br>The game play is repetetive beyond belief. I imagine action-gamers who like stat-based "character development" will enjoy it, but it seems simplistic, derivative, unimaginative and tedious to me.<br><br>Character building seems to rely pretty much on stat and equipment improvement. There is nothing I've found that you can do which allows you give your character personality. What trade skills there are are broken, and even if they fix them they are all purely geared towards the same equipment-based gameplay.<br><br>Allakhazam's review is pretty much right on the money, except that I think the Mission system is an idiotic dead-end. It's online single player gaming - nothing multiple, let alone massively multiple about it. EQ quests are vastly more interesting to do.<br><br>Grouping in AO gives you massive xp bonuses, but with no chat channel outside cities that goes much beyond line-of-sight, it's pretty tough to get a pick-up group. People are trying to group to get the bonus, but a lot more are soloing. You can see that by the reaction you get if you try to shout for a group in a busy area.<br><br>Also if you think EQ groups are dependent on healers and enchanters, you should try an AO group without a Doctor.<br><br>Soloing is easier than EQ, it's true. However, it's also about as interesting as whitewashing a fence. Get the optimum weapon for your skill (Freedom Arms, Mausser, whatever) - find the little area where the semi-static spawns of the correct level mill around - blast them and heal yourselve. Voila, one hour = one level and one exceptionally bored player. Or do the same in a mission, get better loot but add another hour for the trip to and from the mission terminal.<br><br>The graphics are good, but the scenery is dull. If it was a real place it would definitely not have much of a tourist industry. You can travel much more safely than in EQ (nothing much paths across roads) but there is far, far less to look at on the journey.<br><br>The graphics deal with fights terribly, too. You can barely see what's happening - the name of the creature you are killing takes up more space than the creature itself, sometimes.<br><br>Upgrading and maintaining your equipment is a constant chore. Tedious, repetetive, frustrating. You have the choice of carrying so much ammunition you can hardly walk or running back to town every 20 minutes when you run out of bullets.<br><br>And you need to change your weapon and armor constantly to keep pace with the things you're fighting. I can wear the same kit and use the same weapon for 10 or 15 levels in EQ - in AO I have to upgrade every three or four levels - and thats 3 or 4 on a 200 level system, not 60.<br><br>Nothing has any real personality or individuality. The guards don't have names, the monsters drop "Monster Parts". Everyone looks slightly different, but most of them look like the Gimp or a cheerleader or someone from the Matrix. <br><br>All of these complaints relate to innate design failures, not to the lamentable technical problems. At the moment there is a sense of achievement in getting anything done at all, but once the game is completely fixed, bug-free and playable the deep, deep boredom of the gameplay will become all too apparent.<br><br>To sum up, I think that when the appalling bugs, exploits and technical problems are finally ironed out, Anarchy Online will be a fair-to-middling semi-rpg, suitable for teenagers and people with a very short attention span. If the storyline turns out to be any good it may attract roleplayers who prefer SF to fantasy as well, though I doubt it.<br><br>Adults and anyone of any age who doesn't find stats fascinating in and of themselves are going to lose patience with AO very fast indeed.<br><br>As, indeed, I already have.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

EQ is all about building up EQUIPMENT with BETTER stats than the LAST piece of equipment you got SIX months AGO....talk about LAME....and where is the ADVENTURE in EQ? AND the EXP IS LAME IN EQ....HOURS even DAYS sometimes just to gain ONE LEVEL and in some levels 31,36,41 and 45 you can lose that EXP just like that unless you BEG for a REZ or PAY out your arse for one....EQ is built around STRESS....you go inside a deep hard dungeon and die, you can't retrieve your corpse....24 hours baby and it's gone!!!! NOT IN AO, in AO you get ALL your equipment back from the last save and saving costs very little compared to the amount of loot one aquires from missions...AO is FUN, you get to PLAY a game and you are lame for saying it's pure SOLO....just because you couldn't find a group doesn't mean everyone can't....I've always been able to find a group and I like the skill points to put into my character along the way of leveling instead of STATIC stats like EQ that can only be increase by better equipment that's either FARMED to death and you have to play out the YING YANG to buy....or take HOURS or DAYS to Aquire from the constant SAME SPOT SAME PLACE OVER AND OVER KILLING OF THE SAME BORING SPAWN yeah baby that's REAL FUN isn't it?!!! LOL The Real MEAT of AO hasn't even started yet, the WAR between the CLAN and OMNI....it's a non-pvp with PvP elements blended in in certain areas, I like that aspect....I can PvP when I want to and just go adventuring when I want to....and you obviously must have just played the VERY EASY missions to see it as repetitive and boring....one can adjust the missions to make them as easy or hard as they want to AND one can also NOT LOOK at the very bottom of the mission if they want to be surprised at the mission loot, and futhermore I've had some better drops off the mission mobs than the mission gave me anyways!!! I'm sure you'll just love camping Dilyn Starfire in Highhold Pass oh boy yes that is sooooo challenging and eight hour camp that has been KSed time and time again....YEAH BOY that's real ADVENTURE and FUN.....EQ is great for one thing ....SOCIALIZING because you have MORE TIME to do that than anything else!!!

You fight a battle which might last 30 seconds to one minute and poof....most all of your mana is consumed....so you sit there again looking at a silly book until level 35 when they finally let you see while medding...this is totally stupid....and boring after just a few tiimes of it.....casters spend more play time SITTING and MEDDING than they do actually PLAYING their characters combat ablities. Now tanks (pure melee types or hybrids) on the other hand well lol even worse for them if they don't have a HEALER type around, they can spend up to TWENTY minutes healing up full hit points again....TWENTY minutes of doing nothing but sitting there.....thus the "forced" grouping nature of the game....The game has lost it's excitement to me....when I started realizing how much time I actually spent PLAYING the game vs just SITTING looking at a stupid book of spells....I decided it was time to end the waste of time with EQ. Yes it has pretty scenery, the combat is pretty stale, press the A key and the program takes over randomly hitting or missing based solely on stats....no super moves.....no real special abilities....just another button to press for a kick or a bash that is random as the main weapon....I've played D&D and RPG's for 20 years....and DEX was always a part of HITTING in those games....DEX in EQ characters does nothing more than increase your hitting skills over time, which still results in a random hit or miss based on level of character vs level of monster...period. It also is part of the procing of weapons with special effects on them and also whether a  casters spell goes off or not....I would expect in a D&D game or RPG game if I have 180dex to hit VERY often not hit...miss....miss...hit....hit....miss....miss...blah.... It's a Pretty Boys game and it's a game for people who like to BRAG....I've never seen so many braggers in all my life....and idiots who don't even know how to play a character and beggers wanting you to GIVE them items and Powerlevel them.....just from what I've read AO sounds like the game for me.....Get to the MEAT of the game, give me ACTION not a stupid book of pages to look at for six to eight minutes....give me entertainment.....not buttfaces who come along and KS just because they can or UBER guilds always camping the best items in the game because they are all level 60's. If you've never played EQ...don't waste your hard earned money on it, customer service is awful...guides and GM's can be worse than the players....you can't say anything to them....they are quick to accuse YOU of something while they commit the same crime....especially the naming policy. They are not specialists in the customer service field not in the least they are as arrogant as some of the players. But, if you like to chitty chat and socialize more than play a game of fantasy then EQ IS FOR YOU. Because that is surely what you'll have LOTS of time to spend doing while waiting on a  six to twenty minute spawn to pop and in some areas some things don't spawn for a WEEK!! Why did I play it for two years you might ask? It was the only mmorpg with great GRAPHICS...Ultima Online was poor....Asherons Call was poor and sticky in spots. So I WASTED my time, but, not all of it playing EQ....I did play DIABLO2 and Baldurs Gate series all the way through along the way. If only they had bigger areas, longer adventures.....I think Morrowind when it comes out is gonna rock...just too bad it won't be an online game. Neverwinter nights will be a good and real RPG online....EQ needs a facelift....less DOWNTIME and INDIVIDUAL quests like AO would change my mind about it...like I said I want to PLAY not sit....I want entertainment not frustration in corpse retrieval and I want it to be as easy to solo and play as it is to group and play. <br><br>Take it or leave it....if ya like it do it ;)<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Most people who are leaving for AO seem to be those who have not been on EQ for that long.  I have put so much time into EQ that to throw it away for a game that seems to be shakey at best is just stupid.  I know what it was like gettin to the top in EQ.  There were times when i serioulsy thought about beating the @#%^ out of my computer after a death or cursing at the top of my lungs when someone who just joined my group in guk won an fbss in about 5 mins after i had been there for 5 hours.  But when you get to the top, its so much easier and so much more fun.  People actually know what theyre doing and there isnt much risk of death or at least without a almost full exp rez.  I say let those who have never or hardly played either AC or EQ make up there own mind.  And if you really are sick of EQ then go.  I personally took 5 months off of EQ and when i came back the game overall just felt better.  I dont care that much about the deaths or the phat loots anymore, but more about having a good time with lifelong friends ive made in the game or with complete strangers.  Once you get to high lvls the @#%^s are very few and if you happen to be one, everyone knows your name =P.  I can say that i dont like verant and their goddamn vision.  I dont like the camping or how much time it consumes, but i give them credit in that when you get that piece of equipment that took you ever so long to get, it is really rewarding because not every frickin person in the world has it.  This is just me, but i love magic blastin and sword slashin better than gun totin for a MMORG.  I have a million quake clones to choose from for that.     <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2><br>Everquest is an empty promise. The possibilty of that promise being fulfilled keeps you playing. It never really is fulfilled. It is so very much like an addiction. <br><br>I remember reading a post by someone at a forum which listed the qualifications for something being an unhealthy life altering addiction such as drinking or doing cocaine or whatever and the warning signs. EQ fit every single one of them such as doing it at the expense of other activities, at the expense of seeing your family or interacting with loved ones, lying about doing it, etc. Although they mentioned EQ fitting these, they did not have to do so. It would have really had more impact if they just posted the list and let the reader draw the conclusion and then perhaps look in the mirror. <br><br>"Most people who are leaving for AO seem to be those who have not been on EQ for that long. I have put so much time into EQ that to throw it away for a game that seems to be shakey at best is just stupid."<br><br>2 years and the beta too, played the hell out of it.<br><br>Look at what you are saying, "put so much time into it." You are saying that because EQ is like a job, its like work, its like a huge downtime social networking game where you must get a position eventually in an uber guild. You start to look at it as time invested. Its more of an advanced social experiment akin to having too many rats in a cage with too little food than it is a game. Its a massively multiplayer mostly PVE king of the hill simulation.<br><br>I'll never view AO as something I "put so much time into." Its just a game. AO is like the quake or half life of MMORPGs in a way. I could be playing it in 5 months or it might have run its course by then I'll be playing some other game. The thing is, that is a good thing. It is healthy.<br><br>" I personally took 5 months off of EQ and when i came back the game overall just felt better"<br><br>It looks like to me you are not even really reading what you are writing yourself. I can't ever remember using the phrase "took off" time from something if it was something which was just fun or a game. You take time "off" from things like work, or college. You don't take time "off" from relaxed recreational activities. You don't say "hanging out with my friends and laughing and such is just so fun that I had to take 5 months off from it."<br><br>"There were times when i serioulsy thought about beating the @#%^ out of my computer after a death or cursing at the top of my lungs when someone who just joined my group in guk won an fbss in about 5 mins after i had been there for 5 hours"<br><br>Ahaha that is so funny because in another post I said something similar but in a list of the things that I thought was WRONG with Everquest. Once again you simply are not describing what has to do with a "game" or "fun." I don't have fun on the computer and feel like beating it up.<br><br>"....when you get that piece of equipment that took you ever so long to get, it is really rewarding because not every frickin person in the world has it."<br><br>Yep, they pretty much do actually unless its something super rare like a cloak of flames on a newer server. I had a 55 druid and 2 of my twinks had jboots, from when it was a quest. Uncommon rare things become very common fast. I spent a total of 50 minutes ALL TOTAL camping for the jboots, in fact I did not camp at all really. One time OOT was empty and I killed the spawns and ran around, killed the oracle guy, ran around more, killed spawn (still no one else showing up to camp it) 4th spawn AC. Another time I logged out in OOT at sister island to perhaps have a go at a couple spawns there. Server was down, I get on not even knowing if server was up (was after a patch) I get on, swim to the island, AC was up. No one was around at all. I killed it, get the ring, potty self and then 2 casters show up after I run around the island in excitement. They go "we are here camping this spot, sorry." I did not have the hear to tell them that they were about 5 minutes late ;)<br><br>See other people camped jboots for like 28 hours before getting them. That is the crazy way that a super rare random low roll works and why it really does not make sense to skew "difficulty" that way. Ironically the way that verant always said they intended people to get rare stuff is "just happening by" like I did basically. The design does not foster that though but instead fosters camping behavior.<br><br>AO is just a game, it got me to finally kick the EQ habit just because it is just a game. Am I going to remember AO in 40 real time years of my life when I'm old? No. Will I remember the 2 real time years of my life that I wasted in a game world at the expense of friends and family and life in general in Everquest? Yes I will, but it won't be fondly but rather with regret and wondering what might have happened instead if I'd taken the time to live and smell the roses.<br>Life is short, I frankly don't want to play another mmorpg that swept me into it like EQ did because I just don't have the life to waste.<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The main problems and compliants with Everquest have been 100% resolved. Your requests have been answered by Funcom. My main problems with everquest were camping and spending 6 hours playing and coming up with negative experience. Repeated death doing CR was insane. I played an Ogre SK and a Wood Elf Druid. The main reason I played a druid is because I was tired of dying 6 times in a row trying to get my body back.<br><br>I cancelled my account when I couldn't get my druid body back and my stuff was deleted. I had to work, I couldn't sit down for an hour and a half and get my body, so I lost everything. I lost 80 swatches of silk and all my gear. <br><br>In AO you keep your body so no CR and you don't get negative experience from when you started playing.<br><br>I camped the Testament of Veeshan (sp) for 8 hours trying to get a stupid no drop book. And this was level 20. 8 HOURS of sitting and watching a tent. Couldn't move, couldn't leave, might loose that camp... <br><br>If for those two reasons alone I would recommend trying out AO or switching completely like I did. Sometimes I'm a serious gamer, sometimes I'm casual because I have clients that need me to put in a lot of hours sometimes. AO doesn't penalize me, it allows me to pick how I want to play. <br><br>Now as for the game itself, and gameplay, yes there are problems. I don't need a perfect product though, I just want one I can enjoy. After upgrading my memory I'm hoping to eliminate the city lag. (Also going to try to turn down textures after I get back from my trip.) <br><br>EQ just wasn't fun anymore, the biggest issues made the game unplayable or unenjoyable. There is no reason to play EQ, no objective. The stand-in objective is get stronger, so that you can do it again next level. Trade skills were bad at best, hunting for silk or pelts was awful, and Ogre SKs had serious problems trying to smith. (No ore in Oggok? run to Grobb, then back again to smelt it. Ore in neriak, but no skewers to practice on... for 10 zones)<br><br>There are a long list of problems and features about both games, most of them mentioned above. I don't agree with the review about grouping in AO; grouping is encouraged, its just not enforced.<br><br>Try out AO but don't complain about city lag without turning down detail levels. This game was designed to be playable on all machines, but the high end features weren't designed to run on low end machines. That's like trying to host ebay on your home machine, it wasn't designed for it.<br><br>If you do buy a machine... buy athlon! *grin* Intel sucks, don't let them force RAMBUS down your throat. Corporate feudalism, same as Omni-Tek.<br><br>Off topic, but has anyone heard about the linux release of AO?<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I played AO beta and play AO now.  I have been playing EQ for almost 2 years now.  I have decided that I will cancel my AO account once i have paid for one month of it.  Why?  Because everything is too easy and there are people duping and exploiting more than you can imagine.  The game is pretty much beyond repairable until they fix all the dupes and exploits, then make a new server.   Even people that don't dupe or exploit can get items too easy.  You dont feel like you have accomplished something when you get X item because 5000 other people have it already.<br><br>Bottom line, EQ is a better game overall.  I will maybe play AO 6 or so months after I cancel my account, assuming I hear that it's playable, there is no duping, and there are no major exploits.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>after having played EQ for quite some time I have realized i hate EQ!!! I HATE EQ!!!! DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!!!!!!!!  I always hated waiting for SOMETHING to spawn so my group could kill it. I HATED being killed by some wandering newby stomping MOB. I HATED struggling to lvl again and again and again!!!  <br><br>The only thing that kept me going was the thought that "next circle of spells i get suchandsuch spell that will make me uber!!!" and then that lvl would come and i would get that spell and then cry cause the spell sucks badly and the MOBs keep hurting you.  I played an enchanter a bit and i am lucky to be sane today... I played an erudite palidan that i liked, but i just couldn't take it!!!! I couldn't take the jerk EQ players, I couldn't take struggling to get money to get some item, and I most definitly couldn't take dying over and over and over again!!!  It would make me want to cry when froon and choon would come up and just screw you over and over after trying to get your corpse! Corpse runs made me want to cry.  Being pked by some iksar gange in lake of ill omen for no other reason other than to just laugh at your dead corpse! I hated playing on a PvP server because the battles never seemed to go your way...  i remember a specific incident when i was grouped with 3 people in LOIO and was getting ok xp when all of a sudden 2 darkys, out of no where, come in and just totally SCREWED us!!! I did have my moments though where i felt like a uber cool hero.... like when i had a lvl 50+ shaman buff me up with like every buff he had and sent me in after 3 darky pkers in blackburrow(they were all lower than me but ubver twinked) i went in and i managed to make them zone plug after beating the hell out of them, but they came back the next day and continued as usual when i wasn't there to help the poor newbies<br><br><br><br><br>A new hope.....<br><br>when i came to AO everything seemed so much easier... before i know it i have to hang of thigns and i have several newby chars(trying things out)  I play a lvl 7 atrox enforcer for Omni-Tek and love it...  I have a nice little stun baton and some cheap newby armor i bought that looks real cool!  I can't wait to see what kind of things lvl 150+ guys will go raid(perhaps there will be huge pvp wars with pc's and npc's controlled by GMs) when EQ was designed they decided to handicap all classes so they balanced with others, in AO they boosted classes to equal them out.  I also like the futuristic type setting to AO and it would be truly awsome if they kept up an ongoing story line(sort of like in the intro movie)  where OT'ers can go hunt out small rebel out posts and attack them with assault vehicals(may be a lvl 175+ vehical like tanks)<br><br>I think EQ was waaaaaaay too frustrating(probably what kept people coming back for more)  If AO finds a way to take the lag away(may be so you can turn player armor textures off or may be an option where you could have them all look like generic models, but when you click on them you could see their gear and such)  AO isn't rdy for big time game events, but once they fix it, it has the ability to be the best MMORPG ever... imagine EQs smooth gameplay and AOs graphics and game design and thats what i am hoping for!<br><br>I think we all know that in a year or two we will all be playing something like quake turned MMORPG, but for now i think AO will have to do...<br><br>cya all in Rubi-KA!!!<br>-Omnilayyer lvl 7 OT encorfer<br>-Omnislayer lvl 23 erudite palidan of tallon zek   -retired- <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Conversations have stuck up just off of the clothing I wear in cities (which was intentional) and the like. <br><br>In addition, people group all of the time in AO. This certainly isn't the solo life which surrounded AC at all. Grouping gives an enormous xp bonus. People group because it benefits them greatly to do so, but they don't have to if they don't want to. On top of that, groups gain team levels as well. When you team level increases, the xp bonuses and cash rewards go up ever higher.<br><br>It just sounds like the technical difficulties have prevent him from relly getting a closer look at the game's dynamics.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you like EQ, play EQ. If you like AO, play AO. Are we all supposed to eat the same food and drink the same brand of soda? This is Pepsi and Coke people. Personally, I prefer the more casual play of AO. Only huge rear kissing guilds have a chance of getting the good stuff in EQ. I don't and never did care for large groups of people forced into a "social" situation. EQ is "forced" down your throat in every which way. EQ has a huge plus though for all the nifty items it has. But, if anyone can remember, banded armor was in fashion before crafted and such was even around. A lot of this cool stuff was "pending lore" for quite some time. Finally Dragoons Dirks were available after some time. I hate Verant for forcing me to group and camp, and I hate Funcom for the major playability issues and crap they lied about. EQ was more social, if you can call asking a question in OOC and being made fun of just for asking.<br><br>To me the biggest difference between the 2 games is that people have so much down time in EQ that they have nothing else to do besides to wait for someone to redirect their misery and boredom on. I have seen it countless times. Someone will ask, "wheres the bank". The common reply is "up you A$$". Why is it like this? Its something to do while staring into your spellbook for 5 mins or more. In AO, you have to almost force yourself to take a break and sit down and chat. The current OOC they have for under level 6 players is great for all those newbie questons. In fact I find myself making new characters just so I can keep in the chat. Hopefully they will add more channels soon. Which game is more social? Well, it depends on what you consider social. So far, I have had a lot less arguing in AO despite the heavy unplayability it offers.<br><br>Ohh yah. Someone said that some Star Wars MMORG is gonna kill this game. LOL! Now thats a brainless statement if I ever heard it. Thats like saying AO killed EQ. Not everyone is a huge Star Wars fan, especially after the last movie. I used to be a big fan, but I've outgrown Jedis, Wookies, Ewoks, and droids that exist for comic relief.<br><br>Will AO survive?<br><br>Answer: Does a leet crap in the desert? <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I noticed that most of the people who were recently bashing EQ and swearing to move to AO were for the most part long time players of EQ. I think that this may develope a bias towards AO on the basis that they are "played out" of EQ. On person posted that they had played EQ for almost three years. That is a marathon run for a video game! If I played most games for 3 months, that would truely be amazing, as I usually loose interest in most games in a couple of weeks or less.<br>  So, to truely be unbiased, I think you would have to have reviewers who are new to the genre. I was fortunate enough to experience this first hand with three new players to our D&D/ MTG club. A friend of mine got them started on EQ. They had been playing for about a week and I decided to introduce them to AO. The response was the same from all three players, 2 males and one female. <br>  They all wined about AO as dull, and wanted to go back and play EQ. One of them picked up a magnum pistol early on, (which he said the graphic was similar too his .44 mag he owns in RL) and he had fun blasting stuff, pretending it was his own gun till level 8, then the novety wore off and he went back to EQ. <br>  The only thing I can think of to conter the above statement, is that the above three people are more fantasy oriented than sci-fi. I myself am highly fantasy biased, and as a result, have never had much of a liking for sci-fi rpg, computer based or otherwise. So my own take on the comparison is that I like AO, it probably would be fun if it wasn't so laggy (took me 8 minutes to log out once, timed it), but I just can't get into a sci-fi world.<br>  I am also getting sick of EQ. EQ is a great game, but at some point you do get a been there done that attitude. I can wait till Horizons comes out though which, BTW is going to make this argument obsolete, its the game we ALL will be playing, the true EQ killer. Won't be out for another year at least, maybee more like 2. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well i've replied to a lot of people. I thought I would post my experiences with AO.<br><br>I started the day it launched. yes it had probs but i was able to level up to level 9 in a few days even with all the drops. I enjoyed the beautiful environment. i had little lag in the newbie zone and i stayed there till 8.  <br><br>I was reluctant to tell anyone at work about AO till Funcom fixed some of the issues. But my excitement got the better of me. I started talking about the game and pretty soon four of my friends from work started playing.<br><br>1st Friend: went out and got it. Became addicted and within a week became level 21.  he has a P4 1.4 gig 256MB ram  says he doesn't have much lag at all.<br><br>2nd Friend: bought it and became level 28 in about 4 days of massive grouping.  he has a 800mhz PIII 256 MB ram he says he has some lag/memory leak. sometimes logs out every 2 hours because of it.<br><br>3rd Friend: got it says he has no lag, just started yesterday and is level 7. He says he is compeltely addicted. He has a PIII 1 Gig, 1 GIG of Ram<br><br>4th Friend: got it, says he loves it and is becoming addicted. He has some lag, but not that bad.  P4 1.4 Gig, 256 DDR Memory.<br><br>For me. I am addicted to AO. I love the fact the story evolves over 4 years and the story is based on player battles, etc.<br><br>My machine:  PIII 800, 128MB ram - i'm upgrading to 512MB. I lag out every time i enter a city... from what my friends say, with 512 this doesn't happen anymore.  I'm sure that Funcom will fix the mem leak within a week or two and this will no longer be an issue of needing more ram.<br><br>Even with the mem leak, I love the game. I find it moves so much faster then any other mmorpg i've ever played (even with all the lagging out i get around cities or high pop areas.)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It really does amaze me that there are so many people out there that are nothing more than Funcom Fanboys..what? You thinking Funcom is reading these posts and are going to reward you for(as one person put it about EQ) keeping AO's Titty in your mouth?<br><br>The review is dead on correct.  EQ is a 'Social' game, one where people get together and form nice groups for a little fun and excitement and some decent loots.  Plus you can interact with those people and those in the zone.  Yes, yes...some people are complete morons, but they are few and far between and you can always 'ignore' them.<br><br>The Technical issues with AO are an insult to the gaming populus.  This game should never had been released in its current state.  IMHO..I am beginning to suspect that FC was running out of cash and said "Hmmm...we need a serious influx of cash to complete this game...let's release it now."  Guess what?  Going by their release figures that they had 35k accounts on the first week..that equals at lets say $55 per box purchase...that comes to $1,925,000 for '1' week...pretty hefty cash influx to help finish the game that 'obviously' does work properly.  Even all you FC Fanboys have to admit and 'have' admitted in previous post that the game is Laggy and has problems.  And flame all you want...EQ was 'never' this bad at its release, anyone that says otherwise is just plain lying and for some unfathomable reason sticking up for FC.<br><br>Believe it or not I do like playing AO...that is when I can.  I can go out into Tir County and get some great exp and cr and stay out there til the cows come home...or the Leets*smirk*.  But when the time comes for you to have to go to town to replenish supplies and ammo...oh hell...zone in to west gate, make it to the shop and BAM! Crash! Lag Hits! Standing in place for several minutes at a time just to turn to the left and try to hit a straight line.  All and all, an unpleasant experience.  <br><br>And about Email Support...I have sent in 4 emails for support, each of which were separate problems, each of which were worded clearly,I have yet to hear a single response from them and the first was sent 10 days ago...so much for 'quick' response.<br><br>Time will tell about AO and its survival..I have no doubt that they will eventually fix the bugs in this game.  Whether or not FC will survive..flame away..I think no.  Maybe a year at the most.  And here is my reasons why....<br><br>1) The other companies that are about to release their own Online Games are watching 'very' carefully at what has happened with AO..you think they will make the same mistakes? I think not.<br><br>2) One Shadowbane and Camelot come out AO will lose 'alot' of their PvP fanbase...Shadowbane will 'rock' when it comes to PvP Online games.<br><br>3) And lastly...Star Wars Galaxies will kill AO's remaining fanbase in 2002.  Based on the most popular and well-known Sci-Fi story in the planet and produced by the most popular and most successful Online Games of Verant/Sony AND with the backing of LUCASARTS...they will stay on the top of the online gaming pyramid for a long time to come  <br><br>So hit me with all the flames you want fanboys..but remember where you read it first.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>let me illuminate you.  <br><br>This is what it comes down to. I dont care what funcom thinks of my opinion. And yes I have been one of the people saying that AO is great.<br><br>That asside here is a reality check:<br>1. Will games like Shadowbane, Neocron, Camelot launch without problems?  No. I guarntee it. I even would put money on it.  Let me explain something to you.  What MMORPG launched without errors? answer: none.  UO, EQ, AO, all have launched with significant errors (EQ's Cerfnet errors and ISDN backbone, AO's lag and connectivity issues.)  MMORPG's are difficult to launch without errors.  <br>2. Will Star Wars be a hit? Yes.  But personally I think it will suck. People forget that the people running Star Wars Galaxies are the same fools running Everquest.  The same idiots who have been banning whole guilds for "exploiting" the game when in fact all they do is play the game. The same company that turned EQ from a PG-13 environment to a Rated G environment. I think Neocron has awesome ideas such as making hallucinagent drugs - that actually cause in game visual hallucinations.  Would Sony ever do that with STar Wars?  Absolutely not.  Will sony continue baning people for cussing? Yes.  Will sony ban people for killing NPC's in SW that they think are unkillable? Yes.  <br><br>The problem is, the coolest games are made by small companies: AO (Funcom), Neocron (reaktorr) and so forth. They have the cutting edge material. But they dont have the $$ behind them to make them launch as well as a major corporation.  So they have to launch with issues and fix them as they go. Sony would never allow a game to have adult content such as the strip clubs in Neocron, or the drug use in AO.  STar wars will be a Rated G game. You might as well wait for Disney to make some online version of "Poo's World." <br><br>Major coroporations however can launch games without much error. When Microsoft launched AC it lauched without much problems. However before verrant was owned by Sony, they couldn't even afford to split servers. This they told their fanbase.  They were on a old, outdated backbone with as many issues as AO - for the first month. <br><br>But major corporations also make everything politically correct.  They remove the "dark" elements from the game. "Oh, someone wrote a In character Roleplay story that was lurid on a 3rd party website? Oh they posted their character name/server... Ban them!" That's basically what Sony has been doing.  Their goal is a Politically correct, rated-G game. <br><br>While it will attract thousands of players, I think over a few months of play, people will still play games like Neocron, AO and other Sci Fi games that are not afraid to rock the social norms and put up content that is on the edge.  <br><br>Is AO gonna die? I doubt it. It might suffer, esp. after SW launches. But remember, Verrant never could get PvP right in EQ - what makes you think they will in SW? Many of the same Verant folks that were on EQ are now on SWG.<br><br>As for Shadowbane "rocking" the pvp. How is it any different than AO?  It is slightly different as the political boundries change automatically based on structure control, but AO does the same thing - just not automated. The story line for AO doesn't start till this fall. That is when the "war" occurs and the world will be monitored and player battles and events recorded to determine how the world evloves.  <br><br>You also need to understand that Shadowbane and Camelot are not the same venue.  They are going back to Fantasy... which will steal players from EQ and AC... not so much from AO. I for one do not want to go back to a non-ranged attack game... where spells is the only method of ranged attack.  The sci-fi genre is much more interesting to me - and you can remain more in character will pulling info on a creature as you are "scanning" it for data. There really isn't a "in character" way to find out the level/power of a creature in a fantasy setting.  <br><br>If you like Shadowbanes efforts, I think you ahve to applaud AO for making the same movement towards a better PVP evolution.<br><br>The funny thing is, if Lag was really this bad for so many, how in the heck is there a level 80 in the game already? And my friends who started after me are in their high 20's (25-28.) In my guild alone there are members who range from 40-50. The reason is, it isn't that bad in the country side. The cities still require work.  That is problem no one can deny. But not worth scrapping the game. But who levels in the city? Right now the city is commerce only. Which is one reason there isn't a global auction chanel. To encourage people to migrate to the city.<br><br>See EQ IMO does a bad job of community.  YOu say, "EQ is a 'Social' game, one where people get together and form nice groups for a little fun and excitement and some decent loots. Plus you can interact with those people and those in the zone. Yes, yes...some people are complete morons, but they are few and far between and you can always 'ignore' them." <br><br>This is an absolute fabrication. come on, do you know that statistically the average EQ player spends 4 hours a day playing?  In that time they are typically not progressing. All my friends that play eq spend 80% of their time bitching about problems, people, nerfing, loosing exp, poorly done raids, and how they generally are frustrated. I see no enjoyment in anyone who still plays. Now that is mainly because they are high level players.  Lower level players still find eQ fun and fresh. But once you get up there, you will realize all your work is for nothing. NOTHING. there is no pay off. <br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

NOTHING. there is no pay off."<br><br>I have to agree with this wholeheartedly.<br><br>What really upsets me is looking back to the past, 2 years ago when I started EQ. I constantly said to myself "One level closer to 50..." and "If I stay in EQ instead of going out, I can get my level..."  You see, I had all of these expectations of being the powerful paladin who could save people's lives and people would love to have me in their group. Ouch. Here I am now, level 55 and stuck in a serious rut with nothing to do. I play a class that is not needed nor wanted. Clerics, warriors, and enchanters are needed. They each have their defining roles. I don't. <br><br>I play in a smaller guild which is currently laboring to get enough clerics, warriors, and enchanters so that we can actually go places and do things as a guild. But recently, Ive found myself asking this question: for what reason? Whats the payoff? <br><br>Well, your guild gets to brag about how they successfully raided blah blah, killed this uber mob,  and got phat l3wtz. Ohh, FUN! <br><br>Ive worked hard to get to level 55. 95 days playing time over the course of one year (for this character). I played with the sole intention of the desire to be needed and wanted. However, now I realize that all my work was for NOTHING. There was no payoff, there is no satisfaction of being level 55. I do NOT have fun in EQ when I log in and sit in Old Sebilis LFG for an hour, and leave with the same amount of experience I had before entering. I do NOT have fun when I spend an hour running from one place to another because I cant find a soloing druid or wizard who has the time to sell me a port to wherever. I do NOT have fun when a mob that is 10 levels under me totally kicks my ass.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

There are so many high lvl people, and as an earlier post (saying EQ is no longer role playing) i tottaly agree with that noone role plays any more on EQ. i remeber when a Yak was so kool every1 wanted it a long time ago, now when velious and kunark came out a yak sux there are 100 times better weapons now and the game is just getting easier. AO is nice because its a new game things to discover no twinks, it might be like EQ 2 years from now, but till then AO should be a good RP expierience<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>From all the posts out there AO sounds a lot like Dreamcasts Phantasy Star Online which i admit I was very addicted to for a while until I bought EQ...  One big thing lacked... STORY...<br><br>No socializing... more of an action adventure type of game than an RPG...  The posts above sort of enhance this image I am getting...  AO is probably a good game, I havent played it.   But it doesnt sound like an RPG it sounds like a game...  A tomb Raider...  A game you can play for two hours and put away... Not another lifestyle as EQ is...  EQ is an immersive environment that is hard to get out of...  Sounds Like AO all you do is get a quest play it for 2 hours to get your new armour and log for the night...  That would be very fun if your looking for an action adventure game but if you want an immersive invironment it would get very boring...  Much as Phantasy Star Online did with its puny 4 lvls...  Anyway justy my comments from reading the post...  Either way i think i will go get the game just to try it out and see what i think of it in RL...<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think you should consider reading more about AO. The majority of people leaving EQ for AO are coming because EQ lacks RPG.  The key word being "Roleplaying."  <br><br>When i first got EQ (a month after it launched) there were tons of RPer's. now they are all gone. Yes there is a back story to EQ and a even more detailed one for AO.  <br><br>But one thing AO has that EQ doesn't is a world that evolves.  When you go out to lake of ill omen and kill 1000 sarnaks, do they ever retreat? does the world ever change based upon your actions? No.  <br><br>I'm not preaching AO. I'm preaching: EQ sucks. It has failed as a dynamic world - which it pastes all over it's site: 'where you can shape the future of the lands.' what?? how can you shape the future? Nothing changes. Even in Pvp, in 30 min. all the creatures repop and once again, dark elf guards populate nektulous, human guards populate the common lands. The world is *static* it doesn't change (outside of new continents.) Each zone is as it was at launch (save for a few *minor* changes - like adding dark elves to west commons.)  <br><br>For the most part EQ is static. Player decisions and wars on the PVP servers change nothing.  The new generation of games, (Not just AO) are promising a world that evolves based upon player actions.  Shadowbane has political boundries that change and evolve based upon player battles won or lost.  AO has a 4 year storyline that is shaped by the actions of teams and players.  <br><br>It definately isn't a "Tomb Raider" game as you called it. In fact I think the reverse is true and that's why I left EQ after 2.5 years.  None of my actions mattered. No matter how many players i killed on RZ, VZ, or TZ mattered. It didn't matter that i killed 2000 sarnaks on Bertox. The world repops and everything goes back to zero.  <br><br>I'm tired of that. I wnat change. It doesn't have to be AO. I just want a game with evolution... andy many games are and will offer that.  <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The comparison between the 2 games comes down to one thing...what is the ultimate goal in each game?<br><br>Everquest= phat lewt/uberness<br><br>Anarchy Online= win a war<br><br>I know that when I log onto AO i will have something to do, a purpose...not so with EQ. the community is lacking u say? It's been out a few weeks, the community will come when the lag problems are resolved. Speaking of which throw 300 people in Kelethin an see what happens...<br><br>Anarchy is geared for the casual to hardcore, its meant for people to get on play an enjoy. I know many a night in EQ i quit in frustration because my rogue or shaman couldnt find a group. Can I find a group in AO? u betcha...many a night I'll just be hanging out around an outpost an get 2 or 3 invites into a persons group. <br><br>Another point here...thing of all the horrible things people do in EQ...kill stealing, item theft etc., and look at why they do it...because loot drives the game. In AO you'll be the man based on your rep as a uber PVP player. I also read the best items in the game will be made by higher players or attained thru missions at higher levels...that doesnt happen in EQ. Hell the player made items dont get sold after banded.<br><br>I could go on more but I hafta log on to AO an woop some Omni booty.<br><br>Seldoon<br>Clan enforcer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
