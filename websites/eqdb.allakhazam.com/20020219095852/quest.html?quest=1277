Very few of your kind has ever seen the halls you know walk through. You must have provided a great service to our kin for them to allow you passage into this inner sanctum. We welcome you to our ancient home. <br><br>You say, 'thank you'<br><br>Oglard says 'Might, wisdom, and manners? Quite a surprise to see all of these traits in one of the younger races. I am impressed. I see you are a noble creature, one who would treat another creature of nobility with respect.......... 'Oglards eyes suddenly begin to shine with a magical, golden, light. He looks down upon you as if in judgement and asks, 'Tell me Keyno , have you done battle with dragons?' <br><br>You say, 'yes I have done battle with the dragon'<br><br>*note* Saying, "no I have not done battle with the dragons" will result in this.  Olard's eye begin you gleam even brighter, then quickly fade, a frown left apon the wurm's face. Hmm... I see. Thank you for your information. Good luck in your travels.<br><br>You faction standing with the ClawsofVeeshan got worse.<br><br>Oglard 's eyes slowly begin to lose the golden light that flared earlier. He then studies you carefully before saying 'There are many Dragons on this world that do not share our beliefs. If you have done battle with dragons and have lived, then you may be able to help us. <br><br>You say, 'how may i help you?'<br><br>Oglard says 'When a Dragon dies, his spirit leaves his corporeal body and joins Veeshan<br>among the stars. It is our greatest desire, to be without desire, at the time of our death. Even in preperation for battle, we accept that we may die and strive to be empty of desire so that our spirits do not cling to this world when our end has come. For some, however, this is not the case <br><br>You say, 'who are the ones that this is not the case?'<br><br>Oglard says 'When a Dragon dies, and his heart is filled with desire, his spirit will remain here in the filth of this world. The greatest torment is to transcend one's body, and still be confined to this world. Like being trapped within a cell with a single locked door, having the key to unlock it and escape, yet having no hands to use the key. This has befallen one of our comrades. <br><br>You say, 'what comrade has this befallen?'<br><br>Oglard says 'And therein lies our plight. Our fellow Dragon now suffers eternally in unlife, between worlds. We hear his pained howls when we sleep, unable to aid our fallen comrade. He turned his back on us centuries ago, and joined the Ring of Scale. In response to this we erased his name and bloodline, along with the others who left, from our memories and books. He is still Dragon though, and does not deserve the fate he's been dealt. Without his name, we are helpless. <br><br>You say, 'what is his name?'<br><br>Oglard says 'Unfortunately our libraries have no record of him. We know of his death from 2 sources only. Our Lord Yelinak was the first to hear his tormented howling. Then the rest of us slowly began to hear him as well. A chosen few left our home to find his corpse if possible. We were surprised to find he had died here on this continent. Apparently he had returned to us, which pains us even more. <br><br>You say, 'where has he returned?'<br><br>Oglard says 'His body was found in the Eastern Wastes, spears of Krom Zek make<br>protruding from his side and chest.' The wurm pauses for a moment to sigh heavily. He continues, sorrow on his voice, 'We believe......we hope, one of the sentient races witnessed his murder. Chances are slim to nil. But perhaps one of those.....Caldoin? Or something? Found him and recorded his name. Will you investigate this for us Keyno ? <br><br>You say, 'yes I will investigate this for you'<br><br>Oglard says 'We are greatful for your service to us. We know you have little interest in<br>our affairs, yet you risk your life to aid us. Once you find his name, then perhaps we can find a way to release his restless spirit. If you do this, you will be rewarded an item of your choice from our hoard of treasure. Begin with.....whatever they call themselves. The Giants refer to them as iron pellets. Return to me proof of his name and he will be remembered. <br><br>PART II – THURGADIN A<br><br>Loremaster Sarl can be found In ThurgA at the Statue room across the way from the Icewell zone.<br><br>You say, 'Can you tell me the name of a slain dragon'<br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'The name of Dragon you say? One that was slain? Hmmm, sounds interesting. Like I said, we've had little contact with Dragons, but I vaguely recall an ancient legend about a slain dragon and one of our people meeting. Follow me to the Library and we'll talk along the way. <br><br>And so we start walking to the library.. he buffs everything he sees along the way...<br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'There are only a few myths we've recorded havin to do with Dragons, many less legends. There's a story of an ancestor of the Dain ridin a 'Wurm' into battle against Giants. A Wurm be a lesser form of a Dragon, not able to use magic or fly, but still just as mean. There's another story, more recent, about a pair a Coldain that rampaged through the countryside along side a magical sea turtle, undoing evil and saving this and that. Heheh, more likely a drunken wive's tale. <br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'Ye may not know this, but we didn't always make our home here in Thurgadin. Centuries ago we lived deep down in the ground, close to Brell. That was our first home after we became stranded on this chunk of ice. We lived there peacefully for a while, until the Giant kin found us. They drove us out, though we didn't leave without a fight. This statue coming up here is of a hero that sacrificed his life in that battle to bring a great cavern down on the heads of many o those giants. <br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'I brung up our old home o Froststone because we had many books and tablets that were lost when we were forced to flee. We had a long history during our peaceful time there, much of it is lost to us now. Still, we were able to save a few slim volumes. I'm thinkin we may find yer answer in o those old recordings. We'll see.........Ahhh, here we are. Remember to keep yer voice down, it is a library ye know. <br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'Ok, here we are. Let me see.' Sarl runs a finger along the book labels searching for a paticular volume... <br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'Do ye know anythin about this dragon? Ye need his name right?  Some o these older ones are organized in strange ways. I love me fore fathers, but they made some funny kinda rules. Do you know what color this dragon was? <br><br>And since I do not know the color of the dragon.. I start to name dragon colors. Red, Green, Blue, <br><br>You say, 'Black'<br><br>Loremaster Sarl says 'Excellent, I know what we're lookin fer now.<br><br>As soon as you say "Black" he will despawn and respawn in the library. So, if you know where the library is, simply ask him about the name of a slain dragon, and then say "Black." He will pop in the library. Just run over to him and hand him 50pp and he will give you the book.<br><br>Lorekeeper Sarl says 'Ah hah! Here it is! Let's see here..Yes, I remember now. This is<br>the story o Burdael. Ill lend ya the book, but it'll cost ya 50 platinum.<br><br>PART III – FROSTONE IN CRYSTAL CAVERNS<br><br>Gave the book to Historian Baenek in Frostone.<br><br>Historian Baenek says 'You found one of our lost tomes! A lost volume of the Book of Grudges, quite a find. Oh dear Brell! This evidence proves that the legend of Burdael is true! Thank you Metopious. And now I suppose you wish to meet his ghostly form. I have snesed him from time to time. I will call to him now. Go and wait for him in the lower halls. His spirit sometimes calls to me from where the fearsome Stalag Terrors lair. Be warry though, unlife may have twisted his mind beyond reason."<br><br>Your faction standing with the CitizensOfFroststone got better.<br><br>He(Burdael) spawned in the back corner of the stalagterror area, blue to 60 weilding a dwarven axe and with SK pet.. spoke phrases in an unknown tongue, but when repeatedly hailed, replied with exactly the same text, meaning its not a normally randomly scrambled language. the two bracketed words were "Yiond" which triggered more gibberish, and "furysve" which he didnt respond to. despawned at about 5 mins. I'm excellent in Dwarven, Dragon and Elder Dragon fyi, likely its just rantings of a madman, but Yiond was mysteriously capitallized, likely thats our next lead. <br><br>ok, so.. I waited an hour for the historian to respawn and killed the ghost, he dropped a sword, nothing special, but when ID'd.. <br><br>IDs as : Remember, Garzicor.<br><br>PART IV – SKYSHRINE<br><br>Give the axe, Onyxbrand, to Oglard in Skyshrine. MAKE SURE you have an open inventory slot.<br><br>Oglard examines the axe closely. The Wurm's eyes widen as he makes out the name of Garzicor and immediately raises his head to the ceiling, letting out a howl of emotional pain. Your bones shake with the screach, an image of a man in the midst of a rain of his own child's blood comes to mind, the agony is so great. Out of breath, Oglard drops his head and focuses his attention back to you, barely able to hold himself up. He places an urn before you and says, 'You must find his corpse. Find his burial site and summon Garzicor's spirit by speaking your remembrance of him. Speak to him and find out all you can. Return to me with 2 pieces of his corpse combined in that urn. Help us Castrinas , you MUST!' <br><br>Your faction standing with ClawsofVeeshan got better.<br><br>Your faction standing with Yelinak got better.<br><br>Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse.<br><br>So, now I have an urn container, with 2 slots, guess we need to find where he died next.<br><br>PART V – DRAGON NECROPOLIS<br><br>I may have found what we've been looking for... I was runnign around DN saying, "Remember, Garzicor" when I sorta got a response. The spot is at (+1523, +1109) right past the door to the paebla area, right under a giant dragon skull in the wall, with bones all around. This spot makes perfect sense where his body was brought to.<br><br>I went down there to those bones shortly after the entrance to the Paebala area and said "Remember, Garzicor" a few times. Nothing seemed to happen, then suddenly a dialog started. It was a couple words at a time that went something like this:<br><br>Help<br>Veeshan waits<br>Must have revenge<br>Kromzek Must die<br>Must spill blood<br>Vengeance!<br>Home!<br>Vengeance!<br>Home!<br>I am one but two<br>I am sorry<br><br>Yes... he really rambled like that. Short one liners. Mentioned Veeshan once or twice, Kromzek once, spilling blood once, home and revenge a lot. Each line had a couple second delay afterwards before the next. Then it just stopped.<br><br>As soon as the words "I am sorry" appear, 2 bags spawn on the ground, one dragon skin, and one dragon bone powder of some sort. Place them in the urn and combine them. Note it is recommended you do this with the urn, as the two pieces are no rent.<br><br>PART VI – SKYSHRINE<br><br>Give the combined urn to Oglard. He tells you to go give the urn to Eldriaks Fe'dhar. Note the urn you get back is NOT the same one as you gave to him.<br><br>Eldriaks Fe’Dhar says ‘Hmm? What’s this? Oh! You are the High Elf who has been helping us with the nameless one. Well, not so nameless anymore. A part of Garzicor clings to this world, eager to wreak vengeance upon the giants who murdered him. We’ve decided a weapon must be constructed, and the restless spirit of Garzicor must be bound to it. You must be the one to construct this weapon. This dust must be used in the forging of the weapon’s blade. Are you a master smith Torlan?<br><br>You say, 'no, I am not a master smith'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'You must be the one to forge the weapon, Torlan . Go and learn the art of the smith. Return only when you are a master and tell me you are ready. I will then tell you what must be done. <br><br>You say, ‘yes, I am a master smith’<br><br>Eldriaks Fe’Dhar says ‘Good. The weapon is extremely complicated to construct, your skills will be tested perhaps beyond your abilities. The weapon is known as a Naginata. You need not be proficient in its use to build it. The Naginata is constructed of four major parts. The shaft, the blade, the fittings, and the hilt, or tsuba. No ordinary materials can hope to bind the dragons spirit. Special materials must be found.<br>      <br>You say, 'how do I make the shaft'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The shaft must be strong enough to withstand the effects of the<br>spirit’s presence, yet flexible enough to be wielded properly. Of the few dragons that returned to us from the Ring of Scale, some brough back knowledge of a type of wood that may be sufficient. It is known as bronzewood. One can find it amidst one of the forests on the continent of Kunark. I am sure it is being used by one of the sentient races there.<br><br>You say, 'how do I make the fittings'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The fittings are the most important part. The spirit itself will be held there partially. We’ll discuss this later, when you have all the other pieces in your possesion.<br><br>You say, 'how do I make the hilt'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The tsuba is where most of the enchanment will lie. It must be<br>forged seperately of another ore created to be the bane of the dragon. It is called chronium and was developed by the Kromzek with the aid of their blood-thirsty @#%$. You must forge the ore into a plate and then find a craftsman with the skill to carve a detailed mandala of draconic binding into it. This mandala will hold arcane power and restrain the spirit from destroying the weapon. <br><br>You say, 'what chronium'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Chronium is a sacred ore used only by the higher ranked priests<br>of Rallos Zek. You may be able to find some in the city of the Kromzek, Kael Drakkel. Perhaps in one of their temples. Forging it into a plate is simple. Heat the ore in a forge and shape it with a Forging Hammer, then temper it with a Flask of Water. <br><br>You say, 'how do I make the blade'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The blade will be the most difficult piece for you to build. First of all, no mundane ore will do. Long ago, Veeshan sent a gift to us in the form of a meteor. This meteor holds the ore you must build the blade with. Once you have the ore, follow the instructions in this book and forge the blade. Don’t forget, when melting the ore, use the bone dust I gave you.<br><br>You say, 'what a craftsman'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Since the mandala is so detailed, only a craftsman trained specifically in these matters will do. I'm sure you're a fine smith but an adventurer like yourself wouldn't have time to fully master the skill needed to create the tsuba. Find one whose entire life is the art of creating these types of weapons. The craftsman will need a sketch of the mandala as well as the plate of chronium. <br><br>You say, 'what mandala'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The type of mandala we need is a diagram laced with powerful arcane enchantment. You'll need to find a sketch of the correct mandala for the craftsman to go by as he carves it into the chronium plate. There is one place you may be able to find a sketch of a mandala powerful enough to bind Garzicor. <br><br>You say, 'where is the place?'<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'The ones that returned to us from the Ring of Scale told us of the Sarnak. These are hybrids of dragons and a sentient lizard race known as the Iksar. Whoever created them had to bind a dragon to his will or restrain it at some point. Perhaps this being or one of his brood still has a recording of the mandala. Once you have the Tsuba, Blade, and Shaft, return here and show them to me. I will then explain what must be done next.<br><br>BOOK INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>Only a master smith may make the blade.<br><br>Once the ore is found, it must be broken into 2 portions with a forging hammer and a smithing chisel.<br><br>First you must form the core of the blade. Take one portion of the starmetal and apply the bone dust in the forge. Then, with a hammer and chisel, fold the block of ore. You must repeat this 5 times to homogenize the steel. After the 5th folk, take the hammer to the ore and shape the core into a curved blade.<br><br>Now for the “skin” of the blade. Apply the remaining bone dust to the last portion of starmetal. Fold this block of ore, as with the core, 10 times with the hammer and chisel. This will be the most difficult and time consuming steps. After the 10th fold block, apply the skin to the core with the hammer [and chisel]. The last step in the forging process is taking the whole blade and shaping it into a suitable naginata blade [by applying the hammer to the raw blade].<br><br>The last major step is the tempering of the blade. This includes a mixture of clay and water for the differential tempering process. Combine a small block of clay with a flask of water at the potter’s wheel. Then take the clay and apply it to the blade at the wheel as well, leaving the edge of it exposed. Allow it to dry. The last step is to heat the  clay covered blade in the forge, and then plunge it into a fluid to temper. In this case, a special fluid must be found. In the mountains of Kunark one can find a very caustic type of mist that freezes and collects at high altitudes. Find a portion of this ice and use it for the tempering. Good luck.<br><br>Be sure you put the forging hammer to the 'raw blade' one final time. Be careful though, this step was NOT TRIVIAL at 180. Then you can apply the clay. <br><br>For the clay part, I suggest getting your pottery up to 128, which is easily done in the better part of two hours in NFP. Just make unfired small bowls, mixing bowls, etc until you get to 128. You need not fire them to increase your skill.<br><br>PART VII – GATHERING COMPONENTS<br><br>Bronzewood: Found on a rare spawn, A giant carpenter, which spawns in the giant fort in BW. Simply kill the two mobs in the only hut where two giants spawn, and Carpenter Grundo will eventually pop. He does not hold the staff, but you loot it off his corpse.<br><br>Starmetal (meterorite ore): Found on Cliff golems in Overthere. Not too difficult, they require one group. Be sure you have a druid to kite around the Dragoons if they add.<br><br>Chronium ore: Found on Armor of Zek in kael, next to the Vindicator.<br><br>Mist that freezes: Found in Frontier mountains, at -260, -297 on the top of a mountain, called gray colored ice.<br><br>Mandala of Draconic Binding: Found in the east wing in the room with four alcoves, one farther in to the left on the coffin. <br><br>Forging the chromium ore into a plate is simple. Heat the ore in a forge and shape it with a Forging Hammer, then temper it with a Flask of Water. The chronium plate combine was trivial at 118 smithing, so was the INITIAL splitting of the ore. The folding of the core (5x) was not trivial, and I failed on the second fold at 118. The folding of the core and the blade are the most diffiuclt parts. Some folks have reported up to 9 attempts before finally succeeding in the blade.<br><br>The Kerran in the Warrens is a craftsperson. He said that he needs a special set of tools and to bring them here along with a suitable plate of metal and a sketch of the tsuba's design, then he can construct the tsuba. The key phrase is "I need your help." The toolset is obtained from an innkeeper in Paineel. He tends a bar with some dancing skeletons playing instruments, and you need to hail him and give him 1000pp to get the toolset. However, the set is NOT lore and NOT no drop, so you can make a level 1 erudite and get the toolset easily.<br><br><br>PART VIII – SKYSHRINE<br><br> Hand in the staff, blade, and tsuba to Eldriaks.<br><br>Eldriaks Fe'Dhar takes the staff, blade, and tsuba and looks them over. He says, 'Excellent craftsmanship. These will make a fine weapon. But one part remains to join all the pieces together. That is the fittings.' The wyvern then hands you the items back along with a vial of blood and says, 'This vial of blood will allow you to awaken Garzicor's spirit.<br><br>You say, 'How do I awaken garzicor's spirit?<br><br>Eldriaks Fe'Dhar says 'First you must awaken his spirit by speaking where you found his corpse. You must say exactly this: "You are one but two. Your vengeance shall find a home." Hopefully this will bring him to you. You must hurry and splash the vial of Kromzek blood upon his ghostly form. The taste of the blood will bring him fully into existence. You must then do battle with him. If you defeat him, you will have split his being which will be represented by two more shades. Give them each a flawless diamond. He will comply and choose these gems as a phylactery. Once you have the dual phylactery, you need only combine them with the assembled naginata in a forge to create the Ethereal Bladed Naginata. Bring me the weapon.<br><br>PART IX – DRAGON NECROPOLIS<br><br>Say the phrase, an invisible spirit spawns (just see name).<br><br>Give the spirit the blood and a construct looking dragon will spawn (Garzicor's Remains) and attack. Pull this back up the ramp to before the bend, so any kos to CoV people are away from spawn point. Kill this, hits for 144 has an unmemorable AE, pretty weak. <br><br>Then Garzicor's Wrath spawns where the remains died and is agro. This is a translucent looking dragon. He hits for 350ish and has a very strong AE fear, but is not hard for anyone that does zlandicar. <br><br>Once he is dead, another translucent looking dragon will spawn on CoV faction at the original spot, where you said the phrase. Give that a flawless diamond to get magical blackened diamond back. There will be another translucent dragon just past it, deeper down the tunnel, give that one another flawless diamond and get another magical diamond back. Both returned diamonds are NO DROP.<br><br>PART X – The Forge<br><br>Go to a forge and combine the two diamonds with the assembled naginata. The result is an Etheral Bladed Naginata (did not identify it). Trivial at 237 smithing.<br><br>PART XI – Skyshrine<br><br>Give the Naginata to Eldriaks Fe`Dhar:<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'You have succeeded Iustus . Garzicor's spirit no longer calls to us from beyond. Now we ask that you do one more thing. You must wield this weapon against all giant kind to satiate Garzicor's thirst for vengeance. The Naginata has a special power against the Kromzek, they will fall easily before it. However, if you do not wish to, hand the weapon back to me and I'll give you an earring more worthy of a being of faith. If you are one of sorcerous powers, hand me the earring and Ill hand you a ring more suited to you. <br><br>Cast Identify on the naginata he gives back (which looks identical)<br><br>Item Lore: Eldriaks Verified Naginata.<br><br>Give naginata back to him:<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'Tis sad to see that the weapon will not be wielded by it's maker,<br>but here is your earring. Wear it well. <br><br>Give him the earring:<br><br>Eldriaks Fe`Dhar says 'So you prefer the ring? Very well, may it serve you well Iustus . <br><br>If you give him the ring he eats it and says nothing.                          </td></tr>

Big problem.<br><br>The Ghost of Burdael is red to a 48, hits for 150s, has a brown pet that went down easy (probably SK), and waxed a dozen or so upper 40s.<br><br>Of course, the "raid" didn't involve a buffing period, had no clerics (oop!) and massive pingponging.<br><br>I'm glad I decided to stay grouped with my druid, who had SRo evac memmed - despite protests that I wouldn't be able to ask for heals.  Generally, if someone who's not MA is asking for heals, you know you got problems.<br><br>Once the guy doing the quest went down and the healers all called OOM, it was time to shake the exit stick.<br><br>I sorta feel bad for everyone that got roped into killing this single level 49 mob and had to CR to the middle of the Terror Room.<br><br>Of course the cleric screaming not the trust the guy and that we'd all die and he wouldn't rez us for a half hour should've made some people think.<br><br>Anyway, Ghost shouldn't be a huge problem for a good group in early to mid 50s, with cleric and the usual accessories.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
