	 <tr><td colspan=2><blockquote><img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/ao100.gif" alt="Category: Anarchy Online" width=100 height=100 align=right>Anarchy Online has been out almost a month now.  I know there have to be some Everquest players out there wondering about Anarchy Online and how it compares to EQ.  I beta tested Everquest and have been playing it ever since.  I also beta tested Anarchy Online and have been playing it since it was released a few weeks ago.  Of course, I have seen a lot more of EQ than AO, so there are things that I can’t compare quite yet, but I still thought I would give you my initial impressions to help you decide if AO is a game you might want to try.  So here is my comparison and review.<br><PAUSE><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>This is something I feel needs to be stated right up front, because I am going to try to ignore it for the rest of the review.  At the moment, Anarchy Online is not a quality, playable game.  The game was released with Funcom fully knowing that it was bugged, incomplete and unplayable.  I was a beta tester and I was astounded when I discovered that the version we were playing those last weeks of beta was truly just a step from the release version.  Frankly, I believe that any legitimate company should hang their heads in shame after releasing a game in this bad a shape.  Funcom then rubbed salt into the wounds of even their most loyal customers by announcing that the game was “110%” playable two weeks after release, setting off the clock on the 30 days you get with your purchase and assuring that they will start charging people for a game many cannot yet play.<br><br>The lag in the game is horrendous.  Anytime you get close to more than a handful of other players, your frame rate drops to almost nothing and you find yourself standing in place.  What’s worse about this is that you can’t sit or move your curser enough to even log out of the game, and you are often forced to stand there for five minutes or more hoping to just get out of the game.  Of course, you can always alt-tab to windows and control-alt-delete the game closed, but that seems like a pretty extreme measure.  Basically, this means that you are better off just not trying to play during the typical prime time hours.<br><br>The pathing in the game is so bad that when you are in a mission your best chance is to move to a room, stand still and wait to see what starts to shoot at you.  Of course, then it is often in another room and shooting through the walls, but at least you can shoot it back that way.  Mobs can attack you through walls and across the playing field without you even seeing them or knowing where to go to fight back.  Quite often you will lag out during a fight, which makes it impossible to use your special attacks, and then come back in and find out that you died.<br><br>High patience and a low frustration level are required to play this game right now.  A high performance machine and high speed internet connection are also a lot of help.  If you go in expecting a beta quality game, you will probably still be amazed at the problems.  Still, many people are able to play the game, so for those of you who are willing to overlook the obvious problems and want to delve into the actual game lurking behind the bugs, I’ll try to give you my view of how it plays.<br><br><b>Graphics and Sound</b><br><br>	The graphics of Anarchy Online are crisper and more realistic than those of Everquest.  There are nice little touches that really add to the feel of the world.  The sky effects are pretty amazing and there are things like little robots and flying birds that add a touch of realism to the game.  The player models are stunning and the number of outfits you can wear are astonishing.  I created a female character just to experiment with the rather racy outfits you can buy at the store.  This is definitely a PG game.  With all the variety, I don’t doubt that you could really get to the point where you can recognize a person just by his or her looks.  They also programmed some fun emotes into the game, letting you really express yourself.  I know I got a lot of work out of the /anger command when the zones weren’t working right after release.<br><br>Still, even with such crisp graphics, I find the world to be a little drab.  I am sure it is by design, since Rubi-Ka is defined as a dead world that is slowly being terraformed, but there is very little color and variety amongst the cities and zones.  Part of the fun in Everquest is zoning into a new zone and seeing how different it is from the rest of the world.  Everquest has forests, plains, jungles, oceans, lakes, mountains and a whole variety of other types of terrain.  From what I have seen so far, much of Anarchy Online is the same.  So, while I like the individual graphics in AO better then EQ, overall I think I prefer the look of Norrath to the look of Rubi-Ka.<br><br>	When it comes to the sound track and sound effects, AO has EQ beat by a mile.  I always thought that the music in Everquest was almost an afterthought by the developers.  If I recall correctly, music was not even introduced into the game until several months after its release.  A good soundtrack can help get the heart thumping and add to the excitement of a battle.  AO has this and EQ doesn’t.  When I play EQ, I find myself turning down the sound, but when I play AO I like to really crank it.<br><br><b>Soloing and Grouping</b><br><br>This is an area where these two games differ significantly.  Everquest is strictly a group game.  While soloing is possible, it is difficult to do and time consuming.  In general, groups are easy to form and, because the classes are so well defined, you can form a group of total strangers and fairly quickly figure out everyone’s role in the fights to come.  <br><br>Anarchy Online is just the opposite.  It is very easy to solo, and in many ways it is preferable.  I have found it very difficult to find a group because most people have quickly discovered that you can get higher experience and better rewards by soloing.  Moreover, when you do get into a group most people are confused about what they are supposed to do and in the end everyone basically just blasts away at the mob until it is dead.  I assume as people get higher in levels and more specialized that things will change, but groups will never be as easy to define as in Everquest simply because the professions in AO are not so easily pigeonholed into defined roles.<br><br>This has led to an interesting development in the game.  Anarchy Online is simply not as social a game as Everquest.  There is no general chat like the zone chat of Everquest and with fewer groups and faster leveling, it is much harder to meet people and make friends.  It is more like a bunch of single player games being played simultaneously on the same server.  Some of this is due to the lag, which causes most people to do everything they can to avoid other players, but even without the lag, I doubt this will ever be much of a group game. <br><br>The advantage of this soloability is that Anarchy Online is able to be played in short bursts.  If you only have an hour or two to play Everquest, it is almost not worth playing.  By the time you log in, get to a zone, find a group and get into a rhythm it is time to log back out.  However, with Anarchy Online, you can grab a mission, play it through and gain a half a level’s worth of experience and a nice reward all within about a hours playing time.  This alone makes it a far better game for the casual gamer than Everquest.<br><br>Still, I like the social aspects of Everquest and find Anarchy Online really lacking in that regard.  Without more chat features and more incentive to group up with other players, the game will never really seem like a MMORPG to me.  What I have discovered is that when I have an hour to play and just want to play a quick solo game, I log onto Anarchy Online.  But when I know I can really sit down and immerse myself into the game, a find myself going back to.  So far, I don’t think AO has the same addictive hook that EQ can exert on you.<br><br><b>Classes/Professions</b><br><br>	In my opinion, Anarchy Online went the wrong way with their profession system.  I don’t doubt that there will be some significant changes as they start to see how the players deal with it.  Anarchy Online tried to overlap the professions and also, through a skill system encourage diversity even within the professions.  In and of itself, this is not a bad thing.  This supposedly lets the players determine their own destiny rather than be pigeonholed into a role determined by the game designer.  Unfortunately, from what I can see, it has had the opposite effect.  First, the professions don’t vary that much from each other at the start.  Because of the easy availability of healing and nano restoring devices, everyone in the game can heal themselves and cast multiple spells.  Plus, everyone can wear the same armor and use the same weapons.  Naturally, everyone is going to start to figure out the best weapons, armor, nanos, etc and use their skills accordingly.  This is especially true because you get so few improvement points that you feel you can’t waste any on any skill that is not strictly necessary.  So what you get are few actual variations in classes.  Maybe they will vary more in later levels.  <br><br>Also, with the sole exception of the doctor, all of the AO classes are attack classes.  With the exception of the doctor class, there are no true support classes.  There are classes that could be used in support roles, but because most players will spend a lot of time soloing, players who choose those classes will inevitably end up spending their improvement points on attack skills rather than support skills.  This really hurts the grouping process and also reduces the variety in the game.<br><br>In contrast, Everquest’s class system is very well defined, with each class getting their own specialties, armor, weapons, spells, etc.  This can sometimes be frustrating, but it builds up a very well developed reliance upon other players and encourages grouping and interaction.  It also makes it easier to know who and what you are dealing with.  When you meet a level 25 barbarian shaman, you pretty much know what he can and can’t do.  That certainty is not present in AO.<br><br>On top of that, EQ’s variety increases replay value.  The class and race you choose in EQ will significantly effect how and where you play the game.  Play an Ogre Warrior and then play a High Elf Wizard, and you will find your aproach to the game to be completely different right from the start.  In AO, the breed and profession seem to have little effect on how you play the game.  Everyone gets weapons and spells.  They may vary in name, but they all work pretty much the same.  Are you really going to stop playing your level 150 character and start over with another profession that does much the same thing, only shoots pistols instead of machine guns?<br><br>So I have to give Everquest’s system the nod over Anarchy Online.  I have a feeling others may disagree on this.  There is something to be said about having the ability to diversify your character.  Still I know that when I switch from a Rogue to a Warrior in Everquest, I will get a completely different game experience, whereas in AO switching from a fixer to a soldier will not really change your style a whole lot.  <br><br><b>Items and Quests</b><br><br>	This is an area where Anarchy Online has really improved over Everquest.  I love the generated mission system.  You go up to a mission generator, put in your parameters and request a mission.  You will then be sent to an area to perform a duty, whether it is fixing a machine, killing a traitor, finding a lost item, or some other similar quest.  When you get there, your own private dungeon is created.  It generally takes an hour to finish and at the end, you usually get a nice reward.  You can do missions privately or in a group.  This sure beats Everquest’s go camp 10 monsters for a cheesy reward quest system.  <br><br>However, the missions are better in concept in execution, which is a general theme running through much of Anarchy Online.  I know I promised not to mention this again, but right now AO is a truly flawed game.  Missions are often broken and can’t be finished.  The pathing is so bad that you have no idea which Mob will start to shoot at you and you can often find yourself firing at a Mob through a wall while another one stand right in front of you oblivious to your presence.  When you lag, the doorways disappear and can’t be crossed, stranding you in the middle of the mission.  Still, assuming all of this gets fixed, the missions may well be the best part of Anarchy Online.<br><br>	Anarchy Online also gets a huge thumbs up for making their equipment level sensitive (well actually skill level sensitive, but it works the same way).  There will be no twinking in AO, so a newcomer will not find himself wondering why everyone else in the game his level seems to be decked out in great gear while he’s scrounging for enough credits to buy the basics.  Plus, equipment drops randomly in accordance with the level of the mob, so there is no camping in AO either.  And on top of that, just about everything can be bought in the stores.  You are not going to be forced to sit in one place for 15 hours just to get that Phat Lewt.  These are huge plusses in Anarchy Online’s favor. <br><br>	There is a negative side to this though.  Because it is so easy to get the items you want by yourself, there is little trade going on.  Also, there seem to be few, if any, unique or rare items.  I always thought items in EQ should drop more randomly, but that doesn’t mean they should become more common.  I think that the lack of rare items in AO will somewhat take away from the competition that a true game player likes to feel.  While a game should not be all about Phat Lewt, that is still a fun element of EQ that seems to be missing from AO.  Still, overall I like the way AO handles quests and items better than the way EQ handles them.<br><br><b>Overall Game Play</b><br><br>	So which game is more fun to play?  That’s really the bottom line in evaluating a game.  When you are sitting at the computer looking at the AO and EQ icons side by side, which one are you more likely going to click? <br><br>Well, that’s a complex question.<br><br>	They are both fun games.  If you can afford both, I recommend you play both.  Why?  Because of the differences.  While they are supposedly of the same genre, in many ways these are completely different games.  AO is a nice solo game that has the added advantage of having other people around to occasionally chat with and interact with and even group with.  You can play it for an hour and actually accomplish something.  Plus, I haven’t even mentioned the pvp aspects, mainly because I have not tried that yet.  EQ is a great group game where you can really lose yourself in a group experience.  When you have enough time to truly immerse yourself, this is the game to play.<br><br>	In all, even after setting aside the bugs and lag and lack of playability of AO at this time, I definitely prefer Everquest over Anarchy Online.  Of course, EQ’s had more than two years to polish and hone itself to relative perfection, and I’ve also played EQ a lot more than I have played AO, but I doubt that even in four months or so when Anarchy Online finally reaches its potential and becomes a truly final product it will surpass Everquest.  This does not mean Anarchy Online is a bust.  If you can get past the bugs and the lag there is a pretty nice game in there.  If you only have the ability to purchase one more game this year, then by all means save your money and wait for The Shadows of Luclin expansion or perhaps Dark Age of Camelot.  If you don’t mind paying $50 for something that is flawed but still kind of fun, then this game is worth a try.  Whatever you do, don’t cancel your EQ account though, because you may find yourself wanting to come back in a month or two and you will want that level 60 warrior still sitting there when you return.<br><br></blockquote></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Out of the big 4 only AC had a stable start.  I played through the UO bugs and EQ zoning hell (you are on top o the world!!! 10,000 dam after the freefall).  Unfortunately AO did come out too soon, they should have waited another month because its very stable now (except for the memory leak)  <br><br>Allakhazam had some good points but the My Experience triple post cleared up a lot of the misconceptions he had.  Grouping is much better for exp than Solo missions.  Missions are where the money is though.  As for the social aspect, i have had no problems finding friends and groups but you have to remember people are experimenting with the solo aspect of the game as well.<br><br>Another point to bring up is a recent comment of the day from Funcom.  They said that the 1st 75 lvls are supposed to be fairly fast, in a couple months even casual players can have a pretty powerful character to fight with and explore the world.  Then they can make a new one from a different profession and experiment.  The 75-200 lvl range is for the devoted and for the power lvlers.  These are the people who have to get to the top 1st or have the perfect Uber tweaked char.<br><br>This is AO's way of making the game for everyone, in EQ its pretty tough to lvl a char at any rate playing casually.  Also the downtime in AO is WAY less than EQ.  With every profession being able to use Nano paks and Treatment Paks downtime is 1 min not 10-30mins.  My reading will suffer accordingly :) <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The writer says that AO isn't a comunity based game like EQ and that AO focuses on soloing. Well I can't imagine this writer played his characters beyond level 6. The fastest and best way to move up is by grouping.  Soloing definately works but isn't the most efficient.<br><br>On top of that, check out the chat and communication features in the game. Yes there isn't a global chat (ooc) but who wants that? That is OOC. AO stays mainly IC.  Examples of IC is not being able to pick  your name so you dont have some guy named "Pickles" - instead you are given a First and Last name IC, and you can choose a "nick name."  So Pickles or "Bloodhound" although silly isn't your "real" name but a Nick Name.  <br><br>The communication chanels are awesome. you can easily organize a major battle. You have your group/team chanel, you can then create multiple chanels that can include multiple groups/teams etc. you can log/listen to any of these chanels very easily - with just a click of a button. <br><br>Dieing in AO is much easier on the human mind.  You don't loose levels and if you "insure" (a means to save your progress) you can't loose any experience before Insuring.  You can actually get nice items at level 1.<br><br>As per graphics, the author somehow prefers ugly 2D looking plantlife to that of the amazing graphics of AO.  Then he suggests people wait for Luclin.  I think what he fails to grasp is that Luclin although ads a race, and improves graphics. The graphic engine screenshots don't really look that good when compared to Neocron, Anarchy Online and Horizons.  Don't forget it's the same game. It's the same company that bans people without warning, it's the same game where you waste your life away for hours and hours just trying to get back level 49, because you died to many times.  <br><br>Personally I played EQ starting a month after it launched.  It was good in the begining, but quickly became Politically Correct. It now has a market for a G rated audience.  Neocron, Anarchy and many others are targeting a more adult audience.  the newer games do not ban people for cussing.  <br><br>On the flip side, the only thing I can even try and continue playing on EQ is Sullon Zek. All other servers IMO have no validity as there is no real goal. the goal of blue servers in EQ is to gain cyber crap.  Who cares if you have a new helmet? it doesn't even show on your body for crying out loud.  Where as in Sullon Zek, and other PvP game environments level determines your power in the game and over other players.  That at least is a legit goal for moving up in the world.  <br><br>AO also has a 100% better guild environment, where you have guild buildings/apartments, bank accounts, you can set a payroll for members of the guild to pay them once a month, week, day etc.  <br><br>AO is much more of a RPG IMO then EQ - which is a game about camping for hours and hours and playing for weeks and weeks to regain a lost level.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey man, I have seen the graphics for Luclin and they suck.  IT does NOT compare to the beauty of Neocron, Horizons or even AO.  <br><br>Check out Neocron and then Horizons and then look back at Luclin and the shots on their own site. It isn't as good as those other games.  <br><br>Luclin is a weak attempt to improve graphics and a VERY weak attempt. It still lags behind Horizons and many other games.<br><br>And guys, you didn't address the other point: These other games actually improve the idea of the whole gaming environment. Other games, are busy improving the graphics beyond Luclin and improving PvP, improving concepts of questing and grouping... taking land in battles... etc.<br><br>About death: Yes death should have penalties, in AO it does - but it doesn't have to if you are clever enough.  But in EQ the penalties are off the scale of normalcy. I see people spend thousands of hours just to get back the two levels they lost in some series of raids.  I myself have been in a similar situation. I saw my life becoming the game. I had to spend more and more hours to retain something that wasn't worth it. Where is the pay off?<br><br>Will being level 30 mean anythign in EQ? how about 40? or 50? or 60? what do you get? more spells? but better spells gainst better monsters = no change to the game.  As long as there is no PvP there is no challenge.  Sullon Zek has the right idea. I respect that one server in EQ. BUT, it's still the same game where you HAVE to go kill stupid crap to level up even if you are playing a monk.  where is the sense of playing a monk that has to go around wasting wildlife so that he can improve???? EQ has become a RPer's nightmare.  I'm not saying that AO is the grand RP environment, but it's a step in the right direction. Where playesr can have nice things without having to kill 500 spiders, or buy 10k plat on ebay.  In AO You can make money easily on your own - even at level 1 you can make enough to buy nice clothes, decent weapons for your level and so forth.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Interesting review...  I have played EQ for about 6 months...  and in that time, being only a casual gamer, i raised a 30th Druid and 25th Monk.  It was a pleasant experience for sure.  I had had the opportunity in the past to try UO for a couple of months, but the graphics and gameplay didnt appeal to me at all.  When i learned about AO, i applied and got selected to test the Beta 3.<br>I can respect Allakhazam's opinion, but i have to question his objectivity....?   To be honest, there was no need for a review coming from him.  He is not in any special position offering a unique expertise on the game through either an association with the developer or through extensive gameplay.  There was nothing new or particularly interesting in his review.<br>  He obviously has a vested interest in maintaining the viability of EQ since it has provided him with a source of income for the last 2 years!  In terms of website, he is definitely the authority on EQ.  Unfortunately for him, there are other sites out there that are doing a much better job on AO at the moment...  One can only wonder whether this review could be but an attempt at salvaging some of his departing customers.  One thing his review has done for sure for me now is to delete this link regarding AO.  Plainly put, i personally like AO much better than EQ, (for many reasons) and as such dont care for a webmaster who doesnt...  Thank you though for your efforts on EQ, they were much appreciated, and i wish you luck in maintaining the viability of the game.  Competition is healthy.  Is that what the EQ giant is feeling now?  A much more decent competition than AC or UO were?  Mayhaps the giant is not as secure anymore...  as he should!  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think EQ's emphasis on grouping, camping and it's general quest systems sucks.  I'm not in high school or college, so I don't have 8 to 12 hours a day to play.  Alla's comments on the AO's emphasis being on soloing really appeals to me.  I almost want to run out and buy the game because of it.  Then I think about all of the reported bugs/lack of playability and I hear a bunch of people saying that it's completely the opposite in terms of being soloable.<br><br>/sigh<br><br>I just hope the folks over at Shadowbane and/or DAOC are taking notice.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'd like to say, it may have been said already, I havnt read all the posts, when the reviewer saidthat soloing is faster than grouping, he was more wrong than he could, possibly, possibly know. I am currently a level 59 engineer. I can tell you with 100% certainty, that grouping, is 10 times faster than soloing, and Im not even exagerating. The only reason I do missions know, is for cash and rewards /mission tokens. it also becomes harder to solo after around level 40, alot harder. That orange mob will lay a smack down for 120 a time and running isnt such an option like EQ.<br><br>Another points Id like to add is about the reviewer talking about classes being similar. i would wonder what levels he has played too, because as you get higher, the roles start to come through more than say how it is, below 50, which is shoot shoot shoot no matter what class. But as the non total fighter classes start to do less and less damage with their pistols or whatever, theirs roles change and its more efficient for them to use some of their class specific skills to help the group.<br><br>Anoter small points, when EQ was released, servers were down 75% of the time, thats no worse than the problems AO has had, I mean we are only weeks in, and now a massive amount of problems are fixed, in fact just about only memory leak still remains, and lag with huge amount of people.<br><br>Also you said about how all classes can use all weps and armour. Maybe so, from a lower level charachters point of view, as with most of the review. As you get higher, you do not have enough skill, say as an engineer, to keep your casting skills, your weapon skills, and engy (trade and related) skills, and stats up, you have to narrow down. This will result in 1. You wont have as much, not even nearly as much AC as say an enforcer, who can devote all his points into str, stam, agil, anything he needs for the best armour.<br>2. There is no way, a casting based class, can keep up with say, ranged energy, fling, burst, rifle, SMG etc, the kind of skills that are required to use most top class items. most wont even have say their pistol and multi ranged maxed, and will be using much lower qaulity level than say a soldier. As you grow higher, you will start to see a very, very large rift between fighters, and other classes damage output, and the weapons they can use. I can currently as a fighting engineer, use just over half the qaulity level weapon as say a soldier, who has skills to insure he can use those weapons. So although its true we can all use same weps and armour, only to a certain extent, and a certain qaulity level. So really there is a large difference in classes, and what equipment they can use. <br><br>A last point, you said how playing one class, doesntr seem different to playing another, I ponder weather you have actually played more than one class, above the level of about 50, it seems unlikely, because there are so many routes that can be taken, ive tried two different engineers over level 50, and my game play was absolutely different, I took a fighting route, with dodging skills, and little trade, other than to use trimmer,s which my other engy specialised in, I also get pets lower than my nano mage engineer, and its interesting finding ways to boost those skills, also being an atrox now, my stat allocation is totally different, I am a tank engy (heh) and my game is completely different, to my frail nano mage engy.<br><br>One LAST thing, I would like to see rare items on AO, that added alot of fun to my EQ game play, the idea of one day getting that glorious piece. Also I would like to see missions, that go on over a long period (like EQ quests could take you weeks etc) and the final reward be very desirable, possibly even that rare I spoke of. <br><br>Ok thats it, I hope you read this, and dont flame me for this, just give me your opinions<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

The game lags slightly in the cities, but otherwise there is no lag.  <br><br>Allakazam says this about professions<br> <br>"First, the professions don&#8217;t vary that much from each other at the start. Because of the easy availability of healing and nano restoring devices, everyone in the game can heal themselves and cast multiple spells. Plus, everyone can wear the same armor and use the same weapons. Naturally, everyone is going to start to figure out the best weapons, armor, nanos, etc and use their skills accordingly."<br><br>What a bunch of bull@#%^.  He obviously doesn't understand that the cost of ips differs greatly for each profession for the same skill.  A nano-tech isn't going to invest in 1h Edge because it would take all it's ips.  And nanos are mostly profession specific.  I lost a lot of respect for Allakazam today.  Pls know what you're writing about before you post something like this, k, thx.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

You can play for a 90 minute block of time in the evenings... make progress... and then have a massive PvP brawl every other weekend for a couple hours.  AO will live (or die) by the quality of the PvP experience.<br><br>  Playing EQ, I feel that unless I can devote a 4-5 hour block of time... its not even worth logging on.  I still think its a great game (better than AO, truthfully), but I find the time requirements oppressive.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been playing EQ since beta. I've got several 50+ characters, so I guess you could say I know EQ quite well. However, about 2 months ago I lost the desire to play. EQ became boring. I started doing crazy things.... I took all the equipment off my level 52 druid and gave it to a newbie cleric and shaman. I would purposely solo my 53 necro by root/dot/dd - never use a pet. (I ended of getting killed half the time.) I would use my shaman (56) only for plvling people, no camping or grouping. I quit all the guilds I was in.<br><br>AO came out. Whoop! Something new to try. I had a great time in the newbie section doing missions. I thought AO was really cool. When I finally ventured out of the newbie area into town, I discovered what the definition of LAG really meant. I've never experienced anything like it in any game I've ever played. Stuck for minutes. Unable to move. I started to avoid Newland and Tir like the plague. AO is fun when it worked..... WHEN being the key word here. <br><br>All in all, they're just games. A way to have fun. Both of provide enjoyment and as long as we remember they ARE JUST GAMES, it's cool. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Playing AO reminds me alot of the early days of UO.  New, different and lots of problems.  Since I played all three from the retail beginning I'll give you all my 2 cents.  UO started with tech isssues (lag) and never were able to fix it.  EQ had small tech issues effecting playeability and were fixed.  At this point I wonder if AO's lag type issues are correctable.  If the lag and tracking does get fixed I believe this will prove to be an awesome game.  When it comes to playing AO the first thing I notice is it's much easier than EQ.  All the issues that drove me nuts with EQ are not a problem in AO.  You die? no problem you pop up at a safe reclaim center.  No more 3 or more hour corpse runs and begging some necro to help.  You want to travel? no problem, hop the whompas.  No more 3 hour zone hopping and boats to get to the other side of the world. Of course you could beg a druid for a lift. Personally I dislike begging. Then there is grouping.  Finding a group in EQ has more than often been a real pain.  There's no place to go hang out and find a group while you do something else fun.  Often in zones you want to group in there is not enough people your level or too many people in the zone to make it worthwhile.  So your off on another 2 hour run to find a group in another zone around your playing level.  In AO if you want a group go hang out at a mission center in a town. People run thru EQ cities grab what they need and leave.  In UO people hang out in cities and chat, do trade skills, socialize. Eventually in AO I think you'll find people setting up groups, learning trade skills, auctioning and socializing. Then there is the problem of all the places in UO and EQ that nobody ever goes to.  That has always seemed like such a waste. It's called lack of content folks. From what Ive seen so far in AO, people are everywhere.   And then there is the issue of auctioning in AO. Click the friends list and check the box for the shopping channel.  Auctioning is very much alive and growing by the day in AO, folks.  And no more lvl 50's twinking their lvl 5 chars.  I'm giving AO a chance because I have faith in the overall playeability and fun potential of AO....but, (only) if they get the lag fixed.         <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are so many worlds coming out over the next few years, I can't see how one can get a foot hold everywhere. EQ still has alot of life left, and AO surely will get over its starting hurdles . Anyway, unless everyone has the same computer specs and internet connection conditions you could only offer a one sided opinion.  After reading some of the posts, it seems like a well beatin topic. The fun is when someone argues against something that someone else is experiencing:)  I don't get it;) Just pick up your rusty sword or cheesy blaster and have fun :)<br><br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
