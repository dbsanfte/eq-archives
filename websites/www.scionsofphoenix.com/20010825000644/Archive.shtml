<p><strong><font face="arial" size="2">Chardok = OWNED !@#$!@#</strong><br><br>Yesterday, we decided to go to Chardok and own it once and for all. It turned out that the royals couldn't handle the power of Scions. We killed the Prince once, the Queen twice, and the King three times. Congratulations to Ellka, Darieus, and Blearchie on their FA pieces (The third king drop was given to Tolnik of Vision who moved their raid back because of a schedule conflict). Also congrats to Draven on an incardine breastplate and everyone else who scored phat lewts! Sadly, the Queen didn't drop any blades, but everyone had a blast!<br><br><br><img src="http://members.home.net/sirastral/phoenix/king1.jpg"></img><br><img src="http://members.home.net/sirastral/phoenix/king2.jpg"></img><br><img src="http://members.home.net/sirastral/phoenix/queen1.jpg"></img><br><img src="http://members.home.net/sirastral/phoenix/queen2.jpg"></img><br><br><br><br><strong>Nibble is lazy</strong><br><br>Vile Nibble is lazy, so I'll update the news. This past weekend, on Friday, we got together in PoG and cleared pretty much all of it. Then on Saturday, we did some Trakanon (number 10?) slaying with our allies, Spheres of Transcendence and got a nice BP for Tiegos (Grats Tiegos!) and some teef for the Veeshan's Peak Key. Saturday evening, we had a guild meeting and held a small 6v6 double elimination tournament in the arena. Congratulations to team Caius (Caius Worr Aeliena Blazzter Menaddar and Kinder) the undefeated champions. Screenshots to come later.<br><br><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><br><strong>Severilous was the start</strong><br><br>March 8th,<br><br>Well last night we had planned Gorenaire but the bitch didn't spawn. <br>And seems that made our people get really pissed and they all went on a Dragon killing Spree.<br>So first Victim was Severilous, but we were still eager for more dragon blood..and Talendor was still alive..So everyone went to Skyfire and handed Talendor a Can of Whoop Ass.<br>And the night was young, and the people was already buffed. So the leaders decided, heck lets go kill woushi, lets say he has phat l3wt. We kill it and then we can use the WL portal.<br>Woushi went down too.<br><br>Great night for SoP and SoT.<br><p><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br></p><br><strong>Trakanon #? + 1</strong><br><br>March 7th,<br><br>OK this time Trakanon was reaaaaaalllly nice to us and droped BArd Guts and 2, yes 2 , Bard Breasplates.<br>Windsong Completed her FA and scored one BP.<br><br><p><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br></p><br><strong>Trakanon #?</strong><br><br>March 5,<br><br>Ok, I'm a lazy ass and I stopped counting.<br>Once again SoT and SoP got together and killed the poison dragon.<br>Armfield score the nice monk shoulder item (AKA Poison Mantle).<br><br><p><br>___________________________________________________________________________</p><br><br><strong>Lord Dajasdasdnmasndkaldkjsdfhaskjdhfajksdf</strong><br><br>March 4th,<br>OK so Astrel told me, we have to kill that Lord SomethingSomething in Velketor, he drops some phat lwet my twink could use...So what that in mind and being as selfish as usual we decided to rally the troops to kill Lord Dasdfhkjsdhflkjsahfgj <br><br>Well ok. wasn't that. <br>Astrel lead a great raid to Velketor, where only thing that survived was Mr. Velketor itself (and good cause we have 24 people only and I didn't feel like dying). <br><br><p><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br></p><br><br><Strong>The news not that new.</strong><br><br>Well, I've been lazy and couldn't update the news in the last couple of days so I'm going to do a briefing (screenshots not available at the moment)<br><br>March 1st: <br>I think the guildies are slaying trakanon while the vile Guildleader it's still at work.
