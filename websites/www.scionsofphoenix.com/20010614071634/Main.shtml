<p><strong><font face="arial" size="2">Venril Sathir, Innoruk and Paladin Epic.</strong><br><br>Venril Sathir!<br><br>Seems like yesterday was a busy day, It all started with servers going up and down and up and down!<br>After that we realized VS was up and it was late for Europe to take him! <br>We move our forces and killed VS cleanly (maybe 2 deaths) with an excellent plan executed by Hadoken and Siladil.<br>The loot was The Wizard staff for Magna (YEs we are getting closer to finish those wizard epics damn it!) as well as some Ranger and Druid Legs.<br><br>Paladin Epic!<br>I don't even know how but looks like Koti managed to go to Fear and finish his epic while we were doing .. something else..<br><br><br>Innoruk!<br>SoT was in hate, Innoruk was up... anything else needs to be said? oh yeah! We get invited to go up and hang out with SoT<br>Ibyza, Friday , Lupisac and me go up there cause we are bored, looks like maestro was killed and there is another guild in the first floor (maybe SOT killed the maestro), then we move to the second floor and start clearing the way to Innoruk (who we found out got moved to some other part of the second floor).<br>We have around 24 people, but this time instead of 2 clerics we have 4! We think we may not have enough to kill him (lol) so we get another SoP group up there.<br>We clean our way to him (had to find him so took us a while and cleared almost all the floor doing it ... LOL)<br>We have 30 people but a lot of tanks(10) and 5 clerics.<br>Friday is scared to hell , he has to slow the mofo!! <br>Tiarra sacrifices herself and Tashes the sucka! Dalphania engages. we start killing him..10 minutes later, a couple of rezzes and a lot of bitching from the clerics that kept going out of mana.. The Big pickle is dead.<br>Loot as usual Sucked asss.. 2 oggre ring (WTF we dont hire oggres)<br>and some Erudite shoulder piece and DE mask (Gratz Darieus)<br>After all this is still one of the fights that makes me have fun in this game! good i love to kill inno with less than 30 people!<br><br><br><br><br>Posted by: <a href="mailto:nibble@scionsofphoenix.com">Nibble</a> - Wednesday, April 18, 2001 12:28 PM</font><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br></p>

Anyway gratz again =)<br><br>Ah before the rogues got RB, we killed gorenaire and finally the bitch droped the Book for Koti, so we will SOON see another paladin epic.<br><br>Posted by: <a href="mailto:nibble@scionsofphoenix.com">Nibble</a> - Thursday, April 12, 2001 13:23 PM</font><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br></p>
