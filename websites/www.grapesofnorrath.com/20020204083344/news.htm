<b>Jan 31, 2002 - Guild Status Updade</b>
<p><b>Tomorrow evening, I will begin the proceedings for starting the new
guild.&nbsp; I am going to try for "The Grapes" as the guild name.&nbsp;
If for some reason Verant will not allow the use of that name we will have
to pick a backup one.&nbsp; The process could take several days, so I don't
expect anything to happen before next week or even the one following.</b>
<p><b>I will be online for anyone to talk to or to try to answer any questions.</b>

<p><b>Jan.26, 2002 - Guild Status</b>
<p><b>This is a cut and paste from a post by lady Valerisa on the Grapes
message board:</b>
<p><b>Well this is where we are. Apparently the guildleader flag was not
attached to my Station acct in August like it was supposed to have been.
Therefore, since the GM will not give me the guildleadership (since the
original GL is active in the game again) they will only give it to his
acct and then he can do with it what he wants afterwards. I was told that
basically the guild name Grapes of Norrath "belongs" to the original Station
acct that it was first given to way back in 99. I, for personal reasons,
do not wish to contact this person for yet a third time now to get his
cooperation to get this "fixed." He really has never been happy that we
were still using "his guild name" and he will not be happy that Verant
has yet again screwed up our request that the GL flag was not transferred.
We have tried to get it moved to my acct 2 other times now with no success.
I also know that this person will not cooperate with Kero personally to
get this resolved either. I found out last night that a few of my chars
were still in the guild as officers so I re-invited a few of us, then Nae
just poofed out of the guild seemly randomly. As long as we have no guild
leader we can't correct this. We can't make a "Grapes of Norrath" as long
as the original GL acct continues to play even if he is not in the guild
(he "owns" the name.) The GM's only suggestion was to create a new guild
with a different name or all move to a diff server if we wanted the Grapes
name bad enough. I'm open for suggestions on this but I will not deal with
the original owner myself this time. I'm sorry but I just don't want to
have to deal with him again on this. Blame Verant because if they had truely
transferred the GL flag to my acct (as they assured me it was back in August)
this would not have happened this way. I've loved being a Grape and the
name has so many great memories for me personally but I'm at a loss as
to what to do since Verant is not helping us at all.&nbsp;</b>
<center>
<p><b>*******************************</b></center>

<p><b>Lady Kero and I have talked this over for a long time and have come
to the conclusion that it may be best to reform the guild; hopefully with
all the current Grapes joining us.&nbsp; We would like to (but not necessairly)
have the new guild name include the word "Grape", so that we can still
call ourselves Grapes.&nbsp; Also, because the E'ci community as a whole
recoganizes the Grape guild; and while many of us Grapes are not at a point
where they will go on raids, yet, having a place in the community is very
helpful in gaining a place on those raids.&nbsp; The Grapes of Norrath
has such a position on the E'ci server and it wouldn't hurt to maintain
that.</b>
<p><b>We ask that those of you who read this, please pass the word to every
Grape that you know.&nbsp; We do not want to lose anyone.</b>
<p><b>A few possible names have been suggested and I list them here.</b>
