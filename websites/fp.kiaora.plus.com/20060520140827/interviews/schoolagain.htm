        <br>
        The details before the rant. I got the mail today. Guess what was in it?
        That's right a letter from DeVry saying that I don't have some stupid
        something I need to be enrolled and if I don't do it in two days they
        are going to drop me from all my classes. HAPPY FRICKEN MERRY CHRISTMAS!<br>
        <br>
        Of course I immediately lost my temper and started ranting, raving and
        pacing. Chris takes said stupid letter from me. Reads it. Says
        &quot;Umm, I know you can get your degree faster through DeVry, but
        maybe we should consider going to a school that isn't trying to piss you
        off. Besides, I know that if this continues you are going to kill
        someone. And Sara and I have become attached to having you here with us.
        And if they do this again, I am not sure that you won't start beating
        people over the head. &quot; Chris is a very smart man. So I call the
        moron who sent me the letter. Ok, that's not fair. She's not a moron.
        She's doing her job and had no idea the HELL I have been through thus
        far. She isn't at her desk so I leave a message.<br>
        <br>
        The message is as follows &quot; I just got this letter in the mail
        saying that I need to take some test or you will drop my classes in two
        days. There are so many things wrong with this statement that I am going
        to address them one at a time. Issue 1. This is the first I have heard
        about this. I had no idea I needed this test, nor do I know what it is.
        I believe that it is totally unfair and unjust to expect me to take this
        test in 2 days since NOBODY in your entire school informed me it was
        necessary. Furthermore, it's not listed in ANY of the documentation I
        received. Issue 2. So far EVERYTHING having to do with my registration
        has been messed up. I do mean everything. I have yet to have ONE SINGLE
        THING go correctly when it comes to this school. I can say that with all
        honesty and I have documented proof. 3) If I get even ONE MORE
        threatening letter in the mail from this school I will withdrawal and
        take my financial aid to another school. Between almost 'accidentally'
        losing half my financial aid, 'accidentally' misplacing my grades from
        last term, forgetting to tell me I need to provide shot records, trying
        to drop me from classes because I didn't give you my licence plate
        number that you never told me you needed, and now this I am
        understandably frustrated. This list doesn't include a teacher that has
        decided not to teach class, and a c++ teacher who doesn't know what he's
        teaching. It also doesn't include the 3 weeks I have tried to change my
        address with you people. Now I realize that you aren't the person to
        blame for all of this. I have tried to reach my academic advisor with 3
        e-mails and 2 calls. Amazingly I have received no answer from her. What
        a shock. So, since I am fed up. Since nobody will help me, and since you
        are the last one to piss me off, I have decided to make YOU responsible
        for helping me. If I don't hear from you in 24 hours I will drop all my
        classes and remove all money from your school. And whey they ask why I
        will tell them it's your fault. Here is my phone # and here is my info.
        Thank you.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Got a call back in 30 minutes. Amazing how that works.<br>
        <br>
        So I talk to her. She apologizes. Finally I find out that the person
        they assigned me as an academic advisor left last month. Apparently
        nobody is checking her e-mail or her voice mail. :wtf So I calmly
        explain all that has happened to me. And I said &quot;Look I need help.
        I need someone who can see what else I might be missing and maybe go to
        bat for me. This is ridiculous.&quot; She agreed and gave me the night school
        head dean. I called her and am waiting for a response. In the mean time
        I have to take some test, but she is at least giving me till the end of
        the quarter to do so. (End of Feb)<br>
        <br>
        I swear they are trying to kill me.<br>
