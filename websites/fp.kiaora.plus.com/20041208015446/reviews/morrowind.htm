<h1>Morrowind</h1>
<div align="justify">
<table WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="553" valign="top" align="justify">
      <p>Morrowind is the long awaited follow-up to the Elder Scrolls enormous RPG Daggerfall. If you think Morrowind is big you should try that sometime! There are no multiplayer options so this is a game for those anti-social moments.
      </p>
      <h2>
      The World and its Inhabitants</h2>
      <p>
      Morrowind is a land whose native inhabitants are mainly Dark Elves, or Dunmer as they prefer to be called in this instance. They are part of an Empire whose peoples also include other traditional RPG regulars, including high elves, wood elves, Orcs and Nords (barbarian types), but also include a couple of very EQ reminiscent races in the Kajhit (cat people) and Argonians (lizard types). You can't play a straightforward human; there are instead 3 human types races, namely the Imperials (probably the closest to ordinary human), Redguards (the token black guy representative), and Bretons (the more magic adept types).<br>
      The world you play in is absolutely huge, though as I mentioned previously, nowhere near as enormous as Daggerfall, which was really too big. There are luckily a few fast travel options, such as teleports at the mage guilds, boats, and overland transportation called the Silt Strider (using a beast of burden that looks like a house sized flea).</p>
      <h2>
      Gameplay - Combat</h2>
      <p>
      Morrowind carries over from Daggerfall a unique (even bizarre) combat system, which makes use of directional mouse movement, and your movement at the time, to determine what kind of attack you are trying to make (slash or stab for example). Luckily there is an option you can turn on to always use the best attack for the weapon you
      have equipped, as this takes some serious getting used to! You have no indication of the state of a creature's health, which makes deciding whether to run away or stay and fight a distinctly nasty business. There is also no equivalent of Everquest's /consider command, making first encounters with creatures a tad risky and frequent saves a very good idea.</p>
      <h2>Gameplay - Spells and Enchantments</h2>
      <p>
      Spellcasting is mana based, and hence a good supply of mana potions is a must! It is possible to train up in alchemy so you can make your own from various ingredients you can buy or scavenge for yourself from the surrounding scenery or critters. You can regenerate mana through rest, but this is not always possible deep in a dungeon and choosing certain deities may have the effect of increasing your mana poll but eliminating mana regen. Once you have a few spells it is also possible to find merchants who will make you new spells that incorporate any of their effects - for a rather large price. This is great for combining frequently used spells into a single click (the combination of levitate and invisibility is particularly handy for travelling I found). If you want to specialise in spell casting it is probably a good idea to invest in a fair bit of athleticism and speed so you can lob those fireballs from a distance and run away!&nbsp;<br>
      The Enchanting ability is probably one of the most powerful in game, as it allows to you attach spell effects to items ready for use without impinging on your mana pool. You need a very high skill and a very powerful "soul gem" in order to enchant an item with a decent long lasting effect, or a huge amount of cash so you can get an enchanter merchant to do it for you.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>
      Character Creation</h2>
      <p>
      You may choose from a predefined list when going through the rather long winded start up process, or answer a list of questions to have one chosen for you, or make up your own class from scratch. I would strongly recommend the latter, and also suggest that you make sure you choose an ability from each and every group as it is only improvements in those chosen skills that will gain you levels.
      After selecting race and abilities, you get to choose a deity, which will
      confer further special skills or abilities, along with drawbacks in some
      cases. The scale of customisation available at this stage must be one of the games major strengths for any rpg fan.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Quests</h2>
      <p>
      You do not actually have to follow the quests of the main plot line. You can join any guild, become a mercenary or simply explore and lay waste to all in your path! There are literally hundreds of sub-quests, giving the game a long-term replay value not often encountered. Performing a quest may get you a reward and open the way to further quests, but completion itself will not give you more skill ups - advancement in terms of abilities and levels is only through use of your primary and secondary skills chosen in character creation.</p>
      <h2>Complaints</h2>
      <p>The speed at which you can get around on foot is, um not very speedy. It was enough to make me get out the cheat codes :(<br>
      It takes too long to get going when you start a new game. I love to try different characters but I felt I was wasting an awful lot of time at the start each time. If only there was a non-beginner quick start option!<br>
      Apart from that my main complaint would be the system requirements (I started playing this on an Athlon 550, and it felt as if I was having to "zone" about every 50 yards!)</p>
      <h2>
      Verdict</h2>
      <p>
      Lots of replay value and the main plot line is increasingly absorbing. Some earlier quests are a little time consuming and pointless feeling, and you don't quite get the satisfaction of quest completion and levelling you do in Everquest. If you take advantage of the money pumps in game you may ruin it for yourself too, so beware! It's not exactly a fast paced game but can be immersive enough to keep you occupied for a long time.<br>
