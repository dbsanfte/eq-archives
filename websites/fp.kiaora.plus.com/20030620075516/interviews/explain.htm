      <td>Ok, I need someone to explain this to me. Cause it doesn't make sense
        to me. I just got an e-mail from a classmate of mine. We just finished
        our first week of class, and we have a java program due on Wednesday.
        The teacher gave us the lab to work on last Wednesday. It is a simple
        program to print out on the screen our name, our address, home and work
        phone numbers. The prof told us to use bogus info so nobody has to be
        worried about the info becoming available to just anyone.<br>
        <br>
        Now, to be in this class, you must have taken C++ and gotten at least a
        C. This is important cause it means that my classmate should have a
        basic clue how to print something to the screen. I mean we did it ALL
        THE TIME in C++. It's a simple concept and if you don't get it by now,
        change majors.<br>
        <br>
        So, my classmate sends me an e-mail telling me he doesn't understand the
        assignment, and could I help him with it? I reply:<br>

          Ok, you remember that hello world program we wrote? Pull that up.
          Change the function name from Hello to Address. Then, where we output
          hello world? Copy that line, and paste it 3x. Now, erase the first
          hello world and put your name there instead. Then the next hello world
          erase it and put your address. Then the next hello world erase it and
          put your home phone #. the last hello world erase and put your work
          phone #. Save it as Address.java. Then compile it. Then execute. It
          should work. Then you are done.

        For those who don't actually want to read all that, it's an amazingly
        simple program. It's all written. Just copy and paste a few things, and
        change a few words and the lab is done.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I get an e-mail back.<br>

        <br>
        umm. No. Cause our class starts at 7am and the computer lab doesn't open
        till 8am. Hence I would have no way to help you. Literally. Plus I hate
        mornings and I already have to leave the house at 5:45am. If I have to
        leave any earlier then that people will die. I am so not kidding.<br>
        <br>
        So then he asks me to send him my code. Umm. no. Mainly cause I don't
        have it here. I saved it on the schools system and can't access it from
        here.<br>
        <br>
        Now maybe I am being to rough, but come on now. This is the first
        assignment. We have done much harder in C++. Way way harder. I am all
        about helping, but really. I praticaly wrote the program for the guy
        already. I didn't worry about it cause to me it was a no brainer, but if
        he is having problems now, how much worse is it going to be when we
        actually have a challenging program?<br>
        <br>
        Ok, the final straw was just now when he wants me to come in to school
        on Tuesday to tutor him. He said he knows I don't have class, but would
        I mind? YES! And exactly where does it say on my forehead that I want to
        get up extra special early to help him out? I live at about an hour commute
        from the school. It's a pain in the butt for me to go in. I am not about
        to do it on a day I don't have to go to school. I would have to pay for
        a babysitter for the privilage of tutoring him. And it's an incredibly
        easy assignment. For those of you who don't program, this is the
        equivalent of &quot;Who is buried in Grant's tomb?&quot; DUH!
        Furthermore, the school provides tutors free of charge that are
        available every hour the school is open. Meaning that he could walk into
        the tutoring center at any point and sit down with a tutor (Who doesn't
        have to pay for a babysitter while working for free. At least they get
        paid by the school) who can at least try to help him.<br>
        <br>
        I just sent him an e-mail explaining all this to him in a slightly more
        tactful way. And I do mean SLIGHTLY.<br>
        <br>
        My question is, do I somehow have a sign on me somewhere that draws
        these people to me? Ultimately from his questions and his attitude my
        conclusion is that he doesn't want to do it and he is hoping I will
        write it for him. Cause he is too damn lazy to get off his own ass and
        change a few lines of code. How lazy is that? And apparently I have a
        sign on my head that says &quot;I like doing all the work for lazy
        people. please ask me to do it. Hell, ask me to come in early cause I
        like seeing the dawn. I am really an early person. Really. Deep down.
        No, wait...I kill early people. Woops. Slight mix up there. But for you,
        I will suddenly become a morning person. I just meat you, but please,
        let me do all your work so you can sit on your ass and reap the benefits
        of my hard work. I insist. Hell, when you get a job, I will come in and
        work for you so you can collect the paycheck and I will do it for free.
        &quot; The sign must be there. It's there with the &quot;piss me off
        cause I like it&quot; sign.<br>
        <br>
        The last question is, is it inappropriate to bludgeon him to death with
        a floppy disk?<br>
        <br>
        Ok, I am done. Thank you. This is much cheaper then therapy.<br>
