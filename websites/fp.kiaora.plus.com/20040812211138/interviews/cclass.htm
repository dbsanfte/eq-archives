      <td>Background info on my rant. I am taking C++ in school. My teacher has never taught this class before.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Now, to the rant:<br>
        <br>
        Maybe I am alone here, but when I ask a direct question I strangely enough want a direct answer. You are saying to yourself "but Azzna, what are you thinking? Why would expect a direct answer. That
        would be to easy!" and you would be right. I am working on lab 5 in C++ yesterday evening during the lab section of class. I have compiled my program (meaning there are no 'technical errors') however it isn't giving me the output I need. So I pull out my book and check to make sure I didn't forget anything. My code looks like the books examples. I pull out the
        in-class examples. Still looks good. One of my classmates looks at it. He can't see
        anything wrong. We both run the program again. Still not displaying quite right. So, I ask the teacher<br>
        <br>
        I should have known that was a stupid thing to do.  He looks at my code and says "let's start over" Umm?  Did I miss something? My code works. I am just missing one little thing. So why am I starting over. I ask. He says because it will help me learn. Umm. Ok. Sure. So we start over. He decides he wants me to use a for loop instead of a while loop. A for loop in the book is described as a loop you use when you are going to do the loop for a fixed number of times. Since the loop I needed to do was based on a condition, I didn't use that loop. I used the while loop which can handle the condition. The teacher tells me I can use a for loop. I say ok. How? He says "well, how do you think you would use one?" Let me think here. It's not in the book. It's not in my lecture notes. HOW THE HELL WOULD I KNOW? Did you miss that this is an introduction class? OH WAIT! Here it is. Let me just pull the answer out of my A$$! GAH.&nbsp;<br>
        So, I keep that all inside and patiently explain that I don't know, it's not in the book or the lecture notes. So I have no way of knowing. He asks the class. They all stare at him blankly. He then explains to the entire class how to use a for loop in this manor. Ok, I have learned something new.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I enter the for loop and rework my code. He helps someone else. I get the same problem. He comes back over. He looks it over and tells me he doesn't want me to use a while statement here, he wants me to use an if statement. I ask why. He says because he likes them better. ? I thought this was about getting the project done? I thought it was my program. So I change it to an if statement. Still the same problem. He changes a few other statements to what 'he' likes.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Finally, it's the way he likes it. He then says, "So, what do you think is the problem?" (Btw, 2 hours have passed at this point, and I still have the EXACT SAME PROBLEM!) I hold back my temper and say " I don't honestly
        know. I have compared the format of my program and loops with the examples in the book and in the lecture notes. I have all the necessary functions. two of my classmates have looked at it and they don't see the problem either. I am at a loss" Notice the patience. I deserve an award for that.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        He tells me the logic is wrong in the program. WELL DUH! HENCE THE REASON IT
        WON'T GIVE ME THE CORRECT OUTPUT! HUGE DUH! At this point my patience is shot. I have wasted 2.5 hours on this and I am pissed. My response is "If you would recall I pointed that out to you 2 1/2 hours ago. You made me rework my whole program so it was the way you would have coded it so you could ask me the same question? I have checked the examples in the book, I have checked my notes, I have checked with my classmates. According to what I know this shouldn't be happening." He looks at me. Realizes I am getting pissed and says to me "I know programming can be frustrating. Take a deep breath. There is no reason to get upset."&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        GAH! At this point my edit button fails me. "So, let me see if I have this straight. I had a program that complied. The only problem is this logic error. I ask you to help me. 2.5 hours later I have a different program with the same DAMN ERROR! And you STILL
        HAVEN'T HELPED ME! So I have wasted 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back, to reach the same point I was at. What's next? Doing the whole thing over with a do loop? Maybe I could print the code, take it outside and run it over with my car over and over and over again for 2.5 hours. At least that would be more fun." His
        response was "So what would you like me to do?" It took a supreme act of will not to smack him upside the head with my book. I take a deep breath and say "Here's the deal. I am a very direct person. I say what I want. When I ask for help I expect help. There is no need to look for some deep hidden meaning. There isn't one. When I say that I need help. That I have checked the book, I have checked my notes, and
        I have checked with my classmates, that means I have used the resources provided. I expect you to look at the issue. If you see the problem then tell me what it is. If it's something not covered in the book then you could explain it to me and how to avoid it in the future. If it's a
        stupid mistake, then tell me. Don't make me waste another 2.5 hours doing it over again. After 2.5 hours the only thing I have to show from your 'help' is a higher blood pressure. " He says "Ok, you need to put brackets here." I look at where he points and I place them there. My program works. I look at him and say "Why? The book is clear that I shouldn't put them there. Hence the reason I didn't. What did putting the brackets there do?" He explains it to me. Basically the book was wrong. Then he says " I wanted to give you the chance to figure that out for yourself." Now, I can kinda understand that. So I say "I see where you are
        coming from, but this is a beginners class. There is NOTHING in the book or in the notes from lecture to lead me to that conclusion. How was I suppose to figure that out?" He then comments that his teaching method is to question so we learn. That's all well and good, but it isn't lending itself well to our class. Since only 4 people have A's and they program in C++ for a living. The rest of us are barely holding our heads above water.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I am so very very frustrated. Not only did I waste a ton of time, but I had to redo my program the way he would have done it so he could ask me the same damn question. I am still pissed and frustrated. GAH!&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        ok, I am done now.&nbsp;<br>
