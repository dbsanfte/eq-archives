don't know how he does it. You would think that after about 25 Discworld novels they
would start to feel a little old hat, but he just keeps coming up with the
goods. </p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">&quot;The Truth&quot; takes journalism, and more specifically newspaper
journalism, as the subject, or perhaps victim, for Terry Pratchett's wry humor
this time round. If you have ever read those &quot;about the author&quot; type
paragraphs you will remember that Pratchett was himself once in the field of
journalism, so he is certainly writing about an area he is familiar with.
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">The dwarves have developed a method of turning lead into
gold... namely a printing press. It isn't long before William de Word, a born
muckraker, find's himself starting Ankh-Morpork's first newspaper, and
learning the pitfalls of investigative journalism the hard way. Many exaggerated
headlines, talking dogs and humorous vegetables soon follow.
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14"><span style="left: 197; top: 626; position: relative"><img border="1" src="../images/truth1.jpg" align="right" hspace="9" width="98" height="140"></span>The villains of the piece, a couple of hit men from out of town, are both
well developed. I particularly liked touches such as one of them being a
&quot;wannabe&quot; drug addict, who keeps trying to mainline oven cleaner.
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">If you are already a Pratchett fan you will be pleased to hear that a few
regular characters do make an appearance, namely the Patrician, Vimes, Gaspode
(the wonder dog), and of course Death.
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">Here is a little taster to whet your appetite:
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">&quot;It was curry tonight. And one of the strange things
about eating at Mrs
Arcanum's was that you got more leftovers than you got original meals.
That is, there were far more meals made up from what were traditionally
considered the prudently usable remains of earlier meals - stews,
bubble-and-squeak, curry - than there were meals at which those remains
could have originated.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">
The curry was particularly strange, since Mrs Arcanum considered foreign
parts only marginally less unspeakable than private parts and therefore
added the curious yellow curry powder with a very small spoon, lest
everyone should suddenly tear their clothes off and do foreign things.&quot;
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 14">Note that this excerpt demonstrates the positive aspects of
being a professional author, namely you are allowed to start sentences with an
&quot;And&quot; without some English teacher performing unspeakables with a red
biro.</p>
