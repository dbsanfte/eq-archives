      <td valign="top" align="left">It's about time we had another game review
        here at EQ Women I thought, and there is simply no contest about what it
        should be... Black and White from Lionhead is simply the strangest and
        most absorbing game I have played since errr... Deus Ex I guess :)
        <p>Need a break from EQ and have a penchant for both strategy/sim and
        roleplaying? It's an interesting mix from the creator of Populous, and
        is the only &quot;god game&quot; I have enjoyed since Civilisation II
        (yes I have alpha centauri and Civ III, but it was just more of the
        same). Basically, you play a new God whose actions will determine
        whether you are seen as good or evil, or something in-between, and at
        the same time you must wrest control of the belief in the hearts of
        villagers under the influence of rival Gods. You also have a creature
        who you can teach to perform miracles, impress villagers and fight other
        creatures - and it too starts out a blank canvas, capable of good and
        evil deeds, playfulness and greed, kindness and aggression. There is a
        simple system of punishment and reward, plus you can encourage it to be
        interested in particular things...</p>
        <p>Black and white has a pretty steep learning curve, and even moving
        around feels pretty strange at first, as you click and grab your way
        around the beautifully rendered landscape with a disembodied hand, but
        you do get the hang of it! You have to tend to your villagers desires
        enough for them to keep believing in you, either by means of miracles or
        by actually directly helping with things like farming and forestry. You
        can also expand your villages with a building program when you have
        enough resources, though I have to say that one annoying feature was
        that simply finding enough room on the landscape for necessary buildings
        like graveyards and workshops could be quite hard at times.</p>
        <p>But it's not just a beat the other god and win game (though you can
        play like that by choosing skirmish games). The main game has a strong
        plot with many sub-quests for you to perform, often introduced by your
        good and evil consciences... There is a particularly amusing one in the
        first land involving some villagers who want to sail off in a boat; they
        reminded me somewhat of the pirate gnomes in Vellious, though it has to
        be said that the humans of Black and White look <i>remarkably</i> like
        halflings! The only annoyance here is that if you get the urge to start
        a new god, the only way I have found of doing so is to start a new full
        game, and as the first 30 minutes or so is heavily tutorial guided this
        is rather a pain...</p>
        <p>Among the many novel features of the game, one that stands out for me
        is the closest you get to a shortcut to casting a miracle, which is by
        using what they have called <i>gestures</i>. The idea is that you have
        to draw a spiral shape in mid air to indicate that you want to cast a
        miracle, then trace out the shape of the spell - a sort of W shape for
        the water miracle for example, or the S shape shown in the screenshot
        here for the food miracle. It's a real test of your mouse control I can
        tell you! Once you get the hang of it I think it adds very nicely to the
        atmosphere of the game...</p>
        <p>Like EQ, Black and White is very time-consuming, so if you are
        looking for a quick filler before your guild raid this would not be your
        first choice! It does have the advantage of a pause button however... It
        is also very challenging - but not too challenging in my opinion, a
        nicely balanced and multi-layered experience of indeterminate genre. I
        also liked the humorous aspects rife in the game - I love it when your
        creature dances with the natives (the tiger break-dances with them!),
        and the dancing cow <i>still</i> seems funny but maybe that's just me :)</p>
        <p>I can't really end the review without pointing out what must be
        obvious from the screenshots: the game is graphically superb, and not
        too clunky either! A feast for the eyes on top of everything else! Ok
        I'll stop raving about it now.............</p>
