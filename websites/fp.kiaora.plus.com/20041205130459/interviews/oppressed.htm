        <p align="justify">So I went to the store today to buy groceries for my daughter's party on Sunday. As I am leaving and loading all the groceries into my trunk, this car pulls in next to me and almost hits the cart that my daughter happens to be sitting in. (You know that seat thing with the strap?) This car is a ford explorer, can't be more then 2 years old, with rap music blasting. On the bumper is a sticker for the highschool I graduated from. This kid gets out of the car and glares at me. I tell him "you need to pay attention. You almost hit my daughter. And the cart is well within my parking spot." He says "Look bitch. I am part of the
oppressed minority. You whiteys need to stop oppressing us."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yes, I am white. However for the record I am a huge mix of Scottish, Irish, English, Welch, German, French, Italian, Romanian, Cherokee Indian, Black, and Some sort of Asian that my grandmother
referred to as China men. Now, honestly, none of this makes up a large percentage, so I
usually don't sweat it and on those stupid forms I say I am white. It's way easier then explaining all this.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So the HUGE irony here is that this kid is white. I am talking pale, white with red hair and freckles white. I can
guarantee I have more "minorities" in my heritage then he does. Furthermore, the school he goes to is one of the top ten public schools in the country. He is driving a
relatively new Ford Explorer that I am sure his parents are paying for. I know it's his because some of the "decorations" he has in it I can't imagine any parent wanting in their car. So I want to know how he is "oppressed". Really. Daddy wouldn't get you the moon roof upgrade? Damn the man.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So, I ask him "Exactly how are you oppressed? I mean really? You drive a nicer car then me, you go to one of the best schools in the country.
You are in the district for one of the top 5 community colleges, so it's incredibly cheap for you to go there. You are super white, and since I know I have some
Cherokee, Asian, and black in my make up, exactly how am I oppressing you? really? I think in
reality you are oppressing me. Here I am doing my grocery shopping with my daughter. You come flying up in your
orthopaedic vehicle which I can only assume you drive because you are over compensating for a small penis and possibly you have a problem with premature ejaculation. You almost hit my cart which is in my spot. My daughter is sitting in this cart with the safety strap on. Your music is blaring so loud that had you hit her I don't think you could have heard either of our screams. You would have however felt my hands around your neck as I squeezed the life out of you for hurting my daughter. I
guarantee you if you headed into the inner city where there are TRULY oppressed people and you went up to them and said "Hello my oppressed brothers and sisters" a few things would happen. 1) at the very best you would be beaten up. It's completely possible you would die. Because you drive such a nice car I can't imagine they want you to be able to identify them. 2) your car would be in a chop shop. or it would be used in some crime. You have no idea what it's like to be oppressed. You are a white male. And a young one at that where your school caters to you. Your school has an excellent college prep
curriculum and it has many classes for those who might be going into plumbing or mechanics or something like that. You don't have to worry about being shot at school. You don't have to worry that a drug deal will go wrong and you will be caught in the cross fire. You live in a safe place where the average price for a home is $300,000.00. Get over yourself. You are not oppressed. You are the
oppressor. Now, get your scrawny white ass out of my way so I can put my child in the car and leave."<br>
<br>
He just looks at me with shock on his face for a second, then as I start pointing out everything that is good in his life, he gets this look of horror on his face. By the end I thought he was going to cry. I am
surprised he stuck around. Apparently nobody had talked to him that way.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This boy needed a serious beating with the clue bat. Gah. I still maintain that when I leave the house every moron within a 200 mile radius races out to their car in hopes of finding me and pissing me off. I also don't know why they always find me. Nobody else I know has shit like this happen to them. Just me. I swear the "Piss me off Please!" sign is getting bigger. It
probably is also listed on all GPS systems so the morons can navigate to me easier. /sigh</td>
