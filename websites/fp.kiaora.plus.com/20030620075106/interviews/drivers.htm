      <td>I have a question.<br>
        <br>
        Why exactly does every moron on the road leave JUST BEFORE ME? Really. I
        need to understand this.<br>
        <br>
        First off, while driving on a Chicago tollway/highway there are some
        basic rules. 1) If you are in the right lane, go the speed limit. 2) If
        you are in the middle lane go at least 10 above. 3) if you are in the
        far right lane you better be going 70+. Now for those people with out of
        state plates, I give them so leeway. But the morons who have IL state
        plates and their cars were bought at a local dealership. DUH! These
        rules have been in place for years. If you disobey them the cops pull
        you over. If the speed of traffic is 70, and you go 55, you will be
        pulled over. (I am not joking. Disrupting the flow of traffic here is
        bad. Very very bad.) So, perhaps going 35 if in the left lane is
        AMAZINGLY STUPID YOU MORON! If you have to go that slow, we have a right
        lane. We have a median. Use one.<br>
        <br>
        Also, don't ride my ass. I will hit my breaks. I tap them and watch the
        moron behind me slam on theirs. Even if they hit me it's not my fault.
        (for the record I do this when I am alone. Not with Sara in the car) I
        may be dead, but I will be right. And Chris and Sara will get a large
        settlement from your BMW driving ass' estate.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore. We have tolls. I hate to break it to you but we have had
        them for over 25 years. I know. I have been driving through them as a passenger/driver for that long. Hence it should come as no
        surprise that
        we have them. Furthermore, I can say with all certainty that the toll
        you are at hasn't changed in at least 10 years. Hence, you should know
        it's there. On the off chance you are a moron, the signs for the last
        mile saying &quot;Toll in one mile&quot; &quot;Toll in 1/2 mile&quot;
        should have given you a clue. If for some reason you failed to see the
        large yellow signs all over, then maybe the three sets of rumble strips
        should have given you a clue. That only happens when it's time to pay a
        toll dimwit. Get your toll money out first. I have an I-pass. I pay
        money, I get a machine, and it pays my tolls. When the money I have paid
        has gotten low, It automatically refills by charging my checking account
        a pre determined about of money. This means I don't have to stop.
        However, on the rare occasions I don't use the I-pass lane, I ALWAYS get
        stuck behind the moron searching his entire car for change.<br>
        <br>
        Which brings up another point. If you don't have an I-pass, don't go in
        the well marked I-pass lane. And if you do, don't stop and look for the
        machine to take your change, because it's not there. Hence the I-pass
        lane. See how that works? And don't hit your horn for 10 minutes
        blocking the rest of us up cause you went in the wrong lane. Honking
        your horn will eventually bring on one of three conclusions. 1) the toll
        worker will finally walk down here, find out what happened. Then he will
        point and laugh at your sorry ass, while writing you a ticket for being
        in the I-pass lane. If he isn't feeling as nice you will also get one
        for being a moron, and blocking the flow of traffic. 2) One of the cars
        behind us will get impatient and start ramming cars till he forces you
        through. This will cause me to strangle you since this car is new and
        now your stupidity caused damage to it. 3) I will get out of the car. I
        will walk up to yours. I will strangle you for stupidity, then pull your
        car out of the lane. I will go back to mine and continue on my way. No
        jury in all of Chicago would convict me and you know it. Furthermore,
        the people behind me will probably help. So, for the good of all, just
        drive through and pray there is no cop monitoring it. From the amount of
        people who do that and don't get caught I would say it's a safe bet. If
        it bothers you that much, send the transit authority $.50 and move on.<br>
        <br>
        I realize that there are 4 lanes on 294. I respect that. However, if you
        know your exit is coming up, maybe you could plan ahead and change
        lanes slowly so as not to cause confusion, panic and accidents. I
        realize this would be a large change from being in the far left lane,
        waiting till you see the physical ramp for your exit then turning your
        wheel sharply to the right without checking to make sure there is nobody
        in the other 3 lanes of traffic you are now trying to cross. However,
        the other three lanes of traffic often come to a screeching halt trying
        to avoid your lazy I can't plan ass. Often this does cause an accident.
        If you missed your exit, then go on a bit and turn around. The great
        thing about highways is that they have, brace yourself, multiple exits.
        This means you can take the next one. And you can either 1) turn around
        or 2) navigate your way to where you want to go from that exit. What a
        novel concept. If I ever find your lack of planning, self centered butt
        out of your car, I will point you out to my fellow Chicagoans and tell
        them what you do. When the mob mentality falls and you are nothing but
        a big black and blue blob on the ground I will point and laugh at you. I
        will even send you a get well soon card in the hospital. And when you
        come out, I will be waiting to point you out again.<br>
        <br>
        Which brings me to the next point. When Chris drives, these people stay
        home. We rarely encounter them. However, when I drive they are out in
        full force and my car has a HUGE target on it with a neon sign above it
        saying &quot;Me me me! Piss me off. I like it. Really. Make me your
        target for bad driving&quot; And right below that &quot;Jump in front
        of me in the toll line and search your entire car for change. Really,
        It's fun.&quot; What's worse is when I drive and Chris is in the car
        with me. He thinks it's just hysterical. He says I must have the worst
        cosmic karma ever. Because these things only happen to me. I speed the
        same as him, I drive the same as him for the most part, there is no
        logical reason these things should happen to me. However, they do. And
        he just thinks it's the funniest thing ever. He sometimes makes me drive
        so he can laugh. It's ok though. I kick him when he is sleeping to make
        up for it.<br>
        <br>
        I hate driving. My life would be so much better if when I got in the car
        everyone cleared from the roads till I passed.</td>
