<h1>Gazebo</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">I have watched her for several years now. Only one time did I actually see a
smile, but it dropped soon after. She comes here once a year, always the
Saturday of Memorial day weekend and always to this one spot. The first time we
saw her, we checked to make sure everything was ok. She assured us it was, well
as ok as everything could be. I only remembered her the second time, because of
the fabric she was holding. It turns out it was a dress, but hard to forget.
Blue and black checks over white. Why she didn't wear it, no one knows, no one
really wanted to ask.</font>
<p style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">The third year I saw her she looked so incredibly sad. She just sat there, and
looked at the dress until someone walked by. She would look up them, her eyes
would light up and when she saw who was walking by she would look back down to
her dress. I swore I saw her wipe away a tear, but when someone would talk to
her, there was no evidence of crying.</font>
<p style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">I made a wager this year. I bet a fellow volunteer that she would be there
again. We worked out the schedule so that we would be taking care of the flowers
by that gazebo all day. Sure enough, when we got there she was all ready sitting
at a bench and looking through a book of some sort. She no longer looked up at
each sound of approaching footsteps, but looked over the side instead, keeping
watch of the pathway that led to the hilltop. I watched her the entire day,
fascinated by the mystery I created surrounding her yearly vigil.</font>
<p style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">I left for a moment towards closing, I needed to arrange a meeting for the
following week. I waved goodbye to her, although I don't think she saw. The
gardens were closed when I came back. She was gone as I had expected. I walked
up to the structure she always sat. I wanted to know what she saw that no one
else did. A white rectangle of paper was laying on the loose stone pathway. Even
as I picked it up, I knew it belonged to her. It was a picture, curled around
the edges. A man and her with a dog sitting on a front porch. She had a hat on
and was heavier, but I knew it was her.</font>
<p style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">I brought the picture up to the gazebo and slipped it behind one of the boards.
Only a corner was visible, and I knew that when she came back in a year it would
be there for her.</font>
