      <td>ok, here's the problem.<br>
        <br>
        My daughter is 21 months old. She knows where her toes are, her nose,
        cheeks (on her face), her chin, her ears, her hair, and her eyes are.
        She also knows where her bellybutton is. If you ask her where these
        things are she points to them. However she is VERY concerned that her
        belly button will disappear. This is because her bellybutton is covered
        so when you ask her where it is, she immediately has to check to make
        sure it's still there. And she is constantly amazed that it is.<br>
        <br>
        Now, Sara has some outfits that are body suits or overalls. She also has
        PJ's that are the footie ones that zip up. All of these outfits cover
        her bellybutton so she can't get to them. If you ask her where her belly
        button is she freaks out till she is down to her diaper with nothing
        else on and she can see her bellybutton. Furthermore, she will refuse to
        put on ANY clothes so that tricky belly button doesn't thwart her again.<br>
        <br>
        So, why is it that when ever I put her in one of these outfits, some
        member of the family thinks it's funny to ask her where her belly button
        is? Then they point and laugh as she goes into a demonic rage at the
        disappearing belly button and the clothes which were designed to thwart
        her at every turn. Mean time, I have a 21 month year old demo possessed
        child freaking out over her missing bellybutton. And you can't just
        unsnap the clothing to show it to her. Oh no. The missing belly button
        must not only be found, but cannot be allowed to go missing again. So
        now we have nudie time. And if I change her diaper and cover the belly
        button we have a whole new issue. Literally she won't leave the diaper
        changing table till I adjust the offending diaper so that the proper
        respect to the bellybutton is shown.<br>
        <br>
        It is also apparently fun to ask Sara where Mommy's belly button is. And
        she comes running up and will not leave me alone till she lifts up my
        shirt to find it. And if I am wearing jeans, they must be moved to find
        the missing bellybutton. And of course after my bellybutton is found we
        must go looking for hers cause it might have escaped. Those belly
        buttons are tricky things.<br>
        <br>
        All I ask is that when she is wearing clothing that does not allow for
        easy access to the belly button that people do not ask her where her
        belly button is. This makes my job much easier. And furthermore, since I
        have had my bra exposed many times now in her quest for my belly button,
        I would request that we stop asking her to locate mine. It's been there
        for a long time and I am not concerned about it leaving anytime in the
        near future.<br>
        <br>
        Please. Stop the belly button questing madness!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your support.</td>
