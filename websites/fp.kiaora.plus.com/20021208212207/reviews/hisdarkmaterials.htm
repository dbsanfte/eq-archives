      <td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="2"><font size="2">As an avid
        reader, the discovery of a new author whose work you simply love is
        sublime. An impulse purchase in a supermarket introduced me to Philip
        Pullman, an author compared to Tolkien by highly respected reviewers
        such as those of the Times in the UK. Two of the books in this trilogy
        have been recipients of awards, the Whitbread book of the year for one.</font>
        <p><font size="2">For some
        reason various reviewers have labelled the trilogy as belonging to a
        &quot;young adult&quot; genre. I don't quite follow this except for the
        lack of graphic&nbsp; sex and the fact that two of the principal
        protagonists happen to be 12 years old. They certainly don't come across
        as having been&nbsp; written
        with a 12 year old audience in mind anyway! If they belong to a genre, I
        suppose they lurk somewhere between science fiction and fantasy, but
        there are healthy doses of theology and philosophy thrown in! It's
        probably the philosophical/theological angle that allows anything
        smelling like a fantasy to get good reviews from the Sunday Times, which
        is normally the type of newspaper to dismiss anything from that genre as
        pulp... I found the book an un-put-downable damn good read, and finished
        the lot in 3 days flat.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">Of the three
        books, I would have to say I most enjoyed the first, Northern lights (<i>The
        Golden Compass </i>in the US),
        which tells of the adventures of Lyra, an urchin brought up by scholars
        in an Oxford of another dimension, where people's souls are visible and
        accompany them around in animal forms they called daemons. The second
        two novels continue following Lyra and introduce Wil, a 12 year old from
        a familiar modern day Oxford with a mentally unstable mother and missing
        father. The two of them traverse several parallel worlds in search of
        Wil's father and the secret of Dust, a dark matter which appears to be
        the elementary particles of consciousness itself. The incidental cast
        includes witches, angles, harpies and a few scientists.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">The sheer
        originality displayed is probably what caused quite a few of the
        reviewers to have gone off on hysterical and predictable &quot;better
        than Tolkien&quot; raves. I don't personally find the comparison apt,
        the books are completely differing in style. For Tolkien plot is all
        really, but for Pullman character development is interwoven in the fast
        paced story-line.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">Here is a
        small excerpt from the second novel, The Subtle Knife.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2"><i>Will had
        to crouch and take two or three deep breaths and put his left hand under
        the other arm before he could go on. But he was intent on it; he stood
        up again after a couple of seconds, the knife held forward already.</i></font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2"><i>This time
        it was easier. Having felt it once, he knew what to search for again,
        and he felt the curious little snag after less than a minute. It was
        like delicately searching out the gap between one stitch and the next
        with the point of a scalpel. He touched, withdrew, touched again to make
        sure, and then did as the old man had said, and cut sideways with the
        silver edge.</i></font></p>
        <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2"><i>It was a
        good thing that Giacomo Paradisi had reminded him not to be surprised.
        He kept hold of the knife, and put it down on the table before giving in
        to his astonishment. Lyra was on her feet already, speechless, because
        there in the middle of the dusty little room was a window just like the
        one under the hornbeam trees: a gap in mid-air through which they could
        see another world.</i></font></p>
