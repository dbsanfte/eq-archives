<h2>The three faces of EQ (women)</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">I have been playing EQ for over a year now. With the exception of playing my
boyfriend's characters once in a while I have always played female characters. I
have also faced many issues as a female character, regardless of who is behind
that avatar, I see that female characters are treated differently from male
characters.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
Men in the game seem to look at female characters in three different ways. The
first is the Mother Figure, the second is The Damsel in Distress and the other
one is The Little Sister. Now, none of these is what most women who play EQ want
to be every single day they play. Once or twice a month, maybe every other week,
but not every single day.
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
<span style="left: 197; top: 315; position: relative"><img border="1" src="../images/willendorf.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" alt="This is the Venus of Willendorf in case youare wondering." width="94" height="176"></span>
The Mother Figure happens to be my least favorite. Who wants to tell a bunch of strangers
that insults aren't great in /shout or that there are people playing who may be
under the age of oh, 10 and their parents don't necessarily want them hearing
every 4 or 5 letter word in the book. In groups we don't want to settle looting
arguments or organize every little thing. While we may enjoy that every once in
a while it is not something we want to make our career. I have no desire to be
the one to decide that looting will be casual and that items of any worth will
be randomed. I then don't want to deal with the petulant 35 year old man who is
peeved because he didn't get the weapon and someone else did who it wouldn't
serve nearly as well as it would him and then go to the &quot;Man&quot; of the
group/crawl/raid and complain to him and tell him to get me in line. And I don't
want to hear how pathetic I am as a leader because you didn't get what you
wanted. I don't want to be your mother, I don't want to remind you to behave or
tell you not to pull when the enchanter and cleric are down to less than 10% of
there mana capacity. Some of us are all ready mothers, some may be mothers soon
and others don't ever want to be mothers. Besides, you all ready have a mother,
you don't want two.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
I have a dog. While I do agree he isn't a &quot;child&quot; per se, I still
clean up after him, make sure he's fed and take him for a walk. I also do poop
patrol and the training. I have no desires, wants or wishes to come to EQ and
clean up after your bad pulls or your littered corpses that make it impossible
to target anything. I don't want to make sure you have food, because you forgot
to get it before you went to Nek to kill Guardians and are KoS in the city so
you can't get the food. I don't want to make sure that everyone is happy all of
the time. I don't want to be dealing with your pet because he got off his leash.
I have one of those all ready thank you. I am not your mother, nor do I want to
be.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
<span style="left: 197; top: 942; position: relative"><img border="1" src="../images/rapunzel.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="108" height="267"></span>
I am not some Damsel in Distress. I do not want to be. If I have the same
weapon, stats, and armor as you I will do as well or as poorly as you. Just
because the game designers created female characters in such a way that they
don't appear to be able to walk 3 steps without falling over doesn't mean she
will. If I or any woman has 75% of our health and the MOB appears to be losing
its health more rapidly than I am, I probably don't want or need help. When
grouped I can tank and pull as well if not better than you. There is no need to
say, &quot;Don't worry, Dite, I'll protect you.&quot; In real life I am sitting
at my computer and my jaw has dropped to the floor and I watch as the Would Be
Hero's health drops faster than a lead balloon and mine seems to be rather full.
But alas, at full health I need protection, god knows how fast those 1400 plus
hp's may drop at any given moment.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
I am not locked in a tower, nor is a wicked witch keeping me hostage. I am
running free and while yes, sometimes I get jumped by something I can't handle I
tend to make it out alive more often than not and infrequently I even manage to
kill the despicable creature that jumped me. Yes, there are times that I do
appreciate the help. I also appreciate it when they ask if I need the help
before deciding that I can't handle it and will die. Keep in mind as well, that
female characters can and do pull, sometimes very well. If we aren't shouting
about a train to a zone, we just may be pulling with that Snow Cougar on our
butts. While yes, it may get some hits in there, I can guarantee you that if we
aren't yelling for help we are ok. We don't need to be saved.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
<span style="left: 197; top: 1496; position: relative"><img border="0" src="../images/child.gif" hspace="5" width="158" height="220" align="left"></span>
Finally, I am not your little sister. I have an older sister and I don't need or
want any more siblings. One is enough thank you very much. I can take care of
myself and yes, I can even dissuade potential suitors on my own without any help
from any one. I can also decide who I like and who I don't like. In short I am
very good at choosing my own friends and who cares if you don't like her, I do.
I also know when someone is trying to scam, hit on, take advantage, or kill me.
I know how to leave a pickup group if I think it will impede on my chances to
level.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
You don't have to make excuses for me, you don't have to be over protective of
me and you don't have to take care of me. I am a big girl. In fact, I am a
woman, and I play a woman character and while we may not be able to take down a
Griffon yet, there will be a time when we can and we aren't going to need your
help. I am capable of playing this game and I do a semi decent job of it. While
it may not be your way or the best way in your mind it is still a decent job. No
I am not a crazy puller, no I am not a powerleveler, and no I am not the best
dressed or equipped. There is no need for you to come and dress me and level me
up. I am doing just fine on my own. That isn't to say I don't ever want your
help, just not all of the time.</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 14; margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 10">
I do want to close with something. I want to add some things. I don't mind being
a mom, a damsel in distress or a little sister - I just mind when that is all I
am all of the time.</p>
