        <h2>Quests and the World</h2>
        <p>The game has a central plot line which you can choose to follow in a
        linear fashion, but you will certainly find things easier if you take
        the trouble to explore, and search the villages you pass through for
        side-quests. These vary considerably in their rewards, which could
        consist of gold, items and runes in addition to XP. Some quests are
        frustratingly bugged, so it is well worth patching to the latest
        version.&nbsp;<p> You could also theoretically ignore the central plot altogether
        and simply run about killing everything in your path, only taking on
        side quests. You might choose to do this if you are starting a fresh
        character and simply want to level them high enough to import them to a
        higher difficulty.<p>All the quests are stored in your journal, with details and
        a picture that usually gives a clue to the location of the quest's
        resolution. There are also pointers with appear on your compass and
        screen indicating the general direction you should be heading to
        complete a quest.<p>Your quest journal also includes sections for the
        scrolls and books you have picked up, and a game statistics page which
        can show you your overall progression as well as a few numbers relating
        to your most recent foes.
        <h2>Graphics and Sound</h2>
        <p>Well we aren't talking third generation MMORPG here, but it is
        nevertheless a very pretty game. I was very pleasantly surprised in
        fact, as I was expecting it to look something more along the lines of
        Diablo II or Divine Divinity. The screenshots I have included don't
        really do the game justice either. Sound effects and music are passable,
        certainly not grating, though they fall short of Divine Divinity's
        marvellous use of atmospheric music, to use an appropriate yardstick.
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        <p>So you know the basic mechanics.. is it actually fun? Well yes it is! It feels somewhat reminiscent of
        Diablo, in that you are attacked frequently by groups of monsters. However the individual monsters are slightly harder than the creatures of
        Diablo, and the groups you are attacked by are (generally) smaller. There are also much harder monsters such as dragons which take a good bit of strategy to take down. There are far more side quests than Diablo has, but they don't have the depth that say, Baldur's Gate does. The ability to build unusual skill sets for each class gives the game really great replay
        potential - though I do not recommend you try playing the battle-mage as a fighter the first time through at least!&nbsp;<p>On
        the down side, most monsters do appear to behave in a similar way, so
        you don't need that much variety in your combat strategies.. and that
        can lead to tedium or burn out. How much the open-endedness of character
        development compensates for the grind-like progress through the mobs may
        depend on the player. I have certainly enjoyed myself immensely, but I
        can see the possibility looming that monotony in combat will eventually
        bring the fun to an end.<p>On my secret Kiaora-Scale of RPG goodness, it
        rates higher than Diablo II, lower than Baldur's Gate II, but about even
        with the Divine Divinity.<p>&nbsp;<p><a href="http://sacred-game.com/">Official
