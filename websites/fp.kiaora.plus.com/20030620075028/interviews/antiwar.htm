      <td>Ok, this is really pissing me off. Apparently because I don't agree
        with the decision to go to war, I am anti soldier. I am really not sure
        how this leap of no logic was made, but I am really sick of it.<br>
        <br>
        I don't usually offer my opinion of the war. Specifically because it's
        not really a popular one and because people make this HUGE leap thinking
        I am now anti soldier. Not once in my life have I ever spit on a
        soldier. Not once in my life have I ever done anything negative to a
        soldier. Not ever. Nor am I about to start. Just because I don't agree
        with the POLICY our ELECTED officials make, doesn't mean that I am going
        to spit on our soldiers. Quite the opposite. I support our soldiers
        100%. They are doing their job. I hope every single one comes back
        healthy and strong. I hope everyone just surrenders so that not one
        person dies.<br>
        <br>
        And I am not alone in any of those feelings. Most of my friends don't
        like the decision to go to war, but many of us had friends whose parents
        were in Nam. I had a friend whose father had flash backs. Once while I
        was staying at her house overnight. We had to hide in the basement away
        from the &quot;gooks&quot; while he held his sons toy gun to protect us.
        (His wife allowed no guns in the house for any reason. ) It was scary.
        But I remember him and what he went though. I remember watching him
        clench and go defensive when a car backfired. Too many of us remember
        the after effects of nam on our friends parents, our uncles, or even our
        own parents not to completely support any and all soldiers when they
        come home.<br>
        <br>
        War is hell. The men and women who VOLUNTEER to serve in the armed
        forces deserve medals just for volunteering. It takes a brave dedicated
        person to do that. For that I alone I support our troops. I support
        their dedication and their commitment. It takes a certain type of person
        to serve in that manner. I know I don't have what it takes, and I admire
        anyone who does.<br>
        <br>
        And for anyone to look me in the eye and tell me that I 1) don't support
        our soldiers 2) Don't love America 3) Am a commie better kiss my very
        large pale ass. Cause I love my country. In many countries speaking my
        mind like this would get me killed. Or jailed. Neither is appealing. And
        I respect the men and women who risk their lives every day fighting for
        my right to speak my mind. God bless them and keep them safe. And when
        they come home, I will have a yellow ribbon on every tree and bush in
        our yard. I will do what I can to support them in everyway. There is no
        better way I can honor my father, grandfather, friends parents and uncle
        then to stand up and support our troops. They didn't make the decision
        to go to war. I hold the decision makers responsible. I don't shoot the
        messenger. And if one more person tells me that I am unpatriotic, that I
        don't support our troops I swear I am going to pop them one right in the
        mouth. And I will say &quot;see now you sport the red white and blue.
        The red blood, your white teeth falling out and the nice bruising from
        my fist in your face. You have been hit by a true American.
        Congrats.&quot; (Ok I won't, but it really pisses me off)<br>
        <br>
        Sorry, but this has been festering for about two weeks now, and I really
        am to the point of physical violence. Hence I rant here and I can get it
        straight and no one gets hurt. Like me. This topic is very passionate, I
        just wish people would not jump to conclusions like this. And for the
        record, I would like a sign above my head that follows me around all the
        time with big 12 foot neon letters that says &quot;If you aren't
        prepared to deal with my opinion like a calm rational person, DON'T ASK!
        DUH!&quot; It could replace the &quot;Mess with me. I like it!&quot;
        sign. I hate that sign anyway.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for allowing me to rant. I tell you my therapy bill would be
        through the roof if I couldn't.</td>
