<h1>Deus Ex</h1>
<div align="justify">
<table WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="553" valign="top" align="justify">
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">First person shooter? Adventure? Strategy? RPG?
      Somehow Deus Ex manages to combine some aspects of all these genres into a
      very playable and addictive hybrid (with no xp penalties!). I played
      through the entire thing in a week and a bit, so if I have a complaint it
      must be simply that it wasn't long enough!! Like Everquest, I loved it for
      it's immersiveness. I was engaged enough to really care about the
      storyline, the characters, and to be genuinely terrified when creeping
      around corners straight into enemy bots...<br>
      </font>
      <h2><font size="3">The Story</font></h2>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">You are code-named JC Denton, agent for UNATCO, an anti-terrorist
      organisation, set in a not so distant corporate future in a world
      afflicted by a man made virus. The introductory movie is really quite mystifying
      until you have completed the game, at which point you realise
      you recognise every character in it, and the locations. There is a strong
      plot, with engaging characters, and it has to be that element that pulled
      me so strongly through the whole game - I had to know what might happen
      next! Actually this brings me to one of the interestingly non-linear
      aspects of the game - during cut-scenes you often have a choice of things
      to say. Some of these end up having serious consequences later on. Tip: tell
      Jaime to stay at UNATCO!(I didn't!).</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">I don't want to give away much about the plot obviously, but you start
      out fresh from the academy, a kind of cyborg with abilities enhanced using
      nano-technology. Working for UNATCO you undertake several missions to foil
      the plans of the NSF terrorist organisation, which is trying to steal
      barrel of Ambrosia, the only known cure for the plague ravaging the world.
      Your brother Paul Denton, already an agent, is apparently working on
      different missions with the same objective. As the story unfolds you will
      find yourself in locations as diverse as New York, Hong Kong, Paris, and a
      whole slew of military and medical research bases, including a rather
      challenging under-sea base. Corrupt corporations, terrorist organisations,
      governments, the triads, the Illuminati and even UNATCO itself may fall
      under suspicion as the story unfolds...</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3">Gameplay</font></h2>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">The game is divided into missions with primary and secondary goals. You
      are given goals by other characters, sometimes mid way through a mission,
      so it is very important to speak to everyone! Completing goals, and
      exploring thoroughly, results in the allocation of skill point bonuses,
      which is where we see the role playing aspects starting to show their
      face! The skills can be distributed as you see fit, each of which starts
      out untrained and can be raised to mastery. I would definitely advise
      getting that computer skill up, as it saves much hassle and enables you to
      do fun things like control enemy gun turrets (oh dear I am blood thirsty!
      8P). In addition to skill points, you can develop you characters
      augmentations. Each augmentation slot has two possible alternatives, and
      they can be upgraded for increased effect. In your &quot;leg&quot; slot
      for example, you have the choice of a speed enhancement or run silent.
      Using those augmentations takes &quot;bio-energy&quot; however, and you
      will need to recharge...</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Each mission <i>always</i> has more than one way of being completed,
      though the choices are more limited for some missions than others. The
      ability to sneak around means that you do not have to behave like a
      bloodthirsty lunatic throughout the entire game, and you are also able to
      incapacitate many of the enemy without actually killing them.(Note:
      someone really should tell all those evil megalomaniacs to secure their
      ventilation systems a bit better...)</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3">Complaints?</font></h2>
      <p><font size="2">Yes, two of them!</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2">You can't play a woman. Well what's new /sigh.</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">It was not long enough! I was completely absorbed by the storyline
          and game, and was sooo disappointed when I completed it. The
          compulsion to play simply vanished.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Other drawbacks include the fact that the game runs best
      on glide cards, so it can sometimes get a bit choppy on other types. I've
      tried both though and actually played most using a geforce card which was
      quite bearable. It also seems to feel very, well, grey! I think this is
      called atmosphere. Atmosphere it certainly has in wads, but I do wish
      someone would come up with a dark dismal future that was not quite so dark
      and dismal.</font></p>
      <h2><font size="3">Verdict</font></h2>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">I liked it. I liked it ALOT. Great fun, absorbing,
      addictive, excellent gameplay. Just wish you could choose to be a woman,
      bah!</font></p>
