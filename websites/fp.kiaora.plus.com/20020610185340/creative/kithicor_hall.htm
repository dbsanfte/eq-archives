<h1><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Kithicor Hall<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><span style="left: 208; top: 73; position: relative"><img border="0" src="forest.gif" width="252" height="166" align="right" hspace="9"></span><font size="2">The sun was well up in the sky by the time
they dared
enter the forest. Stories of the region by night had even filtered back home,
now so unbearably distant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They had
camped in the western commonlands overnight, keeping a fire going strong to ward
off roaming beasts, but neither felt refreshed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2">They were dressed for the road, strong boots with thick
soles, caked in mud, and long warm woollen capes, only slightly frayed about the
edges. Their clothes had born up well to the punishment the journey had
subjected them to. Though dirty, these two were certainly no peasants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both moved with an easy sinuous lope, the larger of the two leading the
way into the mists of Kithicor forest.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2">The smaller traveller, though weary, felt excitement rise
as they neared their goal at last. She would be able to be herself in this
place, her father had told her so. No one would spit on her, afraid of her gift,
ridiculing her for her differences. Her green eyes gleamed and her handsome face
glowed; even the lack of light beneath the dense distant forest canopy failed to
chill her, as it should. She began to hum under her breath, an alien but joyful
air, until her companion stopped her with a respectful but quelling backwards
glance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2">-Just because the undead are not around does not mean these
woods are completely safe My Lady, please try not to make more noise than
necessary.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2">- I’m thorry.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2">She whispered the reply, flushing deeply. Strictly speaking
her companion was a servant, but this ancient family retainer had known and
cared for her since her hatching. She adjusted her pack and reached a hand to
her lute, the familiar feel of its smooth surface reassuring her, and she ran
on, eagerness once again rising as she willed the last miles past.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 10" align="justify"><font size="2"><span style="left: 208; top: 770; position: relative"><img border="0" src="castle.gif" align="right" width="143" height="161" hspace="8"></span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;</span>The trees
thinned suddenly after an hour or more’s run, and both of the travellers
stopped suddenly as they finally saw their destination before them. A huge
edifice of grey stone smothered in ivy stood in a wide forest clearing. Turrets
and crenulations aplenty topped the thickly buttressed walls. It was evidently
an ancient building, that had been added to over the centuries by a variety of
owners of eclectic and sometimes questionable taste, the fashions of eons echoed
in the multitude of gargoyles, icons and carvings; the windows speckled the façade
like a demented rash, here arched, here perfectly rectangular, interspersed with
arrow slits and a crazy paving of down pipes and guttering.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 15; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 7" align="justify"><font size="2">The
two iksar simply stared. They had both looked, and laughed a little, at the
woodcuts they had been sent of this foreign building, but it seemed with
hindsight that a little artistic license had been used on the part of the
craftsman. For the first time Thespa felt a qualm concerning her new life, the
setting for which now loomed before them. She shrank a little towards her
companion, who gathered himself at last and took her hand in his. Gripping it
reassuringly, he spoke in his usual measured tones,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 15; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 7" align="justify"><font size="2">-It
will be all right small one; your father took great care to find out all he
could about this place. The Lady will have been expecting us for a week or so by
now, so let us go and greet her shall we?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 15; margin-right: 15; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 7" align="justify"><font size="2">Thespa
nodded, her iridescent facial markings glowing beneath her hood. She stepped a
little more confidently towards the alarming building, tail lifted slightly
behind her, a sign of alarm or wariness in her kind.</font></p>
