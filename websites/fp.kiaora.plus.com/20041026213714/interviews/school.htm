      <td>Some background on my rant.<br>
        <br>
        I am enrolled in school full time and I am majoring in Programming. One
        of my core classes is C++. Ok, now to the rant<br>
        <br>
        GGGGGGAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!! Apparently expecting DeVry to use some common
        sense is asking way to much. First, the state of Illinois requires all
        schools (including colleges) to have updated shot records. This means
        that I have to provide my shot records. Cool, I get them from my
        highschool. This would be the highschool I graduated from 10 years ago.
        I have that sent in. They say that's not enough. They need a tetanus
        shot and a measles shot. I point out that 1) I have sent in the tetanus
        shot record from OSU. Apparently they lost it. Have to get another one
        cause I sent my only copy. (I am a fool) 2) I had the measles when I was
        3 and I have a natural antibody. No good. They need the shot. I go to my
        doctor and she says &quot;Your blood work from your pregnancy shows that
        you have an immunity to the measles. You don't need the shot.&quot; She
        faxes over a form that the STATE PROVIDES saying that I don't need the
        shot because my blood work shows I already have the immunity. The school
        refuses to accept it. So I have to get a measles shot. Why? Cause the
        state requires it. However, the state accepts the form from my doctor. I
        called and asked. I had a letter sent to them showing that the form was
        ok. What does my school do? Oh...go ahead and guess.<br>
        <br>
        That's right, makes me get the shot. Bad words being shouted right now.
        Editing them out for the benefit of the young or easily offended.<br>
        <br>
        So I get the shot thing fixed. After 2 months of hassle.<br>
        <br>
        On top of this my core class of c++ is kicking my butt. Why you ask? Oh
        that would be because the book they make us use is an advanced c++ book.
        And, we are in intro. So that make sense, in the same way that child
        proof bottle caps on aspirin keep kids out of the bottle. It doesn't.
        So, I am hoping that my teacher is able to teach so I can understand it.
        That would be a waste of time since my teacher took a c++ course 2 years
        ago and hasn't used it since. So he is teaching from another teachers
        syllabus. So he has NO CLUE! My book is useless. So I borrow my sister
        in law's book to learn from which is great. Mean time the prof is trying
        to teach and he doesn't know what he is doing, I am confused the book is
        useless and I am getting a C for a grade.<br>
        <br>
        Apparently expecting my school to put someone who is knowledgeable in
        the course as a teacher is asking too much. Especially considering my
        tuition is roughly $10,000 a year. I foolishly expect that my teachers
        will be knowledgeable and my books will be written for the level of the
        class. How silly. Why should I expect that? I am about to track down one
        of the deans and bludgeon them with my C++ book. Then I track down the
        moron who recommended this book and rip off his/her arm and beat them
        with the bloody end. Then I go find the moron who thought it would be
        cool to put my prof in a c++ class. And I will bring my prof with me and
        we will take turns holding down that moron and kicking him/her around
        the butt area since that is where their brain is stored.<br>
        <br>
        What kills me is my c++ teacher is qualified to teach my systems class.
        My Systems teacher is qualified to teach my C++ class and they would
        both rather teach the class they aren't teaching. And my systems teacher
        would rock at teaching C++. So it's not like there weren't other
        options.<br>
        <br>
        On top of this my dean is so sick of me she won't return my calls. The
        guy who signed me up messed up ALL my paper work. Now I have to give him
        credit. That takes a lot of work to categorically mess up every single
        bit of paperwork I had to do. That is a level of incompetence that quite
        frankly is impressive. I mean, when he screws up he goes full out.
        Anyone could do a half assed job, but he is so dedicated he did a full
        assed job. Much props to him. My dean has been helping me handle all the
        ignoramus who was my councillor during the sign up process so
        dedicatedly screwed up. She has helped me with the shots, the financial
        aid issues, the academics screw ups, and everything else. She has been
        great, but she has put me on the take a message list. Every time I call
        her aid transfers me directly to voicemail. Very annoying.<br>
        <br>
        If you see on the news that a student in the Illinois area went postal
        with a c++ book in DeVry, you will know it's me. I need to get this
        degree done so I don't have to deal with this stuff anymore. I wanna
        trade in my current frustrations for ones that at least pay me.<br>
