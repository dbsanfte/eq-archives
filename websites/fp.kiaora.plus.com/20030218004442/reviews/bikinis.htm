<h2 style="margin-right: 21">Swords and Bikinis<br>
The Portrayal of Women in Everquest</h2>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 21"><font size="2">Once upon a time, if I wanted to play a computer game, I had several choices
: brown haired muscle man, blond muscle man and black muscle man. Hmm.
Decisions. Though derided by some for her ludicrous bosom, Lara Croft of the
Tomb Raider series actually seemed a refreshing change, at last I could play a
girl! Today I can log into Everquest and every single class and race can be male
or female, there's no denying that's a considerable improvement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 21"><font size="2"><span style="left: 12; top: 187; position: relative"><img border="1" src="../images/vicsin.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" alt="Vicsin watches 3 hillgiants bearing down on her, and hopes the suspenders came with steel ribbing." width="123" height="253"></span>Some women have complained about the appearance of the characters that you <i>can</i>
play in Everquest however. Many of the races do seem to be wearing so little that corpse
retrieval can sometimes be a somewhat embarrassing business. Words such as
&quot;degrading&quot; have been bandied about, but does a scantily clad dark elf
really degrade in the same way that pornography often does? I would argue that
no, it does not.
The dark elf is not helpless, and is not there just to be looked at, she is
playing the same game as the male players and contributing just as much. Also
the evil nature of dark elves makes it seem appropriate that they should flaunt
themselves. On the other hand, dark elf males get to wear a cross between a
smoking jacket and bathrobe when without their armour - perhaps it would be more
in keeping for them to go about clad only in red velvet thong? It's not just
newbie and dead characters that look semi-clothed of course, some actually look
as if they are wearing less with armour on (for example the female dark elf
leather leggings, um a tad airy around the rear, or the look of the leather on
an erudite female).</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 21"><font size="2"><span style="left: 307; top: 415; position: relative"><img border="1" src="../kia.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2" alt="paladin or monk? watch in amusement as the real monk forgets to pull." width="113" height="234"></span>It must be remembered that fantasy role playing games are just that -
fantasy. You can choose to be ugly (well you can if playing an ogre or troll!)
if you wish to. I tried it once, personally I would rather look sexy, and I am
sure that goes for many other players too. Sexy does not mean sex-object of
course, that is a problem that comes with the context in which it is portrayed
and also the attitudes of people to it. However I am not here to be an apologist
for Verant - there are plenty of reasons to make sure the female characters look
good and have a penchant for bikinis and leather, namely the still predominantly
male customer base! Many of the character models were designed by a woman, not
that it tells us much! (Rosie if you are reading, the message board readers
would love to hear from you I'm sure).</font> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 21"><font size="2">So what <i>do</i> women want from role playing games? I cannot speak for all
women, but I can for myself, that the answer lies in simple choice. I certainly
want the ability to play a woman, and I want to be able to decide what she looks
like as much as possible. I want my characters to be beautiful, but not
necessarily brazen. I certainly don't want to be <i>forced</i> to display even
virtual buttocks to the world to the howls of laughter from my fellow players
(did I mention those dark elf pants????). Oh yes and we want to know what
barbarian men wear under their kilts ;-)</font></p>
