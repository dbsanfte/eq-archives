      <td>I am so very very annoyed.<br>
        <br>
        Why you ask? (Silly people. Never ask why. Cause you know I will tell
        you.) Well, I have an e-mail address just like everyone else. Actually I
        have at least 4, but only 2 I check regularly. One I use for junk mail,
        and one I give to people I actually want to talk to. However, in the
        last three months, my 'real' e-mail address has been getting some junk.
        And understand when I say junk, I mean I was gone this weekend and had
        558 e-mail messages when I got back. Only 3 of them were legitimate
        e-mails.<br>
        <br>
        For the record, I do not need the pasta pot, nor do I need the 32
        e-mails you sent me in 3 days to buy it. I do not need a penis enlarger
        seeing as I have no penis. It's part of the whole female thing. I
        certainly don't need the hundreds of e-mails you have sent me this year
        alone. Furthermore, I do not want nor need a mortgage at this time. I
        have no job and no matter how much you tell me you can get me approved I
        seriously doubt a woman with no income, no savings and a child can be
        approved for a mortgage. Now leave me alone. For the record, I don't
        want any new credit cards no matter how many I have been
        &quot;Pre-approved&quot; for. And as for you Discover, I had one of your
        cards before and rest assured that I won't be making that mistake again.
        Devry/Keller graduate school. I ALREADY GO THERE! YOU DON&quot;T HAVE TO
        RECRUIT ME YOU MORONS! DUH! YOU ALREADY HAVE MY MONEY! Stop sending me
        e-mails every other day dammit! For those of you cyber ho's out there, I
        don't care about your web cam. I don't care if you screw animals and I
        don't care if you anus hurts. LEAVE ME ALONE! Furthermore, you didn't
        talk to me last week cause I know who I talk to on line. Literally I
        know them. I can drive to their house, I know everything about them and
        YOU AREN&quot;T ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE!<br>
        <br>
        I do not want affordable health care, car insurance, viagra,
        prescription drugs or anything else. I like paying too much. I also
        don't want the card deck with the 52 most iraq wanted on it and I
        certainly don't want 3 e-mails a day trying to sell it to me. I don't
        want to stimulate my love life either. If it gets stimulated anymore I
        will literally die. My body can't take any more, hence please pedal your
        junk elsewhere. I am not single, and even if I were I wouldn't use your
        skanky dating service. I do not want a mail order bride from Russia, I
        don't care how hot they are.<br>
        <br>
        I want nothing free! No free cruises, no free airline tickets, no free
        hotel stays, no free vacations to wherever, no free samples, no free
        digital cameras, scanners, or anything else. I do not want to save money
        on ink cartridges. I really like paying best buy for them. It's fun. And
        as I have stated before I like over paying. I don't want to lose weight.
        I like being fat. It makes me happy, so please pedal your pills, tummy
        tuckers, robobutt reducer/breast enhancers elsewhere.<br>
        <br>
        I do not want a bright smile. I like my yellow tan teeth. They are
        distinctive. Go away! I also need no help being confident. I am
        confident I don't want your crappy e-mails. I do not want a free cell
        phone, I don't want a sweet deal on a cell phone. I have a cell phone
        now that I don't want. Here is a clue, trust me it's free. I Hate being
        in touch. I don't want people to call me while I am driving so they can
        bore me. I like being unavailable. This way when people get a hold of me
        they are grateful. And I don't have to deal with them. Hence, I don't
        need a cell phone.<br>
        <br>
        I do not need hair remover. Furthermore, I am not going bald so I do not
        need hair club for men or any other hair growth product. I do not dye my
        hair, so hair dye products are a waste too. I am thinking of shaving my
        hair all off so you people will quit bothering me. Hard to sell all that
        crap to a bald chick huh?<br>
        <br>
        Also, I have no debt. Literally. I have none. Well, I have some school
        loans, but I don't have to pay them yet cause I am in school. See how
        that works? And for the record, if I feel 20 years younger I would be
        10. I hated puberty the first time around, why the hell would I go
        through that again? Didn't think of that did you bastard spammer?<br>
        <br>
        The only thing all of you have in common is you are pissing me off. To
        the point that I have started a list of companies I literally will not
        deal with. Ever. So, you have made a name for yourself and you have
        successfully gotten your name out there. Not that it does you any good
        you blood sucking leaches. One day I am going to come up with a program
        that finds these bastards. It will get their personal e-mail address and
        I will just bounce all the spam they send me back to them. It will
        include a little message that says &quot;I hate you and if you send me
        any more spam I will post your personal e-mail on every spam spewing
        place I can find. Furthermore, I will publish my little program and
        everyone will be bouncing their spam back to you. FEEL MY PAIN
        ASSHOLE!&quot; Not that I am bitter.<br>
        <br>
        I really really hate this. I hate having to wade through my e-mail. I
        really hate those bastards who use names like my friends and even do
        something on the subject line like Re: Hi. Cause I am thinking it might
        actually be a legit e-mail. BUT NO! It's an add for viagra. Cause I need
        that. It would do me a lot of good.<br>
        <br>
        These bastards can't call me at home so now they mess with my e-mail. No
        wonder so many of my friends change their e-mail address every 2 months.
        I will thwart these evil bastards if it's the last thing I do. I will
        plot their down fall and when it happens I will rub my hands together
        and laugh manaically. MUhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!<br>
        <br>
        I am beginning to believe these spammers do this to me for their own
        amusement. I swear they are laughing together in their little spammers
        secret lair saying &quot;Dude! I got Susan with the penis enlarger one
        5x in the last 3 days. She has to be pissed.&quot; And another little
        evil jerk says &quot;I can top that! I hit her with the viagra one 10x
        and the home mortgage one 18x in 2 days&quot; And they sit around
        drinking diet drinks popping viagra listening to their homer simpson
        beer bottle opener while playing with their Iraq52 most wanted playing
        cards swapping stories of how they have pissed me off today. I know they
        are. And when I find that little spammers secret lair I will show up
        with my &quot;Azzna's patented Get A Clue bat&quot; and have some
        serious Come To Jesus meetings.<br>
        <br>
