        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sacred (from Ascaron Entertainment) is a fantasy role playing game in
        the style of Diablo II, which can be played online or over a LAN, or as
        a single player game.</p>
        <h2>Classes and Character Development</h2>
        <p>Sacred has a novel take on the traditional roleplaying classes. While
        at first glance some of the classes seem familiar, the implementation
        adds a fresh dimension to the usual, and adds a good sprinkling of the
        brand-new to complete the mixture.</p>
        <p>In brief, the classes are Gladiator, Seraphim, Vampiress, Wood-elf,
        Dark-Elf and Battle-Mage. Gladiator, Wood-Elf and Battle-Mage are
        perhaps the closest to traditional RPG archetypes (warrior, ranger and
        magician). Dark-Elf can perhaps be best described as a combination of
        the roles of monk and thief, while the Seraphim and Vampiress could be
        thought of as somewhat similar to a paladin and shadowknight, but they
        feel quite different to play.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I tried every class myself, but the vampiress was very much my style
        of play - a do-gooding knight by day, a bloodsucking whirling ball of
        claws by night... though with the right skills and combat arts I found I
        could be a blood-sucking ball of claws <i>all the time</i>. What fun.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><p>Every class has different basic stats, which
        increase as a percentage of that base per level. You do get a point or
        so to spend, but it's not enough to make a wood-elf into a gladiator,
        for example. You also receive an increasing number of skill-points per
        level, and this is where the character building really comes into its'
        own. In the case of the wood-elf, you have the option of creating a bow
        reliant ranger-type, a knife or sword wielding dervish,&nbsp; a
        druid-like spell caster.. or a hybrid of all three. With a limited
        number of skill points, it is obviously possible to seriously gimp your
        character. Suggested &quot;builds&quot; with recommended skill point
        distribution would have been a welcome addition to the level-up process
        for those learning to play. Ascaron's message boards are strewn with the
        stories of&nbsp; those forced to re-roll because their choices had
        rendered the later game or difficulty settings un-playable.</p></td>

        <h2>Combat and Spells</h2>
        <p>Combat is basically point and click based. You left click and hold to
        attack at full speed, and right click to use your currently selected
        special attack (which can be a special combat move, or a spell-like
        ability). Combat is all real-time - there is no means of pausing the
        game and stacking up actions as you could in say Neverwinter Nights or
        Baldur's Gate (or even Diablo to some extent). If you are playing a
        class with low hit-points, it therefore pays to either always be
        prepared (buffing before moving on, for example), or save frequently!</p>
        <p>The number of special attacks you have available increases every now
        and then as you level. By level 8 or so you will have 3 special attack
        slots, into which you place the &quot;combat arts&quot; or spells you
        wish to use. With no means to pause, your choices need to be good ones!
        It is possible to stack up to four arts or spells into one slot by use
        of Combos, which you pay for at a special merchant called a Combo
        Master. These can be different attacks, or four instances of the same
        attack, but&nbsp; take a fair amount of time to charge up compared with
        the use of a single art.</p>
        <p>The combat arts are acquired through the memorisation of runes, which
        drop from monsters or are given as quest rewards. You will find you are
        collecting far more runes belonging to other classes, but luckily you
        may trade them at a Combo Master for runes of your choice. (see
        screenshots). The power of a combat art increases if you memorise another of the same type, but the recharge time will also increase. For some attacks, such as a multi-hit
        combat art, it is actually better to stay with a fairly low recharge time rather than build the power of the attack to the highest you can, so you can use it more frequently when
        besieged by hordes of creatures at once.</p>
