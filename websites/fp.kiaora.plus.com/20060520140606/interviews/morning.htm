      <td height="17">Ok, one more perky cute person comes up to me bubbling with happiness and
        enthusiasm DIES A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE DEATH! Do I look like a happy bubbly person? HELL NO! I eat perky cute people for breakfast. I am the mean evil dragon. I will fry you with my evil fire breath for even thinking of possibly looking at me.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, at 7am I hate everyone. Literally everyone. The fact that I had to leave my happy
        cosy warm bed at 5:15 so I could leave the house at 5:45 so I could have my big butt here at 7am makes me unhappy. Hell, it makes me pissed. People could die for looking at me wrong. And now your perky little 21 year old butt comes up to me bouncing and happy calling me a gloomy gus. You want to die don't you? You have suicidal
        tendencies right? Only logical reason I can come up with for talking to me. I don't have any idea who you are. I am reading a history textbook, so you know right off the bat I am busy. Furthermore, since this college has no history major, it's a safe bet I am not overjoyed at the concept of reading a history text at 7am, let alone getting up early to go the class. It's simple logic. Think these things through.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore since I ignored your perky happy little freaky self the first 4x you talked to me, one could reasonably expect that I don't want to talk to you. It's a simple concept.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Could someone please explain to me why these perky happy people feel it's their life mission to make me happy. And why when the ask me how they can make me happy they don't do what I ask? I think GO AWAY is clear. But nooooo! They have to push. Then I point out there is a bus stop a block away. They could step out in front of the bus while it's moving. That would make me happy. They could go talk to ANYONE else and that would make me happy. They could go
        and play with traffic. That would work too. Or even go play with a hungry bear. I would giggle over that one. I might even point. I would even get up early, drive my butt the hour downtown to watch you do it. I would video tape it and watch it over and over and over again, because lets face it. That would never get old.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I believe that cute happy perky morning people behave that way just to amuse themselves at the expense of people who hate mornings like me. It's ok though. I wait till I am awake then mess with them. Mess up their computer. Let the air out their tires.
        Accidentally F disk their hard drives. Change their chocolate for Ex lax.........
