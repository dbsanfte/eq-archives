<h2 style="margin-right: 15" align="justify">Look to Windward<br>
Iain M. Banks</h2>

<p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2"><span style="left: 198; top: 101; position: relative"><img border="0" src="../images/winward_small.gif" alt="click to see larger version" width="102" height="155" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="3"></span>Look to Windward is the latest of Iain Bank's science fiction novels, and 
it lives up to everything I have come to expect from this highly talented author.
Previous Culture novels have included The Player of Games (a personal favourite)
and Excession, he is also critically acclaimed for his non science fiction work
such as The Wasp Factory and The Crow Road.</font>

<p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">Set in
 a distant galactic future where the dominant civilisation is the Culture, humans 
 have overcome even death and live out near Utopic lives, basic life needs having been met
millennia before. The culture is benevolently "ruled" by near godlike artificial
Intelligences, which reside in spaceships or control whole worlds.</font>

<p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">In <i>Look to
Windward</i> a widowed survivor of a civil war is sent to the Culture world of
Masaq, apparently to persuade a composer to return to his home world from his
self-imposed exile and help heal his people. But the mission, as the composer
Ziller suspects, is not all it seems to be.</font> <font size="2">Iain Banks
seems to delight in surprising the reader, building assumptions and expectations
only to shatter them with a sudden revelation. Often a character easily assumed
to be human suddenly turns out to be something truly alien, in shape at least.
The plot itself twists and turns, part thriller, part mystery, and leaves you in
suspense right to the final pages. If you have read Iain Banks before you will
know that it is <i>not&nbsp;</i> a foregone conclusion that the main
protagonists shall win, or even live!</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">As
usual the exploration of character motivation is detailed and complex, and the
discussions of comparative culture held by some of the characters are
thoughtful, provocative and sometimes humorous. Even the Minds themselves have a
somewhat bizarre sense of humour, shown in their chosen names; examples such as <i>All
the same I saw it first, Resistance is Character-Forming, Inappropriate Response
</i> 
and <i> Lasting Damage,&nbsp;</i> spring to mind. The non-culture (and non
human) civilisations he depicts often seem to have more in common with the
present than the culture itself does, a fact he also uses to force the reader to
question their assumptions.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">As
you may have guessed, though a thriller, a mystery and space opera, <i>Look to
Windward</i> is not the lightest of reads, so if a throw-away piece of
entertainment is what you are looking for, this most certainly is not it. If on
the other hand you prefer a more thoughtful and challenging read, it most
certainly is.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">No
review is complete without a small taster, so here you are:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">The General System
  Vehicle <i>Sanctioned Parts List</i> appeared on the screen in the
  Superlifter's lounge as another point of light in the starfield. It became a
  silver dot and grew quickly to fill the screen, though there was no sign of
  detail on the shining surface.<br>
  ~<i>That'll be it.<br>
  </i>~I suppose so.<br>
  ~<i>We've probably passed near several escort craft, though they wouldn't be
  making their presence so obvious. What the Navy called a High Value Unit; you
  never send them out alone.<br>
  </i>~ I thought it might look a little more grand.<br>
  ~<i>They always look pretty unimposing from the outside.</i></font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">The
  Superlifter plunged into the centre of the silver surface. Within it was like
  looking from an aircraft inside a cloud, then there was the impression of
  plunging through another surface, then another, then dozens more in quick
  succession, flicking past like thumbed paper pages in an antique book.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">They
  burst from the last membrane into a great hazy space lit by a yellow-white
  line burning high above, beyond layers of wispy cloud. They were above and aft
  of the craft's stern. The ship was twenty-five kilometres long and ten wide.
  The top surface was parkland; wooded hills and ridges separated by and studded
  with rivers and lakes.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">Bracketed
  by colossal ribbed and buttressed outriggers chevroned in red and blue, the
  GSV's sheer sides were a golden, tawny colour, scattered with a motley
  confusion of foliage-covered platforms and balconies and punctured by a
  bewildering variety of brightly lit openings, like a glowing vertical city set
  into sandstone cliffs three kilometres high. The air swarmed with craft of
  every type Quilan had ever seen or heard of, and more besides. Some were tiny,
  some were the size of a Superlifter. Still smaller dots were individual
  people, floating in the air.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">Two
  other giant vessels, each barely an eighth of the size of the <i>Sanctioned
  Parts List</i>, shared the envelope of the GSV's surrounding field enclosure.
  Riding a few kilometres off each side, plainer and more dense-looking, they
  were surrounded with their own little concentrations of smaller flying craft.</font><p style="margin-right: 15" align="justify"><font size="2">~It
  is a little more impressive on the inside, isn't it?<br>
  Hadesh Hurler remained silent.</font>

entirely escapes me, amazon.com don't appear to have this yet (possibly its not
been published in the US yet) so if you want it,<i> Look to Windward</i> can be
found at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857239695/eqwomen">Amazon.co.uk</a>
(direct link to book).<br>
