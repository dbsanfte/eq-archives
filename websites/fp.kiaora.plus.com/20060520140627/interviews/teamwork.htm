      <td>Ok, the background. My systems analysis class has a project that we
        have to do. We have to create a system for a company basically. We
        decided to do a website ordering system for a steel company. It's for
        the sales people to use. One of the girls in my group works for this
        steel company. Now, the steel company doesn't actually know about the
        project or want it, it's just a class project. I have 3 group members.
        One is great. She does what she is suppose to. The other is well, slow,
        but I just do the work and she is ok with it. The last one is a HUGE
        crack monkey moron. He thinks he knows things, but he doesn't. Let me
        give you some examples.<br>
        <br>
        1) He has no clue what web hosting is. At all. Did I mention he is a
        tech major? When I tried to explain it to him, he didn't get it. However
        5 people who were listening to me (including the teacher) said it was a
        great explanation. I spent over 45 minutes trying to help him understand
        this concept. All he kept saying is why do we need it hosted. It can
        just live on the web. I want a medal for not killing him. Really.<br>
        <br>
        2) He is a Database Administration Major. However, he doesn't know how
        to design a database. And he is in his Senior year. I on the other hand,
        have no database experience, and from the example the teacher gave us
        was able to design a database myself.<br>
        <br>
        The issue at hand. I gave him the completed database I designed on paper
        and told him to type it up. He being the crack monkey moron guy who is
        finds shoelaces confusing decided that he would 1) lose my database
        design. 2) do it himself. Of course he doesn't tell the group that. So
        the Friday night/early Saturday morning before class this moron starts
        to write a database. He uses the in class example. Exclusively. Now, the
        in class example is for an online MP3 download sight by a major record
        label. Now, most people would look at that example and realize that a
        steel company probably doesn't need 1) a record label table 2) An artist
        table 3) Royalties table 4) A credit card table. When companies order
        steel, they tend to pay in purchase orders. Something about a huge truck
        with big steel beams doesn't scream &quot;CREDIT CARD PAYMENT&quot; to
        me. I am strange like that. Then to top this all off, this little freak
        of nature forgets to add THE ORDER TABLE! You know, the entire reason we
        are making the damn database in the first place. He tells me that it's
        not necessary. Um? Ok so how do the orders get placed? He says
        &quot;They just do.&quot; You know, the magical database elves live in
        the database and work their magic order taking magic. Then the orders
        just magically work their way through the system without requiring an
        order table. And of course when we want to run queries on the order
        information, the elves know which ones we want and they weave us a
        magical report. Because everyone loves the magical database elves that
        allow us not to do the tables we need. And those magical eleven produced
        reports are just so pretty.<br>
        <br>
        Oh wait it gets worse. Moron boy does this last week at 3am Saturday
        morning. Conveniently enough I am asleep. He was suppose to do it on Wednesday
        but had me convinced he had it done. Cause apparently I am also
        a moron. Anyway, he attempts to make the database. Which I shall refer
        to as &quot;The crack monkey's screwed up database from hell&quot; He
        comes in Saturday morning and turns it in without even talking to his
        group about it. So now, the screwed up database is turned in, which
        means I probably will have to kill him. Cause I can't imagine this will
        get credit. Now he has decided to redo the database design. Why? Cause he
        is a stupid moronic idiotic inbreeding freak of nature who can't
        understand simple concepts and doesn't understand his major and if he
        ever gets a job he is going to be fired within a week crack monkey. Not
        that I am bitter. I have redone this freaks work every damn week. And
        when I say &quot;Just let me do it&quot; he refuses. So I end up redoing
        his work Saturday morning. I really really really hate this crack
        monkey. he is causing my stress level to rise significantly. I will have
        to kill him for the good of the world. We can't allow someone this
        clueless to 1) breed. 2) Interact with other humans. 3) attempt to hold
        a job.<br>
        <br>
        What I want to know is Why do I always get them? And is it murder to put
        someone down for the good of all mankind? Is it wrong to grab his arm
        and beat him with it? unfortunately I can't fire him from the group, and
        the group project is almost done, so I think I can lower my stress soon.
        I will also avoid him for a group project like the plague. Seriously</td>
