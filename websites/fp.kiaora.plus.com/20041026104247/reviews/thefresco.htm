        <p>15 years ago an unusually thoughtful parent bought his daughter a
        book by an author she had never heard of before. The Chronicles of
        Marvin Manyshaped was my introduction to the work of Sheri S Tepper, who
        I thereafter&nbsp; named for quite some time as my favourite author. She
        may even have been instrumental in my character formation given that I
        was 16 at the time and very willing to absorb quite a few of her
        feminist and radical ideas. I have known her work to be read and enjoyed
        by people usually utterly averse to science fiction or fantasy of any
        kind.<p>Tepper can create, with enviable depth and clarity, incredibly
        complex, utterly alien worlds. Her characters are deeply engaging and
        her narrative smooth and readable. Perhaps that's enough praise singing
        for now though, as I must now insert a note of caution. The Fresco was a
        very enjoyable read, but this time I felt she had gone too far, that her
        bad guys were inhumanly evil caricatures and this seriously detracted
        from the points she was trying to make. Senator Morse in particular, is
        a woman hating, pro-gun, pro-life cartoon of a man, who is prepared to
        barter human lives to aliens for personal gain. Pretty much all his
        views are seen as stemming from a pathological hatred of women and
        pregnancy, and he is held up as a character of hate, with no effort made
        to explore reasons for his views.<p>The plot follows Benita, a Hispanic
        woman abused by her drunken husband and generally put upon and under appreciated
        by her family. She is chosen as an intermediary by aliens choosing to
        make contact with humanity, and this she does, travelling to Washington,
        and eventually to&nbsp; other worlds. The aliens in question are a well
        meaning race who want to help humanity achieve the level of social
        advancement required for admission to a galactic federation, which would
        protect earth from some of that Confederation's more predatory
        members.&nbsp; I do not want to give away too much of the plot so I will
        simply end this with an excerpt.<p>&nbsp;<p><i>She threw herself down on
        the bed, sprawled every which-a-way like cooked spaghetti, muscles
        letting go all at once, mind switching from angelica to the bookstore,
        back to General Wallace, and then to the creature that had called itself
        an athyco. Whatever did they really look like? And how could they have
        gone out of her mind even for a moment? So strange, so wonderful, yet
        hard to think about. Well, strangeness was hard to think about. Wonder
        grazes you like a bullet, it zips by and is gone, and all you really
        perceive is the zing as it goes past, or maybe the pain if it comes too
        close. It does no good to search for whatever it was, for it never
        lodges anywhere you can get a good look at it. The truly strange has no
        hooks of familiarity that one can catch hold of.</i><p><i>It had
        happened though. It wasn't a dream. She really had met weird aliens,
        Chiddy and Vess, who had done her as good turn, who had to have done it,
        because it was the only way she could explain how well she'd been doing.
        She hadn't cried once. She hadn't lain awake, worried over what she
        might have done or said wrong. She hadn't been concerned about running
        back home because it was her duty. Somehow, it seemed, Chiddy and Vess
        had unquirked her.</i>
