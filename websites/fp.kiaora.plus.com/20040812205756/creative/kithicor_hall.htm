<h1><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Kithicor Hall<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></h1>
<blockquote>

<p>The sun was well up in the sky by the time they dared enter the forest. Stories of the region by night had even filtered back home, now so unbearably distant.  They had camped in the western commonlands overnight, keeping a fire going strong to ward off roaming beasts, but neither felt refreshed.
  </p>

<p>
They were dressed for the road, strong boots with thick soles, caked in mud, and long warm woollen capes, only slightly frayed about the edges. Their clothes had born up well to the punishment the journey had subjected them to. Though dirty, these two were certainly no peasants.  Both moved with an easy sinuous lope, the larger of the two leading the way into the mists of Kithicor forest.
  </p>

<p>
Thespa followed the reassuring bulk of Cathiss through the twisting chasm. Though weary, she felt her stomach begin to flutter in anticipation. Their goal was now close. She would be able to be herself in this place, her father had told her so. No one would spit on her, afraid of her gift, ridiculing her for her differences. As they passed into the forest her green eyes gleamed and her handsome face glowed; even the lack of light beneath the dense canopy failed to chill her as it should. She began to hum under her breath, an alien but joyful air, until her companion stopped her with a respectful but quelling backwards glance.
  </p>
<p>&quot;Just because it is daylight does not mean these woods are completely safe My Lady, please try not to make more noise than necessary.&quot;,
he said, and Thespa was instantly silent, thoroughly quelled.&nbsp;
  </p>
<p> Strictly speaking her companion was a servant, but this ancient family retainer had known and cared for her since her hatching. She adjusted her pack and reached a hand to her lute, the familiar smooth surface reassuring her, and she ran on, eagerness once again rising as she willed the last miles past. It was a shame the need for quiet meant her drums were out of the question; they would have eaten up the remaining distance in no time.
  </p>
<p>
Thespa could not help but compare the forest with those of her native land. The oppressive darkness, even at the height of day, was the most significant difference. These trees were arboreal monsters you could hollow a house out
of; they swept skyward for hundreds of yards before exploding, branches and leaves strangling each other and what little light there was. It gave the uncanny impression at ground level of being at the bottom of some deep ocean. For any other than this aquatic pair the sensation would have been suffocating.
  </p>
  <hr>

<p>
	The trees thinned suddenly after an hour or more's run, and both of the travellers stopped suddenly as they finally saw their destination before them. A huge edifice of grey stone smothered in ivy stood in a wide forest clearing. Turrets and crenulations aplenty topped the thickly buttressed walls. It was evidently an ancient building, that had been added to over the centuries by a variety of owners of eclectic and sometimes questionable taste, the fashions of eons echoed in the multitude of gargoyles, icons and carvings; the windows speckled the façade like a demented rash, here arched, here perfectly rectangular, interspersed with arrow slits and a crazy paving of down pipes and guttering.</p>

<p>
The two iksar simply stared. They had both looked, and laughed a little, at the woodcuts they had been sent of this foreign building, but it seemed with hindsight that a little artistic license had been used on the part of the craftsman. For the first time Thespa felt a qualm concerning her new life, the setting for which now loomed before them. She shrank a little towards her companion, who gathered himself at last and took her hand in his.
He gripped it reassuringly.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be all right small one; your father took great care to find out all he could about this place. The Lady will have been expecting us for a week or so by now, so let us go and greet her shall we?&quot;,
he said.</p>

<p>Thespa nodded, her iridescent facial markings glowing beneath her hood. She stepped a little more confidently towards the alarming building, tail lifted slightly behind her, a sign of alarm or wariness in her kind.</p>

<p>
Their arrival had been witnessed, it appeared. As they approached, the enormous iron doors began to swing open soundlessly on&nbsp;
well-oiled hinges. The fact that the doors were made of thick iron reminded Thespa of her companion's earlier reminder of the perils of Kithicor's night and she shuddered in slightly delighted anticipation. She would be safe in here she knew, but how marvellous to consider the dangers so close, dangers which one day she would be allowed to help tame.&nbsp;<br>
	A guardsman appeared in the doorway, greeting them with a salute.</p>

<p>&quot;Names please!&quot;, said the guard with an exaggerated salute. A faint
grin hinting that this was a formality and their names were already known.<br>
&quot;I have brought Lady Thespa D'acot&nbsp; to enrol sir. I am her servant
Cathiss&quot;<br>
&quot;Very good sah, apologies for askin, as I don't rightly see what other iksar visitors we'd be like to get around here, just doing me job
is all.&quot;</p>

<p>
He waved the newcomers through the doors with a grin and a sideways look at Thesca's lute. Word had evidently spread about the iksar bard.</p>
