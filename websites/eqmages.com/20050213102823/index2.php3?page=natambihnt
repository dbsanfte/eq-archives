 <h2><u>GoD Natimbi Group Hunting</u></h2><br><br>Reccomended levels: 55 (group hunting), 65 (solo)<br><br>Natimbi is a great zone to hunt in for loot. The mobs hit hard, normally around 260s to 330s for named but they have lower hp compared to PoP mobs. All mobs throughout the zone drops quest and rarely, good drops worth up to 50k plat ( at least on Luclin server ) or more. <br> <br>At the port in point in Natimbi, the camp NPCs give out nice quests for gear with stats and around 50 hp 50 mana. Particularly of interest are the high elf that wants Intact stonemite parts ( he wants 4 different intact stonemite parts, shell, meat, eye and something else ) and the halfing who knows how to make turepta soup. She wants succulent terupta meats, only succulent will do, normal turepta meat does not work. All this gear is no drop so its only if you need it.<br> <br>So basically, you can set up your group or yourself if you were soloing. Just north outside the camp and kill tureptas and stonemites. Levitate is a BIG plus and a must for some classes. If you are quick you will never die even on a train as the magus just slightly behind you. It only goes to Nedaria tho so make a hotkey or something.<br> <br>When you are feeling more confident, cross the river. Beware there are some mobs in the river and some of them can come on land. If you cross the river, levitate becomes even more useful. Mob pathing into the river and to the camp is horrible and they wont be as fast as you if you can float over to the magus for safety compared to you swimming. There are more roamers on this side however and Hynids ( hyena like dog things ). They drop flawless hynid hides which are for a quest for 15 ac 65 hp 15 disease resist boots in abysmal sea.<br> <br>To the north of the other side of the river there is a camp of restless souls. They drop spectral essences for a melee only 1hb with 150 DD quest also at the natimbi camp. So you could persuade a melee to join you to farm this site.<br> <br>NAMED: teruptas are a PH for a fierce cragwalker. a named terupta who can drop decent loot which would probably be an upgrade for you if you need the quest items in natimbi. The same can be said about a swift scavenger, who is a named hynid tho not often seen near the zone in. Stuff in the water are a PH for a Vimidon, a named crab regrua who also can drop decent loot. And Tumia Lehio is a named ghost that can spawn in any of the restless soul spots. She can drop a 20 hp augment. Also I have seen Kyv Heartpiercers around, they drop a decent bow and a sword and their PHs are the slightly harder nocs and mastruqs ( I think so anyway ) that can be found through the zone. Usually around bridge and stair structures.<br> <br>Beware around the hours of 12 midnight and 2 am game time. The cragbeast queen can pop, there will be a zonewide message about a distant roar if so. If you are around the camp or just across the river or at the restless soul camp you should be safe but any further and you are at risk of getting killed horribly. She hits for 4000s and runs faster than or as fast as bard song.<br><br><br> - Guide by Naresha Qysilthilas on Luclin.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(237); return false;'>Natimbi - The Broken Shores mob list</a><br>

This zone was fantastic soloing at 59, great experience and loot for that level.  The exp rate was on the average 1% per 3 kills.  Now at 60 the exp rate has gone up to about 1.5% per 3 kills at least.  GVoc Air is my pet of choice, although I've started to use the *improved* MSIII pet also (pet has a new proc and seems to do pretty well).

Another note, fishing while you med is a great way to earn some easy plat during downtime; as fish/crabs sell for an average of 2pp each.

Find a partner, and add the named spawns to your list of targets for some good loot.  During my time in this zone, I've upgraded my face, secondary, and range slots while simply grinding out exp.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>How in the world can you kill someting that hits for 4000?  o.o<br><br><i><b>holix</b> says:</i><br>Hi i play on rodcet i'm a 54 mage almsot 55 and i was wondering. it says 55 and up for soloing here, but i looked up spells and it said i dont get new pet till 57. so what pet would i use now for here earth?<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>nvm<br><br><i><b>Zanch</b> says:</i><br>I started soloing the turtles here at 49.
