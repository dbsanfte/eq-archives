 <h2>Epic 2 Discussion</h2><br><br>What do you think the Magician Epic 2 should be? This is a topic covered extensively elsewhere (check the <a href='http://forum.magecompendium.com'>Mage Compendium Forums</a>), but I would like to get people's thoughts here as well, so when Brenlo etc visit this site they have something to read. :)<br><br>The old epic is a special fourth type of pet which is more powerful than the other four. Would you like to see a similar type of epic for version 2, or something completely different? Post your ideas and opinions here!<br><br><br><br></center><br><b><u>Comments/Feedback:</u></b><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Dependent upon the difficulty of the Epic 2 quest. I feel an upgraded epic pet is in order. With the PoP pets available at higher lvls, why bother with epic 1 other than just to have it. Hopefully epic 2 will address that.

Mana regen would really be nice.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Perhaps it is another summon pet tool like the first epic, but maybe it's to summon a different element of pet; maybe with an earth elemental look but with different abilities.  Just a thought, hopefully it'll be more than just an Epic 1.0 with better stats.<br><br><i><b>Fritz</b> says:</i><br>for some reason i feel we might get a clickable upgrade of an eye of zomm, lol. but seriously what might be neat to implement would be maybe a clickable full group CoTH, or maybe even just an upgraded one that works in all zones? just a thought, cause even if they make 2.0 a better pet, and EQ throws out another expansion its just gonna become like our first epic. <br><br><i><b>Joyire</b> says:</i><br>Well I think that another pet would be a waste of time, do to the speed at which sony is coming out with new expansions.  It will just end up not being as good as later pets.  But I do think that it should stick to being a summon.  Perhaps a robe with epic stats, and maybe even some mana regen props.  That is just something I think that I would enjoy... I'm sure whatever it is though Sony will be sure to dangle it in front of us with a wonderfully impossible quest. *Dripping with sarcasm*<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>All i know is from EQ Stratics 'pre-unveiling' of our epic 2.0 and it alludes to casting eye of zomm... if that is the case i will seriously just sell my gear and move to WoW... how lame would a lvl 8 spell be for an epic effect... Specially since we can do the Clay Bracelet quest when very young... I think Eye of Zomm is a useless spell and personally dont use it, i use Tallon if anything... Necro's like Zomm, i understand why but if my new epic is a lvl 8 Spell i'll tell sony Exactly what to do with it!<br><br><i><b>Daerflin</b> says:</i><br>A ratio based Damage shield, decent duration, group effect. By Ratio based I mean it reciprocates a percentage of the damage done by the mob back to it. So instead of doing a Flat 60 points of damage per hit , it does say 20% of the Mobs hit. 
So a big 500 point hitter would recieve 100 points of damage back, whilst a 1000 point hitter would take 200 damage. 
That would make the Epic2 an item that would scale with difficulty as well as making it something valuable for all situations and very useful against big slow hitters as well as small fast ones.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>perhaps epic 2.0 could have a spell that is nowhere in the mages repertoire making it essential to have.  Something like a pacify maybe or a slow a utility spell that makes it highly sought after.<br><br><i><b>Taishici Arch Convoker</b> says:</i><br>IMHO this epic almost has to be a follow up of the original due to the other classes gettin their uber pets that could destroy our fist epic pet. Kinda sad when ur epic has no more value than stats and the occaisional chain petting strat. One major spell I think will be mandatory as a clicky on the epic 2 is a realistic heal spell for our pets. BL's get 2100 hp heals and they are hybrids...... End Rant<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Nah not an uprgraded pet pls. It will just get out dated soon & the new monster summoning pets with pet foci from Qvic or Txevu make it uber anyways. Also many times when u raid, pets arent used often for a variety of reasons that i wont discuss here <shrug> I would like something to complement the mage to make him feel more than a 2nd rate wizzie for the times when we cant deploy our pets & just stand there nuking (esp during high end raiding). <br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I love the idea of a right-clicky pet except for one thing:  It eventually becomes obsolete.  We've seen this happen already with Epic 1.0.  Intead, how about a right-clicky instant-cast pet-buff?  The drawback is that the buff can be dispelled.  The buff could provide various effects such as +25 STR, +25, DEX +25 AGI, +50 AC, +25 ATK, +1000 HP, a DS that stacks with our normal DS, +50 hp/tick regen (pet doesn't have to be out of combat) and even an additional proc effect.  Add +25% DD focus and +25 mana/tick so that it even benefits the 50+ fire pets (in case they ever get fixed).  Maybe the effect also heals the pet for 2000 hp, and it has a recast timer of 5 minutes.  Or, maybe Epic 2.o simply has a right-clicky instant-click that makes our pet enrage, recast timer 5 minutes so it can't be used for solo chain-pulling.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>i hope the epic 2 is not only a new pet but a pet that comes fully buffed and an instant cast time 5 min recast time with 8k+hp so mage pets can do some real damage and there damage out put should be that of a 65 warrior with haste and if you give your pet a weapon tghe it gets the damage as if it were a lvl 65 warrior with max skill in that weapon and or all the 65 lvls should be 70 lvls<br><br><i><b>neego</b> says:</i><br>the last one about the 65 ands 70's was me didnt mean to put annonamous<br><br><i><b>Appolo</b> says:</i><br>i think the way to go is make a pet that is clicky and have it on the same level as our other pets. make it random which pet you get and have a 1 minute timer on it. this would do 2 things. first it would open the door to chain summoning again and second when it hit the fan you could squeeze out a pet in a jam and gate<br><br><i><b>Appolo</b> says:</i><br>also dont make it a summoned item....that is cool for cr but lets face it. big pain to have to use mana and time to get new one over and over. make it a item like rest of them<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I completely disagree with the Epic uselessness. Epics came out in Kunark and served the mage community for Kunark, Velious, Luclin all the way to the begining of POP.

What WOULD be a good idea would be a clicky heal for your pet. Clicky heals never go out of style. As a warrior I *STILL* use my Invigorate BP at 65. 10-20 second clicky CH for the pet! now that is something that wont go out of style soon :)<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Some good ideas here...an idea might be more control for the pet...make the pet closer to the control ability of a full pc...this might change the need for them in high end raids...and lets face it, doesn't it really grind your butt when we can only take half a toon to the fight?<br><br><i><b>Sued</b> says:</i><br>Magicians needs to be able to cast their buffs on other toons. Our mana regen stacks with HoV while the druid BoT9 does not, etc. This would make magicians more desireable in groups. The ability to control which spells pets cast or when they go hand to hand vs. casting would make the pets better and might actually get magicians all over the EQ community to dust off those, never used, fire pets. If you can turn off taunt and /pet hold, then you should be able to /pet don't root... my 2 cents.<br><br><i><b>Heros</b> says:</i><br>I don't think the new epic should even be a weapon i think it should be a sheild that has like a Picture of the four different elements on it thats like the size of a Tae ew sheild and still has an effect like FT20 and summon a level 70pet with 8khp 1700ac 1650atk 270 str sta agi etc... something that will actualy let a mage solo like its supposed to. Name-Heros Server-Veeshan good bye now!!<br><br><i><b>Heros</b> says:</i><br>To add to my last post when you make the pet i was thinking it would mix like the first epics pet together with the level 65 spell pet and come out with the level 60 pet with thoughs stats. Name-Heros Server-Veeshan Bye bye now!!<br><br><i><b>Heros</b> says:</i><br>Level 70 pet /points at last post
Name-Heros Server-Veeshan Bye bye now!!<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>a summon pet would be nice but i hate the elemental pets. why not something new based on the summon monster spell line. or if it has to be an elemental pet something that looks diffrent from all the other elementals so you know its an epic pet. as for all the high stats it is highly unlikely that SoE would give us a pet worth the effort it takes to get it. but how able something that can benifits the group or raid. a pet that cast not only DD spells but elemental type buffs like lev and DS or saves on all withing range. plus maybe it offers a mana regen to all around it. theres something that could be usfull. A bard based pet that sings to every one in the sounds of the elements offering speed resist and hp/mana regen. <br><br><i><b>bottled fennin ro</b> says:</i><br>HOw about a second pet that we can have on top of our epic.  If you have epic one and two you can have two pets.  Be very stimulating controling them though.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>ok any one know where there is info on where to start and whats needed for epic 2.0 or 1.5 yet? <br><br><i><b>Anvarra</b> says:</i><br>You all make good points but lets not forget the 66 to 70 spells have some nice pet heal and buffs in them and a couple of tiks aboot. How about a simple reminder to the EQ crew Magician is elemental Earth,Air Fire and Water yet all our spells DD and AE are FIRE BASE Wiz and Chants even Sham use Fire and Ice. Why not an epic with a right click Ice DD Nuke for us. We know it will aid summoning no matter what. I know I know I am being nit picky but it just burns seeing a firepet ice the creep and I can't....ok seriously how about an Epic that right clicks a Prylen pet? <br><br><i><b>Anvarra</b> says:</i><br>1.5 and 2.0 starters....The Magician Epic Quest 1.5 Checklist

=============================================================
Step 1: Meet with Iilivina

Requirements: Group

You will need your Staff of Elemental Essence to begin the Epic 2.0 quest.

Look for Iilivina is Dranik's Scar.

You say, 'Hail, Iilivina'

Iilivina says 'The magic here is quite unique. I am thrilled I've had the opportunity to study it.'

Give her your Staff of Elemental Essence. Don't worry, you get it back.

Iilivina says 'My goodness, I did not realize you were the one [Bantil] sent to me! This is truly amazing! I was shocked when Magi'Kot's dream had been realized. I never thought it would be surpassed. My, so much focused elemental energy. This is truly amazing. You have accomplished quite a feat.'

You say, 'bantil'

Iilivina says 'Yes, Bantil told me you would be coming. Perhaps we can help each other. There are two tribes of elemental beings here. They have an unprecedented ability to channel elemental energy. I have yet to see one with my own eyes, but they may just contain [power] that will help you unleash the staff's true power '

You say, 'power'

Iilivina says 'They use the elements in a way we have yet to understand. I suspect something in their essence that allows them to tap into the elements in a different manner than we understand. If my suspicions are true, these creatures should leave behind a small portion of their essence, when their spirits leave their bodies. If you find anything like that, bring it to me. They may be rather small, so bring me two from each type for good measure.'

You will need to travel to Riftseekers and kill Pyrilen and Gelidran mobs, and collect two each of Pyrilen Essence and Gelidran Essence.
<br><br><i><b>Anvarra</b> says:</i><br>Thats all I got so far in my searches sorry for the small amount of info brothers and sisters<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>this is non related but do you really need a credit card to pay the fee or can you just send a check?<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Ithink it should be a ultimate pet focus that adds all the effects the old epic had but moreso high damage shield,stun proc, backstab,<br><br><i><b>EQDoronos</b> says:</i><br>What about something like a truly epic spell?  Maybe the End of Magi'Kot.  It would be a spell that effects the enemy like so;  they age as old as the mountains (STR and ATK debuff), Fire consumes them (DoT HP reducer), Whirlwinds to scramble their thoughts (Mem Blur and stun, maybe even a confusion effect), and Water to drown them (Choking based DoT).  I dunno, it's just a thought.

I think that is a great idea (Keeping the casting time within reason)<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I think that the Epic 2.0 should have a clicky Mana Burn type effect on it, but only one that isnt as good as the Wizzy's of course, otherwise they will complain, but I think we need something for a little extra firepower.  The focus effect should maybe be something with awesome mana regen, or maybe a pet beefer upper, if you get what I'm saying.  Thats just my two copper.<br><br><i><b>Kontana Spellbookworm</b> says:</i><br>An upgraded version of epic 1.5 for epic 2.0 would be find by me. What I think they should do is *if* you've completed the epic 1.5 quest, you can turn in yout epic 1.0 orb to an NPC, and he hands you back another rod (or maybe even a shield!) with an upgraded pet summoned version of the epic 1.0 pet, that is compareable to the Child of xxx line of pets. 30 to 45 second cast so it's not chainable like epic 1.0 pet. This would still give us an epic, and would also solve the problem of our obsolite epic 1.0. From what I've seen, Mages are the *only* class who's epic is truely obsolite with the new 66+ spells. It would be nice to see an upgrade.
