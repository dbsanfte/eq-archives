 <h2><u>Pet Focus Items (up to 49)</u></h2></center><br><br>A pet is <b>the most important</b> aspect of the mage class, certainly below 60. One of the single most important quests any mage will ever do, is the pet focus items quest. Anyone not doing this is really missing out. This guide deals with how to obtain the focus items which will focus any pet from levels 4 to 44, increasing its power, strength and size! (From 34 the pets appear visibly larger).<br><br> <br><b><u>What are "pet focus items"?</u></b><br> <br>The focus items are primary slot mage only items with some very low stats, right click reclaim energy, and the unique focus effects: <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4397">Minion of Fire</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4398">Minion of Water</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4399">Minion of Earth</a> and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4396">Minion of Air</a>. These are <b>the</b> original focus effects, in game before any of the labelled focus effects. These focus effects make your pets more powerful, even visibly larger! (From 34 onwards), and work on all pets from level 4 to level 44.<br> <br><b><u>How to get them.</u></b><br> <br>The quest giver is a gnome called <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12084">Vira</a> in the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Solusek_Ro.htm">Temple of Soulsek Ro</a>, but thats the last stop on your trip, as its pointless to go and see Vira before obtaining all of the handin items. These items are: some minor item relating to that element, some kind of gem, some kind of giant toe, and, most importantly <u>a torch/shovel/broom/stein</u>.<br> <br><b><u>Collecting the Items</u></b><br> <br>By far the hardest and most awkward items to obtain, are the "ordinary" items that get powered up and returned to you. These items drop off the magicians in Najena (reportedly including the goblin magicians), and can be found on the aligators outside Cazic-Thule too. However, this guide assumes that you will be taking the Najena route, as the alligators are 'second best' unless you are exp camping them. (For more information on alligator route click <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=279">here</a> for mob info).<br><br>However, these items <b>are</b> tradeable, and its always worth asking mages who might have done the quest before if they have one of a particular item lying around, after all, its rare that you get the 4 you want in order before getting a duplicate of one of them. (Obviously, save YOUR duplicate items, to trade with ones you need, or to sell or give to someone else!)<br><br>First things first: Getting to <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Najena.htm">Najena</a> is fairly easy, just port in to Lavastorm and it should be labelled on your map. Once there, tread carefully, and proceed slowly through the zone. Your looking for <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2128">'a magician'</a>.<br><br>There are a few there, all on a 19 minute cycle. You need to get yourself set up so that your killing as many as possible while still getting back to await the first spawn as 1) With luck they wont get time to get a pet up, saves time and reduces risk. 2) Theres no point venturing deeper than you have to. Theres not much help I can offer at this point, except that <b>DO <u>NOT</u> THROW AWAY ANY 'PAGES OF ELEMENTAL MASTERY: <element>'!</b>, these are needed for the magician epic. They are also rare, but your killing two birds in one stone, so to speak. Doing two long painful camps at once. The camps do take ages, but eventually you will find 'A Shovel', 'A Stein', 'A Torch', and 'A Broom'. (Hopefully at least!). You don't <b>need</b> all four, but you get a focus item for one element for each item you get.<br> <br><b><u>The Other Items</u></b><br> <br>Ok, so you have "the ordinary items", thats most of the work done! You just need some other items to complete the set, here are the requirements for each. Below these listings I have put the quickest and easiest way to aquire them all in one go. (Although It might be worth checking the bazaar for some of these items)<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6361">Shovel of Ponz</a> (Earth)<br> - A Shovel<br> - Ruby<br> - Hill Giant toes<br> - Gargoyle Eye<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6363">Stein of Ulissa</a> (Water)<br> - A Stein<br> - Sapphire<br> - Ice Giant Toes<br> - Mermaid Scale<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6362">Torch of Alna</a> (Fire)<br> - A Torch<br> - Fire Emerald<br> - Fire Giant Toes<br> - Fire Drake Scale<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6360">Broom of Trillon</a> (Air)<br> - A Broom<br> - Star Ruby<br> - Cyclops Toes<br> - Griffon Feather<br> <br> <br>Firstly, on your way out of Najena, stay in Lavastorm and kill drakes to get the fire drake scale, then quickly go through Nektulos Forest to East Commons to Freeport, from where you can catch a boat through the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/oot.html">Ocean of Tears</a>.<br><br>In this zone you can acquire most of the remaining items. The islands you need are gargoyle isle (a couple of kills of <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2543">"A Gargoyle"</a> should yield the eye), Siren Isle (kill <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2536">"An Alluring Siren"</a> untill you get a mermaid scale), and Cyclops Isle. On this island should be (very popular spot) people camping the cyclopses.<br><br>They will almost definately sell you the gems you need cheaply, far far cheaper than a merchant. And near there you should find someone camping <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2572">Gornit</a>, he is pretty much always camped, and generally his toes are left to rott, ask whoever is camping if you can loot them, he drops all types of giant toe, including cyclops. All thats left to do then is to pick up a Gryffon feather, I suggest checking the bazaar or vendors in the Karana's. (If a gargoyle is too high level, then look on nearby vendors or the bazaar for the eye)<br> <br><b><u>The Final Hand-In</u></b><br> <br>This is it! Back to Lavastorm, but this time to the ajoining zone "Temple of Soulsek Ro", to find a gnome called "Vira". (You should have nothing to worry about faction wise in here). Simply hand her the right 4 items to make each focus item. You don't have to do all 4, and don't have to do all at once, the quests are totally independant of each other. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your beefed up pets!<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=10'>Temple of Soulsek Ro mob list</a><br>

They are LORE, so you can't get spares to sell in bazaar.

All four flavors of giant toes can be merchant mined in OOT (every merchant I checked had all four flavors) from people camping the named.

Mermaid scale was merchant mined in OOT, Gargoyle Eye was found in bazaar, Gryphon Feather was merchant mined off of gypsy merchants in NK, Fire Drake Scale merchant mined off of the druid merchant in Sol A at druid circle.

All gems can be purchased from jewlery merchant in PoK behind main bank.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>this is good advice for all u newbies out there if u need help i am a lvl.9 or up monk named mobslair.On the eci sever<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>HOW COME NO ONE IS ON THE ECI SEVER THAT GIVES HINTS!!!!!<br><br><br><i><b>Pictos Bonesplitter Rodset Nife</b> says:</i><br><br>One place you didn't mention is Mistmore. There's a gargoyle fairly close to the zone and if you can get a group of 4 people to help you pull it or a High Lv char your set. The mob always drops 1 and most of the time 2 eye's.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>isnt there any quests for EXP factions or currency for lvl 5 and under mages? I mean there has to be one. I desperatly need EXP and Currency.<br><br><br><i><b>Archonz 33-Mage Quel</b> says:</i><br><br>After a long paintful camp im Najena, I was able to collect a torch, broom, and shovel.  Still missing the stein but here's the scoop.  I found a total of 7 "magicians" in the zone all dark elves.  However the only item i recrieved off of them was the "shovel."  In the zone is also a "goblin magician" after 3x killing him I recieved a "torch."  But heres something that might be really useful.  I found an enchanter, yes an enchanter, that also has a chance of dropping these items.  If you are looking at the eqatlas map, right outside room "11" is a named mob named Ekeros.  I recieved a "broom" from him.  I know that he was an enchanter because he mezzed me and my pet.  Was an ez kill though, was green at 34.  Some mages were on a 10 min cycle, others more about 20.  However with a total of 9 mobs found to drop this item, I was kept pretty busy.  If anyone finds that @$%^ stein on quellious server, plz send tel to Archonz- 34 mage
