 <h2>Low Levels as a Mage: EverFrost</h2><br><br><br>When creating your mage, in my opinion the best place to hunt is EverFrost. Wherever you start it is only a quick trip through PoK away, so its worth making the trip. The only downside: You wont be able to do the newbie quests as easily, but you shouldn't need to. Keep reading to see why.<br><br><br>There are a few reasons EverFrost makes such a good newbie zone, but one reason is that the mobs largely all path through one point, so theres plenty of stuff to kill in the very first levels. Pull stuff you are capable of taking, and you should shoot up. Another considerable bonus is the loots here, for example, turn in polar bear skins to Cindl in Halas tailoring shop, and you will recieve xp, gold, and some newbie armour. Its a good deal, with over a yellow of exp at level3 for each skin handed in!<br><br><br>I suggest saving all pelts and spiderling silks you find here - they will allow you to make some basic armours with tailoring, but more importantly, they will give you cash. A high-quality bear skin, for example, sells for a good price to players, more than enough to buy yourself some armour that surpasses the newbie suits. Keep LQ skins too, try to make leather padding out of them, which sells for very high prices!<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Comments/Feedback:</u></b><br><br>
