 <h2>The Bloodgill Goblins</h2><br><br><br>Another great guide by Morillion.<br><br><br><br></center>Ask anyone who has done the Bloodgill Goblin camp and they will tell you, it is an amazing camp. You can do it as early as level 39, and they don't start turning lt blue til 50. <br><br><font size=+1><b>Location and Setup</b></font> <br><br>The Bloodgill Goblin camp is in the middle of the Lake of Ill Omen (LOIO). If you have PoP, the easiest route is to take the stone to Fironia Vie, run invis and levitated out of the tunnel, take an immediate left and follow the edge of the zone a short ways until you hit a stream. Go left at the stream, and you will zone into LOIO. <br><br>Once in LOIO, follow the stream to the lake. The temple with the Bloodgills is in the center of the lake.  <br><br>Being underwater, be sure you have a permanent Enduring Breath item, or a bag full of waterstones. You will also have a much better time in the water if you are levitating, so have a bag of lev rings as well. <br><br>The temple itself is a large dome with 4 spires at the corners. There are a total of 12 Bloodgill Goblins around this area. Every spire has 2 goblins, there are two at the entrance to the temple (Veksar), and there are two singles at the smaller spires on the western side of the temple. At the entrance to Veksar, there is also a chance to get the Bloodgill Marauder. He is much tougher than normal Bloodgill Goblins, and will be a tough add. Until at least lvl 44, I would recommend either using eye of zomm to check and see if he is up before pulling, or avoiding the temple entrance altogether. The Marauder drops a piece for the VP key and spawns every 13 hours (I believe), so some occasions you won't need to worry about him.<br><br><br><br><font size=+1><b>Strategy</b></font><br><br>First, the facts. Bloodgill Goblins vary in level from 35 - 38. They have approx. 1200-1500 HP, and hit for ~70 max, although they typically hit in the 40s and 50s. They are VERY social, and will assist even when they turn lt blue. They drop a couple plat each, as well as Bloodgill Scale (for Iksar quest) and an Ancient Coin (for bard quest), as well as various runes and words. About 1 in 25 also drops a Harpoon of the Depths, which is a large lore piercer that sells for 60pp or more to merchants. I typically destroyed the coins and scales, or let them rot. For the harpoon, I would run to the merchant in the windmill at the Southern part of the zone to sell, then run back. The Bloodgill Goblins have a 17-20 minutes spawn time. At 39, they gave 2% or more XP each. At 50, they give about 1/2% or less XP each. From 42-48 they were averaging 1% per kill, or 12% (3 blue) every 20 minutes. <br><br>(<i>Short Version</i>) <br><br>Start at the Northeast corner and work counterclockwise. Fully buff and equip your fire pet first, and send it in without pulling. Start healing the pet when it gets below 80% health, and be sure to tag each goblin with a low level nuke to get xp. The last mob to die from the spire couples will run at 20% and not get any adds. The ones in the front of the temple will, so nuke them when they begin the deathwalk. Once you finish the loop and get back to the NE spire, med and rest on top of it until they repop. <br><br>(<i>Long Version</i>) <br><br>Now my strategy. Keep in mind this is what I did, and not necessarily what is the best. First, make sure you have KEI. It will dramatically decrease the downtime. (although it may be a non-issue soon with the KEI level nerf on the horizon) Then cast a fire pet at the bank of the lake. Give it a full set of plate, any other AC items you can, and 2 sword of runes. Make sure you have EB up, and dive in. Go to the Northeast corner of the temple, just South of where the goblins are. Burnout the pet, then med to full. Here is the spell lineup I recommend: <br><br>At 39: <br><br>1. Blaze <br>2. Cinder Bolt <br>3. Renew Summoning <br>4. Renew Elements <br>5. Burnout 2 <br>6. Lesser Conjuration:Earth <br>7. Burst of Flame <br>8. Gate <br><br>At 44: <br><br>1. Shock of Swords <br>2. Blaze <br>3. Refresh Summoning <br>4. Renew Summoning <br>5. Burnout 2 <br>6. Conjuration: Earth <br>7. Burst of Flame <br>8. Gate <br><br>At 49: <br><br>You could do it blindfolded. 49 Fire Pet stomps these things into the ground with barely a scratch. Spells at will, but do some damage  <br><br>It is very hard to pull Bloodgills singly without a lull/pacify spell. For that reason, I always took 2 at a time when I could. Get to a spot where you can see the action but not aggro the goblins, and send the pet in against one. Do not pull, or the second one will attack you! When the pet gets below 80% health, start healing. From 39-43, the heals suck, so you may have to chain heal using the lvl 20 and the lvl 8 heals. After 44, Refresh Summoning is all you need unless something goes awry. Somewhere inbetween heals, hit the first goblin you attacked with Burst of Flame to get all the xp. The goblins will not run as long as there are 2 of them, so the first one will stay engaged with the pet until he dies. Once the first one dies, the second one should be down to about 70% health thanks to the DS he has been beating on. Hit him with Burst of Flame also. The second goblin WILL run at 20% health. For the goblins at the 4 spires, don't worry about the runners getting adds because they won't. Just let the pet kill it. For the goblins by the entrance, use a nuke to finish them off because you do have a risk of getting an add. <br><br>From lvl 39-43, I could take the top spires only, and one of the two singles from the West side if mana and time permitted. After getting the lvl 44 heal, I was able to take all 12 spawns and the marauder if he was up. I would work counterclockwise from the Northeast corner. By the time I came back to the NE spire, I was low on mana, out of energy (stamina from swimming), and still have 5-7 minutes before the goblins re-popped. This was good, because at the top of the NE spire, it is flat and out of the water, so you can med mana back and regain your energy. By the time I was full mana again, the pet was at full health and the first set of goblins had re-popped. <br><br>There is also a bonus to those with extra mana and time. Between the SE and NE spires is a barracuda spawn. Usually it is a Deepwater Barracuda, which is lvl 35 and is very comparable to the Bloodgill Goblins. Occasionally it will be a Bloodgill Barracuda, which is level 40 and in comparable to the Bloodgill Marauder. The joy of this is that the fish is on a 90 second timer, so it could be an XP camp within itself. <br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(73); return false;'>The Lake of Ill Omen mob list</a><br>
