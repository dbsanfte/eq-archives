 <h2>Sisters in OOT</h2></center><br><br>I used to play everquest a while back and I had a level 39 High Elf Magician on Brell.<br><br>I know of many places to suggest where to hunt for the best exp with low to medium risks of dying. On my Mage, around level 23 I went to the Ocean of Tears and hunted the Woodelf females on sister island until about level 26 I think, or higher.<br><br>I know what is going through your head. ("Why would you ruin your faction with the Woodelves while being a Highelf?") Well, its not that bad.. I started killing at 23 and when I hit 26 I think they were apprehensive - not a very big faction hit at all for me.<br><br>And when or if your faction does get to where your KOS to the Woodelf, you can go to East Freeport and do a muffin quest which is super easy to do, although it takes A LOT of muffins to get your faction back to snuff.<br><br>Anyway, when on the island there is one person you MUST stay away from and that is the woman in the hut furthest to the right from the docks. I think she's a princess or something, but that isn't important. Just keep this in mind: When she argo's you, you better have SoW, levitate, and good faction with God cause you'll be doing a lot of praying when she lays the smack down on ya! Hits for like 500+ maybe, only got hit once and I died so fast that it left me wondering what the F happened. Besides her, the rest are pretty easy.<br><br>Now for my mage: (Who was untwinked to the max.) I killed the sister on the dock, at the tree right behind the dock, and one other sister who is further over to the right down near the shore line. When your pulling these women, pull them all the way on the left side of the dock. There's a little hill right there and that's where you will want to fight. At 23 I used my earth pet for starters but I hate using him because when you root the women they keep attacking and being untwinked, you run out of mana pretty fast and your pet takes more and more dmg.<br><br>When I hit 24 and got all my new spells I went back and did the same process. Only this time I would pull the two women in the far back left house after the others. Take note that all these women argo if they get within a certain distance of each other. So I made sure that I was full or almost full mana. When you get two close to each other, here is how to take control: Nuke one of the women and send pet in to root her, back him off and set him on the other girl who is attacking you. (If they are both on the pet don't worry about them just keep healing pet. Only nuke if the girl(s) are 50% or below otherwise you will get argo.)<br><br>If you keep them apart so the pet is on just one, you can chain nuke the girl that your pet isn't on, if she aggros, get pet to root her again. Then I would nuke her until she dies. Sometimes the other sister break root and would run after me so I would get pet to root her while I ran back. Just keep doing that over and over and your kill themem eventually.<br><br>I think I was still hunting there at level 28 also, got my new pets and would kill just about all of them. I tried to stay away from the three in the main building as it consists of a merchant and two guards who will agro if your close enough while attacking another sister. There are some Dwarfs around the back of the island, and there are lower level female Woodelves roaming the island who mostly carry rusty weapons. The sisters that you will be killing drop 3 or more plat, belts that sell for 1pp to an NPC and if you kill the sisters with the swords in their hand then you can sell them for 10pp+ each to an NPC depending on faction/cha.<br><br>The sisters also drop words which can help you out with your research. There are several islands around sister island: The one straight out from the docks has Aqua Gobs on it, the one slightly to the left from the docks (Facing the island) is the island where that lone Cyclops roams - there is a  merchant in the building on that island who sells a lot of Mage pet spells that you WILL be needing. If you get into trouble when you have levitate and SoW you can run to the druid rings which is behind the roaming cyclops island. But beware, there are A LOT of cyclops on the island. Or you can just gate out if you get enough space.<br><br>As far as selling goes, you can sell to the merchant sister in the main building on sister island when your not attacking any other sisters, or you can sell to the dwarves on the back left corner of the island, you can also sell to the highelf women on the cyclops island. But if your DE then you better get used to zoning into EFP.<br><br>I love hunting at this spot because its private, peaceful and you can jump into the little boats and ride around the ocean when not fighting. But if you get into trouble you can bet your sweet arse you'll most likely die if you don't get out of the zone real quick or get some help. (Being a Mage you get used to dying...It becomes a part of your culture.)  If your not twinked then you better keep on guard at all times when pulling and attacking. I would highly reccomend for all mages to do the pet focus item quests if you have not already done so. I believe that you can get exp from these women untill 34, then it's not worth it. Nice way to make money too! Hope this will help you, It sure helped me.<br><br>Mage of the thirty-ninth summon, Adaiin King.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(42); return false;'>Ocean of Tears mob list</a><br>

The sisters pop real fast. About the time you get done with the last one, the 1st one pops back up and you can keep on killing..Unless you can kill em with 2 hits then youll have to wait a few.... Good place to hunt for Magicians. Though I have hunted here with my Bard,Shaman,Necromancer, and Cleric. Best classes for this place in my opinion would be Mage (With earth pet), Druid, and Shadowknight (Just make sure your buffed if your not twinked)<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>yeah that "princess" that layed the smackdown on your azz is a warrior guild master =0) lol<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
