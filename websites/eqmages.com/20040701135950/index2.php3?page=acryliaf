 <h2><u>Plat Farming in Acrylia Caverns</u></h2><br><br>Guide by Bandoslav Grumsonavitch.</center><br><br><br>AC is an annoying run from PoK - and in Grimling Forest you must run through the caves bypassing a horde of level 30-40ish grimlings which can randomly see invis and beat you down in short order if you aren't wary. Path is PoK-Shar Vahl - Hollowshade Moor - Grimling Forest - Acrylia Caverns. FYI there is a bank & vendors in Grimling Forest at the cat outpost visible from hollowshade zone-in. <br><br>Then, you get to zone into AC and find a level 50+ sanctum xxx mob right where you pop in - also with a chance to see invis. These mobs dbl for 155 and can nuke for over 550hp if casters, and of course CH if healer. And if that's not enough risk for you - any mob in the entire dungeon can randomly see invis (though they are rare). To sum it up - 90% of the time your invis will be seen and you will get beat on a little running through the tunnels in the forrest - pop into AC and immediately get beat on by a very healthy mob - hopefully tank it long enough for the forrest mobs to run away from zone line so you can zone again before you get rooted & DOT'd to death. Or - when you are really lucky and the sanctum see's invis you get to practice summoning your pet while getting hammered. Okay - time to be honest...I've never died here but I have gotten close a couple times. <br><br>Now that you know what it takes simply to get inside - it's not really that bad. I only have 2350hp self buffed but I never bother with getting virtue or anything - just C3, I'd imagine anybody with 2khp can tank long enough to summon your pet. <br><br>Now that you are inside - this is the scoop: Your goal is to clear out the entire zone in area and the first 3 rooms in the 28 minute spawn time. This is aprox 6 roamers that you must always be aware of and keep dead, 10 statics in ritualist area, 11 statics in primalist area and 3 static's in the burrower area. The mobs range from level 45-48 and the named are 50/53. You have Bloodguards (warrior), Painsoothers (male=shaman, female=cleric with CH), deathspeakers (wizards and necro's, no way to tell apart). The mobs don't seem to buff each other, nor do necro's summon pets - and at 65 everything is still aggro but the radius is very small. <br><br>Loot: All mobs drop a random assortment of Etched Acrylia XXX Rune - stackable and some (Wer's) sell for over 5p each. Some only sell for 1p and aren't worth keeping. <br><br>All mobs also randomly drop small pieces, bricks & blocks of acrylia. Use your smithing skill to make pieces from every brick/block because you instead of selling bricks/blocks for 25-35p each, pieces sell for 25p each so you can make more money. Also, bricks of black acrylia which is worthless on my server and at 9g not worth vending. Everybody has smithing mastered right? If not, spend the 45 minutes and 200p it takes to get to 115 skill, refer to eqtraders.com because you'll make that back your first day. <br><br>All mobs also randomly drop Crude Filth Covered XXX weapons - junk but vendors buy for 142p. Only named mobs drop coin and very little at that - so leave your coin purses in the bank and bring nothing but 10-slot WR bags. <br><br>Named: A grimling ritualist drops the metalic grimling bone (150p) as it's common, and acrylia chainmail (7k) as it's rare. (I think it's a shaman but it's never successfully cast a spell for me to be sure, I kill it that fast) <br><br>A grimling primalist drops acrylia chestplate (6k) as common, and grimling skin mask (9k) as it's rare. Both also drop Legend of Lies. (I also think shaman, but same as ritualist it dies before it can channel a spell off thanks in most part to Zebober) <br><br>Now - the critical thing about this place is that you bring the absolute minimal "stuff" and the maximum amount of bag space. The only thing in my bags not looted are malachite, food, water. That leaves 77 loot spots. Ever other space you fill with something else is money lost. <br><br>I use 61 Xegony pet fully equiped with summons - unless you get 5 adds this pet can mow through anything here. If you are that bad of a player and you consistantly get 5 adds, bring Rathe's Son or canipet your heart out. I've never lost a pet here, nor came close, nor had the need to canipet. C3 should be more than enough mana for even those with little or no FT. <br><br>I always run out of loot space within 3 hours, sometimes in only 2 - and start exchanging rune stacks for the weapons when they drop, and the lesser valued runes. If you have a boxed char you can tag along purely for loot, or to run & sell you can make more pp/hour than I can. <br><br>Yes - you read that last paragraph right - I am full in 3 hours or less. Now if you use simple math you can see that if I looted only ore that would be 77 bricks/blocks which will make 150 pieces selling for 25p each: 3750p right there in 3 hours. Exchange some of those bricks for weapons and your assets just jumped a bit. Throw in any loot at all from named and your earnings per hour skyrocket. <br><br>Today is my first day back to work after taking 3 weeks off - which I gamed Mon-Fri from around 8am-12pm CST - 4 hours per day. Of those 15 days played, only two of those had me leaving the dungeon with no named loot. Most days I got loot from both named. Some days I got all loot from both named. And a couple days I got named loot within my first 30 minutes, ran to bank in grimling forest to put in shared slots, ran back and got more loot (these were lucky days). <br><br>In those 3 weeks I accumilated & spent a total of 162kp - over 10k/day average or almost 3k/hr net. Now that average lowers a bit if you factor in the time required to travel to the camp, break down bricks and the 24/7 afk bazaar mule when i wasn't farming. <br><br>Anyways - there it is. My ghetto camp - do not come here expecting xp - I think I got a total of 3 AA during all of this. 20% of mobs are green, and everything but the named are light blue and very low light blue. Xp is pathetic, dismal. <br><br>Most people I've encounted in AC actually go to Inner area to camp the tougher mobs that drop nicer loot - and for the better xp. But, I've found that it takes a very lucky soul camping inner to make more cash/hr v/s the zone in areas. And me, I'm not lucky...I'm ghetto.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(149); return false;'>Acrylia Caverns mob list</a><br>

Well the recepie works but vendors dont buy the pieces for that much any more.<br><br><i><b>Anthe</b> says:</i><br>The intent of breaking bricks & blocks down into small pieces is for selling to players in the bazaar - not to vendors.<br><br><i><b>slackmoz</b> says:</i><br>What you can also do to increase pp, is collect the Pristine Acrylia Shards. Combine 8 and you get a quest item that gives you some exp and 750pp.
You can get the container and summon 7 bags, once you have 8 shards you combine and make an 8th bag.
Now you have one slot worth 750 pp, not bad ;)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2441 for the quest.<br><br><i><b>Jasparjazz</b> says:</i><br>Anyone soloed here around the 56ish lvl?<br><br><i><b>Restless</b> says:</i><br>Acrylia Cavern is a bad place if you get adds, and adds will come the further into the complex you go. A lvl 56 will stand little chance against adds. I would not suggest it, of course you can try and see for yourself..<br><br><i><b>Sunbath</b> says:</i><br>Do you think beastlords can do the same ? and what time spawn on names?<br><br><i><b>Shrikke</b> says:</i><br>Level 55 de sk, can't solo any of the mobs w/o VERY nice buffs and gear, the mob at the zone in is a wanderer that spawns and wanders off, and so far cannot see through invis, and if it does you can zone back out. Everything in the entrance area is dark blu to me. No shard drops in the entrance area. Will post more once I land some help to actually go deeper, not many 50-60 peeps in the ac mostly 65 farmers so far, too bad.<br><br><i><b>Restless</b> says:</i><br>Sunbath, BST:s should not have any problem there as you contrary to Mage´s can slow the mobs.<br><br><i><b>Judeden</b> says:</i><br>My 46 BST can solo AC. Wait just realized something .... the acryla caverns im thinking of is in Eastern Wastes.... dont know of any other and dont understand what your saying up above. <br><br><i><b>Restless</b> says:</i><br>Judeden, your talking about Crystal Caverns, also known as CC..this is AC in Grimling Forest.<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
