 <B><U>Hunting for Cyclops</U></B><BR><BR><br><br>One great plat making method that you don't need to be a massively high level for, seems mostly forgotten nowadays.<BR><BR><br><br>Theres an island full of monsters that can give both awesome exp (amazing for levels 39-45), and a nice supply of light, high cash, vendorable loots: expensive gems, gem set jewelry (even better than the gems), and mithril amulets. The light weight means you can go on hunting for a while, and the plat is instant and reliable (no bazzaring needed). Sounds good right? The only problem is, did I mention you will be killing these?<BR><BR><br><br><IMG SRC="img/1/seafury2.jpg"><BR><BR><br><br>Not so easy. But wait, they aren't as fearsome as they seem, although, whatever you do, don't breathe through your nose while face to face with one.<BR><BR><br><br>Now, some of you might of heard of an Ancient Greek legend about a hero who defeated a cyclops, by taking out its eye? So thats sorted then, easy, right? Unfortunately, no. That method hasn't really been effective since Specsavers brought out their "Oddysius Strength" range of jumbo contacts, beside which, union rules get in the way:<br><br><br><br><I>"..and eye poking in all its forms is prohibited, until such a time as you accept proposition 76.2.1 (giant eye laser-glasses for all Cyclops, or at least cool glasses with dark lenses, like they have on The Matrix)..."</I><BR><BR><br><br>Stupid rules, I know, but Verant gave in, and anyway, the cyclops don't like that kinda trick, and its punishable by a splatting with extreme prejudice. What can ya do? So we'll have to fight them fair, well the first step is to find them.<BR><BR><BR><br><br><br>Heres the boat route from East Freeport docks into the Ocean of Tears, keep checking /loc until your at round about 0,neg6000, then jump off and swim North up to the island. Welcome, to Cyclops Isle!<BR><BR><br><br><IMG SRC="img/1/ootmap.jpg"><BR><BR><br><br>Once your at the island, your method of killing is up to you, but I would reccomend just chaining pets at them. Some other tips include:<BR><BR><br><br> - Keep lev up where possible, cyclopses in the water run as if snared, so you have time to get on top of things or gate/make a dash for freedom.<BR><br> - Things WILL go wrong occasionally, it never hurts to have gate memorised and/or be bound nearby.<br><br> - Pull cyclopses to the outside of the island,since your much more likely to have a peaceful fight, hopefully without adds.<BR><br> - They don't, at least not in my experience, resist much, most things will land on them without a problem.<BR><br> - As far as I know, charm, mez, fear, stun and snare will all work against them. You can use any method ya like to kill these. (Background info's)<BR><BR><BR><br><br><br>But above all, don't underestimate them. They might be fat and look like Homer Simpson, but they can quickly turn violent and start hitting people with people, and if you give them a chance they will gang up on you. Anyways, on to the hazards of the isle!<BR><BR><br><br><B><U>Quag Maelstrom</U></B><BR><BR><br><br>This guy is harder than your average cyclops, level45 and immediately recognizable, because in a suicidal bid to become your next target, he waves around a massive horn for the bard epic. He procs an AoE mana drain and is harder hitting, so make sure you only pull him if you can take him, he wanders cunningly, and he can be quite a painful add! As if thats not bad enough, he sings, maliciously. A tone death 30 foot cyclops with a very loud rumbling voice, and breath that could corrode wood sound fun to you? No? Stay out of his way, and preferably out of earshot, for your sake.<BR><BR><br><br><B><U>Tainted Seafury Cyclops</U></B><BR><BR><br><br>This cyclops looks the same as the others, and is just ever so slightly harder. The problem? Upon his death, your greeted by this guy:<BR><br><IMG SRC="img/1/cseafury.jpg"><BR><BR><br><br>The <A HREF="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5168">Corrupted Seafury Cyclops</A>. A level52 mob for the druid epic who summons and causes immense amounts of pain. He also takes ages to despawn, so whatever you do, don't kill the Tainted Seafury Cyclops! If someone else has been clever enough to release this menace, be really careful to stay well out of his way till he despawns. The Tainted Seafury despawns relatively quickly, but the Corrupted takes ages.<BR><BR><br><br>Anyway, I hope you find this helpful, and hopefully it can bring you lots of exp, and bags of plat. (Leather bags, good reliable ones with dollar signs on it, guaranteed not to split under the weight of your cash, as proved by TV stereotypes everywhere).<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(42); return false;'>Ocean of Tears mob list</a><br>

But Seafury Isle can be severely overcrowded.<br><br><i><b>Ailees</b> says:</i><br>I went soloing a lot in there when young.
Best place is just near GORNIT which is a pirate giant, good to kill because of money.

hunting tips : sit pet at the tree by Gornit, on the sand part. DS can be used. Run with Lev, pull seafury with a long range bolt of low level, and run to pet.
Send pet to attack when seafury almost at sand.
When pet at 22 summon new one and chain.
