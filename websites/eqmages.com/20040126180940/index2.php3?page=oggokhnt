 <h2>Here fatty, fatty fatt... Hunting Ogres</h2><br><br><br>Oggok may not seem like the most obvious exp zone, but it can be quite good.<br><br><br>Like many mage solo spots, the very best thing is to push yourself and go as early as possible, and you can take down the Oggok guards by 39, just use an equipped air pet, and have 2 pet heals memmed incase a situation arises where you need to chaincast and can't wait for the recast time.<br><br>Sometimes you will get a bouncer that is very magic resistant (about 1 in 4), so you will need to be able to rely on pet damage alone.<br><br><br>Single pulls are easy, just stick near the zonein. Don't venture too far, as some NPC's are nasty in this zone.<br><br><br>The cash loots are very nice, and there is a merchant that is always indiff (Bubbgribb) so you can sell them all easily. The cash, as well as the nice rate of exp, are what makes this camp so special.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Comments/Feedback:</u></b><br><br>
