 <h2>Hunting the Revamped Mines of Nurga</h2><br><br><br>Thanks to Norillion for this guide!<br><br><br><br><br></center>Found another great spot, the revamped Mines of Nurga. For those that have been here before, they really did not do much except increase the level of the mobs and add a few roamers. That was enough to make it more worthwhile to farm chardok faction by getting pretty good xp at the same time. I've had the zone to myself on a couple occasions, and I've also been there with as many as 9 people, so still not very crowded. <br><br><font size=+1><b>Getting There</b></font> <br><br>Nurga is in the southern half of the Frontier Mountains. There are two ways I use, both equally perilous. Get a map: http://maps.eq-toolbox.com <br><br>First way is to take the Overthere Stone. Invis and lev, then run straight south to the Frontier Mountains zone. Continue south from the zoneline in FM to the Nurga entrance, watching for giants who can see invis and might be a nuisance. <br><br>Second way is to take the Fironia Vie stone. Invis and lev, then run through the tunnel and zone into the Dreadlands. Once in DL, head Northwest to the Frontier Mountain zone while watching for spiders, giants, and Drolvargs that see invis and will be a nuisance. Once in Frontier Mountains, head West and you will see the entrance to Nurga. <br><br><br><font size=+1><b>Hunting</b></font><br><br>The entrance to Nurga is safe unless a train has just gone through and nothing I have encountered sees invis in this zone. Go for a ways, and there is a waterfall leading down to the mine, with 1 or 2 mobs out front that are lt blue or green to 56. <br><br>The Goblin mobs in this zone fall into a couple key classes, and each has a suffix that I will try to add later. <br>1. Warriors - Straight forward HP kings. Slavedriver, Taskmaster, Overseer. <br>2. Shadowknights - Nasty harm touch to start out a fight, then some strong melee and HP. Suffixes include Life Drinker, Death Knight. <br>3. Rogues - Melee and backstab, if you let them. Decent HP. Suffixes include Stabber, Sneak, Blackguard. <br>4. Necromancer - No pets, but these guys will cast poison and disease-based spells. Pretty nasty, but low HP. Suffixes include Blight Caster. <br>5. Shaman - Casts some nasty shaman spells, and will try to root and malaise a lot. Melees more than other caster goblins, but still has low HP. Suffixes include Spirit Lord, Spirit Caster (anything with spirit, really). <br>6. Wizard - Casts magic, fire, and cold based nukes while trying to root everything in sight. Rarely melees unless oom, and has low HP. Suffixes include Arcane Master, Flame Dancer, and Frost Caller. <br>The various Rats are all warriors that I've seen, and have melee/HP comparable to the Goblin warriors. Some rats also have a strong disease DoT. <br><br>Respawn time on all mobs is roughly 18 minutes. Drops include salts and skins for chardok faction quest, a few rubies, diamonds, and fire emeralds, and about 6pp each in coin. Named can spawn just about anywhere, and drop some decent tradable loot. <br><br>Melee mobs, especially the shadowknights, are the hardest. It usually takes 2 Earth pets or 1 air or water/1 earth to finish them off. Casters, on the other hand, are cake if you have decent resist gear. Send an air pet against them, and wait. Most fights, my single air pet ends the fight with 90% or higher HP because no spell landed. I have 175+ in Fire, Cold, and Magic with buffs, and 80+ Poison and Disease with gear, and only the occasional Poison spell lands. <br><br>I've divided up the zone into different levels based on what I've seen. There seems to be 4 tiers when it comes to mob strength. <br>Image removed - PM me if you need it <br><br>Area 1 <br>This is my preferred place to hunt, and are what I consider Tier 2 mobs. Goblins are far apart, and everything is dark blue. The mobs in this area melee for 111-120, and warrior mobs have about 6khp with casters having about 4k. There are only 2 wanderers and they are fairly predictable. Mobs include: <br>A Goblin Stabber - Rogue <br>A Goblin Arcane Master - Wizard <br>A Goblin Slave Driver - Warrior <br>A Goblin Life Stealer - Shadowknight (500hp HT) <br>A Goblin Spirit Caller - Shaman <br>A Goblin Blight Caster - Necromancer <br>A Viscious Mine Rat - Warrior w/Strong Disease DoT <br><br>At the top of the ramp is a pool with 3 mobs that can be single pulled. The mob closest to the ramp is a placeholder for Stabber Remmy, who is no tougher than any other rogue mob. I've killed this guy 3 times. Twice, I've gotten: <br><b>Golden Mantle of Control <br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM <br>Slot: SHOULDERS <br>AC: 8 <br>DEX: +5 CHA: +5 INT: +5 HP: +25 <br>MANA: +25 <br>Recommended level of 40. <br>WT: 1.6 Size: SMALL <br>Class: NEC WIZ MAG ENC <br>Race: ALL</b><br><br>And once an actual upgrade dropped: <br><b>Silk Gloves of the Night <br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM <br>Slot: HANDS <br>AC: 6 <br>DEX: +6 STA: +3 CHA: +3 INT: +6 <br>HP: +15 MANA: +30 <br>Recommended level of 40. <br>WT: 0.5 Size: TINY <br>Class: NEC WIZ MAG ENC <br>Race: ALL</b><br><br><br>Area 2 <br>These are the Tier 1 entrance mobs, and are all lt blue or green at 56. Lots of space between mobs, and 2 or 3 wanderers. Probably good hunting in the high 40s. <br><br>Area 3 <br>These are the Tier 3 mobs. More HP, higher melee damage, and better spells. The melee I've encountered here needed about 3 pets to finish + 1 char. Casters were tougher, but still did not penetrate my resists. Pretty safe area because of the two zone lines to escape to. <br><br>Area 4 <br>Tier 4 mobs. Very tough to solo at 56. Took on a shadowknight mob in the back. Harm touched pet for over 700, melee for 160, and took about 5 pets to finish off. Took on a shaman mob who did more melee than tier 2-3, and took 2 pets to finish off. Also managed to get off some nasty dots on the pet and blood boil on me. <br><br>I also got greedy here when I found a named overseer (Overseer Pruckib -level 50 warrior) sitting where I could probably single pull after clearing 2 mobs. Pulled an ordinary overseer first, and it took 3 air pets, 1 earth pet, 2 char, and 2 Scars to drop. Next I pulled a Flame Dancer (wizard). He managed to land one fire nuke on me through about 180 FR, and towards the end nailed me with bonds of force through 190 MR. 3 Air pets and 1 char took him out. Canni back to full and pulled Pruckib, who was no harder than the first Overseer. All he dropped was a stupid key for a ring event involving the slaves. <br><br><br><br><br>_________________ <br><br>XP was decent. For the tier 2 mobs, about 1% normal xp per 2-3 kills, and about 1-2% AA per kill. Not as safe as some other spots because of the occasional roamers and a few close pull areas. Fights are pretty exciting because of the random nature of the casters. <br><br>I will try to add some of the suffixes in later when I can write them down. Otherwise, let me know if you have any corrections or additions. <br><br><br>And FYI - I found all the old Nurga mobs. In frontier mountains, directly west of Nurga entrance, is a small cave system. Inside were all the mobs I recognized from old Nurga. Same level, all green, and gave DiZok faction and dropped skins and salts. Also came across Chief Rokgus who has some OK loot and is lt blue<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(88); return false;'>The Mines of Nurga mob list</a><br>

At zi and at the first encounters all mobs are LB but still offers good xp (12% xp bonus in zone)Further in i encountered DB mobs that was just as easy to dispatch, will go back there with a friend as there are no shortage on mobs there =)<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I solo here quite a bit - am lvl 53 and find it quite easy to do the entrance mobs, but don't venture much further.  I noticed since the latest patch that the mobs now cast FEAR.  Very disturbing.  Pull with Lava Bolt - u should hit for about 50% of the hp (rarely misses), then send in pet.  This way u can easily pull singles.  With the bonus exp in this zone I get approx. 0.5% per kill.<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
