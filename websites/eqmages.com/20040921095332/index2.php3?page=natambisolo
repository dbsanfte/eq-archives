 <h2>GoD: Soloing in Natambi</h2><br><br>Natambi is a fairly good solo zone for mages, thanks to <i>Izzadan</i> of Rodcet Nife for contributing this mob list. These were written from the perspective of a level61 mage using WoX pet.</center><br><br>1) <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14223">A Hynid Fleshripper</a> - Very easy to be soloed by me. i would say max hit for them is 235 to 170 ish and have about 7-8k hps. (they tend to take 61 pet down to about half health with one TER thrown in).<br><br>2) <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14491">A Feirce Cragwalker</a> - Be warned, do not attempt with out a slower (<i>Or Planar Renewal - Ed</i>), i had to chain cast about 4 air pets (61 air pet) and eventually killed him. Nice loot as well, a 3int spell haste 3 item on him. (Same goes for a furious)<br><br>3) <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14222">A Turepta Cragwalker</a> - Also easy to solo, max hit about 180, though doubles for 175 most of the time.<br><br>4) <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14225">A Noc Darklurch</a> - Bad, i couldnt solo these as they hit for about 250ish and have a mean 550 DD proc that goes off A LOT. I did however duo with a 62 shaman and we owned these suckers real easy.<br><br>5) We also popped <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14229">Kyv Heartpeircer</a> (named arrow guy) a few times while fighting there. Max hit about 520ish, same proc as most of the other mobs in zone. He fires arrows that can either snare you, drain your mana, and i forgot the other proc. He wasnt to tough of a fight for me and the 62 shammy, once slowed he he was as good as erudite MEAT. 61 AIR pet tanked him very well. It was buffed by the shammy and healed about 4 times in fight by him, I also threw in about 6 TER heals for my pet. Once he is below 40%, nuke him and he will die real fast. He dropped a nice sword that sells for about 10-12k.<br><br>6) <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14226">A Restless Soul</a> - Mobs at the ruins accross the river from camp, these aren't so easy. They can tear my pet apart in lil over 20 seconds. I've not tried nuking 'em to death though. They hit for about 240 ish and have a proc.<br><br>Well thats it from me for now, oh and  remember, dont aggro the <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14213">Cragbeast Queen</a>, she hits hard (4k) and runs very fast!<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(237); return false;'>Natimbi - The Broken Shores mob list</a><br>

thnx<br><br><i><b>Fayline Fyrecat</b> says:</i><br>Good start Izz, and thanks.  One thing I would like to add is in regards to the underwater spawns.  I soloed from 59.2 to 60 in this zone, and since the turtles (turepta) and shore stonemites are on a relatively slow timer, I would summon up a water stone and head below in the straight in front of the camp.  There are about 6 to 8 static spawns of crustaceans, swordfish, and squid (I'm at work, mob names escape me atm).  All underwater spawns, turtles, hynids, and stonemites are in the DB/LB range at 59-60, and I was getting 1% reg exp per 3 kills at 59; and just under double that amount at 60.  The turtles and crustaceans (normal mobs) have been known to drop a FT neck piece and a melee equivalent Aura of Courage(?) piece, the latter I was lucky enough to loot myself.  Last tidbit of info; fishing is a worthwhile past-time while medding, as the fish/crabs you catch sell for an average of 2pp each depending on their weight.  Enjoy!

<br><br><i><b>izzadan</b> says:</i><br>thanx for posting fay.
Indeed, most mobs in zone drop the FT 1 neck item and aura of courage (shell inlaid collar i think) i havnt been in the river to hunt just yet but will for sure soon, i believe that the reef crustations drop the FT 1 and aura of courge items most commonly.maybe? any way i will have an update about EXP/AA Exp very soon and about any other mobs.

thnx an dill get back soon. 
<br><br><i><b>Danille from Ayonae Ro</b> says:</i><br>Good post on this zone.

Soul camp is a decent one as a 65 mage with Planar Renewal, Air pet focused with BO5/MoR can take the entire camp with no problem. There is one double pull but if you just send in HoE and burn the targeted one down you will have no problems.

The rest of the mobs in this zone with the exception of the Cragbeast Queen are also soloable by a 65 Mage. Dark Blue mobs offer 2% AA exp per kill.

Decent drops too. FT neck piece and a few HP and Mana AUGs.<br><br><i><b>Mazzroth Hellfury</b> says:</i><br>This is kind of an odd question, just wasn't sure where the best place to post it would be so I figured this particle area of the site would get the most hits. I'm currently working on a mage, 28th lvl at the moment, and plan to be post 50 in the next two weeks or so. I was curious if anyone out there would be willing to help me with planar flags and the likes. I'm currently in an almost dead guild, that I don't see that happening soon, though I don't want to leave the guild because the ones that are still active are really great people and I enjoy playing with them. If anyone can or would be willing to help would be awesome, I play on the Tunare server.<br><br><i><b>Restless</b> says:</i><br>Mazzroth, are you on something or are you just a noob?

Learn the game first, then if your going to post moronic stuff, add a smilie at the end so we know your joking.. =)

<br><br><i><b>izzadan</b> says:</i><br>should not have posted that here  mazzroth, as this is not a post about planer progresion. This, as i think you can see? is a post about natimbi and a bit of information about the zone. look befor you post. read them and then if it is relevent to the post, by all means post as much as you want.<br><br><i><b>izzadan</b> says:</i><br>check the mage forums, you will find every thing and any thing in there about our lovely class..hehe<br><br><i><b>Raiistlin</b> says:</i><br>I am a 57 mage with about 6% in to lvl would it be ok to try this area out fora soloing  mind u have all my spells up to lvl 57 ( minus 56 summon muzzle) just trying to look fora good spot and it seems this would be good if i have my 60+ pets ????  I also play on RN .
<br><br><i><b>Izzadan</b> says:</i><br>At 57, i think you should be able to do it. 
Im not sure when they are going to revamp it as such. (I dont think they have done it yet?) Al tho it mayb hard. All you can do is give it a shot, i suggest you try the turtles first as they run as if they are snared, so if in need of a gate you will have plenty of time. also try the little lizards things there. (forgot name) they should be fairly easy and with the pet upgrade could make a bit of difference..Only thing i fear is there proc. 500 dmg can hurt.

So all i can say is give it a shot!. 

So you play on rodcet hey? Will have to send ya a tel or send me one if im on. we can get together some time. Im grinding my way to 65 atm hehe. Also i suggest ya buy muzzle. +11% haste is not to bad. <br><br><i><b>Izzadan</b> says:</i><br>At 57, i think you should be able to do it.

Summon a bunch of water breathing stones unless you have an EB item.

Just enter the water and hunt Reef Crusteans and Saltwater Longnose (looks like a swordfish).

Fight the mobs at their spot - will get no adds.

Reef Crusteans are slow hitters and easy, however longnoses hit hard and also backstabs so if all things go bad, dont try to outswim it, just gate. - Earthpet preferred here, no other pet can take that damage in your level.

Both mobs can drop the Talisman with manareg +1 =)<br><br><i><b>Restless</b> says:</i><br>Actually soloing even turtles at 57 is hard, 1 turtle took 80-90 % of my mana, however there are mobs in zone not listed here (yet) that will be owned by you.

With regards to my lvl 53 water pet, I have accomplished this with Malosi,Pet heals, Nukes. Had to be very cautious to pull turtle into camp for fight, to avoid adds. Yeah, the fight lasts awhile, but one turtle takes about 40% of mana, while atop of mount the whole time. Also had pet loaded with pet toys and my Burnout IV with Haste from any nearby chanter. Usually have 1-2 resists, so watch aggro carefully. Good Luck :)<br><br><i><b>Taishici 62 Arch Mage</b> says:</i><br>I honestly have to say I've stayed in natimbi for quite a while. Even as I am a 62 mage I still get good exp with little to no effort and all the mobs are still at least lb to me. Also although the dark lurches are hard to kill they are very doable at my level. I just pull with malosini and send pet I use the Ward and heal 3 times land sun vortex and watch the mofo die. Also I fully gear my pet with weaps haste and belt. And also there are those nasty matruq warfiends which are pretty much the same as the darklurches but also have another proc that my pet got hit by. These guys output some serious damage and would be better to fight with a shammy at your side. There are also acouple of other named in there not mentioned above.1.)Swift Scavenger 2.)Tumia Lehio and 3.)Vimidon. If you are carefull and have full mana and virtue on both u and your pet then any of these creatures are soloable.<br><br><i><b>Taishici 62 Arch Mage</b> says:</i><br>^edit from last post^ the spell is sun storm that i used not sun vortex.<br><br><i><b>Izzadan</b> says:</i><br>Vimidon is possibly the easiest of the named solo. We had a 65 berzerker with us but he went down in a matter of 10 seconds. Tumia Lehio is fairly hard and u must chain cast your to pet heals PR and TER. she/he hits for max of 340ish. same with most other named type mobs. <br><br><i><b>Izzadan</b> says:</i><br>one thing to look out if your not 64+ is look at who YOU TARGET!! ive done thios a few times with my druid and have kilelde him:) you think u target a normal cragwalker when infact uve targeted a fierce cragwalker:) so be carefull!!

Mustags warfiends (sorry bout spelling) are fairly hard as well, there doable but have a nasty proc that lands very ofteni usually end up hlave a bar of mana left. 4.4k mana pool here (sucky i know) <br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
