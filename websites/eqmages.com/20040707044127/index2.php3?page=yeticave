 <h2>The Yeti Cave in the Dreadlands</h2><br><br><br>The "Tundra Yetis" live in a cave in the NorthWest corner of the Dreadlands. These Yeti's are amazing exp, and are well suited to mages.<br><br><br>I would encourage people to go there as early as possible, in fact, if you got some decent buffs and got toys/buffs for your pet, a really good mage with pet focus items and a nice mana pool can do these as early as 29, and the exp will be AMAZING if you can do them that low!<br><br>However, if its too tough at 29 wait for your 34 spells and come back. I would reccomend the fire pet, its damage shield is fantastic. Pull Yetis and sick the pet on them, nuke and heal. The exp will fly by!<br><br>You don't want to leave (and risk losing) this camp unless you have to, and grouping here is crazy, you can solo everything as a mage.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(75); return false;'>The Dreadlands mob list</a><br>

Whatever you do, make sure you DS your pet first. Air pet should be less downtime, but mobs would be less of a challenge with earth pet (has so much hp that the DS damage alone should go quite a lot of way towards wasting it, also root makes safer if goes bad).<br><br><i><b>Chizy</b> says:</i><br>Torv Server

I lived in these caves, they are really easy to drop, nice exp.. and on my server, hardly no one was around them..<br><br><i><b>Wicc Vanwinkle</b> says:</i><br>L34 the Air pet with a Fire Shield is better for it's higher damage mitigation and much higher hp regen, at L39 the new Fire pet (as all L39 pets do) gets a much needed increase in HP regen and it can now easily handle the Yetis...<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I think this is good for mages from what i  here. this sounds well suted to the mage.   P.S. MAGE"S ALL THE WAY!!!!! <br><br><i><b>Fonalrono</b> says:</i><br>I just got my mage 39 last night in Gunthak Pling, how many yeti are there, enough to constantly pull 5 or 6??<br><br><i><b>Kaileyah</b> says:</i><br>If I remember correctly, I milked them yeti's till 46.  I got a 10 dose sow potion and ran back and forth from the two caves while I waited for the one I was just leaving to pop up again.  It was constant great exp, and even when they were LB they were still better than grouping or soloing somewhere else that required a lot of mana.  After that was through there is a cave in the middle of the snow area where there are higher yetis and you can kill them till about 50 but after that there are better zones for better exp like PoP.  I believe I leveled once every 4 hours of running back and forth.  Sometimes twice a day when I played long hours.  Good times!<br><br><i><b>Ranlgon</b> says:</i><br>Yeti's are great for soloing. They have a very low agro range. Two can be standing side by side and you can pull singles with no problem. The only problem is with the yeti's that roam. They usually take the same routes so they are easy to avoid. Just need to be aware of them in case you are on their path and have your back to them. They give good exp and fair loot. At higher levels it is easy to clear 5 or 6 of them and have a fair wait for them to respawn. At this time you might run between the different cave areas and clear them as you go. There is a cave by the mountain giant fort that has glacier yeti's that are of a higher lvl. I did this group at lvl 44 and they beatable but tough.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Well im a 29 Mag and I just got my pet focus and was hoping i could do this and amazlingly I CAN !!!! Yeah!!<br><br><i><b>Eldrith</b> says:</i><br>You sure you can do this at level 29?  Leveled 29 last night.  29 Fire Pet w/focus 2 Fists of Ixiblat, Belt of Maki'kot, Muzzle of Mardu and a full set of Summoned Chain.  And My pet got spanked.  Even with me Nuking for all I'm worth.  Casting Malaise is a waist of mana, cause it never sticks and cosequently my spells never hit for 100%.  
I was able to kill 1 red, but it took forever to med back up.  I don't think this is advisable for level 29..  maybe 34, definitly by 39.  
29 is just too low  (might work if you chain cast pets, but I hate doing that)<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
