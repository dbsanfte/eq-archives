 <h2><u>Soloing dwarves and elves in OOT</u></h2></center><br><br><b><u>Why only evils?</u></b><br><br>This underutilized camp in Ocean of Tears is only for<br>those who don't really care about killing some serious<br>faction in exchange for steady, uninterrupted<br>experience. It's quiet, remote, and often you have the<br>entire zone to yourself, though occasionally you have<br>to deal with /oocs from people arguing about Gornit,<br>the seafuries, or the AC.<br><br>However, don't ever expect to go to Kaladim or the<br>good elven lands and be welcome. Here are all the<br>factions you slaughter by doing this camp:<br><br>Killing dwarves:<br>- Kaladim Citizen (guards in Butcherblock still OK -<br>just don't go in Kaladim anymore)<br><br>Killing green Sisters of Erollisi, named sisters such<br>as Antimine and Tegea Prendyn:<br>- Clerics of Tunare (Felwithe clerics, paladins, some<br>guards)<br>- Faydark's Champions (Kelethin rangers and merchants)<br>- King Tearis Thex (various Felwithe inhabitants,<br>including some guards)<br>- Soldiers of Tunare (Kelethin druids)<br>(raises Crushbone Orcs, if you even care)<br><br>There are also two low level pirates named Dayle<br>Jornin and Zyle Bensmill, who have huge aggro radiuses<br>and will attack without provocation:<br>- Pirates of Gunthak<br>(raises Firiona Vie)<br><br><br><b><u>Prepare for camp</u></b><br><br>You need to take the boat from East Freeport. If you<br>are KOS in East Freeport, you will need to invis<br>yourself to the dock. It's not a bad idea to bind<br>yourself on the dock in case of a CR. Even if you are<br>KOS, you are safe at the very end of the dock.<br><br>If you want to bind in OOT, there are a few safe spots<br>on Sister Island. However, you will have to take the<br>boat all the way to Butcherblock to get out of the<br>zone, or go to Brother Island and pick up the boat<br>there. Both will require invisibility, because after<br>killing the elves, neither the Brothers nor the<br>Sisters will like you very much.<br><br>SoW potions are helpful here, especially once you have<br>started killing the sisters along with the dwarves.<br><br>If you are not KOS to the elves initially (and you<br>soon will be, so don't get used to this), you can just<br>wait until the boat docks at Sister Island and<br>disembark. However, if you are KOS to the elves, you<br>will need to jump off the boat when you see the island<br>off the right side of the boat (north). Swim to the<br>eastern shore and you will see plenty of spots where<br>you can get on dry land and make a pet in relative<br>peace.<br><br><br><b><u>What's good about this camp?</u></b><br><br>The experience here is not super fast -- not as fast<br>as some other camps. However, it's quiet, with plenty<br>of safe places to sit and med for very steady<br>experience with little to no competition. The spawn<br>you will be hunting -- two dwarves and two named<br>sisters -- are spaced out so there is very little<br>chance of adds. The green Sisters of Erollisi will<br>generally not attack you unless you are right on top<br>of them, and even then they are an easy kill.<br><br><br><b><u>Pets for this camp</b></u><br><br>I used the earth pet because everything here runs (and<br>runs fast) and root becomes important. There are a few<br>EXTREMELY nasty mobs on this island that will add if<br>your targets run out of control, so you want to keep<br>them nailed down whenever possible. Of course, use<br>Burnout and shield of flame, and load your pet with<br>summoned goodies.<br><br><br><b><u>Strategy for the dwarves</u></b><br><br>Your first targets are going to be two dwarves, a male<br>named Hugan Tunbin (level 25) who spawns near the<br>shore, and a female named Elona Tunbin (level 24), who<br>spawns nearby near a stone monument. DO NOT CONFUSE<br>THEM WITH THE DWARVES THAT SPAWN ON THE WEST SHORE.<br>Those are all male, there are 3 of them, and one of<br>them, Glendl Vargnus, will clean your clock -- he's<br>level 45 and NOT to be messed with at this time.<br><br>The Tunbins are located on the northeast part of<br>Sister Island and are on about a six-minute spawn.<br>They are warriors, mildly magic resistant, and<br>supremely stupid. As a human Innoruuk worshipping<br>mage, I was dubious to them when I started, and after<br>three levels of killing them, I was still dubious.<br>Although they ruin Kaladim Citizen faction by killing<br>them, they don't seem to be on that faction<br>themselves, so as far as I can tell you can kill them<br>indefinitely under those circumstances and they won't<br>aggro you first.<br><br>Both can easily be killed in place, although I<br>recommend getting malaise on them as early as you can<br>manage it so your pet's root sticks. They seemed<br>slightly less resistant to the Blade line of nukes<br>than to the fire line.<br><br>The one thing you need to be careful of with Elona<br>Tunbin is that both Dayle Jornin and Zyle Bensmill<br>(male wood elf pirates) spawn fairly close by. These<br>are low level (16-20) but they have a huge aggro<br>radius and will attack on sight, running from<br>surprisingly long distances to do so. They usually<br>spawn west and a little north of Elona. If you see one<br>of them up, send the pet to get him out of the way<br>first so he doesn't add and interrupt your spells.<br>They're not tough, but they can be annoying. You can<br>also try pulling Elona due south a bit and that will<br>usually keep the pirates from adding.<br><br>The Tunbins drop small amounts of cash, occasional<br>research items (mostly necro words or runes), dwarf<br>blood, and dwarf meat.<br><br><br><b><u>Strategy for elves</u></b><br><br>For the most part, you can ignore the wandering<br>Sisters of Erollisi and mostly they will ignore you.<br>They are low level (9-13) but they do drop some spell<br>components, wood elf parts, elf blood, heavy large<br>halberds (leave or destroy) and purity belts, which<br>sell back for about 2pp each. Of course, there is no<br>merchant in this zone who will deal with you, either.<br><br>Once you've gotten the hang of the dwarf camp and you<br>have a lot of time you're sitting around doing<br>nothing, it's time to add in a named Sister or two.<br>There are really only two you are going to have time<br>to do, and only two that are really safe to pull.<br><br>Run south and then west along the shore of the island<br>until you can just see the village. You will see a<br>large tree and then just beyond it a female half-elf<br>in silver chain. Have your pet /guard here at the<br>tree, and then run and fetch the elf, bringing her<br>back to the tree. Her name is Antinime, she is level<br>22-24, and she will screw your elf faction royally.<br>She is also a melee, does not cast, and is somewhat<br>magic resistant. She drops purity belts, wood elf<br>parts, elven blood, and the occasional rusty weapon.<br><br>Kill Antinime fairly quickly if you can. If you have<br>the resources for it, your next kill is Tegea Prendyn.<br><br>This is a trickier pull and MUST be done carefully or<br>else you will get two other named sisters with her<br>from nearby. If you're really unlucky, you'll get even<br>more.<br><br>Tegea Prendyn stands on the end of the dock. Follow<br>the edge of the water until you're in range of Tegea;<br>you'll have to go very close to dock to get this<br>close. Pull her with malaise and then run back,<br>CAREFULLY, right along the edge of the water to path<br>her through the water and onto the shore. If she paths<br>through the village, you might as well gate.<br><br>Once Tegea Prendyn is to your pet, it's just a routine<br>kill. Like Antinime, she is not a caster. She's level<br>25 and hits a bit harder than Antinime, though her<br>drops are pretty much the same.<br><br>By this time, you should be able to run back to the<br>dwarves, and mana permitting, start that pull, or have<br>a few minutes to med a little and rebuff your pet for<br>the next round. By the time the dwarves are both dead,<br>Antinime should have respawned and you can do this as<br>many times as your mana permits.<br><br>...Csimene, Human Mage of Innoruuk<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(42); return false;'>Ocean of Tears mob list</a><br>
