Usually it's better to just buy weight reducing bags.<br><br><a name="3"></a><b>Innate Stamina</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base STA by 2 per level.<br>Marginally useful for magicians. At level 65 with 5 points in this skill, this increase only amounts to a maximum 26 hit points without Natural Durability.<br><br><a name="4"></a><b>Innate Agility</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base AGI by 2 per level.<br>Minor usefulness to magicians, due to already low midigation abilities.<br><br><a name="5"></a><b>Innate Dexterity</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base DEX by 2 per level.<br>Slightly helpful to magicians. DEX is used in conjunction with channeling skill, and every bit of DEX helps increase channeling success.<br><br><a name="6"></a><b>Innate Intelligence</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base INT by 2 per level.<br>Useful for magicians with little to no access to INT gear, but useless if already at cap. With level 65 and more than 200 INT with 5 points in this skill, this amounts to 65 more mana. With less than 200 INT, this amounts to 130 mana.<br><br><a name="7"></a><b>Innate Wisdom</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base WIS by 2 per level.<br>Useless for magicians, as wisdom has no relevance to magicians.<br><br><a name="8"></a><b>Innate Charisma</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base CHA by 2 per level.<br>Useful for extra saves with Call of the Arch Mage and Elemental Silence. Also helps to decrease vendor prices. However, it's usually better to buy Charisma gear than purchase this ability.<br><br><a name="9"></a><b>Innate Fire Protection</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base Fire Resistance by 2 per level.<br>Useful to help save versus fire based spells.<br><br><a name="10"></a><b>Innate Cold Protection</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base Cold Resistance by 2 per level.<br>Useful to help save versus cold based spells.<br><br><a name="11"></a><b>Innate Magic Protection</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base Magic Resistance by 2 per level.<br>Useful to help save versus magic based spells.<br><br><a name="12"></a><b>Innate Poison Protection</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base Poison Resistance by 2 per level.<br>Useful to help save versus poison based spells. This is particularly useful, since there are few magician usable items with saves versus Poison.<br><br><a name="13"></a><b>Innate Disease Protection</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base Disease Resistance by 2 per level.<br>Useful to help save versus disease based spells. This is particularly useful, since there are few magician usable items with saves versus Disease.<br><br><a name="14"></a><b>Innate Run Speed</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases innate run speed by 10% per level.<br>Highly useful for all classes, especially solo magicians. This run speed does not stack with run speed spells such as Spirit of Wolf; rather run speed spells overwrite this ability. Marginally useful outdoors because of that, but highly useful indoors unless Spirit of the Shrew is available.<br><br><a name="15"></a><b>Innate Metabolism</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1<br>Decreases food consumption by 10, 25, and 50%.<br>While mages can already summon food and drink in unlimited quantities, sometimes player-made Stat food (such as Misty Thicket Picnics) will be desired. This also significantly decreases food consumption of horses and drogmors (which inherently increases food consumption dramatically).<br><br><a name="16"></a><b>Innate Lung Capacity</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases air capacity by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<br>Almost useless for magicians, since magicians have the ability to summon Waterstones which grant Enduring Breath to the user.<br><br><a name="17"></a><b>First Aid</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases the Bind Wound cap by 10% per level.<br>Marginally useful for solo magicians, since bandaging forces one to not meditate. However it is quite useful for bandaging other players who are low on health.<br><br><a name="18"></a><b>New Tanaan Crafting Mastery</b><br>Level 51<br>3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3<br>Allows more than one tradeskill to exceed 200.<br>While useless for most, for the tradeskill fanatics this is a dream come true. This allows players to reach 250 skill in all 7 major tradeskills: Baking, Brewing, Fletching, Jewelcraft, Pottery, Smithing, and Tailoring.<br><br><a name="19"></a><b>Innate Regeneration</b><br>Level 51<br>1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases innate HP regeneration by 1 point per level.<br>This is most ideal for soloing where magicians do not have access to healing spells, but has utility elsewhere as well. With Level 65 and 3 points in this ability, a magician will completely negate the effects of a Rod of Mystical Transevergence while buffless, sitting and standing.<br><br><a name="20"></a><size=18>Archetype Abilities</size><br><br><a name="21"></a><b>Spell Casting Mastery</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases mana saved through specialization.<br>This ability is one of the most powerful abilities magicians have access to. At level 1, 2.5% mana is saved from all spells. At level 2, 5% is saved. At level 3, 10% mana is saved. This stacks with innate specialization and mana preservation effects.<br><br><a name="22"></a><b>Spell Casting Fury</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases chance to perform critical nukes to 2%, 4%, and 7%.<br>With level 1, spells have a 2% chance to perform a 33% critical blast. At level 2, spells have a 4% chance to perform 66% critical blasts. At level 3, spells will do double damage 7% of the time. Over time this ability will provide a significant increase in magician DPS.<br><br><a name="23"></a><b>Channeling Focus</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases channeling abilities by 5%, 10%, and 15%.<br>This increases the chance for a magician to take hits and continue to channel spells on the attacker. This is most useful for the solo magician and very marginal use in groups or raids.<br><br><a name="24"></a><b>Spell Casting Subtlety</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Decreases spell aggro by 5%, 10%, and 20%.<br>Highly useful for all magicians. Allows a magician to "chainnuke" longer than he normally could before gaining undesired aggro.<br><br><a name="25"></a><b>Spell Casting Expertise</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Removes the chance to fizzle on spells below level 20, 35, and 52.<br>Only minor use for magicians, since most high level magicians rarely cast low level spells.<br><br><a name="26"></a><b>Spell Casting Deftness</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Reduces cast time on beneficial spells with cast times greater than 4 seconds by 5%, 15%, and 25%.<br>Decreases the cast time on buff spells, and stacks with spell haste items. Marginally useful for magicians, since magicians have very few buff spells.<br><br><a name="27"></a><b>Natural Durability</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases HP from STA and items by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<br>This increases the HP granted from a magicians STA and from +HP on items. At level 3 a 10STA 100HP item will actually be seen as a 11STA 110HP item. No matter how you look at it, more HP is very important, and its something you can never have enough of.<br><br><a name="28"></a><b>Combat Stability</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increase melee midigation by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<br>Most useful for the solo magician since one should rarely get hit on raids and groups.<br><br><a name="29"></a><b>Combat Agility</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases melee avoidance by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<br>Highly useful for all mages. Less hits means less heals, and less hits means a greater chance of survival.<br><br><a name="30"></a><b>Mental Clarity</b><br>Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<br>2 / 4 / 6<br>Increases base mana regeneration by 1 point per level.<br>This increases base mana regeneration, and stacks with all forms of mana regeneration. Mental Clarity 1 is relatively cheap. However Mental Clarity 2 and 3 are considered expensive.<br><br><a name="31"></a><size=18>Class Abilities</size><br><br><a name="32"></a><b>Mass Group Buff</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>9<br>Reuse Time: 72 minutes<br>Allows for group buffs to be cast on all players within range of the spell. Also doubles the cost of the spell.<br>Almost useless for magicians, since the only three spells that can be used are group damage shields. However on some fights this can mean the difference between success and failure.<br><br><br><a name="33"></a><b>Mend Companion</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>5<br>Reuse Time: 36 minutes<br>Allows Magicians to perform a Lay-On-Hands type ability for their pets.<br>At level 65, this ability does 2146 hp worth of healing. Highly useful for soloing. Reuse time can be further decreased by the PoP ability Hasted Mend.<br><br><a name="34"></a><b>Frenzied Burnout</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>6<br>Reuse Time: 72 minutes (?)<br>Duration: 36 seconds<br>Increases pet haste dramatically, and allows the pet to perform flurries and rampages.<br>Almost useless for magicians, but can provide a short increase in pet damage, and could mean the difference between victory and defeat.<br><br><a name="35"></a><b>Elemental Form: Fire</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3 / 6 / 9<br>Cast Time: 8 seconds<br>Duration: 36 minutes<br>Reuse Time: 15 minutes<br>Turns the magician into a fire elemental, granting 10, 20, and 30 points of damage shield, as well as 10, 20, and 30 INT.<br>Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful for indoors. This is the most useless elemental form.<br><br><a name="36"></a><b>Elemental Form: Water</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3 / 6 / 9<br>Cast Time: 8 seconds<br>Duration: 36 minutes<br>Reuse Time: 15 minutes<br>Turns the magician into a water elemental, granting enduring breath and increasing mana regeneration by 1, 2, and 4 points per level.<br>Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful for indoors and underwater.<br><br><a name="37"></a><b>Elemental Form: Earth</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3 / 6 / 9<br>Cast Time: 8 seconds<br>Duration: 36 minutes<br>Reuse Time: 15 minutes<br>Turns the magician into an earth elemental, granting 5, 10, and 20 STA as well as 50, 100, and 200. HP<br>Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful indoors.<br><br><a name="38"></a><b>Elemental Form: Air</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3 / 6 / 9<br>Cast Time: 8 seconds<br>Duration: 36 minutes<br>Reuse Time: 15 minutes<br>Turns the magician into an air elemental, granting levitation and increasing all resists by 10, 20, and 40.<br>Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Useless in zones where levitation does not work. Quite useful for area effect battles, where resists are the key to survival.<br><br><a name="39"></a><b>Improved Reclaim Energy</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3<br>Alters the formula to Reclaim Energy<br>Changes the formula to Reclaim Energy to return 95% of the mana used to summon the pet. This considers all forms of mana preservation present on the mage at the time the pet is summoned. Normal  Reclaim Energy is only 75%.<br><br><a name="40"></a><b>Turn Summoned</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>5<br>Reuse Time: 72 minutes (?)<br>Allows magicians to cast an area effect Fear + DoT on summoned creatures, centered around the magician.<br>Almost useless, since very few areas have large quantities of summoned creatures. Furthermore, the spell is resistable, and can have high resists.<br><br><a name="41"></a><b>Elemental Pact</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>5<br>Eliminates the consumption of malachite when summoning pets.<br>Removes the malachite cost of summoning pets, but does not remove the need to carry malachite; at least one must be carried at all times. Worth noting that Servant of Marr, Child of Ro, and Rathe's Son do not consume malachite, reducing the value of this AA.<br><br><a name="42"></a><b>Pet Discipline</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>6<br>Allows a magician to execute a /pet hold command, forcing the pet to stop attacking until told to attack.<br>By far one of the magicians most powerful abilities, this removes most liability with using a pet by allowing the mage to control when to attack. Highly useful for the raid mage, but still useful for both the solo and the group mage.<br><br><a name="43"></a><b>Quick Summoning</b><br>Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<br>3 / 6 / 9<br>Decreases cast time on summons (pets and items) by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<br>Highly useful for Call of the Hero, and highly useful for chaining pets. Worth noting that spell haste is capped at 50%, which Quick Summoning 3 reaches.<br><br><a name="44"></a><size=18>PoP Advancement</size><br><br><a name="45"></a><b>Advanced Innate Strength</b><br>Level 61 / 61 / 62 / 62 / 63 / 63 / 64 / 64 / 65 / 65 - Innate Strength 5<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base STR by 2 per level.<br>Only useful for magicians if encumberance is an issue. Usually it's better to just buy weight reducing bags.<br><br><a name="46"></a><b>Advanced Innate Stamina</b><br>Level 61 / 61 / 62 / 62 / 63 / 63 / 64 / 64 / 65 / 65 - Innate Stamina 5<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base STA by 2 per level.<br>Marginally useful for magicians. At level 65 with 10 points in this skill, this increase only amounts to a maximum 52 hit points without Natural Durability.<br><br><a name="47"></a><b>Advanced Innate Agility</b><br>Level 61 / 61 / 62 / 62 / 63 / 63 / 64 / 64 / 65 / 65 - Innate Agility 5<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base AGI by 2 per level.<br>Minor usefulness to magicians, due to already low midigation abilities.<br><br><a name="48"></a><b>Advanced Innate Dexterity</b><br>Level 61 / 61 / 62 / 62 / 63 / 63 / 64 / 64 / 65 / 65 - Innate Dexterity 5<br>1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<br>Increases base DEX by 2 per level.<br>Slightly helpful to magicians.

With level 65 and more than 200 INT with 10 points in this skill, this amounts to 130 more mana.

Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities 
3 / 6 / 9 
Cast Time: 8 seconds 
Duration: 36 minutes 
Reuse Time: 15 minutes 
Turns the magician into an air elemental, granting levitation and increasing all resists by 10, 20, and 40. 
Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Useless in zones where levitation does not work. Quite useful for area effect battles, where resists are the key to survival. 

The values are wrong. Increase in resists is 5, 15 and 25 I believe ( I can't remember exactly but I know I have air elemental form 3 and it only gives me 25 to all resists. )<br><br><i><b>Naresha Qysilthilas</b> says:</i><br>Mastery of the Past

Further removes the chance to fizzle on spells below level 54, 56, and 58. 
More useful than Spell Casting Expertise, but expensive to train. Removes the chance to fizzle on high level spells, and can be quite useful. -*-*- Mastery of the Past is very useful for a raid magician or a group which is using CoH to split a hard pull. ( and has no FD class ) You will never fizzle a Call of the Hero, Rod of Mystical Transvergence, Gate ( although the collapsing of them will still occur ) again. Potentially saving alot of mana if you max this ability.<br><br><i><b>Naresha Qysilthilas</b> says:</i><br>BTW can the format of the feedback and comments be changed?

Simply send your pet to pull the target you wish to bring to you or your party and /pet hold as soon as it hits the target once. If it goes really bad, you can probably get a gate off or zone before your pet dies and the mobs come for you. An added benefit is your pet is considered indifferent to all mobs. Therefore making your pet attack a dark blue con amongst light blue cons will only bring dark blue or higher cons in the pull.<br><br><i><b>Arch Mage izzadan, Of rodcet.</b> says:</i><br>So a mage has only 3 tittle correct? 6 points = baron, 18=master and 24 sage?

Also, to use PoP AA's do you need to have Sage title? It lists some AA's with required previous AA's, but to take Servent of Ro do I need to have 24 aa points spent in the Class (59th level) aa's?
<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Talerence - I would advise all classes/races, everyone, to get innate run 3. Personally all my characters also get innate regeneration 3 next. After all you do not allways have sow/shrew/mount and do need to run sometimes, and if get debuffed you can't outrun. Regen is nice because face it, no hitpoints your dead, and combined with the hp/ac/ and later mana regen buffs helps heal up mod rod or the occasional mob hit fast, dont need healer types to spend mana on healing you. Those two are more valuable to most then a 3 points in a stat, or resist. While bandaging seems good since we summon them, would rather be medding for mana then bandaging and with inate regen and spell up you heal more then fast enough that you dont need to bandage. The metabolism one is nice if you spend a lot of time on a mount, but i think it is still secondary to run and regen.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Turn summoned-can think of one use that I would have for it. Going to the island in Twilight Sea that is full of elementals and gathering up as many as can with /pet hold on, pull them all to near pet and hit turn summoned, they are low enough level that they should not resist a lot, and the dot from it should kill some if not all. Main reason to do this for me would be to get smithing components, and maybe a drop or two from the named ones to sell or twink an alt. Though I have to say it really isn't worth the AA points for that, couple area effects and pet not on hold and can clear the island pretty fast.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>What Class AA's do you guys recommend, have pet hold and mend companion. Mass group buff is worthless, dont think frenzy would be that helpfull unless pet crits or something special, might get level 1 in air for levitate and level 1 in water for waterbreathing and mana regen but dont see spending the points to get to level 3 in them. Any suggestions, I rarely chain pet so reclaim isn't high on list, nor elemental pact. Would like to see that Sage in front of my name but dont want to spend points in little use aa's just to get the title.<br><br><i><b>ryo</b> says:</i><br>this forum kinda sux and the EQshaman sight is goin from a useful system to this one too this sux.<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
