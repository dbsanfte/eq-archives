 <h2><u>Exploring Chardok B - Solo Exp and Loot</u></h2></center><br><br>Chardok B is a 'temporary' dungeon that is still arond.  To get to it, you must travel deep into chardok (behind the herbalist).  Here is a chardok map I customized with a neon-green path from the zone-in area to chardokB zone, in can be found <a href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/view.php?map=Chardok_1_1488.txt&bg=b&id=132">here</a>.<br><br>Simply download the everquest version and save to your everquest/maps directory.  A map of chardokB can be found <a href="http://mapfiend.eq-toolbox.com/view.php?map=Chardokb_1_28.txt&bg=b&id=50">here</a>.<br><br>The prefered method obviously is to ensure you have dubious or higher faction with the Brood of DiZok (chardok) so you can take your sweet time getting to B.  If you try the run kos, you WILL get the living shiznat beat out of you though as you run.  I do not recommend this, though many people do this without hesitation.  The zone-in to chardok B is within a small (safe for coh) alcove, the zi is the little lever on the wall.  Once inside B, the zi is safe if you hug the far corners.  The giant grey spiked-flower looking thing is the zone out back into chardok.  It is proximity ~and~ clicky, so be careful if you camp the zi as it's easy to get too close & get popped out.<br><br>Chardok B zi is all undead, ranging from 54-58 and the named being 59-61.  All normal mobs are easily dispached using a fully geared WoX pet, named mobs and the occasional add will require chaining heals and/or mend if you have it.<br><br>All mobs randomly rarely drop normal chardok loot - from chokadi hide boots to staves of shielding as well as some of the nicer words & runes.  Coin loot is 0-6p.  Mobs also drop quest items (collect all 4 pages & killing a golem results in golem heart ring for example).  Definately keep ALL pages you can find (page of dust, page of decay, etc) as well as collect all 4 types of staff of suffering & all glimmering gems.  Refer to ala's for quest detail for some pretty nice rewards...but realize to actually finish the quest will require tank, healer, dps.  You can't do it alone.<br><br>Solo at 65 w/ 190aa I can solo the first 12 static mobs and the 6 roamers in the 28 minute spawn.  A necro partner can really help as they can slow the mobs, and you can start killing the first few castle mobs.<br><br>Rabid chokadi's are named, and can randomly pop in the place of ANY static spawn in the dungeon that normally pops a undead or chokadi.  These are quite a bit tougher, but can drop some very nice loot.  The roaming spectre & ghost mobs are ph's for named also, which always drops very nice loot.<br><br>Solo I get an aa every 2-2.5 hours, and depending on named spawn luck I can make 50-10kp per hour.  If you get soem friends with tankage & dpd so go with you, the castle is another entirely awesome run as there are much more named, great loot potential and the exp in a good group can rival BoT.<br><br>Of the insane amount of time I've spent in B over the past 4 months, I can count on one hand the number of times there have been more people other than me (or my group) in the zone.  Twice has been for korocrusty raids.  As such, this has been the ideal place to farm from work when I need to afk often - I have never been killed afk.<br><br>Regarding level & gear requirement - I didn't come here until I was 65 with 120ish AA & FT12 and I could kill the first 10 or so mobs at zi.  I would say steer clear of this zone for solo action until you are 65 and nicely equiped.

It drops you right next to the bank and you can get out the same way.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>At 63 with around 100aa the entrance was decent exp using 1pet per kill method. Named took around 3-4pets if chaining. I havent tried solo yet but with a partner u can move right from the entrance and take your first right towards the pet dogs, everyting is single pull at 63-4 just watch out for roamers. Make your way around the stairs  fighting all mobs along the way, on the other side of the stairs is a 2nd trigger trap that will spawn a mob. From here theyre maybe a named up in the middle of room named the Armorer. I generally clear this room and make my way up the steps towards the sarnaks avoiding the door on the left as theyre are 4 healer types inside and cannot be single pulled. From up here just stay in the corner opposite of the 4mob room and pull em all back, nice thing is the roamers will spawn inside that door and roam down the way you just cleared.<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
