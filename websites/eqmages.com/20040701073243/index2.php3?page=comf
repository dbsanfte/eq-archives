 <h2><u>Farming CoM: Reavers + Neh Ashir (Epic piece)</u></h2><br><br>This guide was by Mentoba of Stromm.</center><br><br><br>First of all, run your ass to city of mist...get kei first, it makes it alot less boring (its not needed though). Once your in city of mist, cast invis on yourself, and mem eye of tallon. Run around city of mist a bit, use your eye, scout for nameds etc, and keep looking until you see "captain of the guard"...there will be one up somewhere, rest assured. If he's surrounded in a place you need IVU to get to, make a pet and kill your way to him. If not, just nuke him once with fbot or sun vortex, he'll go down in 1 hit (or 2 if you got a flookey resist or something~). Loot the key off him. Invis back up and move to the moat area. <br><br>Stand at the "T" in the moat and make up Rathe's Son if you have him. If not make 61 air. If you dont have 61 air, then GOD YOU SUCK..jk jk.. If you dont even have 61 air just use 57 earth, you'll wanna armor him up, but he works. <br><br>Summon your pet FISTS OF IXIBLAT or BLADE OF THE KEDGE~ Do not use the magic sword, its procs wont land on reavers. Fire lands fine, ice lands shitty (from what i've noticed). Give your pet belt, etc... Kill the two mobs that are sorta near the locked door. Walk up to the locked door, click it with your little keygasm that you got off the captain of the guard (you did kill him right??). It'll now be on your keyring like the key to your ex-gf's house that you never returned (you slut.) <br><br>Target the black reaver thats standin in front of his little throne. Cast something on it (annul or mala, or malise, or whatever, dont cast a dmg spell cuz it'll take a few sec for pet to get it off you if you do). Wait till it gets RIGHT IN FRONT of where the door is, and have your pet engage it there. <br><br>DO NOT FIGHT ON THE MOAT WALKWAY!!! (If you insist on doing this, you'll proly be fine. if you do it a few times, the reaver or your pet will eventually fall off, creating an orgy of chaos as you search for the reaver, jump off, discover theres a mob in the water sometimes, get hit, get blinded as your pet runs off like mad...yeah..sorry, i'm ranting, this NEVER happens to me, never...) <br><br>Anyway! My spell line up! <br><br>1. Sun vortex (use shock of fiery blades or fbot here if you want) <br>2. Transons Elemental Renewal (dont need to have 2 heals up i just do it for ghoisk sometime or incase i get an add and a reaver at the same time or something) <br>3. Planar Renewal (you'll wanna have this, but again, its not necessary. You dont even hafta have the 60 heal, but if you dont have it you might need to chain 44/52 heals sometimes.) <br>4. Pet of choice. <br>5. Flameshield of Ro <br>6. Burnout <br>7. something to pull with <br>8. gate. <br><br>Heal pet at 70 if you got planar renewal... heal once... nuke a couple times...heal again.. dead reaver. Go loot up, pray you get a jade reaver or the 55 shaman pet spell, and engage the next reaver. Eventually Lord Ghoisk will spawn. He's the same as a reaver except he summons and has more hitpoints. Chain nuke him down to about 50% life. At 50% he "runs out of steam" and slows himself. Seriously. After 50% you can just sorta med and nuke at will. <br><br>okay...theres the basic strat for killing reavers etc...now what about getting neh'ashir so you can hopefully get your epic peice??? <br><br>Turn your ass (gnomish hopefully) around and walk to the "T" in the moat walkway. Turn left. Kill the mobs in the little gazebo, walk onto land, turn left again...kill more mobs.... go around the corner.... (now you'll be facing the zone in).. walk straight killing the 2 mobs taht'll be in your way until you get to archway that leads into the goo temple/lhranc area. Strand in the doorway and bring your pet to you. Type /pet kill a black reaver. <br>I know i know, wtf your saying. <br><br>Type /assist your_pet's_name, and type pet back off. <br><br>Turn around and run back to the beginning of the moat walkway. Sit, mem "Scars of Sigil". Cast it. <br><br>Watch in glee as the bolt goes up through the floor of the building above you and hits neh'ashirs reaver for oh so little damage. Wait a few seconds...The reaver comes warping on down like os/2. Kill it. Kill the next one, etc, until neh'ashir spawns. <br><br>Neh'ashir is not kos. <br><br>If you were using an earth pet, kill it and switch to 61 air. If you dont have 61 air, get it, maybe 59 air would work but it'd be annoying fight. Cast annul magic several times on neh'ashir because its an enchanter, and engage. Malosini(a) neh'ashir and nuke away. Your pet will stun it, which is important because neh'ashir complete heals over and over again if you dont use air pet. Neh'ashir will die and you'll laugh at how easy she was. Loot the corpse and realize she had the last laugh because it didnt' have the torch. Repeat as many (dozen) times as necessary to get your torch. There you go. <br><br>PS: the key that drops off neh'ashir can be used to go up the elevator to get another reaver or whatever.<br><br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(98); return false;'>City of Mist mob list</a><br>

I haven't farmed reavers since the changeover.<br><br><i><b>Eandori Raintree</b> says:</i><br>I could target the Neh Ashir Black Reaver from the spot described here, but I could not pull him.  I needed to get up to the pathway in the air to kill Neh Ashir.

I used tons of tricks to get past and around buildings until I was by myself at the final tower in the sky.  Most of the tricks involved Drogmor+invis+Earthen boots.  Yes, they nerfed that, but yes you can still do it to some degree.  Just turn on levi+drogmor and stand either in a corner, or VERY close to a wall and spam the boots.  You will gain levitation.  Then click off drogmor and run to where you need to go before you drop again.  Pulling the Reaver for Neh Ashir out was not to bad either.  Stand next to the door, make an eye of Zomm/Tallon and run up to the reaver and target.  Then /pet attack.  As soon as your pet lands 1 blow, use /pet hold and run back along the skypath away from the final tower.  Your pet will follow you out the door, and across the path (getting summoned if he hit that stupid reaver too hard)  When the reaver is out with your pet, re-engage pet and kill the stupid reaver.  If the reaver does not come out very welll after engaging pet, just sit down and let sit aggro bring him out.

When Neh Ashir spawns, get your MR as high as possible.  Send in your pet of choice and beat that guy down.  Be carefull of you, pet or the mob falling off the pathway.<br><br><i><b>Manouk</b> says:</i><br>this worked fine, was not able to assist elemental at first, but after a few tries, got it. <br><br><i><b>Lildailye</b> says:</i><br>They change something about Neh Ashir, I fought her to get my epic. She was twice as hard to kill. I had to get a cleric to come along to keep my WoX alive. We were both out of mana and pet was down to 10% health when he finally killed her. Lucky for me first kill, she drop that torch.

I'm on the Erollisi Marr server<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>neh is tough b/c she hastes herself... pull with dispell a few good times before malo'ing and you're good to go<br><br><i><b>Whambam</b> says:</i><br>This is a awesome guide showed it to may whole guild.  Thanks alot Mentoba of Stromm.
