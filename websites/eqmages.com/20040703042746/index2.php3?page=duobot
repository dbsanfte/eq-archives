 <h2>Duo in the Bastion of Thunder</h2><br><br>A lot of people often talk about the effectiveness of soloing in Bastion of Thunder with charm, but it can be very risky.<br><br>A much safer alternative, is to duo with a class that can help you control the charmed pet. This means less wipes, and if your duo class can double up as a really good puller, you wont loose too much exp from soloing.<br><br><br>Before charming your pet, mez it and debuff it with mala and malosinia, and (this is important) get your duo-class to snare it. Then keep your pet parked a way away from where you stand, so that when it breaks you have plenty of time to charm or mez.<br><br><br>As for duo class, I would reccomend a good druid: They can heal, snare, give some crowd control (with root) and pacify-pull. Not to mention you will always have evac and PoTN available. With a good druid, this can considerably outdo full-groups for exp and loot. You can also find places to do this when all the group spots are taken.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(173); return false;'>Bastion of Thunder (BoT) mob list</a><br>

Since the charm nerf, charm breaks way way too fast sometimes.  The giants summon, and broken charm with just the charm pet tanking = death.  Hasted, Charmed Elementals can be up to 1000 DPS.  When charm breaks you instantly get summoned then have TWO very high DPS mobs beating you down................... DONT EVEN BOTHER.............................................................  Now on the other hand, Charm duo'ing with a druid in the courtyard above is a VERY good option.  The Stormriders kinda look like large bee's.  They don't summon, but they do cast.  Go the the SOUTH area (Earth Elementals), Grab a Jord Kjal.  Make an earth pet, and send it in.  Mez the Kjal while they fight.  Stick Malosinia on the Kjal while it's mezzed, have the druid snare it, then reclaim your earth pet (replacing the mana from debuff and mez) and charm the Kjal.  Wait around 30 seconds to do anything, as if charm lasts more then 30 seconds it seems charm will have some decent duration.  At all times possible, keep max distance between you and the charm pet.  When charm breaks MEZ as fast as you can.  Now take your charm pet up to the pad on top of the south area.  Walk onto the pad from the side, and the charm pet will follow you up to the courtyard.  Now pick a courtyard with Stormriders in it, and now Burnout V the charm pet, give him summoned pet gear with a different weapon for each hand, and send him at a stormrider.  Drop a Malosinia on the Stormrider, and nuke him for 5 points.  Don't waste more mana nuking, there's no chance in hell you will outdamage the charm pet.  Have the Druid snare the Stormrider, then Root the Stormrider while your charm pet beats it down.  When the Stormrider gets low HP, he will start healing himself (Thanks to a recent nerf).  Have your druid buddy cast his level 61? stun spell to keep the heal from going off.  Move to the next Stormrider and do the same.  After around 3 Stormriders, your charm pet is low HP.  Since he has around 30K HP, don't bother healing, this is what you do...  Make the pet sit, back up, and break charm with Eathen Boots (right click insta-invis to animals) then MEZ the pet on his way too you.  IMMEDIATELY charm him again.  The pet will regen HP at an insane rate until the Mez wears off (yes while still charmed).  If you time it right, your charm pet can go from 30% HP to Full in 25 seconds.  Be sure to refresh the snare and Malosinia every 10 min or so, don't want those breaking in the middle of each fight.  This tactic is still dangerous, and takes alot of skill.  But it can be mastered and you and a druid friend will be OWNING exp and getting vendor-pp drops, Etherals and Spectrals, and tradeskill drops.<br><br><i><b>Anidazen</b> says:</i><br>Wow! Nice comment.

Outclasses my article somewhat, lol. Ok if I incorporate that comment into the actual text of article?<br><br><i><b>Eandori Raintree</b> says:</i><br>Sure that's fine with me, in fact I would be honored =).  I can reformat it better in an email if you like.  As the message currently sits, it all runs together.  My email address is eandori@comcast.net<br><br><i><b>Naresha Qysilthilas</b> says:</i><br>That said it's always nice to have a cleric handy when trying this out :)<br><br><i><b>Naresha Qysilthilas</b> says:</i><br>Sorry if this sounds like common sense but wouldn't recommend this if you are a frequent LDer. <br><br><i><b>Jeradim</b> says:</i><br>Question:
After you charm a Jord Kjai, how do you get past all the mobs to get to the pad that takes you up to the courtyard?<br><br><i><b>Farrudar</b> says:</i><br>If you are planning of going to Beas but there is not a Jord Kjal at the pad you are not out of luck.  The giants in bot have a fairly low aggro range I have notcied.  What i do to pull a pet to pad is the following:
-Use Elemental Silence on the pet.(pray it doesnt resist)
-If it sticks immidiatly sinia the pet. Now invis and run to either the left or right corner by Guakr pad.
-When mez breaks the pet will come at you full speed, but will not aggro any other mobs on the way. Simply remez then charm.
-Kill the mob nearest to you on pad then move up to courtyard and pet will follow.

<br><br><i><b>Kaileyah</b> says:</i><br>Jeradim... simply kill your way through.  Short and sweet add on.  Id say a druid or ranger is a must unless you want to be seen naked every 3 minutes.  A must is malo, snare, sow, cha buff no matter what your cha is!!, and a wide open area, easy place is SB or ST.  The earth elementals are pretty common and much easier to get.<br><br><i><b>Kaileyah</b> says:</i><br>...last time I promise.  Wheres the edit button?  Anyways, giants were much easier for me, not every giant gates, some are pure melee, and even the one that does gate don't heal themselves.  When it is a gate giant just slap on some magic dd at the end and youll still be alive!  Plus, you can easily kill a named if you know what your doing and score some great upgrades or great farming items..where as the CY you cannot.<br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
