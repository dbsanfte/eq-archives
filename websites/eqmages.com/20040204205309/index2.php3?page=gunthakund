 <h2>Gunthak Undead Side</h2><br><br>I have found the most uber of all that is uber locations to solo your way<br>from 39 to 44 in less than 4 hrs per level.  The undead side of Gunthak<br>beach.  The mobs don't run, are far enough apart that you can single pull 10<br>mobs and then use their spawn cycle to continuously pull.  They drop stuff<br>that sells for 1 or 2pp each, drop up to 5pp, as well as dropping bone chips<br>(5gp to 1pp each in bazaar) and Zombie Skins (5pp min each in bazaar).  I<br>was able to do this after the C3 nerf, so it can be done!!<br><br>Here are the 6 steps to get set up and rolling:</center><br><br>1) Run to Gunthak and bind at the LightHouse.  This is good cause there is a<br>bank and a vendor so you can "Guard" your pet, gate and bank, then just run<br>back to the beach.<br><br>2) Summon pet (I recommend Fire because of the innate DS) and give him<br>everything you got. Armor, Elemental Defender, and single cast the focus<br>items to hand him.  Also I suggest spending the 40pp for the belt, proc<br>weaps, and haste mask.  Once done, give him the "Guard" command.  Don't use<br>the Earth pet, the mobs don't run anyway and the stun from the air pet or<br>the innate DS from the fire pet will serve you well.  Besides, all pets up<br>to 49 are the same except for special abilities.<br><br>3) Summon a levitate ring and run to the beach.  You want to go to the<br>extreme left side (if you are facing the beach from the water) which is the<br>opposite side of the beach from the tunnel to Dulak.  There will be 3 undead<br>mobs in a row on the beach.  Don't worry about them, just stay against the<br>wall in the sand.  They will NOT agro you...you can even sit if you like.<br><br>4) Cast Summon Companion (level 39 spell) and re "Guard" your pet or he will<br>wander back to the lighthouse.<br><br>5) Load up your spells with Burn first (your pulling spell) then your fav DD<br>and/or DoT spell.  If you are using the fire pet, dun worry about the<br>DS...if you are using air, then mem DS too.  Make sure to have Burnout and<br>pet heal on hand as well.<br><br>6) Start pulling.  Go down the line on those three mobs, then the mob at the<br>top of the broken boat piece, then the mob just to the other side of that<br>boat piece.  Then there are 2 mobs next to one another just above you, if<br>you pull the one farther away from the wall they will single, if you pull<br>the other one, then they come together.  Once you take both of those, the up<br>the beach is a rock with 3 mobs; one on either side and one just in front.<br>Take the one in front, then left, then right.  Once those are dead, the<br>first mob should have already respawned or is soon to come...use that as<br>some med time.  You will need med time, don't get me wrong, but you should<br>be able to take that cycle pretty handily.<center><br><br>Just as reference, here are the mob names (from easiest to hardest) so you<br>know what to expect.  The Skeletons are a little easier to kill then the<br>Zombies, so if you are having a hard time, be selective as to what you pull<br>until your mana pool catches up to you.  There is only one spot that the<br>Maniacal spawns and he, along with a Deadly, are the placeholders for a<br>ShadowKnight class named zombie.  If that dude shows up, have someone kill<br>it for you.  He will pound you hard.</center><br><br><b>Skeletons:</b><br>Savage<br>Viscous<br>Deadly<br><br><b>Zombies:</b><br>Emaciated<br>Pestilent<br>Maniacal<br>One Named<br><br><center>Happy Hunting!!<br><br>Pyrov Nukeovich<br>Mage of the 57th Circle<br>Brell Serilis<br><br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=179'>Gulf of Gunthak mob list</a><br>
