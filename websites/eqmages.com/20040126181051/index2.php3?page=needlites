 <h2>Echo Cavern: Soloing Needlites</h2><br><br><br>Set up in the left corner of needlite room, and pull out a FIRE PET (important!). Buff the pet, but don't give it a DS, it has its own, and its better. In fact its essential for this.<br><br>You can solo these (singles) with your level20 spells, even though they will start out red then! All are single pulls except in the far corner you sometimes get 2.<br><br>Simply pull with a low level nuke, and set your pet on them, healing if needed. These mobs hit weak but fast, making them ideal to be eaten by your pets damage shield!<br><br><br>The only problems with this camp are: The spore plant guarding the ramp - but this is avoidable, just stay away from it and by the walls. It ignores your pet, but sometimes will KS needlites from you if your pet chases them towards it.<br><br>The second problem is the Queen, which is a rare spawn in the center, before 24 you are best off getting someone else to kill it, say its up and usually people will be only too glad to help!<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Comments/Feedback:</u></b><br><br>
