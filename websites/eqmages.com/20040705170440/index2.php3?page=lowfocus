 <h2><u>Pet Focus Items (up to 49)</u></h2></center><br><br>A pet is <b>the most important</b> aspect of the mage class, certainly below 60. One of the single most important quests any mage will ever do, is the pet focus items quest. Anyone not doing this is really missing out. This guide deals with how to obtain the focus items which will focus any pet from levels 4 to 44, increasing its power, strength and size! (From 34 the pets appear visibly larger).<br><br> <br><b><u>What are "pet focus items"?</u></b><br> <br>The focus items are primary slot mage only items with some very low stats, right click reclaim energy, and the unique focus effects: <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4397">Minion of Fire</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4398">Minion of Water</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4399">Minion of Earth</a> and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4396">Minion of Air</a>. These are <b>the</b> original focus effects, in game before any of the labelled focus effects. These focus effects make your pets more powerful, even visibly larger! (From 34 onwards), and work on all pets from level 4 to level 44.<br> <br><b><u>How to get them.</u></b><br> <br>The quest giver is a gnome called <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12084">Vira</a> in the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Solusek_Ro.htm">Temple of Soulsek Ro</a>, but thats the last stop on your trip, as its pointless to go and see Vira before obtaining all of the handin items. These items are: some minor item relating to that element, some kind of gem, some kind of giant toe, and, most importantly <u>a torch/shovel/broom/stein</u>.<br> <br><b><u>Collecting the Items</u></b><br> <br>By far the hardest and most awkward items to obtain, are the "ordinary" items that get powered up and returned to you. These items drop off the magicians in Najena (reportedly including the goblin magicians), and can be found on the aligators outside Cazic-Thule too. However, this guide assumes that you will be taking the Najena route, as the alligators are 'second best' unless you are exp camping them. (For more information on alligator route click <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=279">here</a> for mob info).<br><br>However, these items <b>are</b> tradeable, and its always worth asking mages who might have done the quest before if they have one of a particular item lying around, after all, its rare that you get the 4 you want in order before getting a duplicate of one of them. (Obviously, save YOUR duplicate items, to trade with ones you need, or to sell or give to someone else!)<br><br>First things first: Getting to <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Najena.htm">Najena</a> is fairly easy, just port in to Lavastorm and it should be labelled on your map. Once there, tread carefully, and proceed slowly through the zone. Your looking for <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2128">'a magician'</a>.<br><br>There are a few there, all on a 19 minute cycle. You need to get yourself set up so that your killing as many as possible while still getting back to await the first spawn as 1) With luck they wont get time to get a pet up, saves time and reduces risk. 2) Theres no point venturing deeper than you have to. Theres not much help I can offer at this point, except that <b>DO <u>NOT</u> THROW AWAY ANY 'PAGES OF ELEMENTAL MASTERY: <element>'!</b>, these are needed for the magician epic. They are also rare, but your killing two birds in one stone, so to speak. Doing two long painful camps at once. The camps do take ages, but eventually you will find 'A Shovel', 'A Stein', 'A Torch', and 'A Broom'. (Hopefully at least!). You don't <b>need</b> all four, but you get a focus item for one element for each item you get.<br> <br><b><u>The Other Items</u></b><br> <br>Ok, so you have "the ordinary items", thats most of the work done! You just need some other items to complete the set, here are the requirements for each. Below these listings I have put the quickest and easiest way to aquire them all in one go. (Although It might be worth checking the bazaar for some of these items)<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6361">Shovel of Ponz</a> (Earth)<br> - A Shovel<br> - Ruby<br> - Hill Giant toes<br> - Gargoyle Eye<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6363">Stein of Ulissa</a> (Water)<br> - A Stein<br> - Sapphire<br> - Ice Giant Toes<br> - Mermaid Scale<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6362">Torch of Alna</a> (Fire)<br> - A Torch<br> - Fire Emerald<br> - Fire Giant Toes<br> - Fire Drake Scale<br> <br><a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6360">Broom of Trillon</a> (Air)<br> - A Broom<br> - Star Ruby<br> - Cyclops Toes<br> - Griffon Feather<br> <br> <br>Firstly, on your way out of Najena, stay in Lavastorm and kill drakes to get the fire drake scale, then quickly go through Nektulos Forest to East Commons to Freeport, from where you can catch a boat through the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/oot.html">Ocean of Tears</a>.<br><br>In this zone you can acquire most of the remaining items. The islands you need are gargoyle isle (a couple of kills of <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2543">"A Gargoyle"</a> should yield the eye), Siren Isle (kill <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2536">"An Alluring Siren"</a> untill you get a mermaid scale), and Cyclops Isle. On this island should be (very popular spot) people camping the cyclopses.<br><br>They will almost definately sell you the gems you need cheaply, far far cheaper than a merchant. And near there you should find someone camping <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2572">Gornit</a>, he is pretty much always camped, and generally his toes are left to rott, ask whoever is camping if you can loot them, he drops all types of giant toe, including cyclops. All thats left to do then is to pick up a Gryffon feather, I suggest checking the bazaar or vendors in the Karana's. (If a gargoyle is too high level, then look on nearby vendors or the bazaar for the eye)<br> <br><b><u>The Final Hand-In</u></b><br> <br>This is it! Back to Lavastorm, but this time to the ajoining zone "Temple of Soulsek Ro", to find a gnome called "Vira". (You should have nothing to worry about faction wise in here). Simply hand her the right 4 items to make each focus item. You don't have to do all 4, and don't have to do all at once, the quests are totally independant of each other. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your beefed up pets!<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(10); return false;'>Temple of Soulsek Ro mob list</a><br>

They are LORE, so you can't get spares to sell in bazaar.

All four flavors of giant toes can be merchant mined in OOT (every merchant I checked had all four flavors) from people camping the named.

Mermaid scale was merchant mined in OOT, Gargoyle Eye was found in bazaar, Gryphon Feather was merchant mined off of gypsy merchants in NK, Fire Drake Scale merchant mined off of the druid merchant in Sol A at druid circle.

All gems can be purchased from jewlery merchant in PoK behind main bank.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>this is good advice for all u newbies out there if u need help i am a lvl.9 or up monk named mobslair.On the eci sever<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>HOW COME NO ONE IS ON THE ECI SEVER THAT GIVES HINTS!!!!!<br><br><i><b>Pictos Bonesplitter Rodset Nife</b> says:</i><br>One place you didn't mention is Mistmore. There's a gargoyle fairly close to the zone and if you can get a group of 4 people to help you pull it or a High Lv char your set. The mob always drops 1 and most of the time 2 eye's.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>isnt there any quests for EXP factions or currency for lvl 5 and under mages? I mean there has to be one. I desperatly need EXP and Currency.<br><br><i><b>Archonz 33-Mage Quel</b> says:</i><br>After a long paintful camp im Najena, I was able to collect a torch, broom, and shovel.  Still missing the stein but here's the scoop.  I found a total of 7 "magicians" in the zone all dark elves.  However the only item i recrieved off of them was the "shovel."  In the zone is also a "goblin magician" after 3x killing him I recieved a "torch."  But heres something that might be really useful.  I found an enchanter, yes an enchanter, that also has a chance of dropping these items.  If you are looking at the eqatlas map, right outside room "11" is a named mob named Ekeros.  I recieved a "broom" from him.  I know that he was an enchanter because he mezzed me and my pet.  Was an ez kill though, was green at 34.  Some mages were on a 10 min cycle, others more about 20.  However with a total of 9 mobs found to drop this item, I was kept pretty busy.  If anyone finds that @$%^ stein on quellious server, plz send tel to Archonz- 34 mage
or
Vizix 35 druid
Thnx and good luck<br><br><i><b>Archonz</b> says:</i><br>I finally found that @#$$# stein tonite.  Get this though, it just dropped off of a plain old goblin in the zone.  Not a mage goblin, just one of regulars.  How wierd.  I got a nice guy to help me tonite also.  He told me that they drop off of -Magicians, -ALL Goblins, -Dark Bone skeleton's, "Rathyl," and ekeros.
CHECK THE BAZAAR FOR YOUR GEMS>!!!  I spent 120pp on one, and found one selling in bazaar for a whole 20pp.  Anyways, I know it takes a logn time, but the pet definately is bigger, hits harder, and seems to have some extra hp.  Good luck<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>i would like to get some info on the higher end magi pet focus items, i mean i know about LDoN aug and of cuz the VT gloves of dark summoning... but i was wondering if there were any orthers.. i was told PoTime had one but i haven't been able to find any... and no clue if GoD has any.. Thanks<br><br><i><b>Kazzyr</b> says:</i><br>i did the quest for the earth pet, i got all my items went to turn it in and guess what?? i didn't get it. i didnt get it because when i made my mage i didn't choose soulzek as a god, so when i handed in my items she said to me that the temple didn't like half believers and i lost all my items, which sucked cuz it cost me 150 pp to buy the ruby. so if u are going to do these quest be sure u have the right god hehe<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>You dont need to worship solusek but it seems you either hailed the guy you arent supposed to hail in sol ro or you did something to piss them off because everyone starts off indifferent there, kill shadowed men for faction increases with sol ro<br><br><i><b>newmage</b> says:</i><br>jus bought all 4 ordinary items total of 500plat on xegony server<br><br><i><b>Ezan</b> says:</i><br>ok, here is a little info for the mage's that don't have good faction with sol temple... obviously you should consider the quest giver to see if you are indifferently or better cause usally anything less then that they will consume your well hard earned pieces.... anyway there are a few ways to up your faction 1 way is to kill shadow men in various location in eq WC lfay lavastorm and the 2nd way is quite easy you just have to risk going into mistmoore castle but in the graveyard there is a small crypt that inside is a coffin with a bag on top well if you pick that bag up which respawns ever so often prob 5 or 10 mins and give it to the guy that is directly behind the crypt(looks like a shadowmen) and hand him that flower and you get exp and faction hit to the good with sol temple.

Is there a minim level? I get a your will is not sufficient Message.<br><br><i><b>Cyriel</b> says:</i><br>Make sure that when you turn in the shovel that it's the shovel you get from Najena and not one of the non-magic ones that sell frequently in the bazaar<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Lots of confusing comments. Let's see if i can shed some light on it.
Yes, there is a minimum level. As the article says the foci work from level 34 onwards.
If you get a message like "Solusek Ro does not believe in doing things half" this does not say your faction is bad or that you should be a follower of Sol Ro. It tells you that you have not yet handed in ALL the 4 CORRECT items to receive a focus item.
The items listed in the article are correct, the most probable reason why Kazzyr failed has been pointed out by Cyriel, make sure you have the correct shovel.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>I did all 4 of these, and I accidentally criss crossed the items for the broom and the shovel. But then I turend in the rest of the tiems, and then completed the items for BOTH items and the NPC handed be both focus items.  This was back before they gave stuff back to you also.  But the NPC will hold the items for each focus and will hand it out as soon as the 4th item is handed in.  <br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Dark-Boned Skeleton's in Najena have a chance of dropping any 4 of the focus quest items.
