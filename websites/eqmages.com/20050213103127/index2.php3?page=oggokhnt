 <h2>Here fatty, fatty fatt... Hunting Ogres</h2><br><br><br>Oggok may not seem like the most obvious exp zone, but it can be quite good.<br><br><br>Like many mage solo spots, the very best thing is to push yourself and go as early as possible, and you can take down the Oggok guards by 39, just use an equipped air pet, and have 2 pet heals memmed incase a situation arises where you need to chaincast and can't wait for the recast time.<br><br>Sometimes you will get a bouncer that is very magic resistant (about 1 in 4), so you will need to be able to rely on pet damage alone.<br><br><br>Single pulls are easy, just stick near the zonein. Don't venture too far, as some NPC's are nasty in this zone.<br><br><br>The cash loots are very nice, and there is a merchant that is always indiff (Bubbgribb) so you can sell them all easily. The cash, as well as the nice rate of exp, are what makes this camp so special.<br><br><br><br></center><b><u>Zone Information:</u></b><br><br><a href='http://www.eqmages.com' onClick='moblist(9); return false;'>Oggok mob list</a><br>

Single pulls are possible for only 2 Ogres...the other 2 are in the Guard House on top and will double tram you. You will get killed.
How many do you kill?<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Any Suggestion for a Dark Elf Mage? Killin those Ogers would kinda Screw me if I were to go back home.<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Aye, Dark Elf mages need a good place to hunt!<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>Hmmmmmmmmmmm..... gotta try this. Will let you know how it goes. Curently I am lvl 40.<br><br><i><b>Medya Wyvernslayer</b> says:</i><br>Can I try this one on my Vah Shir Beastlord? Level 41 and doomed to remain that way if I don't find interesting hunting grounds soon.<br><br><i><b>Rengaw</b> says:</i><br>Did this in my early Mage 40s.  All but two mobs are single pulls.  You have to watch out for the two roamers.  One roamer comes to near the zone line.  The second goes up the guardhouse stairs to the second story.  So always watch for the roamers. 

Other mobs are single pulls except the two on the second story of the guard house.  Make sure that pet is good health and you are full mana to take on the two.  If things are not going your way then jump down from the second story out the balcony and head to the zone line which is close.  Mobs will use the stairs you you will have time to get away.  

Make sure your bags are empty for the mob weapon drops as they sell well.  

I never made it past the guard house as their is a mob who I was KOS to and he had unlimited hit points.  So never made a dent.

I did try to lev across from the second story of the guard house to the other side, but I never ventured far, but there were more mobs.  With the new maps in EQ this may be easier to navigate in the zone.<br><br><i><b>Saurfaugtinker</b> says:</i><br>Im sorry i dont like this.. guide much.. doesnt say WHERE these guards are to hunt! There is a few i see wander bridge area i killed tho...And they were bouncers... You must mean inside oggok? i think others are confused too..<br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br>i agree...Where they at? sit there and act like its Named on the map ' Ogre Guard Place" i mean come on =/<br><br><i><b>Cosz</b> says:</i><br>*Note invis and run to the oggoc zone between the two guards guarding the entrance. Don’t mess with them, they have a lot of hit points. 
Killing cycle for Oggoc
Section 1 the guard tower level 39-45ish
At 39 pull all guards back into the tunnel at the zone line (nothing comes back past the merchant, bouncer scar will add if you are careless and don’t pull deep enough)
Guard Scarr spawns in the back of the zone and walks to the merchant at the zone line kill him first. This starts the clock.
Pull and kill the guard on porch of guard tower
If there is a guard at the right side door way pull and kill him
Go up left side stairway of the guard tower pull and kill guard at top of the stairs
The right stairs guard may be between the two on top leave him alone until he comes back down the right side stairs pull and kill him next.
Two on top will come together, leave them alone till you hit a higher level
Rinse and repeat as mana permits.
FYI once scar is dead you may fight safely on the hill or in front of the merchant until he pops and walks to the front again.

Section 2 (mana determines when it is time to add this section to the cycle)
Kill everything in section 1
Hug the right wall (leave the guard xterminator or something like that alone) he will not agro if you hug the right wall.
Fight the next 3 guards in this little court yard in front of the tunnels (watch for scarr spawning from the back and walking to the merchant at the zone line)
At the top of the hill look to your right, there is a guard on the second floor, save him till last
On your left there are 3 tunnels a roamer may be at the door or up on the second floor if door do first if second floor do second
Tunnel on right has static guard inside do him first (or second if guard is in the other door way)
Go back up hill and cast debuff on second story guard he will run to the back and 1 minute later come storming down path from the back of the zone kill him.
 
Section 3
Kill everything in section 1 and 2
Keep running to the back, there will be two guards in the archway, camp all the way back from them against the wall by the npc so nothing coming out of the door way will agro you
Single pull the guards to the back wall to fight, run through archway and take a left first door on left first vendor on right is bub grib, sell, invis run to zone line rinse and repeat
*note do not take the right tunnel under the Archway, there is a guild master there that makes mage hand puppets, it aint pretty
