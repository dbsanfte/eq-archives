              Happy New Year, T4C Developers, T4C Servers and T4C Gamers, <br><br>The following list is an amended duplication created by All With Honor Guild <br>of 355 strong for Vircom's T4C Design Team for consideration and <br>corrections. AWH is a dedicated guild of beta testers under a binding and <br>active NDA contract. Their guild home server is located at: <br><br>Http://www.jungleii.com <br><br>This is not the entire report, nor the exact replica of the one, AWH has <br>collected, complied and submitted directly to Vircom for consideration. <br>Certain "GM" bugs may have been retracted or omitted from this report to <br>assured continued game server security. <br><br>AWH also notes with caution, gamer's playing or using any known or published <br>T4C "bugs" is considered bad form-and will not be tolerated on most <br>servers-placing your character at risk of loss of exp, levels, items or <br>deletion, without advanced warning, depending upon the T4C Server's <br>administration policy. <br><br>Additionally, upon discovery of any game glitch, graphic break, word typo or <br>misspelling, incorrect NCP response or mysterious reaction/non-reaction <br>discovered within the T4C game, should be immediately reported to T4C Design <br>Team at: <br><br>http://www.the4thcoming.com/scheme1/beta/form_bugreport_mid.shtml <br><br>Without your report, it is impossible for the T4C Design Team to know of the <br>need of correction. <br><br>Each complete AWH Bug report was supplied to Vircom directly on the <br>"Vircom's T4C Bug Reporting Form", after confirmation by AWH Staff. It is <br>then delivered in a prompt and timely manner. Additionally, this continuing <br>report is divided into numerical parts, to avoid confusion with "aged bug <br>reports", as requested from the T4C Design Team at Vircom. <br><br>All With Honor’s The 4th Comings Bug Reports for Version 1.20 <br><br>001. Brightness Control is not working correctly. <br><br>002. Agility Description when icon right clicked says it limits how high you <br>can train your Dodge and Attack skills. This is no longer true. <br><br>003. Descriptions will stay even when escape is hit to clear screen to world <br>view. <br><br>004. When an item is picked from pack and becomes the cursor if you hit <br>escape the item stays as the cursor (Note this would be useful if you wanted <br>to add a "Give" command where players could hand directly to other players) <br><br>005. When items are taken off they sometimes disappear both from where worn. <br>The cursor and inventory items reappear when item screen is closed then <br>reopened <br><br>006.

Exiting T4c the game often stays on the task list ctrl-alt-del and end <br>task unloads it with a "not responding" error box <br><br>010. Direct Draw driver does not always get released when exiting game <br>preventing reloading of the game (or any other app needing DD) *note this <br>does not seem to be related to the task list bug as it can still happen <br>after checking task list <br><br>011. Right Clicking Spell Icons for description click an upper icon then a <br>lower icon upper description stays with lower description partially obscured <br>by upper description <br><br>012. Some people crash when a seraph logs on on the same screen <br><br>013. GMs teleporting with interface screens open (staus, chat, group, etc) <br>crashes client <br><br>014. Quotes (" ") for white text will not work in sysmsg <br><br>015.

Items summoned to an area will disappear if you walk away and return <br>but for some reason it acts like server may still "see" the items. This will <br>cause an “invisible lag spot” to the area when many have been summoned. The <br>problem needs to be addres-because if we need to put an item somewhere for a <br>quest/event-GM’s can not hold trust it to be “permanent”. <br><br>127. Opening a door/chest then talking you will turn and face the door/chest <br>as if you are talking to an NPC <br><br>128. Chalice, Runic Scripting Kit, Magic Scripting Kit, Bone, Bat wings, <br>Tarantula Eyes, and Keys have no graphic in sell dialog <br><br>129. Item Belladonna Berries appear in backpack upon slaying Greyleaf only <br>once. If you keep previous berries in pack even though it says you gain each <br>time however if you drop the berries and kill him again then pick the <br>dropped ones back up you can repeat this as many times as you want gaining <br>as many berries as you can hold (Sorry, the wording is confusing but.. you <br>get the point) <br><br>130.

Items dropped for Seraphs in Forest of no Return (possibly other areas <br>I haven't found yet too) cannot be dropped. Some of the items are capes, <br>useless to a seraph and being undroppable useless, these may or may not be <br>quest items but are wearable <br><br>134. Upon becoming a seraph for a 2nd time when striped all items gain in <br>seraph areas get wiped from players inventory <br><br>135. Upon becoming a seraph there is no place for player to sell items he or <br>she may wish to be rid of <br><br>136.

Seraph's Reynen's Key does not get wiped with other keys <br><br>138. Item Ancient Ring stays in pack unusable even after quest (Bones of <br>Orimar) is completed <br><br>----- <br><br>Not bugs but the GM's are “wondering about” the following issues: <br><br>1) Due to there being only 3 islands now karma max will only be 300 no way <br>to reach the max 500 (If the 500/-500 was/is to be a part of the game <br>perhaps seraphs should be able to gain karma)-TimeViewer <br><br>2) T4C GM Manual 1.20 appears to be missing the following information: None <br>of the new weapons, armor or new monsters are listed with the exception of <br>the AWH Shield.-Tobin <br><br><br>Current bug report tally sent into the T4C Design Team from All With Honor <br>Guild as of this date: 1504 <br><br>For The Good of The Game, <br>CJ Curtis <br>Aka <br>LadyWigglesnort <br>All With Honor <br>Jungle II Online <br><br>
