              I was bidding on an auction that I successfully won. The seller was Nytebyter.   I waited a couple days after the close of the auction to hear from the seller, but heard nothing.  I have since sent him 3 emails asking to complete the transaction.  I have gotten no response back at all.  Not even something saying I don't want to sell it anymore or anything. It is like the guy fell off the face of the earth. <br><br>Anyways just wanted to warn everyone to steer clear of him as it seems a waste of time to bid on his auctions.<br><br>

              Well, I will make one response, same as I did to this no-life loser.  <br>I did indeed let my nephew use my credit card to sell off some platinum.  My nephew was unfortunately taken by his parents back to the Dominican Republic and no longer plays EQ.  I had no knowledge of this auction that was incomplete, and tried to make it up to this idiot.  <br>I had over 150K in the EQ bank and was more than willing to still complete the auction, but this little ahole, WITHOUT GIVING ME ANY TIME to address this, went and gave me a negative seller rating and reported me as FRAUDULENT to Player Auctions.<br>Crap happens sometimes, and this idiot could have gotten his platinum with no problems, but he gave me NO time to honor my nephews auction and wrote me this scathing email about how I was a thief.<br>So, sometimes you have to take these no-life losers with a grain of salt and realize that they have tied their complete lives up with cartoons and pixels.  I myself own a successful business and do not have time to mess with games.<br>Now I get an email from lamers accusing me of being a thief.  Some of you need to get a life, because this guy never sent me money and I would have tried to do the auction anyway if he had given me a couple days instead of reporting me for theft and trying to destroy my reputation.<br><br>dude STFU and FU<br><br>Nytebyter Lifetouch<br><br>

Just had to let you know that the "Dying Game" comment you made about Everquest is getting VERY popular.  And now we have your website...how wonderful.<br> <br>I am an original developer that worked on project phase 2 of Everguest.  Oh yea, and I wrote a little book called "Perl Script Unleased", you may have heard of it, sold about 3 million copies.  You can still buy it at Amazone and the likes.  I now operate an ISP and cyber cafe here in Anchorage.  I passed on your forum post from Playerauctions to some very close friends in the business.<br> <br>Lets just say this my "million dollar business" friend, business may get a bit slow at the ol "Wood Bytes" website.  I understand this does not really bother a "wood worker guy" as yourself, but the electronic word is very stong.  <br> <br>Have a great day and watch try to watch open comments next time there Steve.<br> <br>Robert Breedlove<br>The Surf City Group<br>Achorage Alaska<br><br>His email is:<br>Breedlove@gci.net<br>_________________<br><br>I think this guy is a phony since he cannot spell even the name of the game he worked on, nor the town he lives in and can find another 6 errors or so in grammar and verbage, nor can I find reference to "his" book on Amazon, but nonetheless his threat has been forwarded to my lawyer.<br><br>Drop me a note Selasque, and let me know what happened exactly and what I can do to make this right with you.  My understanding in his termination hearing was that no money was taken and that there was no actual offense except his language and attitude.<br><br>Remember that is was as easy for him to type my name on the bottom of an email as it would have been to type Ronald Reagan on the bottom of the email.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
