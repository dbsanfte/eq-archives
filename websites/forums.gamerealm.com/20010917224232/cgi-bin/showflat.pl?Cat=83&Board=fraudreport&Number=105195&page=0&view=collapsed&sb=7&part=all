              This is the copy of the last e-mail so far I have recived from that Khalidor platinum guide "company".<br><br>First of all,  they can get a grip of concept that if you are selling something: all of your claims have to be true. This guide doesnt work, and there is at least one thing that they claimed and it is not working as it should. I dont need to list all of them really because in order their claims NOT no be true, I just need one.<br><br>I have tried to explain them, if you go to buy a car and dealer tells you that car has stereo, AC and 10 000 mile waranty, you buy it and come home then realise there is no AC in the car,  so it is not a scam that i don't have AC, because i still have stereo and 10 000 warranty? <br><br>Also this is e-mail i have received from this guy so there are part of in there from my original mail (i put Me: in front of it), and then there is his response (has "PL Guy" in front of it).<br><br>I know we are all used to be dealing with those kind of people in our local East commons, but what kind of "company" replies to their customers like this, please read this:<br><br><br><br>Me: Hello Again,<br><br>Really off the subject, but I have just noticed that you, the PR guy for<br>this "company", sent me and e-mail that had acronym WTF in it.<br>Could you please clear that for me and explain me what that means, (spell it<br>out)  because if it is what I think it is, I think thats a really wrong way<br>to treat customers<br> <br>PL guy: By all means! WTF stands for "what the fuck." Are you insulted? Tell me something: which is more insulting, to be accused of "fraud", which is not simply a crime but a felony, or to have someone say "you can't possibly know what the fuck you're doing." I'd rather have someone say "you can't possibly know WTF (again, stands for what the fuck) you're doing" than have them even imply that I'd commited fraud.  If you find WTF so offensive, every time you see it, simply pretend that it stands for "what the fudge."<br><br><br> Me: Also I haven't said that as lev 59 I couldn't do it, but my point was that<br>lev 45 character can not  do Forager/hunter spawn as you said it could. Also<br>if you have lev 1 tracker at the zone line, he can just tell you what mob is<br>up, so what if you know that Doom is up, you lev 45 character needs to find<br>and kill the mob. Lets say you go to do this with paladin, he cant track mob<br>down, and even if he stumbles over the mob (hoping all this green trash that<br>still can do some damage to lev 45 character doesnt kill him first) does, he<br>can't solo it. Thats at least one part of your claim that is wrong.<br><br>(Addenum: This is the part when car dealer tells you WTF, so if you car doesnt have AC as I promised, you still have Warranty and stereo)<br>PL Guy: OK so because you find one perceived inaccuracy, the entire guide is worthless now right, and you want your money back? BS (stands for BULLSHIT), it ain't (is not) gonna happen.  Methinks (I think) you were looking for something that would allow you to sit your ass (gluteous maximus) in Freeport and just sit there and make 1K per hour every hour with no effort.  There are no such methods.<br><br><br><br>Me: Please feel free to reply to either of my 2 e-mails and spell that acronym<br>for me.<br><br>PF Guys: Once again, so there can be no misunderstanding, it stands for "what the fuck."  Feel free to e-mail me again if you forget it and need me to remind you.<br> <br>Regards,<br> <br>Doug Reding<br>www.powerleveling.com<br><br>

              What Ratko Vavic failed to do in the above post was mention that in the VERY FIRST E-MAIL HE SENT TO ME, he accused me of fraud.  He did not approach me in a civil manner and ask for a refund, he didn't say "I already knew all of this stuff so it isn't much use to me" and ask for a refund.  No, the very first e-mail he sent to me accused me of committing fraud.  Why? Because we state that for ONE of the FIVE methods, you need to be at least level 45 to do it.  Well, as it turns out, there is a VERY rare mob that is a bottleneck in the cycle that you cannot solo at level 45.  This does not mean you cannot do the cycle at level 45! It simply means that if this rare mob should indeed spawn, you will need help to kill it to continue the cycle.  For apparently not placing a disclaimer in my auction and on my web page, Mr. Vavic e-mailed me and accused me of fraud, and of course asked for a refund.  When someone approaches me like that, I will not give them a refund purely on principle, even though I'm only saving $5.<br><br>Yes, it is true that in my reply to his e-mail accusing me of fraud, there was one sentence that had "You can't possibly know WTF you are doing" in it.  One of the statements in his e-mail suggested he DOESN'T know WTF he is talking about: he said that "casters do not get invis until level 8." He was criticizing another of our methods, saying we misrepresented those because casters don't get invis until level 8, not level 4! Of course, I set him straight on that issue in a big hurry.  I would think that only complete newbies would make a statement like that.  He was apparently quite insulted by my using the abbreviation "WTF" and he told me he didn't think it was good to treat customers like that.  Even customers who accuse you of fraud Ratko? Ratko then e-mails me back, asking me to spell out WTF for him.  So I did! This guy had a lot of nerve contacting me for the first time for a refund by accusing me of fraud, and had even BIGGER nerve to feel that I had wronged HIM by replying with "WTF" in a sentence.  So yes, I spelled it out to him.<br><br>As to your car AC analogy, you are completely wrong sir.  Here is a proper analogy: you buy a car with AC, and the brochure for the car says the AC will maintain a comfortable, 70 degree temperature.  You drive through Death Valley in 125 degree weather, and the AC is not able to bring the temperature in the car down to 70 degrees.  In 99%+ of conditions, it can though.  By your non-logic Ratko, you should accuse the automobile manufacturer of fraud and tell the public they are running a scam, and demand your money back.  After all, the AC was not able to get the temperature down to 70 degrees during that .0001% of the time when you drive through Death Valley in August at 3pm!! This is irrational, unreasonable nitpicking, nothing more.<br><br>In any case, I clearly did not commit fraud.  However, this post is most certainly, legally, libel.  "Khalidorr's Platinum guide is scam" is the title of the post.  You've accused me of fraud, now please explain how this guide is a scam.  And explain why you posted the part of your e-mail that contains details on one of the methods in Khalidorr's guide.<br><br>Before I saw this post, I killfiled your e-mail address because I was sick of dealing with you.  I planned on killfiling any more e-mail addresses you might have e-mailed me from.  Because of this however, I am not going to let this matter slide.<br><br>Doug Reding<br>PlayerAuctions ID 'platfactory'<br>www.powerleveling.com<br><br>

              This is part of auction:<br><br>METHOD ONE: A cycle that produces drops worth up to 15K platinum.  This same 15K item is often sold for $250 in real cash.  Plenty of other drops in this cycle are worth between a few hundred platinum to close to 10K.  Values in real dollars for these drops range from $5-100 each.  You'll need to be at least level 45 to do this one. <br><br>Ok now, I am lev 45 paladin, can i go sowless visible in Trakanors teeth to find forager/hunter and manage to kill them (those mobs hit for 117 btw) and then when lev 50 mob spawns, I will go and solo it too? <br><br> Anyone that have ever encountered any of those mobs can tell you, and answer is NO, it can not be done.<br><br>Ok then that was lucky shot, now lets say I am warrior level 45, can I do this? NO, it can not be done.<br><br>Well 3rd is a charm, let me go try with rogue, NO it can not be done. <br><br>I really dont need to go any further, also I wont even mention other obstacles that you may run into as lev 45 trying to do this - many mobs are undead so they can see through invisibility, many of the froglock shamans in zone are sowed and can SEE invisible (those are hard especially when are in agro range on opposide side of the hill, they agro half zone on you  as you run and you dont even see it till its late), really lot of roamers so you wil easily get adds. I have seen experienced pullers in this zone being lev 50ish and geting owed by unlucky pull. Level 45 can not do this succesfuly. Some classes might be able to do those, but not really succesfully as you describe it.<br><br>I gave Doom just as an example, but thats true, as caster lev 45 you can not cast a single spell on it, so unless you plan to melee it down i really dont see how you will kill it, even as melee lev 45 you will get owned by it.<br><br>So now this cleares things up a bit seems that your system doesnt work in percentage you ment, you made wrong claim in auction, why dont you admit it and fix the mistake. <br><br>I mean just look at it, you are claiming that level 45 paladin/rogue/warrior CAN solo lev 45 mob, or even level 50 named mob that spawns after that? (i used those 3 classes because with them it is most obvious that this system doesnt work as promissed, not even close to that 99% )<br><br>And I am the one that has been called names and that I dont know what I am talking about. <br><br>Also seller addmited that for some of those mobs i might need help, but do you see that in his auction? <br><br>I have said this in e-mail and I will say it again:<br><br>You made wrong claim in your auction, and I want  refund for it, no more no less. You promised that as level 45 I will be able to do this cycle and it simply is not doable, and thats why I want refund.<br><br>I hope this makes whole situation clearer.<br><br>

              I have looked at the auction in question by request of the buyer and I honestly do not see any fraudulent intentions. I believe the buyer was upset with the wording, which is a broad statement "at least".<br><br>Here's how fraud is defined on Player Auctions: <br><br>Paying for an item and never receiving it or <br>Receiving an item that is less than what is described -- such as winning a solid gold ring at auction but receiving a copper one instead. <br><br>I see this as a issue between the buyer and the seller, if the buyer is upset I believe he should ask for a refund, leave negative or positive feedback and move on.<br><br>Thank You<br>Shane aka Lux

              Dude, EQMerchant you have serious issues man.  I have both of Khalidorr's guides and they both rock.  The uber plat guide works too so I don't see how you could say it's a scam.  And boy you sure need a lot of stuff spelled out for you damn.  Not surprising since you didn't know when casters get invis lmao.  <br><br>But on to your weak argument, here's something else you missed - method one which your bitching about is a *cycle* and it says so in the first sentence.  How many palys warrior rogues can do cycles hmmm? Don't you think when you see it's a cycle that should clue you in that you better be a class that can do cycles to begin with? And he's right a 45 druid can definitely do it unless doom is up not sure about other classes.<br><br>You wanna know how to get into cobal scarr too eh? Do I really need to explain this one too? Well gee maybe you go to the zone and wait for someone to kill the key mob and ask if you can loot it since they almost always have the key already anyway and the mob is always being killed.  There you go, you have the key at level 4.  Please tell me you knew this because Im embarassed for you if you didn't.<br><br>EQMerchant have you ever taken a marketing 101 class man? You ever see an infomercial? Ever here of hype? Sure that auction is a bit hyped OK but everywhere you look *everything* is hyped man.  It's called marketing and you just have to be smart enough to see through the bs.  If that was fraud than every single ad you see practically is fraud too and every company should be sued for fraud.  So this guy didn't spell out all of the requirements 100% big deal.  If he did you'd still probably find some little gray area to use as an excuse to get a refund.  And if he did spell it out the friggin auction would have been a stinkin book man.  And probably would have given out too many clues as well.<br><br>Anyway Khal you keep up the good work man your guides are the best by far, especially powerleveling.  This guy is definitely just looking for any tiny thing he can find to get his money back.  Kind of like a lawyer gettin someone off on a technicality.  It really pathetic.<br><br>Sharkey<br><br>

              Dude?<br>eh...<br><br>So what do you mean when you say cycle? Please explain, because here I only see camping forager/hunter spawn. Is it cycle because they are roaming mobs, or because they have few different placeholders? <br><br>Ever zoned in TT and heard someone asking : "Is forager/hunter cycled?", or maybe "Anyone cycling forager/hunter", hm, I  never did.<br><br>Depending on the equipment some classes can't do this "cycle" solo even on lev 50, and basicly every non-tracking classs will have hard time doing this sucesfully at any level, especially when named pops. But that aside, its funny how did we came from: anyone can do this at lev 45, to: well at least druid can do it. Where did rest of the classes go? <br><br>Maybe put in the add "This is high level cycle, but if you are druid you will be able to do it even as low as lev 45".<br><br>Cobalt Scar part I mentioned just as another example of poor writen guide, I know how to get in, but some pople don't, and my point was that lev 4 can't do it by himself. <br><br>In general none of those methods work as promised, I find it hard to beleive that anyone can make PP by those methods, (maybe in first month Velious was relised), but if you claim you made huge PP, congrats, but at least on my server,  camps that are mentioned in guide are overcamped by newbies, which made all those items worthless, they dont sell nearly as much as listed.<br><br>Cobalt Scar method doesnt  work all that good either, people sell items needed for quest twice as much as listed in guide, and most of those people there won't sell'em at all, so time you spend getting those items honestly isn't worth it.<br><br>I said this to seller, and I'm repeating it again, I didnt like the guide, but the reason of my complaints are dyscrepancies between auction, and guide I received, not the quality of the guide itself.<br><br>As for marketing part, i didnt phone ordered  "Chia Pet", I made bid on auction. There is difference there, seller needs to deliver everything as auctioned. (Well on that ford explorer comercial there was Buggs Bunny in there, i went to dealership spent 30k for it, should I expect to have Buggs in the trunk?).<br><br>As posted above, Shane claims that this auction is valid, and even though I disagree,  it seems nothing can be done on this matter, and I will not post on this topic again.<br><br>I still think those claims are wrong, but at least I hope that some of the potential buyers of the guide will see this in a same way I did, or at least have heads up in a way what to expect from it.<br><br>Dude, thats about it.<br><br>I hate that word =)<br><br>

              Well hello, Brent! How are you?<br><br>"Stay away from any of his guides is my only advice, because you will be unhappy with the product."<br><br>Yes, and my 90 all positive, zero neutral or negative feedback rating here on Player Auctions certainly reflects the fact that people are dissatisfied with guides I offer.  My 629 positive, 5 neutral and zero negative feedback on eBay also reflects the fact that people are dissatisfied with me as well I suppose.<br><br>Like Ratko though Brent, you failed to explain the circumstances behind your "refund request." Ratko came to me first accusing me of fraud, while you sir said the "method didn't work."<br><br>Anyone remember the shark meat quest???<br><br>Anyone think you couldn't get from level 1-25 in one day and make hundreds of plat per hour in the process??<br><br>I have a list a mile long of people who did just that.  Brent here e-mails me and says it "doesn't work." I explain to him that it does in fact work, and what does he do? He goes and e-mails ALL of my bidders on eBay telling them that I am a scammer (again, my feedback certainly reflects that, right?) and that my guide is a fraud.  I found TWO EQ websites, one registered to Brent and another with his NAME in the URL that had the shark meat quest listed on them.  The real reason for his refund request was because he already knew about the method, NOT because it didn't work, and he knows it.  We did not guarantee that you would not know about the method.  Any guide which made a guarantee like that could be stolen easily by simply saying "I already knew about it.  Give me my money back." So, Brent decided to come up with every excuse in the book to get a refund, and lied non-stop in the process.  First it was that it didn't work, then it was that they nerfed it on his server only, which was BS, then he tells me that it's the TEST server he plays on and it was nerfed there WHEN THE TEST SERVER WAS THE ONLY PLACE IT *WASN'T* NERFED!! Brent is a thief, and the only reason he got his money back is because of the fact that he was e-mailing all of my bidders and I had tired of the whole thing.  He stood to cost me a lot more than the price of his guide.<br><br>All the players who e-mailed asking for a refund after it WAS nerfed, received a prompt, no questions asked refund.  Brent was not in this group.<br><br>It would certainly be easier to just give refunds to thieves such as Brent, and nitpickers such as Ratko, rather than refuse to on principle.  The amount of money I made on their respective guides was $9 and $5.80 respectively.  Certainly, the time invested in denying their refund is not worth the money.  It's also not worth potential lost sales when unethical individuals such as these go on a smear campaign when you wont cave in and give them a refund that they do not deserve.  However, even if it does cost me more money and time standing firm, I feel I am doing the right thing in not caving in to these people.<br><br>My feedback speaks for itself.<br><br>Doug Reding<br>Player Auctions ID "platfactory"<br>eBay ID "directnutrition"<br><br>

I do not know his eBay or any other auction ID's or I would post them.  If Brent is even a tiny bit dissatisfied, he will demand his money back or report you to an auction site for fraud.  Threats will fly from him.  If he does not get his way, he will e-mail all of your bidders for every auction you have running, telling the bidder that you are a con, fraud, snake oil salesman, etc.  I still have forwarded e-mails from customers who received such e-mails from Brent.<br><br>A person does not get an eBay feedback rating of 629 positives with ZERO negatives by offering poor customer service, poor products, etc.  You wanted something free sir, and I was not going to stand for it.<br><br>"It was a false guide, and the guide did not work. I told him this, and he replied to me cussing me out, telling me I was a moron."<br><br>Please explain to anyone reading this how the shark meat quest in GF did not work.  Tell them how you couldn't get levels or platinum off of it.  I'd really like to hear this; I have been waiting 3 months with no explanation for this claim.  And you know I did not cuss you out until I got an e-mail from one of my bidders, with an attachment.  That attachment was an e-mail from you, telling the person that I was a scam artist (despite my 600+ feedback) and that my guide was a fraud.  This done purely out of spite, because I would not give you your money back based first on the claim that you couldn't make enough plat with it, then that you couldn't make enough plat with it because you play on the TEST server, then just "because" after I tried it on the test server and it worked just as well as any other server! Ironically, if you really DO play on the test server, then you got an additional 10 days out of it before the patch! For anyone who does not know - turn in 4 shark meat to Galin Woodwind outside the warriors guild in Kelethin and you receive money and a weapon, as well as great XP.  For a time, shark meat could be purchased in Thurdadin, and a full trip with deluxe sewing kits on person and in the bank would get you from level 1-15 in a matter of hours, while simultaneously making about 300 plat per hour.  1-25 in a day was easily possible if one did this for about 14-16 hours.  It worked beautifully until Galin was removed from the game.  They left him on the test server though! After the next patch, shark meat was removed from Thurgadin.  My guide was extremely detailed and worked superbly pre-nerf.  It made Tumpy Tonics look like a joke.<br><br>"I replied angrily i'm sure. After telling him that I was going to send the emails and report him to ebay, he sent me my refund."<br><br>I did not ever send him a refund based on eBay.  eBay would not have helped him.  They wont force a refund simply because you don't like an item.  I was not worried about eBay.  I gave him the refund to get him to quit e-mailing my bidders.  He was going to cost me a lot of money.  I would say that the reason you received a refund Brent was BLACKMAIL, plain and simple.<br><br><br>"He then Calls my house at 1:00 in the morning. Waking up me, my sleeping child, and my wife.  Tells me, I have you address, then tells me my address. Tells me I had better quit posting about him. And that i'd better watch my back.  I hang up on him, and he calls me back reapeating the same stuff. NEVER identifying himself, or WHY he is calling, WHAT I posted, or ANY other information."<br><br>Honestly, after 2 months I thought I'd never have to deal with this guy again.  He came VERY close to crossing the line with me after e-mailing all of my bidders.  This one was the final straw.  Immediately after I read that post, I knew who had made it.  I did a bit of research to find his information, and then I called him and told him his name, address, and phone number, and that with that information I have every piece of information needed to have him served at any time.  So, unless he did not want to be sued, I demanded he remove the post and never post anything, e-mail anything to anyone, etc. regarding me EVER again.  Mr. Copeland did not like being told all of this in no uncertain terms apparently, so he decides to sink even lower and post that I "threatened his family." What a real piece of work you are, Brent.<br><br>"Please keep ALL of this in mind whenver you see his name."<br><br>Ditto that with Brent Copeland.  People here can see my feedback on both Player Auctions and eBay.  They are smart enough to see through someone who comes in hear and anonymously libels anther person.  Who do you honestly believe people will find more credible? Someone who posts using their real name, with a perfect feedback rating of 90 on Player Auctions and 629 on eBay, or someone posting anonymous vitriol under the screen name "cheezypoof"?<br><br>I rest my case.<br><br>Doug Reding<br>Player Auctions ID 'platfactory'<br><P ID="edit"><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>Edited by platfactory on 08/11/01 01:07 AM (server time).</EM></FONT></P>
