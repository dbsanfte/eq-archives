              the basis of the post is that TDE are asses when it comes to sharing spawns, they will not reconize any other guild raid period, i've been up to fear 4 times myself, 1st question always asked, is Cazic Thul up, no TDE killed him during the week, next raid, same thing, next raid same thing, and also aparently TDE and Sanctuary belive they are the only people on the server that are able to kill both Venril Sathir and Trak, while trak may be true VS isn't but they refuse to let anyone else have the spawn and IMO they should be give 1 warning to share the spawns and then have their accounts baned for a week for each adition offence, sorry, but this isn't your server and Cazic Thul, VS, and Trak aren't your spawns.<br><br>

              Have you heard about the Agreement TDE & Sanct has???? They alternate week by week between Trak & another spawn. Like no other guild is capable of taking either spawn down, which is complete BS, sure it might take a couple guilds together to do it but they don't own these spawns! I read how someone is going to be writing Verant on this issue, I to will be sending off an email and I suggest everyone else that cares do the same.<br><br>

              OK this is getting very disheartening hearing all this negative stuff about how Sanct and TDE wont share spawns.  I posted a rather lengthy message on Sanct's board to Sasandra concerning.  I will be more curt this time.  If you want a spawn - take it.  Very simple.  Neither TDE nor Sanct will push out a mobilizing raid on a spawn.  But keep in mind these mobs will not last forever.  If you want to try VS - plan for his respawn - He drops many needed FA items, and the faster he dies, the faster he repops.  The ONLY reason Sanct and TDE (and Forged Souls too) are getting all these spawns is because we plan ahead for them.  I suggest that you stop whining and start planning.  I for one would love to see another guild or conglomeration of guilds take out one of the Kunark mobs.<br><br>And hey - how is this for an idea...  "Wait a minute, VS is dead - why dont we try severilous instead?"  Or Phin  Or Ragefire Or Prince Or King Or Queen Or name any one of the other 100 friggin uber mobs in Norrath.<br><br>My point being - that if another guild or group of guilds decides to kill whatever mob Sanct has their eyes set on, we aren't going to wring our hands and call them names, we will congratulate them and find something else to do.  There is no shortage.<br><br>On a side note.  Venril isn't easy.  There are only a couple of guilds on the server that have the classes and levels to do him - and they would need a lot of outside help.  And I have yet to see any representation from either of these guilds posting against us.<br><br>So please, by all means - take the next VS spawn - Frankly it would make me happy.  I'd like to see some other guilds in on the action - would make our life more interesting.  But keep in mind there is plenty to kill all over Norrath and if TDE or Sanct or Another_Scapegoat_Guild_001 takes the spawn before you do, get over it - plan better next time -  and try to kill something else.<br><br>Raelface xxth wizzie<br>&lt;Sanctuary&gt;<br>7th Hammer

              My beef is with TDE, no other guilds. These guys have been hogging Cazic for weeks and weeks now. If there is a fear raid in progress they will just break in and take down Cazic and be damned to anyone else in the zone already doing fear, they have had a monopoly on Caizic for the last couple months and wont let anyone else kill him because they know the min he pops and they make sure they bring him down every single time.

              *chuckle* while I thought I'd never find myself in a position to do so - I have to stand up for TDE on this one.  TDE got the last Cazik spawn, true - but I think the one before that they got was like a month ago.  Not too long ago, (like 2 weeks ago) if memeory serves, CT was up for a good 3 days before anyone decided to take him down - and I think it was a pickup raid that did bring him down.  And about 3 weeks ago - it was another pickup raid that took him down.  I dont think you can really point fingers at TDE and say they are monopolizing a spawn when they've only killed him twice in a month - on a one week week spawn - with lots of patches in between...<br><br>Raelface xxth wizzie<br>&lt;Sanctuary&gt;<br>7th Hammer

              well as im too low for any dragon or plane raids, when i am i will take my guild up there or over there or wherever.  Emerald flame, if i were you i would plan your raid the second that cazic should spawn.  If tde or sanc are up there, screw em (no disrespect to either guild, i have a rl friend who is tied up with them) and break the plane and go for cazic.  And btw in emeralds defense, there are numerous posts about Tde not so much Sanc reminding them to share high lvl spawns.  But im sure TDE is a great guild, even tho a bit bad at times, you guys know your doing something wrong when post like this are brought up.  Keep that in mind when deciding to raid somethingrather.

              Am I the only one thinking GM's need to come in and ban all members of this guild from Fear? Sheesh guys, learn to share.<br><br>Hmmmmm... Sheesh guy, learn to GET INFO BEFORE YOU POST =p<br><br>First time i been to this place but i guess Xian is some sort of admin or something (considering he has over 90% of the posts on this board) (sarcasm), and i'm surprise someone who seems to have as little insigt on the server`s activities could put something like that in news section. (recommending to ban a guild from a zone when you have no clue... well...maybe you shouldn`t be admin of an EQ board)<br><br>YES, TDE kills cazic pretty much every time we can (need to since we are actively working on epics), but since when is it a crime to kill a mob that is up and NO ONE ELSE is killing? It's not like we prevent anyone from trying (2 people from guild who are in competition with TDE on server posted truth about how cazic died in last month or so). You blaming us for being efficient? For trying to complete epics? For killing 1 damn mob in this game???<br><br>CT is not the only uber mob in EQ (far from it). If TDE has it`s mind on killing cazic at a certain point in time, we will get him very often because we CAN mobilize fast and efficiently clean fear in less than 4 hours. Until at least we get a few skin for wizzy epics, CT will stay on TDE mob's hotlist, but meanwhile we haven't done inno in a while, vox/nag are up pretty much all the time on 7th (TDE even has to set up twink naggy raids to clear to ragefire cause no one else is killing him), how about instead of complaining about "your" mob, you try one of the other one? (then again i'm pretty certain the person who started this CT thing has an item they want from CT). Well guess what, some of our wizzy also need CT to be down and to help them our guild will bring him down as much as possible when we know he's up (not our fault we are efficient at raiding and can mobilize fast for him) We will not rush in a plane when someone is in, or try to push people out of fear to get CT, but we will keep trying him as long as we need for epics (blame verant, not us ;P), again not our fault that we CAN ACTUALY KILL HIM, and not only talk about it. ;P<br><br>But anyway, i don't get how people can get pissed at uber mobs being dead on a server like 7th.... for god's sake, on most servers, all uber mobs are dead in 24 hours after a patch, on 7th most the time they are up and waiting to be killed. Yes that particular mob (CT) has been killed a lot recently by TDE (but no only by TDE as lead to believe in the news page) and honestly we will keep killing him at least for a while still. Not to piss you off, but actualy to help our guildmembers complete their epics, and also have fun =)<br><br>If you're mind is so set on CT that you can't do anything else, then set up a raid for after a patch a beat us there, we won't infringe on an ongoing raid, but like i said CT is one of the "hot" mobs we need to kill to get important pieces for epics (chardok queen also in that category ;P) so if it's up an no one on it, you can count on TDE to mobilize and go take him down =)<br><br>Honestly, CT isn`t a big deal anymore to TDE, but we NEED to kill him to help our wizzies complete epic, for us it's not a big raid, we can do it pretty much anytime (yea prolly at 6am on a monday too)and we have no interest in preventing anyone from killing it, but we have the will to complete epics, and that include killing CT to get his skin, there's no way around it, we NEED to do it, and will do it for a while still.<br><br>If you can't compete with TDE mobilisation force (read ranadin ;P) then i advise you be patient a little and wait a few weeks, hopefully we'll get what we want and move on. Meanwhile you could do something productive like killing inno or vox/naggy, or set a shroum king raid, or go to chardok (even only fighting at zone in (well zone out really) can be a challenge to most guilds on 7th), heck now there's a gadzillion uber mobs to kill in eq =P<br><br>I agree that if your mind is stuck on CT, and TDE happens to be killing it a lot at the time, might tick you off. But gotta face reality too, TDE is a big efficient guild, we can kill CT, we need to kill CT, we will kill CT every chance we get, we are not trying to hog him or anything (we kinda outgrew CT lvl mob anyway) we just wanna have fun and help our guildies.<br><br>P.S. What do you want so bad from cazic that makes it a server crisis situation that TDE focus on him nowadays?<br><br><br>

              actually there is a big difference between doing something wrong and doing something others dont like.  The server reaction to sanctuary and TDE working out a solution to alternate VS and trak has not been well received by the rest of the server however you all complained about the 2 guilds fighting over the 2 spawns and begged them to reach an agreement.  If you want to take one of them you will have to do just what both guilds have had to do and that is to have overwhelming numbers in the zone ready to go when he pops or as soon as the server comes back up.  No one else has yet to do this and its impossible to do a pickup raid right after  a server comes up.  Some of you feel that either guild should allow you time to kill these mobs yet time and time again you feel the need to badmouth them when you dont like what they do then turn around and say that they should help you.  Bugger off or get your butt in gear and do something.<br><br>

              News posts won't be removed. If it is incorrect then a correction will be made.

              Then perhaps you should print a retraction.  Unless you do wish to be more of a gossip column rather than a news site.  Everyone has their own opinions, preferably made upon their own experiences rather than a rumor mill.

              I have to agree with woodmuffin, this does not at all seem like impartial journalism.<br><br>Everyone has had issues at some point or another with people.  Just the other day as I was cutting through neriak a guy rooted a guard and ran away at top speed, yelling for help.  Since I never walk anywhere without a pet, I let it chew the guard.  The guy then complained about me ksing his guard, he wanted help with a stone guardian that was aggroed on him that I couldn't even see.  While we talked about it and it was quickly settled when he realized I had only seen the one mob, if we hadn't talked and he sent you an email would that have been news?<br><br>If you want to be Lum The Mad, say so and call it www.seventhhammerbitching.net, but don't say that this is "news".<br><br>Leonardoh Cragsbane<br>Forged Souls<br><br><br>

You persist at calling what you printed about TDE "news"....yet, you then state you didn't report it as "fact". Hello..Xian, "news" is fact, not bullshit. You reported bullshit. You received 5 emails about the samthing on our server...Xain, how many people play on 7th hammer....I beleive at peak play times it's around 1700 or more, so 5 people's opinions make this news, but news not based on fact and not investigated in any manner..my, theres 1693 others you could have polled for opinions or asked for details....there are websites you could have surfed to gather informantion to support your rumors from 5 people. <br><br>You stated you were "appalled" by this as TDE policy...Xian, did you go to TDE website and READ our policy? That would have been simple enough, not time consuming, but you chose not too. You stated you are in favor of banning a guild, my guild based on what? Your "news" story that you yourself state is not based on fact? <br><br>Xian... your schizophrenic veiw of reporting "news" is not acceptable. This is slander, you put YOUR NAME to it, you called it "news" under a "headlines" title, based on what was RUMORED to you, you call for the banning of a guild. Yet you try to excuse yourself by stating you have no one else to report the "news". Xian...you are responsible for what you choose to print here. Who do you think is going to willingly accept your offer to report "news" on this site now that your've made it  a joke with no credibility whatsoever? Better question: how long do you think your "EQ top 100" award,which you gleefully speak of on this site,will last now?  <br><br>Choose, Xian. Retraction/apology..or a real report with real facts and evidence to support what you state.<br><br>Xian, please take to heart..only 2 people in Norrath have the ability to argue/debate skillfully with me...my husband, Baur (/kiss hunny!) and my guild leader, Ranadin.

              as just our guild alone we haven't done fear, and we have never been able to attemt CT cause he isn't up, we organize with another guild or 2 as well to do it which is why it is normaly on a friday or saturday, but regarless on whether or not we, or the organizer of the raid, posts the intentions to kill said mob it will be dead when we get there, he will be up to following wednesday regardless because of the patchs so we aren't cause him to spawn any less often by doing so, but that is the only time we can organize a force large enough to take down CT.<br><br>

              So per your two listed and self admitted handicaps:<br><br>1)  Your guild cannot do fear alone, not to mention even attempt CT...<br><br>2)  The time it takes you to mobilize is at LEAST 3 days, if it is in fact at all possible - and you are still not sure you can even kill him due to lack of experience and never having tried.<br><br>Now I read your 2 handicaps and wonder why you post and slander.  The main reason I see here is you simply cannot step up and bring him down as fast as others and you wish you could.  So you slander and post general lies for no reason?<br><br>I don't understand how you can hoestly expect others to wait 4+ days for you to kill Cazic (IF you can) when there are uncountable guilds ready to take him down if they feel like it as soon as he comes up.  (Sanct, TDE, Forged, Clan Seventh Hammer, etc)<br><br>I don't appreciate your guild's immaturity leaking onto a front page of a claimed "news" site - based soley on the fact that you are still a younger group of players and your own inability to accomplish something most others can bothers you.  It's wrong, it's not a way to advance yourselves as players NOR as claimed media spokespeople.  If you are upset at your own inability to accomplish something, then get off your boards, get off your behinds, and MAKE it happen.<br><br>Don't post bullshit and claim it as news - that's never an answer.<br><br>As a long time player I sincerely lost a LOT of respect for the younger generation of guilds and specifically Emerald Flame.  I not only find it appaling, I find it immoral and sincerely hope you can turn yourselves around rather than flame your own inabilities.<br><br>Good day.<br><br><font color=red>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</font color=red><br><br><b><font color=white>There's a shadowed stain on the west facade.

              Hi,<br><br>Although there have been recent issues between my guild and TDE, I find the entire introduction of this on a good news server to be pretty lame.  <br><br>On the topic of TDE taking Cazic?  You ever zone into fear when he and draco are up?  It's a lot different than when he's not, I can assure you that.  I can recall a pretty powerful guild having what amounted to a 9 hour CR in fear with constant DT's, massive exp loss etc, cause Cazic had a bad hair day and decided to take it out on them.<br><br>All of the peeps who are actually benefitting by zoning into fear, learning their way around, figuring out break strategies, getting class armor drops, etc with really not too much danger (It's easy to break with 2 groups when Cazic is not up) should really think about what they seem to want before ranting about a guild clearing him out for ya every week.<br><br>Insofar as a guild having some "secret knowledge" about when he repops and capitalizing on that knowledge....my response is, you haven't been playing long if you don't know that he pops as soon as the patches are done.  If you want to do a raid, make sure people are gonna be around when the servers come back up, and go in and take it.  It won't be easy, that's for sure.  <br><br>Other thing?  Why don't you try communicating in advance, and say "Guild X is going to try Cazic after patch is done, wanna come help clear?  If he drops the epic quest piece you're looking for, your mages can have it by default".  This gives you the benefit of cooperation, as well as learning a little about clearing the place with CT and Draco up, and lets you drop him and get the stuff.  This obviously is considering they say yes, but I would bet that if they were approached with an offer like this, they'd probably go for it.  (please note, I do NOT speak for them in any way shape or form, just tossing about ideas).<br><br>Now, the bad part is....this is supposed to be a news site for 7th hammer, and while it may be popular to have a TDE hate orgy elsewhere, this is NOT the appropriate place to do it.   Channel 2 news can't go on TV and say "God isn't someone gonna do something about organization X/Y/Z because they're rude according to others?"  Nah, just report the stuff, let other people sort out what it means, otherwise you have ZERO credibility as a news provider.<br><br>Frodlin Wisecracker (54 War)<br>Keliash Wisecracker (21 Necro)<br>Enlightenor Holyroller (20 Cleric)<br><br>Forged Souls<br>(We 0wN j00 0rC p@wn5)<br><br><br><br>

              Well put Frodlin, you bring up a few good points i forgot to mention myself =D<br><br>1) CT being down does make for easier armor farming and zone exploration, we know smaller guilds often follow us in planes to camp respawn, and got nothing against that, more power to them =)<br><br>2) the example you give about asking to take a big mob with agreement on loot actualy happened. TDE needed white dragon scale for bard epic, so we made a twink raid with a few smaller guilds invited, had a blast killing vox, TDE got scale and if i remeber well pretty much all other items were won by outsiders (patch/bag if i'm not mistaken) so yes it is indeed possible to work something like that out with a little communication.<br><br>Woon<br>Proud pet of gabtik02<br><br>

              Phobias, it can only happen 2 ways<br><br>1) The smaller guilds come in after TDE is in zone...there i would have to say we would consider that an intrusion on our raid and a) we would let you know b) we would go on with our plan or clearing the plane and killing CT<br><br>2) when our first people get there, they see you there, say so in guildchat and we do something else (i don't think anyone can say TDE ever jumped in on their raid, in fact only conflict we got so far was from people comming in on us and saying we shouldn`t be there cause they `claimed` that spawn/zone earlier)<br><br>On that second point i could had we actualy been asked many times to help do corpse recovery in planes, i myself have ran invis to safe spot to CoH a TDE cleric while Ranadin was dragging bodies to us. Then i remember once where we were asked to help a cr, and ended up clearing whole plane (including CT) while yeilding on all drops but CTs to the small guild. (they didn't plan to do CT, only wanted some armor). They ended up with a lot of armor (cleaned whole place) and their first guild attemp (and success) at CT with our supervision, i personally had a blast that day =)<br><br>Woon<br>pet slave<br><br>

              I am confused :)<br><br>I don't know the full facts, I think it's fair to say no one does. All my meanderings are based on this thread and 'that' news article.<br><br>So from all this, I have gathered that:<br><br>Q1. TDE have been flamed royally in a 'news' article. <br><br>Q2. Xian has moaned that no-one wanted to post news, so he thought he would.<br><br>Q3. EF complained that a posted raid was taken out by TDE<br><br>Q4. Long standing players / guilds are far too snobbish to think anyone could possibly know as much as them about killing ubers.<br><br><br><br>A1. Crap article, not news, unfounded drivel - EVEN if it's true, show some impartial evidence.<br><br>A2. Xain, how much has the post rate dropped on this site since the change? Umm, maybe you could take some blame for the sudden drop in interest  when www.seventhhammer.net stopped working?<br><br>A3. OK, from the info here, EF posted a raid well in advance everywhere possible. As this did not suit TDE, they took the mob anyway on another day, fully aware that they would stop the EF raid. My question is, what is the point of posting intended raids if Uber guilds aint gonna take any notice?<br><br>A4. How is anyone going to learn about Uber killings if they can't beat TDE to a raid? <br><br>I applaud TDE's response time, I really do. All power to you. But this is not a race, not real life, surely in a game, we are the people we want to be, in my case, fair, generous and outgoing. What TDE offers in defence is 'we are so damn fast, if you want a shot, you better join us, because there is no damn way we are gonna waste a spawn cycle just to let you assholes have a go' Surely if a riad is planned and posted, it's posted and therefore kinda booked. Sorry guys, come back next time, you can kill him easily, so it aint no hassle to you, whereas the other guild has planned for weeks, people have re-arranged RL schedules, but no, 30 of Uber_guild_001 were on and bored :)<br><br>Personally, I would summarise that to resolve this situation:<br><br>Accept the other party is not going to listen to your argument.<br>Try to co-operate rather than remonstrate.<br>Lose the ego's.<br>Re-do the raid planning procedure (if we all can't play nice, lets book raids with GM's, get them to control who gets into planes when).<br><br>Just my 2cp :)<br><br><b><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#006600">Ar</font><font color="#009900">at</font><font color="#00CC00">ho</font><font color="#33FF33">n O</font><font color="#00CC00">'Gr</font><font color="#009900">ie</font><font color="#006600">ved</font></font></b><b><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#006600"><font size=-1></font></font></font></b><br><p><b><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#006600"><font size=-1>Ranger of the 30th Season<br><br>Chief Officer of Darkest Destiny</font></font></font></b><br><br><b><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#990000"><font size=-1></font></font></font></b>&nbsp;<br><br>

              Phin is the boss of Kedge.  And as far as pre-kunark world goes, prolly the answer to all those people who couldn't kill Nag or Vox (his spawn is 12 hours and he does drop some decent stuff - though mainly FA items now)<br><br>Sasandra is right - Phin is not  a favourite target because fighting underwater is difficult.  In addition, it's a tough dungeon to navigate.  Nothing quite like having a_pickup_newbie_00 telling you, "Oh crap I lost you guys" followed by "my water breathing is going" then finally "my body is in the room with the thing in the middle" (or, my favourite, "my body is in the room with all the fish")<br><br>Anyway my point was, if it still isn't sufficently clear.  That there are tons of things that are in dire need of getting their butts kicked.  Especially on this newbie server.  Phin being one of them.  I can give you a dozen other suggestions too (Kunark) based on lvls/numbers if a certain God or dragon or whatever you had your sights on happens to be dead.<br><br>/tell Raelface "..."<br><br>well, as soon as I get out of this infernal country that is...<br><br>Raelface xxth wizzie<br>&lt;Sanctuary&gt;<br>7th Hammer

               I don't believe that it's particularly relatied to guilds, but the different type of gamers out there, is that some us seem to play a lot, but there is very little spontaneity in our activities.  Each hour is planned in advance.  So while I'm on every night, I t's onlt for a couple of hours and I know exactly what I'm going to do before I log on.   If we want to do a dragon, we set aside hours of one of our days weeks in advance, and then we check on him and have our fingers crossed and post on various boards of our intentions, and then the night before, the dragon is killed.  So, the raid that the more casual gamers had been looking for, is canceled.<br>That is just one example, but it's one that I lived through.<br>There are many things that we want to do specifically, just once, where we will go without sleep and reschedule our life around to do, just so we can do it once and know what it's like, so it's disappointing if no matter how you might try, it's taken away from you.  I don't blame anyone,  if I could play nonstop and could do the impromptu fun raids, I would.  In fact my one time I got to see Fear and  try to see Vox were unplanned.  But I usually can't.  Very often if I log on it's just for an hour to say hi.  It's almost as if we need a server specifically for the casual gamers that completely respect plans for spawns, but, well, then someone would come along and maliciously take advantage of that, so this way is better, that way we can pretend it's mere oversight.<br><br>Back to guilds, guilds tend to attract like players.  The "uber"guilds with a core of powergamers, are going to attract others like them.  Same goes for the casual small guilds.  Birds of a feather sort of thing.<br><br>where was I going again? I don't know, it's late.  But one more point, in order for us to successfully do a raid, yes, it does have to be planned in advance, and it's degrading, but the way it works now for it to work, is we would have to go to other guild boards and essentially beg of them to not kill the spawn so we can have our chance.  Obviously that idea is laughable, obviously we're just being silly because there are so many other things in all of Norrath for us to see.  And many raids do have a back up plan if the first falls through for some reason.  However, you have to take the amount of time that the individual set aside in their day for this raid, and then take into account the traveling time and reorganization for going somewhere new, and ofttimes you will find that we don't have the time, and so we drift off, or log off and go back to real life where obligations were begging attention anyways.<br><br>now why on earth did I feel like I had to throw my two cents in?  Oh well.<br><br>Eydera Ellessendil<br>Wayward Cleric of Tunare<br><br>

              Eydera, it is a problem admittedly.  I dont know how many times I have read various threads about how EQ is an unfair game for casual gamers.  But this unfairness manifests itself on many different levels.  <br><br>Lashing out at Uberguild 'x' Is, IMHO scapegoating.  I have no solutions to offer the casual gamer, and Verant's reply has always been to the effect of, "if you are a casual gamer, then it doesn't matter as much to you, does it?"<br><br>I think it's terrible that the uberguilds have been forced to farm low level mobs for their FAs - Whoever decided to place one of the 4 components needed for Wiz FA as a 5% drop on Cazik Thule outta have their heads examined.  Much better idea to increase the challenge and the drop rate on this item.  You can bet your last dollar that there is a consentual groan that echoes throughout Sanctuary every time we go to kill that boob (and Phin too)  I would imagine similar circumstance with TDE also.  Everwhine threads are rife with similar complaints.<br><br>Really the only thing you can do is talk to the various guild officers and state your intent and hope they agree.  I can only speak for my guild - but I am sure your wishes would be respected within reason.  Also try to plan your raids around respawn times.  Vox must have been a surprise though, since she is alive most of the time.  Backup plan - good idea.  Transportation?  Shouldn't be that hard to to co-ordinate if the raid leader is half-decent.  Hell, send me a tell, I'll help too if I'm not deep somewhere<br><br>Raelface xxth wizzie<br>&lt;Sanctuary&gt;<br>7th Hammer

              I wanted to say a few things:<br><br>Don't associate that "news post" with the guild Emerald Flame.  I don't even see where that association comes from.  If it is through Sasandra, then there is a bit of confusion.<br><br>Sasandra is an officer of Emerald Flame.  Sasandra has a green name on these forums.  This means that she can edit or delete posts on the forums she moderates.  She can do so if there are racial slurs, or a very limited set of things in the offending post.  This does not make her a reporter for that "news site" and it sure as hell doesn't mean that Emerald Flame as a guild supports that news site.<br><br>Sasandra's opinion is also Sasandra's and doesn't neccessarily reflect the viewpoint of Emerald Flame as a guild.  Some others in Emerald Flame agree with her.  Some do not.  I'm Sasandra's husband in game.  Although I see her frustration, I accept how things are and don't hope to change the reality of how power works.  People with power, they get their epics, or whatever thing they want.  People without that power, don't.  It isn't enough to have enough power to take out a mob as a guild.  You need to have that power 'on the fly' and not just "Hey, if we all work out our schedules, we could do that".  It is obvious that unless we as a guild or collection of friendly guilds organize a post-patch or spawn-time rush to take out CT or Inny or VS *AND* beat another guild that is both much more likely to be able to do it, has done it before, and can certainly do it faster, AND fully intends to do so, she won't see the opportunity for her epic.  Nor anyone else in the guild.  Although we as Emerald Flame certainly could go to Fear, clear the zone, and even take out the boss-man himself, we cannot assemble that full force 'on the fly' yet.  This means that we have to plan something 2 weeks in advance, get people signed up, have friends rearrange work schedules, and basically say "We would like for this to happen" and hope that it is possible.<br><br>We have stopped fooling ourselves.  If we post "we are going to attempt hate on suchandsuch date at 11am" we pretty much expect one guild or another to look at that and say "Hey cool, make sure to get there by 10am Hahaha!"  Or one of the guilds that can say "/gu hey, let's do fear, nobody is there right now" and up they go, they don't bother checking raid boards or calendars anyways.  They don't need to.  They have the power.  I base this statement on the experiences that we have had in the last few months.  It isn't that we think it could happen.  It has happened and it will happen again.  It is the way things are.<br><br>This is reality.  I don't even care if it's wrong or right, I don't bitch, I don't argue about it.  This is how it is, and there is not a damn thing that can be done about it, because we don't have the power as a guild to enforce any change.  We don't have the power to get to VS first, nor inny or CT.  We don't expect him to be up on the day we happen to be able to assmeble a killing force anyways.<br><br>CT / Inny we could take out if he were ever up when we were able to do the plane.  When I say we I don't mean EF alone, but rather EF and the other guild(s) that we usually get together with to do planes or dragons.  I think EF might even be able to do that alone.  Yes, we can do that.  We have the power.  But only on a Saturday or something when we have the full force of our guild to assemble.<br><br>VS - I'm not even going to start on this one.  It's been talked to death and basically I don't care.  It's the same situation as with Inny and CT in my opinon.  I know enough people that are of sufficient level, I've read accounts of how to kill VS (done my homework) and I've basically come to the conclusion that if a collection of certain people I know were to get together, have the time to set it up and go do it, VS would fall.  But, like inny or CT, VS won't be up.<br><br>Trakenon?  Jeez... TDE has serious problems killing Trak.  Needless to say Emerald Flame certainly can't.  I don't even see the issue on that.<br><br>Yes, there are lots of other mobs.  Velius, and a hundred other places.  But the epic loots don't come off of those, and I think that is what drives the desire for the old world and kunark bosses.<br><br>What does this mean for CT, Inny, or VS?  They won't be up, and we all know it.  Those particular mobs are killed every week when they spawn, or certainly within 24 hours after patch from what I've seen.  Every week.  By the same two guilds, Sanctuary and TDE I assume, from all the commotion... I haven't personally checked on who knocks off the gods every time, but the many times I have asked, one of those two guilds were it.  This is just reality.  Soon it will be fortitude, and some others.  Someone will always be on top of that spawn, if not Sanc or TDE.<br><br>There is a bright side.  I know they gotta be hella bored with these guys and sooner or later they will not have any need to do them anymore!  Yes, TDE and Sanctuary will eventually have all their epics and those mobs will eventually be left up.  Other guilds will start killing them regularly because they can.  Probably Emerald Flame will be among them.<br><br>**********<br>I want to respond to a disturbing post in this thread:<br><br>Hey wasnt a member of Emerald Flame the guy that ninja looted faydedar last halloween?<br><br>NO!  *#$*@*# NO!<br><br>I saw this whole incident from the first /tell to me as an officer of Emerald Flame to the end.  In the end, Sanctuary assured me that they believed that it was *NOT* said Emerald Flame member.  Oh My God you don't know how much trouble that incident caused, and after everyone had talked things out and gotten to the truth of the matter, Sanctuary said that they believed it was not a member of Emerald Flame that did that horrible thing.<br><br>I hope that Sanctuary supports that viewpoint today as much as they did after it happened and everything had been talked out.  If that is not the case, come talk to me in game and I'll beat a dead horse with you anytime.<br><br>

              This is gunna make everyone mad but I honestly could careless.<br><br>At lvl 1, you walked out of where ever you started and began killin trash. Still in lvl 1 you see this snake over there and YOU want him BAD. You race over to see what? a little lvl 3 guy whalin on him. He kills the EXPfull snake in 2 secs flat. WHY AREN'T you ALL over him yet about killing that snake???<br>Well on reason is that you kinda look up to him/her in a way because he is "bigger/higher" than you. The other is that he was there 1st on that snake and how was he to know you wanted to kill it till you got there and saw it die??<br>In the back of your mind your thinking "if I was lvl 3 i coulda got there and killed that snake faster"<br>NOT more than 5 mins later the same thing happens again......YOU are stinkin pissed and you make a rude jesture to that guy and walk off. Now your kinda thinkin man he's a jerk and he knew i was going for that darn snake and he did it to me again!!! You continue around killin things THEN all the sudden BOOM, the big "red" con starts after ya.<br>YOU are freakin out, knowin if that thing hits you once its all over....you are running like flies to SH@T on a moist hot summer day. Theres that guy who killed those snakes in front of you. You think hey he's lvl 4 by now he can take this thing easy. You flea over and /YELL like a your gunna lose your hell lvl. He stands there. YOU /YELL 10 times and he's Scratching his ASH(ogre war) while standing there. That red con has cought you now and BOOM, you=dead.<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT..........<br>When you finally get back to your cold body, that fat old ogre killed 4 more of those red cons and hes restin up. <br>You say, He man why did't you help me out there a min ago?<br>*you wait for a reply*<br>*you wait more*<br>*and more*<br>Supertankwithanattitude says, I didn't wanna kill anything in front of you anymore. Last time I did that you got mad.<br><br>Moral: You just got what you wanted. YOU asked for it. Note why you let him have the first snake. Also note how pissed you would be if someone let you die.<br><br>Only thing I knowis that on the Seventh Hammer, since day one, we have all done 3 MAJOR things (all of us):<br>1)Let ppl who got to that camp/spawn/snake first have it to kil.<br>2)got mad at someone or something<br>3)Whined when someone with better planning, skills, and manpower has killed something we wanted to kill.<br><br>I can honestly say I have have done all on one occasion or another but here is the thing, I knew in the back of my mind that hey, they beat me to the punch, they deserve it. And to top it off when I go runnin by them with that thing thats gunna stomp me into the ground, all i have done is gave them the pleasure of watching me DIE. <br><br>In closure, yes there will be guilds/ppl that kill something before you get there but how hard is it to get there first? If ya can't get there first, how hard is it to get your friends there 1st? If they can't get there first well I am sorry it sounds like you came in second place. Pre my existance on a server and in EQ there was a rule and "STILL" is a rule commonly know through out Norrath as,FCFS. First come first serve, if you all don't want soandso and or bob to kill sometihng GET THERE FIRST.<br>This is very simple! <br><br>My true hate = farmers who don't give up a spawn/camp for someone/group who will get EXP off it BUT that a whole new "?news?" topic. LOL<br><br>Like or not there you have my "opinion"<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Tagim Anbagem<br><br>P.S.- I am not even guilded so don't think I am even taking sides here, I think argueing on a MSBaord is alittle too late and all your doing is pissin in the wind but atleast ppl with sense can try to look at situations in a different view and apply it if it happens to them one day.<br><br>

              hehe i was too tired to play eq .. so why not read msg boards (sigh .. little TOO addicted =P) anyways who ever even started this thread is a total .. well .. i wont say to keep matters simple .. if you wanted to flame a guild fine .. flame a way there is a lamers section .. i must say that on some occasions i have been upset w/ tde but in general i find them 1) my friends<br>2) willing to help<br>3) respectful<br>has anyone who has wanted to kill cazic check with tde when making their plans to see if its already dead? or do you assume he is alive then go up find him dead and flame them? i must say that the only time i was in fear was to help save ds and loh from a botched raid .. (main that resque turned into a botched resque sorta =P) and ya know what? wow cazic was up!! and ya know what? .. wow people in tde were on!!!!<br>this doesnt apply to just tde .. it applies to any guild .. omg 3 high lvls are campin the ac in oot (single spawn basically as to try and avoid the xp reason in my example) wow they are getting rings for their twinks .. and bummer you had a raid planned .. yes it is sad .. i have been there .. omg 19 hours campin it and i got KSed .. sucks o well 12 hours later i got it .. im jus rambling on here cuz i dont really wanna goto sleep .. but what is everyones problem? you cant kill cazic? well you want his loot? (as seen by a post ..we want his loot who doesnt) well i can assure you that tde doesnt even need his loot .. man ive seen their chars and WOW .. is it their fault that cazic drops part of an epic? no .. i see lots of tdes w/ epics .. but outta all the items in the game those are a few of the only ones i dont see them ALL with ... i bet you all want your epic as well .. so are you to blame them for rushing in asap to get it.. if your jus lookin for loot .. most of the other mobs in the zone drop similar loot .. and ill tell you id rather dragon loot over god loot sometimes .. also what about quests? if your reasoning is you want cazic for loot .. wow thats sad .. tde ATM needs cazic for quests .. when they start farming him nonstop as soon as he pops for loot .. then you can flame away and maybe i will support you .. but im done now this was jus a rant because too many people are bitchin bout uber guilds .. and some of my friends are in them .. you know me i am chisel giantbane .. friend to all all a freind is pretty much my motto .. but this jus disheartens me .. i will sadly watch you camp some item for a quest .. and hear you get flamed cuz some guy wants him for his other loot <br><br>Chisel Giantbane<br><br><br>

              I for one have NEVER encountered a bad member of either Sanctuary or The Dark Exile. Their reputations I have to admit are there, but I have not personaly, seen any basis for it.<br><br>I think the fact that they are larger, uber guilds might in fact play alot in this. I have read their policies myself and been to their web sites. I think that what is truely going on is ALOT of lack of communication.<br><br>This is and was my reasons for starting the "Guild's Alliance Council"<br><br>Mutual respect for one another is in order here. <br><br>All guilds who start, start small and grow. We should respect eachothers place in this world small or larger guilds.<br><br>I can only hope that when my guild and our alliances now, reach those lvls to be able to do these spawns, that these larger guilds can do. We will be able to execute them with just half of the knowledge that these guilds share.<br><br>They should be used as examples of what is possible to do and learned from.  In reading their policies and not experiencing any camp stealing, slander, dishonorable conduct, etc.<br>I for one reserve judgement of these great guilds.<br><br>Perhaps if everyone had the facts and we had a better way for guilds to communicate or agree to communicate. Alot of THIS would not be going on.<br><br>The Raid boards themselves are a good tool to help with the communication between everyone on the server small or large, wheither or not the leaders of those guilds choose to use them and have respect for one another, will always remain to be seen.<br><br>If they publicly announce a "No booking" and "No Reading of Boards" policy then they set themselves up for the slander and badmouthing. Sorry to say but it is true. There will be no respect in that.......... regardless of how big you are. The fact of the matter is there are alot of guilds on this server. <br><br>I wish all guilds well and HOPE that a better understanding is met here rather than this continued lack of fun, mess, that is going on. <br><br>We are here to have fun and enjoy our time in this world....Right?<br><br><br><br>Azula Draco<br>Enchantress <br>Honorable Freedom Fighter<br>Guildmistress<br>Seventh Hammer Server
