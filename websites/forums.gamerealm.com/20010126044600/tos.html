      <b>ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY<br>
      </b>These statements represent a guide to the acceptable use of GameRealm
      facilities. GameRealm recognizes as acceptable all forms of data
      communications across its network, except where Federally subsidized
      facilities of transport (such as national backbones like NSFNET) may
      require limitations, or State/Federal/International law prohibits. In
      those cases, use of the network should adhere to the general principle of
      advancing science and education through interexchange of information among
      research and educational institutions except where specific policy
      statements exist. In cases where data communications are addressed to
      recipients outside of the GameRealm supplied network and are carried over
      other regional networks or the Internet, GameRealm users are advised that
      acceptable use policies of those other networks apply and may, in fact,
      limit use. If GameRealm is informed by Federal/State/International
      authorities of inappropriate or illegal use of GameRealm facilities and/or
      other networks these determinations will be binding on the customer.<br>
