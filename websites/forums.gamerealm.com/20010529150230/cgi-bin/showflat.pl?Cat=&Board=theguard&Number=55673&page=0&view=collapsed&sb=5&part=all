              Friends, Norrathians, Guildmates lend me your eyes...<br><br>These last few weeks have been trying on The Guard. We are facing our greatest challenge yet. As many of you have seen, or heard, or felt, The Guard hasn’t been what it used to. The silence in guild chat is oppressive. Good friends of ours have been leaving. There is a rift forming, if it hasn’t already. And the question is, will we let it tear us apart, or will we rise to overcome it, emerging a stronger, closer guild?<br><br>There has been much confusion, and little communication as to what has actually been going on. I have talked to a few people, and none of them has had a clear understanding of the happenings of the last few weeks. Therefore, I write this, not to vindicate or accuse, but in the hopes that through understanding, compassion and reason, we will be able to mend that which we love so much. I invite all of you to respond, and more importantly, to add to anything pertinent that I miss. It is important that the whole story be told so that we may move on unified and whole again.<br><br>I suppose I should begin with an early Monday morning...<br><br>I was on late one night (or early by some standards) when I received a tell from Zariabeth. She told me that she was considering leaving the guild, and eq all together. Only considering, mind you, nothing was set in stone. She told me some of the reasons, which I will not go into here. Suffice it to say, Zar was considering leaving for her own reasons, some guild related, some not. The most important thing was that she do what was best for her and for the guild. My heart went out to her. It was a big decision to make.<br><br>No one in the guild knew at this point, and it was far from my place to tell anyone. However, it did not remain a secret for long. The officers met with Zar that night for our weekly meeting. Here, Zar shared with the officers the same thing she had shared with me, that she was thinking of leaving. She was not sure, she gave us her reasons, and said that she still had a lot to think about before she made a decision. It was then that she went LD, leaving the officers to think about what she said until she was able to return.<br><br>In that time we did think, and talk. While I cannot say any of us wanted this to happen, I also do not think this announcement was a surprise. For several weeks beforehand, it seemed her interest in The Guard was waning. She did not attend meetings (either officer or full guild) with the same frequency she used to. She was also not involved in the events and raids like she could have been. She hadn’t really been playing much, just spending her time blacksmithing, which, while a worthwhile trade, is not all that fun. But there were other changes as well. She seemed to lack an enthusiasm she once had, and seemed, for lack of a better term, depressed. Personally, I was concerned for her, as a guild member, an officer, and friend.<br><br>Anyhow, it was then that we started talking about who should lead if she decided to leave. None of the officers present at that moment were eager for the responsibility or commitment of leadership. Not because we didn’t care, but because what we could offer was limited compared to one other who had demonstrated both leadership and commitment... we wanted Stubbie. For the prior weeks, it was Stubbie who ran several meetings when Zar was unable to attend. I know personally, the effort he puts into his plans. He is knowledgeable, respected, and dependable. (Technology on the other hand...) He was a logical choice, given the situation, if he would accept the position. That being the case if Zar left...<br><br>She finally did come back, and we continued the discussion of her leaving. One of the things she made clear was that if she did leave, she would leave it all: Leadership, the guild, everquest, everything. That would be hard on us, as officers, and the rest of the guild. Zar is well loved. Her kindness and helping spirit are endearing to everyone, and she is part of The Guard family. However, the question came up that perhaps she should step down from leadership, take an officer’s position, and leave the leadership of the guild in the hands of someone more capable.<br><br>I have said it before, and I will say it again. Zar was great in the beginning, when Valor turned over leadership to her. Unopposed, loved, committed and eager, Zar brought out guild out from a time of almost collapse. She brought some lovely new people in and we grew and flourished. I can’t say whether we would have made it or not under someone else’s leadership, but I know we did under hers. For that, Zar will always be close to The Guard, and for that, we all owe her our thanks and respect.<br><br>But times change, and situations change. As our guild grew and developed, we started to have more needs not being met. The largest one, and the one that made me think that maybe it was time for Zar to step down, was the need for strong leadership. Zar couldn’t offer us that. Stubbie could. I began to see this at that meeting, even though Zar was still undecided about what she wanted to do, and I think that many of us began to see that same thing. Thus, it was proposed that she consider resigning her leadership, but remain in the guild. Many of our members would soon be able to group with her, and many of out alts could group with her alts now. No officer responded to this charge, I think, because in some way we all felt the same.<br><br>I think I know why Zar responded as she did. Those words must have cut like a knife. To lead a guild out of dark times only to be asked later to step down as leader must have been some of the most painful things she could have heard. And for none of us, her officers who are meant to support her, and be there for her, when none of us said anything to the contrary, the pain must have been that much more. For this, I am sorry, and ask for both Zar’s forgiveness, and that of the rest of the guild.<br><br>The meeting closed soon afterwards, and we went on our own ways. Zar decided soon afterwards, or perhaps before, that she would indeed leave. When I heard that Zar was leaving the guild as well as the server, my heart was grieved. No one ever wanted her to leave completely. She was, is and always shall be a member of The Guard, and in her absence, she would be missed. When I heard it was because of a comment made at the officer meeting, and that no one stood up for her, I was ashamed. Ashamed that we could hurt one we cared about so much both with words, and with the absence of them.<br><br>No matter the reason Zar said her goodbyes, it was up to the officers to move the guild forward, and the first thing we needed was a leader. Stubbie accepted the role, and was looking forward to it. It seemed well received. Fizgig and Valor, who would finally be returning to eq, both supported this decision, and we hoped for a smooth transition with the backing of the rest of the guild. All seemed as though it was finally getting back together when Zar made a most unexpected announcement. She would be returning, and resuming her leadership position.<br><br>I think this is the place where a lot of bitterness and anger begins to seep into the story. Instead of being welcomed back as our leader openly, Zar met with contention among the officers. Not for returning to the guild. I don’t think there is a single one of us who wanted her to leave, but to stay as leader? That was a different question. Matters only worsened when Zar started changing our policies without even speaking with the officers. That only furthered the lack of trust and comradery between all of us. And how did the officers respond? By meeting in groups without her. Mistrust begets mistrust, and I fear there is much of that now. No one here is blameless.<br><br>I too, have my feelings to account for. Yes, I rejoiced when Zar said she was coming back, but I also did not think she should have just assumed leadership again. I think that was forfeited when she declared she was indeed leaving. I also think that, as far as the guild goes, Stubbie is more qualified for the position of guild leader. Do not think I say this lightly. And do not think I say this to hurt Zar. I know it must hurt her to hear this. And again I am sorry. But I will not tolerate secrecy anymore. I will not hear rumors of power struggles and forcing people out. I want the truth to be told, and available to all. If I have somehow misrepresented you, please, respond and clarify. If you can add something, let it be known. If there is anything you feel you need to say, say it now. I have poured out my heart in this, disclosing all I know and feel. If I have done you wrong, I am sorry. And if you feel that I have not fulfilled my duty as an officer, I will resign. I bear none of you ill will and only wish for what is best for The Guard and it’s members.<br><br>Nyn<br><br><br>

              I feel that something as big as naming a new leader should be left to the guild as a whole, not just the officers.  I understand your points Nyn, but I don't agree with the officers making the decision of Stubbie being the leader.  I agree that Stubbie is more than qualified, as are a few others in the guild.  I am not saying I don't want Stubbie to be the leader, what I'm saying is it isn't fair to everyone if the officers make this decison on their own.  The vote must go on on Tuesday.<br><br><font color=red> Addriana Darkseeker<br> level 30 Erudite Paladin<br>Holy Knight of the Guard</font color=red><br><br><font color=orange>Kajana <br>level 22 Wood Elf Druid<br>Young Tree Hugger</font color=orange><br><br><font color=black>Peiana<br>Level 10 Troll Shaman</font color=black><br><br><A HREF="mailto: princessadriana@mindspring.com "> princessadriana@mindspring.com </A><br><br><IMG SRC="http://www.mindspring.com/~yeagley/_uimages/Addriana.jpg">

              Well put...<br><br>Nyn, u bring up alot of valid points, and I respect your position on this issue. Thank you for coming forth, I think this is the clearest representation of the events I've seen. But Princess is right, the vote must go on. The Guard as a whole needs to make this decision, and I do not wish to have the officers make the decision of leadership for me. I wish to at least have some input on the decision, and I think alot of peeps feel their opinion doesn't mean anything to officers or the guild (read Ado's posts). That is a bad feeling, I'm sure all can agree to that. <br><br>Again, I am not saying I know everything, but from what I have read, and been told, that is the impression I have gotten. If I am mistaken, please post a response, or tell me in game. Honestly, I can't wait until this whole thing is over, and I can just play again sheesh!<br><br>Elendos<br><br><br>

              “I think a lot of peeps feel their opinion doesn't mean anything to officers or the guild” I’m really sorry to hear you say this because it does. That is one reason why I posted originally and put up a msg of the day telling how to get to the boards.  So that those who don’t know what is going on will be able to read about it and put up their opinion.<br><br>At this point I don’t think voting is a viable option.

              Hey all.  I've decided to answer my question I asked to Stubbie, because it looks like he missed it.  <br><br>The main reason the leader should come from the officers is because the officers have the experience regarding the inner workings of the guild.  They've been watching and keeping track of things, and have been in on the decision making.  Hopefully, and officer would know what direction the guild was designed to go in, and what direction the current crew wants to go in.  They've been dealing with issues as they came up.  Hopefully that experience will translate into a solid leader.<br><br>I'm not sure if that's clear, but there's a shread of logic in there somewhere.  ;)<br><br>-Uncle Val<br>Valor of The Guard<br>"You want a stien with that?"

              In some cases that may be correct, probably most cases.  However, this guild is full of peeps that can be great leaders.  I've seen it while grouping with them.  Pandra, Reneww, Camaldor, Hanaman, Nyneave, Willsapper(when he was with us), and a few others have all shown great leadership while I grouped with them.  Sure, a couple of them are officers, but not all of them.  I know there are more than that which are more than qualified to lead this guild to greatness.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is, sure anyone in the group of officers we have could be a good leader, but why limit it to the officers when there are plenty of other peeps that would also make good officers?  I think there should be a preliminary vote to limit the # of candidates, then another vote to decide the leader.<br><br><font color=red> Addriana Darkseeker<br> level 30 Erudite Paladin<br>Holy Knight of the Guard</font color=red><br><br><font color=orange>Kajana <br>level 22 Wood Elf Druid<br>Young Tree Hugger</font color=orange><br><br><font color=black>Peiana<br>Level 10 Troll Shaman</font color=black><br><br><A HREF="mailto: princessadriana@mindspring.com "> princessadriana@mindspring.com </A><br><br><IMG SRC="http://www.mindspring.com/~yeagley/_uimages/Addriana.jpg">

              Princess, you've got a good point, but I don't agree with you.  I still think you're sexy and smart, I just don't agree with you at this point.  If I piss you off, I ask for your forgiveness in advance.  ;)<br><br>To use an army anology, those people made great sergeants, but would they make good lieutenants?  Majors?  Generals?<br><br>I know it's not quite that extreme, but there's a difference between a guild leader and a group leader.  One could compare it to the difference between Tactics and Strategy if you want to, but the fact remains there is a difference.<br><br>I'm not saying that those individuals would not make good leaders.  Willsapper was the leader of his old guild, he'd make a damn fine leader of a guild, but not necessarily this guild right now.  Whoever becomes leader will be walking into a tricky situation where there might be a mass exodus.  We need someone familiar with the situation who also has the capacity to be a solid "General."  Not a Patton or a Macarthur either, but an Eisenhower.<br><br>From what I can figure out, that most likely means an officer.  <br><br>If you want my opinion, that means Stubbie.<br><br>-Uncle Val<br>Valor of The Guard<br>"You want a stien with that?"

              Believe me, you have nothing to worry about as far as making me angry.  I agree that there is a difference between leading a group and leading the guild.  All I'm stating is there are indeed peeps outside of the officer ranks, who are qualified to take the task at hand.

                I know of many people that have come to read the boards but have not posted.  They have a variety of reasons.  The biggest of which is that they just aren't up to dealing with being blasted for posting something someone doesn't like over a game.  So I think it is wrong to think people don't care or aren't informed because their name is not seen on a post.<br>  I, too, think I am in a dictatorship rather than a democracy.  In America, any man or woman is allowed to run for president(as long as they have the pp's to pay for the campaign).  They do not have to have been a mayor or governor or anything.  They just have to want to run.  So, I ask, why not let anyone run who wants to run?  You need to know that of the many people I talk to are untrusting of 'the officers' now.  This has really hurt them.  They didn't get to choose stubbie or even know who was up for it.  Why not let the people decide?  We all have good minds and good reasoning.  We all have an idea of who would be a good leader for us.  What are you afraid of that you are so against a reelection?<br><br>We are people not sheep and many of us will refuse to be led in a direction we do not want to go.<br><br>Baleeb<br><br><br>

              In my opinion, the reason the officers should be the ones to decide is because that is simply the way things generally work in real life.  Ok sure, the people vote on a president, but anyone who knows what goes on knows that the electoral college really decides who the president will be.  These are "officers" chosen by the people to represent the people.  Now, maybe part of the problem is that the guild was not designed around a democracy.  Maybe that should change, maybe not.  But the fact is that, according to the way the guild hierarchy was designed, the guild officers JOB is to make these kinds of decisions, and be, so to speak, the voice of the entire guild.<br><br>The follow up to that point is that the guild members are supposed to assume that the officers are going to do what is best for the guild, and trust them to do that.  This means, in addition to other things, trusting them to vote on things like : new members, removing members, new officers, removing officers, and other leadership positions.  How much power do the officers have versus the guild leader?  Well, in this case the model is similar to our government.  The guild leader can override officer decisions in the same way that the President can veto congress laws.  However, if the officers feel that the issue is important enough, and they are all or most of all, in agreement, they can override the president Guildleader).  It is not common, as it does not build unity, but it can happen.<br><br>Now, in some ways the guild IS a dictatorship, so to speak, in that there are no re-elections each "term".  Once you are an officer or Leader, you are in, unless extenuous circumstances come up.  That is why we have officers who have had their leadership position since the start of the guild.<br><br>Finally, and this may seem like the harshest point of all, and in some ways it is.  If you disagree with this point that is fine, I do not hold it against you, but I will not apologize for it.  In the end, it boils down to this : whose guild is it, and what is the vision of the guild?  Don't get me wrong, we as officers, (and 6 of the people siding with Stubbie are from the original 10 founding members) care very much about our guild, and ALL the people in it.  But, it is our guild so to speak.  We formed it with a common vision in mind, and while we are constantly improving it, and using input that often comes from OUTSIDE the leaadership circle, we also must stay true to the vision for the guild. (omg i sound like absor, talking about "Visions" and such, heh. In many ways there is a very common thread between us though)  We are not a guild about ruling our subjects with an iron fist.  But we will not sit idly by while the guild changes into something we did not want it to be.  That is part of the driving factor behind all the troubles.  I will be the first to admit that maybe these goals and ideal, etc, were not clearly laid out before everyone from the outset as well as they could have been, but we did our best.  I care, again, very much about everyone in the guild, and value their opinions.  But I, we, will not comprimise our goals for the guild, simply to appease the masses.<br><br>Ok, I put that kind of harsh, but it is all laid bare there.  In the same way people continually threaten Verant that they will quit after each "nerf", so too people will tell us that they will leave the guild because of this.  However, remember that, if you feel you must leave the guild because of this, you are still our friends.<br><br>I will try to close with an analogy that might help to make more clear what I am trying to explain.  Rembember, it is just an analogy, not a model to follow by :<br>In America (I know not everyone is from the USA here so just bear with me and change the name to make it meaningful to yourslef), we all live by a set of rules and laws.  Some of those laws we agree with and some we don't.  But in the end, the set as a whole forms a country we are proud of, and enjoy living in.  The Guard is the same way.  We dont expect everyone to agree with us all the time.  But remember that we are out to make the Guard a guild we are proud of, and that others are proud to be a pert of also.  If you are not proud to be a member of our guild, then you may feel free, with no ill will, to leave.  The differance between our guild and the country we live in is that it is easier to join, and leave, the guild. . (well, there are lots of other differences also...)  But you see the analogy, I hope.  Because I dont have an analogy to explain the analogy hehe.<br><br>Nalaani Darkfyre<br>Magician of the 35th Year, but no longer Staring At the Spellbook (love auto-med)<br>"Taunting Attacker Master"

              While I cannot speak for those in the guild that are not posting, I find it hard to believe that any of them would simply not care. I know I for one have spoken with guildies about this situation who have not posted here. Yes, I believe this is the best way to display what we think, what we feel. But it can't be considered the only way. <br><br>For one, I talked to Zaratul today. You know, how long was that guy (and I will miss him sorely) in the guild, and he asked me today if  we had a website? He had no idea we had a forum! And how long has that MOTD been up? Peeps don't always look at it, it's the same color as the server MOTD.  I got all my information from Addriana on where to post, where the website was when I was being recruited by her (and Pathius), no where else did I get this info. How sure are we that all the peeps have the information necessary? Yes, I agree that the MOTD SHOULD curb that, but I don't believe it is working as well as it is made out...<br><br>I am not trying to be harsh or attack anyone, but it is unfair to assume things. I'm going on the game right now, and I'm going to ask everyone about this and see what is up. <br><br>Also, I need to know what time the meeting is going to be Tuesday.

              Baleeb and Adorae - Are you staying or leaving?  I'm just curious because you guys said you were leaving, and it sounded rather immediate.  If you're staying, good to see you, but could you please let us know?  <br><br>I'm not kicking you out, or saying your not welcome, but if you have decided to leave then please go.  <br><br>If you haven't decided yet than just let us know.  I'd understand, right now I just want to know where you stand.<br><br>As to the vote.<br><br>I am for an informed vote.  I repeat, an INFORMED vote.  While I don't know if this is a voting situation, if that is what the officers decide to do, than I am for it.  Both Stubbie and I posted messages of the day to ask everyone to read these threads and reply.  Even if the reply is simply "I have read this thread" I would appreciate it.  We did this so people would know what was going on, not to stop any practices.<br><br>I am not yelling at anyone.  I'm not mad at anyone.  I don't want to hold a vote on Tuesday and have everyone vote for the statis quo just because they aren't informed.  I thin that that is a valid concern.<br><br>No, America is not a democracy.  It's a democratic republic.  There's a big difference.  I've studied American History quite a bit.  It's one of my passions.  I love this country quite a bit.  I cannot remember a single founding father who wanted ignorant people voting.  Even Jefferson, the high lord of sufferage himself, wanted educated voters.  Voting without information is worse than anarchy, it allows the vote to be controlled through misinformation, and that is something I wholeheartedly oppose.  If we do have a vote, than I sincerely hope that every member takes the oppurtunity to understand the issues.  If we do not, we are doing a disservice to themselves and to the Guard.<br><br>The Guard was originally formed as a loose democratic republic.  What can I say, I wrote the original charter, and I'm alittle biased towards America.  I'm also not the best of writers and consequently, I never planned for a contingency like this.  In fact, I never planned for any contingencies. Neither did Fiz or Pandra or Nyn, the original officers.  If something came up, we pretty much planned on winging it as we go.<br><br>However, over time it has evolved into a loose oligarchy of leaders who try to listen to the guardsmen.  That's part of what lack of organization leads to.<br><br>We're walking into a tricky situation.  Zariabeth left.  Stubbie was voted the new leader by the cadre of officers.  Then, before official leadership could be bestowed on Stubbie, Zaria decided to come back.  <br><br>The situation is not a presidential election.  The situation is one of confusion coming out of our lack of official protocol.  We don't have procedures to cover this situation.  Part of this is my fault, and I readily accept the blame.  Part of this is ALL the officers faults, including Zaria, for not covering this in the revision.  <br><br>So we're in a legislative quandry here.  Zaria officially left.  Stubbie was made leader.  Zaria came back.  <br><br>So the question is how do we wing it now?<br><br>I'd suggest that we think for a moment about how the government would handle this.  Nixon resigned.  Ford took over.  What if Nixon came back before Ford was sworn in?  What would congress do?  How would the Supreme Court rule.  Think about it.<br><br>That's the best analogy I can draw to what's happened here.<br><br>Again, Adorae and Baleeb, are you still with the guild?  Just asking, because I haven't been told, and I'm not a fan of ignorance.  <br><br><br><br>-Uncle Val<br>Valor of The Guard<br>"You want a stien with that?"

              for what it is worth, that info is included in the informative section that all members agree to having read when they join the guild and are assumed to have read it.  All of that is on the guild website which only recently (in the past 3 weeks) came down.  Im sorry if they dont know, but it is assumed in the form that they have, in fact, read the info that is required of them to read.

              my previous post was to answer Elendo's question, or statement. Just so there is no confusion. again, all members were supposed to have known about (been told) both the boards and the guild web site.  I have referred several people to the old web site.  It is gone now so there really is no place to go for info on the guild right now. oh well.<br><br>Nalaani Darkfyre<br>Magician of the 35th Year, but no longer Staring At the Spellbook (love auto-med)<br>"Taunting Attacker Master"

              Sweet...if the meeting is indeed at 10EST, then I should make it just in time...I may be a few minutes late, so I hope that is ok. That's right after I get out of work.<br><br>And I agree Nal, that the reason peeps don't know is one of the reasons you named, sometimes all of them I'm sure. But assuming they know...that is a little dangerous I think. I was recruited for some time before joining, and had plenty of time to read the charter (which, I wish I had a copy of now) and browse the site. Members no longer are offered that. So, I think it is important we get something going again, maybe here even, so peeps can see what we are REALLY about.  And I think that all members would benefit from reading it again, and thinking it over, as a reminder to ouselves. If anyone does have a copy of it, please email me at jdgodd@yahoo.com<br><br>Wow, am I really this serious? What have I become? =)<br><br>Princess, maybe we could have u post it at your site?<br><br>Elendos<br><br><br><br><br>

              /e boggle<br><br>I'm so torn, confused, and befuddled over this whole affair and my feelings towards it.<br><br>On one hand, I am passionate about this guild's success.  I have spent tons of personal time to sit through 2 hour meetings that could be finished in 15 minutes, invested serious brainspace to work on guild relations, structure, and success, and busted my butt to make guild events something to be proud of.  I have read many of the posts here, and I think a tremendous amount of passion and investment has been expressed by many caring individuals.  These are folks who all want to see The Guard succeed.  For the guildie who wants to know the whole story, it's all here.  I will vouch that most of the facts presented in these posts are reliable and personally verifiable.<br><br>That being said, I have to step back and do a reality check.  It boggles my mind that so many personal agendas and egos can have such a tremendous influence on a number of people's GAMING experience.  To be honest, I often find myself sifting through some of these political details and sitting through long meetings thinking "I have to do this in real life.  Why am I doing this in my gaming time as well?"<br><br>Tuesday's meeting will happen for better or worse.  It's too late now.  In my opinion, we (collectively) lack a fundamental understanding of what the Guard is and have no vision for what it should be.  I have a copy of the original charter and was present when we revised it.  Each individual has an idea of what the guild should be, but no one carries that vision into the guild as a whole.  For illustration, we cannot say definitively that The Guard is:<br><br>A guild of EQ players or Norrathian characters (it is both.  Some people have several alts in the guild and some have only one character.)<br><br>A roleplaying guild.  Some of us are almost exclusive roleplayers while some view the guild as an extra chat channel in game.  Fizgig and I batted this around at one point, and there is a lot of room for roleplay between "What brings ye here, fair stranger?" and "I can't until LOTR opens in dec.!"  My own personally opinion is that we could do better at roleplay.  We should be selective as to what races / classes we allow to join, and not worry about "we don't have enough enchanters for raids - let's find some."  We should form guild alliances for reasons, and not because they do cool raids.  By the same criteria, we should refuse to associate with certain guilds, or have an open war with guilds that oppose us.<br><br>An oligarchy, representative democracy, open democracy, benevolent dictatorship, and so on.  On this part I think no one agrees.<br><br>These and many other questions should be answered before we settle the leadership issues, but time is against us.  We have to make a decision and move one way or another or the guild will implode.  The facts as presented are correct:  Zariabeth is one of the most generous and kind people I have met in game.  She guided us into a new vision of what the guild should be.  Her leadership style did not always coincide with the visions of other officers, and probably caused some underlying friction.  Stubbie indeed stepped forward when Zariabeth was unavailable and kept things moving with commitment and efficiency.  The officers asked him to continue this role after Zariabeth's depature.  Her announcement caused some distress among some guildmembers, and they asked her not to leave.  She then decided to stay, and made a fairly strong entrance with sweeping annoucements of new visions and policy shifts without discussing them with the other officers.  Some decisions and actions on all sides could have been wiser, but everyone has acted with the best of intentions and a passion for the Guard to be something grand.<br><br>So the chips will fall where they may.  The guild is too broad in vision and encompasses too many different views of what a guild should be.  Regardless of which direction we go, we will lose members.  Many who leave will bear no ill will towards the guild, but may recognize that it is just not the place that that meets the needs of the character.  That is painful in the short term, but necessary if a clear vision is to emerge for the future.  Who knows?  I may be one of the ones to leave, but it won't be from negative feelings.  The health of the guild supercedes "the needs of the few... or the one (gasp)."  <=sorry, I couldn't ignore that opportunity<br><br>So there's is my 2cp worth.  I look back over what I write and have the same thoughts that I began with.  "I am passionate enough to write all of these thoughts." and conflicted the opposing thought that "I can't believe I'm sitting in my office at work and investing this much time in the internal palitics of a game."<br><br>Just remember - Karana's storms fall on the just as well as the unjust.  His are the forces which destroy, but also bring new life through adversity.<br><br>Gurdo of Rivervale<br>Humble Servant of Karana<br>Events Officer of The Guard
