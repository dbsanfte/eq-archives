              The guy used to reply to my mails within one hour. After I sent the money with Western Union he never replied to any of my mails. He's trying to sell computers on the front page of playerauctions with a featured auction, and his name is Roberto Borias and lives in Tinley Park 60477, IL.<br><br> I'm now taking this case to the IFCC, link that is posted on the playerauctions site and takes care of this kind of scams http://www.ifccfbi.gov/ . It's very important in my opinion to work against these scammers and the more people that will report them to the IFCC, the safest will become this business on the next (hopefully).<br><br>

              vallonbuyer issue has been resolved.  He bidded on a auction to get back at me for different side sale.  First sale fell through due to other giving false EQ account info.  Since he bidded and Won pc auction that is what was sent to him.  Would have gave a refund but he bidded on the PC auction and is won it. I never scammed him as I have sold close to 10 PC's on playerauctions with all of them happy customers including shane himself.  <br><br>

He received the money and never got back to me (since there was no auction I had no proof of a deal and as I live overseas he realised he could just ignore me and keep the money). Until I won this bid for the computer. If this hadn't happened he would have never contacted me again, nor would have offered a refund of course. AFter the conclusion of the computer sale, he even threatened if I didn't provide a shipping address in the next few days, the auction would fall through and he would not refund the money nor ship the computer. Luckily he got my address in the next few hours and told me PC would be shipped on the next Monday.<br><br>The money has now been sent for over TWO months and PC still not received. During these two months I received one email to confirm the computer had been shipped, then waited 6 weeks without any answer from him. After another of my mails I got an answer telling me he was talking with the customs and I still didn't get any answer. The auction was for a $400 computer, and I sent $600, which means I sent $200 for shipping and handling and prompt service. Still two months later nothing was received with very few information about the going of the deal. <br><br>Finally as it seems EQSTOCK doesn't seem very motivated to ship this PC and take care of this case promptly, I offered twice to get a refund of only $550 with Western Union, where the other $50 would be for the WU fees.<br><br>I have purchased many items over playerauctions, where my feedback is currently of 8. I never had any problems until I gave my trust to EQSTOCK, which really doesnt seem to care at all about this situation. Who knows maybe using this board will have more impact than my emails to him.<br><br>

              Case is apparently solved, after several more emails, EQSTOCK accepted to give me a refund in two weeks, which you can see in the following email:<br><br>On Sun, 24 June 2001, Bob Clemente wrote:<br>> Well after further review I will be sending you a<br>> refund in 2 weeks.  Why 2 weeks cause I am out of town<br>> for the next 2 weeks on vacation.  Refund will be send<br>> via fed ex with a us postal money order.  This is not<br>> a joke this not to jerk you around.  After further<br>> review shipping is just way to much and customs cost<br>> is to much.  Now to settle this matter I will need<br>> name address ph# to get you your refund.  Reason for<br>> this is UPS cost to send PC is $308 to get it to. One<br>> which in no way I know you are not going to pay that<br>> much as I am not either.  Now I am ending this dispute<br>> with a refund.  If cant accept this then thats your<br>> problem.  Verify it your self go to ups.com and try<br>> sending a package from tinley park , IL 60477 to you<br>> with the demensions of 36 24 12 50lbs. It will show a<br>> value of $308. Now im not paying that much to ship you<br>> one.  Which in turn will show you didnt pay enough for<br>> shipping to begin with.  So I am ending the squabble<br>> with a refund.  Send the info I ask.  In turn the<br>> recent auction you bidded on is nulled and<br>> playerauctions will be contacted with a explaination. <br>> Now if in turn you leave neg feedback on last auction<br>> so be it im not going to use playerauctions no more<br>> and in return i will leave my saying as you refused to<br>> pay full shipping of $308.  Now accept this or not is<br>> up to you.  No joke no hassle your money returned to<br>> you when I return that is up to you as no pc's will be<br>> shipped to you for the said above reasons.<br>> <br><br>

              I offered a solution to problem he refused to solve it.  Shipping a PC out of the US requires to file alot of paperwork with US customs.  No PC from US can be shipped with a US operating  system under US LIC laws.  I explained it to him again and again. As it shows he didnt post the emails I wrote to him explaining that.  I offered a refund he refused it.  HE did not want to pay the full shipping cost of $308 to ship PC to him ( as he lives in switzerland) so I offered refund at his cost. He didnt accpet it so what is a person to to do.  Its not easy shipping a PC that weighs 50 pounds over seas through customs as it will take close to 3 weeks to get to him. <br><br>

              I would like to explain situation here as people are thinking that I tried to scam him on a computer.  Original sale was for a EQ account I was selling for somebody that tried to put a scam on me.  I sold account and turned over funds to the person he gave me account info.  When I checked account items were not all their.  At the time vallon sent payment and I allready accepted it to turn over to the original seller.  Original seller had gotten funds allready through western union.  Now I got no replys from other seller so vallon got no replys from me.  Vallon then bidded on another auction of mine to get more attention from me.  Now after trying to resolve issuse I said his funds will go to the PC he bidded on.  Now when I said you will be getting the PC instead of the eq account he agreed to that.  I told him I was checking with shipping and customs. <br> Now sending a pc overseas takes awhile like 3 weeks.  After explaining this to him and responding to him what was transpiring he still insisted of me scamming him.  I Sent 3 emails telling him I was checking with customs of how to get the PC out of US with out any laws being broken.  Customs are the type of people that dont get right back to you.  Now he went and bidded on another PC to to get more attention.  Now to me he never intened on buying PC's just wanted more attention from me.  <br><br>Listing each PC's cost more more than $35 so I offerd a solution which you can see he refused.  He insisted I was going to scam him again.  Now i sold close to 20 computers here with no complaints except him.  After telling him shipping was $308 and would take 3 weeks to get to him he asked for refund.  After considerations and seeing he would not fret and give in to paying that much I offerd refund of the EQ account sale.  As stated in my auctions are people who bought these machines from me and I have not scammed.  Vallon threw empty threats of filling more IFCC reports if I didnt honor the PC sale enven though he knew he wasnt going to buy the PC's. <br><br>As for asking for address so many times is I get close to 300 emails a day about sales.  It's real hard to manage all the address's that come in.  Second my job takes me out of town atleast twice a month away from a internet connection, so responses are ruff at times.  <br><br>So people who check this now know the whole story about this .  Would most scammers come to a board to explain? NO! None of them do.   I am no scammer and not going to start.  I just move overstocked  inventory for mine and my brothers business even at a loss sometimes.  Any questions email me for my sales and would gladly answer any questions.  To ensure my sales any them can and will be shipped COD to ensure your safety of the sale.<br><br><br>This issue has been resolved with a refund of the EQ account.  Vallon agreed to pay the posting charges on the 2 PC aucitons. Refund wasnt offered earlier as he bidded and asked for the PC's.   Both of us agreed upon that and this matter has been resolved in a civil manner now.  Nobody here intened to scam anybody and we both are on a common ground now.<br><br>EQSTOCK<br><br><P ID="edit"><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>Edited by eqstock on 06/25/01 08:57 PM (server time).</EM></FONT></P>

              What ever you wish.  We agreed to have his payment go to the PC's. Vallon wanted the PC's but as stated he found out true cost of shipping.  The first one he didnt pay enough for shipping.  Was short $150 thats a big difference.  The second one like I stated He bidded to get more attention and thats why I stated the payment for second one to be sent with in 24 hours of shipping first one.  That would have put me $250 in the hole which in turn he would not have paid me probably.  I dont know if you like to ship something out and prob not receive the $250 difference in  shipping cost and posting fees.   But to me that makes a big diifference.  But see you dont have to worry about shipping like I do you sell only sell virtual items.    Still I see no scam here as you state.  So go back to farming virtual items.<br><br>EQSTOCK<br><br>
