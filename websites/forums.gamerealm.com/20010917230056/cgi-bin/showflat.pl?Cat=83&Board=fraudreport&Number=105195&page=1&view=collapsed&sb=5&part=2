              Well hello, Brent! How are you?<br><br>"Stay away from any of his guides is my only advice, because you will be unhappy with the product."<br><br>Yes, and my 90 all positive, zero neutral or negative feedback rating here on Player Auctions certainly reflects the fact that people are dissatisfied with guides I offer.  My 629 positive, 5 neutral and zero negative feedback on eBay also reflects the fact that people are dissatisfied with me as well I suppose.<br><br>Like Ratko though Brent, you failed to explain the circumstances behind your "refund request." Ratko came to me first accusing me of fraud, while you sir said the "method didn't work."<br><br>Anyone remember the shark meat quest???<br><br>Anyone think you couldn't get from level 1-25 in one day and make hundreds of plat per hour in the process??<br><br>I have a list a mile long of people who did just that.  Brent here e-mails me and says it "doesn't work." I explain to him that it does in fact work, and what does he do? He goes and e-mails ALL of my bidders on eBay telling them that I am a scammer (again, my feedback certainly reflects that, right?) and that my guide is a fraud.  I found TWO EQ websites, one registered to Brent and another with his NAME in the URL that had the shark meat quest listed on them.  The real reason for his refund request was because he already knew about the method, NOT because it didn't work, and he knows it.  We did not guarantee that you would not know about the method.  Any guide which made a guarantee like that could be stolen easily by simply saying "I already knew about it.  Give me my money back." So, Brent decided to come up with every excuse in the book to get a refund, and lied non-stop in the process.  First it was that it didn't work, then it was that they nerfed it on his server only, which was BS, then he tells me that it's the TEST server he plays on and it was nerfed there WHEN THE TEST SERVER WAS THE ONLY PLACE IT *WASN'T* NERFED!! Brent is a thief, and the only reason he got his money back is because of the fact that he was e-mailing all of my bidders and I had tired of the whole thing.  He stood to cost me a lot more than the price of his guide.<br><br>All the players who e-mailed asking for a refund after it WAS nerfed, received a prompt, no questions asked refund.  Brent was not in this group.<br><br>It would certainly be easier to just give refunds to thieves such as Brent, and nitpickers such as Ratko, rather than refuse to on principle.  The amount of money I made on their respective guides was $9 and $5.80 respectively.  Certainly, the time invested in denying their refund is not worth the money.  It's also not worth potential lost sales when unethical individuals such as these go on a smear campaign when you wont cave in and give them a refund that they do not deserve.  However, even if it does cost me more money and time standing firm, I feel I am doing the right thing in not caving in to these people.<br><br>My feedback speaks for itself.<br><br>Doug Reding<br>Player Auctions ID "platfactory"<br>eBay ID "directnutrition"<br><br>

I saw your original post Brent before you edited it, and I printed it out, just so you know.<br><br>YES, I did call Brent's house and threaten him: with a LIBEL lawsuit.  I absolutely consider your first post to be libel, sir.  And the post that you just made and edited as well.  After taking one month worth of harassment from you and then giving you your money back when I was unwilling to fight further, you come back and do this months later.

              Here is your first post Brent, before I even replied to you:<br><br>"Reding.. boy that is a familiar name. It sounds like the same guy who sold a guide for the infamous, sharkskin quest to make tons of plat.  Not only was his auction fraudulent, he said he'd give the money back if the quest was taken out within 24 hours. Well, the server I played on, they stopped selling shark meat where he said they would the day I got the guide.  Took me over a month to get the money back, and the support of ebay to help.  This guy is a fraud, snake oil sales man, and when he screws you, he becomes a complete a-hole about it.  Stay away from any of his guides is my only advice, because you will be unhappy with the product."<br><br>And I submit to anyone reading this that if they ever get a bid from someone identifying themselves as Brent Copeland from Huntsville, AL, that they not do business with this person under any circumstances.  I do not know his eBay or any other auction ID's or I would post them.  If Brent is even a tiny bit dissatisfied, he will demand his money back or report you to an auction site for fraud.  Threats will fly from him.  If he does not get his way, he will e-mail all of your bidders for every auction you have running, telling the bidder that you are a con, fraud, snake oil salesman, etc.  I still have forwarded e-mails from customers who received such e-mails from Brent.<br><br>A person does not get an eBay feedback rating of 629 positives with ZERO negatives by offering poor customer service, poor products, etc.  You wanted something free sir, and I was not going to stand for it.<br><br>"It was a false guide, and the guide did not work. I told him this, and he replied to me cussing me out, telling me I was a moron."<br><br>Please explain to anyone reading this how the shark meat quest in GF did not work.  Tell them how you couldn't get levels or platinum off of it.  I'd really like to hear this; I have been waiting 3 months with no explanation for this claim.  And you know I did not cuss you out until I got an e-mail from one of my bidders, with an attachment.  That attachment was an e-mail from you, telling the person that I was a scam artist (despite my 600+ feedback) and that my guide was a fraud.  This done purely out of spite, because I would not give you your money back based first on the claim that you couldn't make enough plat with it, then that you couldn't make enough plat with it because you play on the TEST server, then just "because" after I tried it on the test server and it worked just as well as any other server! Ironically, if you really DO play on the test server, then you got an additional 10 days out of it before the patch! For anyone who does not know - turn in 4 shark meat to Galin Woodwind outside the warriors guild in Kelethin and you receive money and a weapon, as well as great XP.  For a time, shark meat could be purchased in Thurdadin, and a full trip with deluxe sewing kits on person and in the bank would get you from level 1-15 in a matter of hours, while simultaneously making about 300 plat per hour.  1-25 in a day was easily possible if one did this for about 14-16 hours.  It worked beautifully until Galin was removed from the game.  They left him on the test server though! After the next patch, shark meat was removed from Thurgadin.  My guide was extremely detailed and worked superbly pre-nerf.  It made Tumpy Tonics look like a joke.<br><br>"I replied angrily i'm sure. After telling him that I was going to send the emails and report him to ebay, he sent me my refund."<br><br>I did not ever send him a refund based on eBay.  eBay would not have helped him.  They wont force a refund simply because you don't like an item.  I was not worried about eBay.  I gave him the refund to get him to quit e-mailing my bidders.  He was going to cost me a lot of money.  I would say that the reason you received a refund Brent was BLACKMAIL, plain and simple.<br><br><br>"He then Calls my house at 1:00 in the morning. Waking up me, my sleeping child, and my wife.  Tells me, I have you address, then tells me my address. Tells me I had better quit posting about him. And that i'd better watch my back.  I hang up on him, and he calls me back reapeating the same stuff. NEVER identifying himself, or WHY he is calling, WHAT I posted, or ANY other information."<br><br>Honestly, after 2 months I thought I'd never have to deal with this guy again.  He came VERY close to crossing the line with me after e-mailing all of my bidders.  This one was the final straw.  Immediately after I read that post, I knew who had made it.  I did a bit of research to find his information, and then I called him and told him his name, address, and phone number, and that with that information I have every piece of information needed to have him served at any time.  So, unless he did not want to be sued, I demanded he remove the post and never post anything, e-mail anything to anyone, etc. regarding me EVER again.  Mr. Copeland did not like being told all of this in no uncertain terms apparently, so he decides to sink even lower and post that I "threatened his family." What a real piece of work you are, Brent.<br><br>"Please keep ALL of this in mind whenver you see his name."<br><br>Ditto that with Brent Copeland.  People here can see my feedback on both Player Auctions and eBay.  They are smart enough to see through someone who comes in hear and anonymously libels anther person.  Who do you honestly believe people will find more credible? Someone who posts using their real name, with a perfect feedback rating of 90 on Player Auctions and 629 on eBay, or someone posting anonymous vitriol under the screen name "cheezypoof"?<br><br>I rest my case.<br><br>Doug Reding<br>Player Auctions ID 'platfactory'<br><P ID="edit"><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>Edited by platfactory on 08/11/01 01:07 AM (server time).</EM></FONT></P>
