            <br><P CLASS="post">
              Get ready for some intense reading :)<br><br>1.01  Who is creating this game?<br><br>"Shadowbane" is a game currently being created by a development house in Austin, Texas called Wolfpack Studios, Inc.  Shadowbane has been in development since April 26th, 1999.<br><br>1.02  Is this a multiplayer-only game?<br><br>Yes, Shadowbane is a MMORPG, or "massively multiplayer online roleplaying game."  This means that, where most games titles only allow for 4 to 64 players in a single games, Shadowbane will allow tens of thousands of players to explore, adventure, and fight in a single game session.   <br><br>1.03  What platform will Shadowbane run on?<br><br>Shadowbane is being designed for home computers using either Windows or Macintosh operating systems. Support for console systems (such as the Playstation 2 and the Xbox) is being considered for future versions. <br><br>1.04  Can I connect with a 56kb modem?<br><br>Yes, a person with a 56kb modem and an internet connection should have no problem connecting into the world of Shadowbane.<br><br>1.05  When will Shadowbane be released?<br><br>We are currently in the early phases of beta testing the software for Shadowbane.   Completion of testing is based on a set of 'release criteria' (as opposed to a particular date and time) and for this reason no specific date has yet been determined for release.<br><br>To keep informed as to the status of Shadowbane, be sure to join our Shadowbane mailing list by clicking here.<br><br>1.06  How much does it cost to play?<br><br>The game CD will be priced in the same range as most other new game titles, and the first month of play time will be absolutely free!  Pricing has not yet been determined for additional months, but the service will likely cost around US $10.00 per month, per account (as with other comparable game titles.)<br><br>1.07  What if I don't have a lot of time to play?  Will the game still be fun for someone like me?<br><br>Absolutely!  We wanted to make a game that was playable and fun for casual gamers, but deep enough to keep the hardcore gamer interested.<br><br>1.08  If my friends spend more time on the game then I do, can I still adventure with them?<br><br>Sure!  Shadowbane's "Grouping System" allows characters to adventure together without level restrictions of any sort. (See the Party System section to learn more).  Additionally, leveling in Shadowbane doesn't take nearly as long as some other titles, so lower-level players can have an easier time catching up with their higher level friends. This helps level the playing field, making new characters as viable and fun to play as established "masters."<br><br>1.09  Will there be servers outside of the United States?<br><br>Yes.  International Shadowbane servers will be offered through Wolfpack's publishing partners (such as Swing! Entertainment)  and, in most cases, players will be able to travel between these servers easily.  For more information on traveling between worlds, read the Traveller Discipline.<br><br>1.10  So how does Shadowbane differ from other Massively-multiplayer titles?<br><br>Shadowbane is the first Online RPG to allow players to actually control  the virtual world.   Players can join together to form guilds, armies and Kingdoms.  Leaders can marshal their strength to build keeps, temples and fortifications and control vast sections of the virtual terrain. <br><br>1.11  What kind of activities can I engage in? <br><br>Well, as Shadowbane is really a simulation of a feudal world, the possibilities are endless!  Players will spend a lot of their time doing things like: <br><br>Adventuring and exploring the world (in parties or alone), <br>Collecting treasure and amassing wealth, <br>Study and mastery of magical and combative Arts, <br>Hunting and dispatching monsters to increase in power and prestige, <br>Walking the world ("like Caine from Kung Fu"), living as a renegade... or a hero, <br>Amassing a mercenary army and engaging in territorial warfare, <br>Acting as a diplomat, and engaging in political subterfuge, or <br>Founding a Kingdom and expanding your Empire. <br>1.12  So is Shadowbane a Roleplaying Game?  Or a Strategy game? <br><br>Well, both actually.  We've taken elements from strategy games (like city building, sieges, territory conquest, and tactical formations) and integrated them inside an RPG... Players can still quest, level and adventure as before, but we're extending the life of the game and its possibilities - adding a reason to continue play once the more conventional RPG has been mastered. <br><br>In a nutshell, we're expanding the concept of what an online persistent world RPG is. Rather than focusing only on the story arc of the single character (and taking the game no further), we want to extend the experience by creating a backdrop of political intrigue for players to become engrossed in. <br><br>1.13  What if I don't want to participate in the Strategy game?  Do I have to? <br><br>Of course not; at it's heart, Shadowbane remains a Roleplaying Game.  The strategic elements emerge later in game play, and each player can determine his or her own level of participation. <br><br>1.14  Why so much emphasis on player interaction?<br><br>We believe that an online title can be more than just a "game" -- that by combining the elements of an RPG with a service model geared towards on-going narration (such as a television sage, or a series of novels) we are creating a unique new form of entertainment; a new type of media in which the viewer can make the leap from "silent observer" to "active participant." <br><br>We didn’t just want to build a game; we wanted to build a living simulation. Shadowbane is dynamic, breathing model of a feudal society -- with all the cooperative and competitive implications thereof.  We believe that this will create the ultimate roleplaying experience, and that the opportunities for human interaction brought about by such a flexible environment will far surpass what one might come to expect from a more static, repetitive model. <br><br>In short, we don't want to give you “just a game”... We want to give you the opportunity to Change the World.<br><br><font color=red> and more</font color=red><br><br>2.01  What can you tell me about the World of Shadowbane?<br><br>The game of Shadowbane takes place in a fantasy world known as "Aerynth."  In crafting this world, Wolfpack Studios has created over five thousand years of recorded history, abounding with legends, epics, and tragedies. <br>Within the game, "Shadowbane" is the name of a legendary blade that is repeatedly instrumental in turning the tide of history.  A lost holy relic held in the same regards as "Excaliber" or "the Holy Grail,"  Shadowbane acts as the central focus of Aerynth's vibrant tapestry of war, tragedy and murder.<br><br>To learn more about the epic tale surrounding this mythical weapon, read the Legend of Shadowbane.<br><br>2.02  What is the setting of the World?<br><br>Shadowbane is set in the genre of "dark fantasy."  After millennia of strife, toil, and struggle, Aerynth suffered a massive catastrophe from which it has yet to recover...  Players are born as children of this new Dark Age, known to the inhabitants as the Age of Strife, and the game begins approximately one hundred years after the near-complete collapse of the civilized world.<br><br>It has been five full generations since the end of the Age of Kings. When the All-Father turned his back from the World, Aerynth was cast into Darkness. The sun dimmed and shrank as the World was buffeted with tremors and furious storms. The clouds let forth a seemingly endless deluge, drowning the land with a sickening rain of blood. Disease and starvation ran unchecked, turning the surviving cities into little more than festering wounds.<br><br>Then came the Endless War.<br><br>Brutal Warlords rose up, marshalling the rabble of survivors and turning brigand mobs into formidable armies. The Holy Church struggled valiantly in a final attempt to calm the hearts of the few innocents who remain, but the griefs of the new Age overwhelmed them.<br><br>Most of the knowledge of previous Ages was lost, and a new Dark Age descended on the Children of the World. Statues of wondrous kings lie forgotten, half-buried in the sand. The Great Library of Aerynth is destroyed, her once great Towers fallen. <br><br>Chaos and strife reign supreme. Some say the End is Near... and in this Final Hour, a single hope remains. <br><br>They call it Shadowbane, a light to stand against the Darkness.<br><br>You can read more about the Shadowbane backstory and the history of Aerynth by consulting the World History section.<br><br>2.03  How will history unfold?  Can the world be repaired?<br><br>The storyline of Shadowbane is currently estimated to take place over a period of five years after our initial release.  The game of Shadowbane is a truly dynamic World, however, so while our writers certainly have ideas about the direction of the plot, the exact fate of the World cannot be determined...  To a large extent, player actions will determine how events in the World unfold over time.<br><br>2.04  Once I subscribe, should I expect new content be added to the game?<br><br>Absolutely!  In addition to the ongoing development efforts, Wolfpack has a dedicated writing team known as the Story Board whose sole responsibility, much like the writing team of a television series, is to keep the plotline moving forward.  New content will be constantly added, and events will happen on a regular basis which can change the game forever.<br><br>2.05  What does the game look like?<br><br>That's a hard question to answer, but a number of good examples of gameplay can be found in the Screenshot and Beta Journal sections.<br><br>2.06  Will there be music in the game?<br><br>Most definitely.  Nothing sets the tone and atmosphere of an area like a good piece of music.  A few samples of Shadowbane's music can be found in our Multimedia section.<br><br>2.07  Will each “world” be a mirror image of each other?<br><br>No.  In Shadowbane, all of our worlds (gaming environments) are completely unique. When the Turning occurred, Aerynth was literally torn asunder, broken into an array of fragments great and small. Each “world” or “server-cluster” in Shadowbane is one of these fragments, a portion of the original world. Rather than the identical "mirrored" worlds presented by other games in the current market, Shadowbane will consist of many interlinked "world fragments" scattered throughout a universe, each with their own unique feel and flavor. One fragment might be almost entirely jungle, while another could consist of frigid Arctic regions. Imagine the different worlds that might result if the Earth were to shatter, and you'll get the idea. Unlike most other online games, individual characters will be able to travel between world fragments through magical gates and portals. The traditional model of distinct, discrete "servers" will not exist in Shadowbane. <br><br>2.08  Are there "zones"? <br><br>No, not in the traditional sense: the landscape of each “world” is seamless. We may refer to various areas as a “zone”, like a Desert Zone or an Elven Ruin Zone, but there is no “Stop and Load” time associated with moving between them. Instead, the world is constantly loading around you as your character moves, keeping a preset circumference of terrain loaded around you at all times.  Further, this area is larger than your character can “see” - so there won't be blind spots as you travel around the world. <br><br>2.09  Are there “bottlenecks” in the terrain where it is impassable and forces you into canyons or valleys to get from area to area?<br><br>In most areas you can walk straight from region to region without any trouble. There are some geographical obstacles, of course, that are just physically impossible to pass; some mountains are too steep to scale and some lakes too wide to swim. The only other obstacles to travel will consist of the walls and fortifications built by yourself and other players.<br><br>2.10  How do I communicate with other players? <br><br>There will be many forms of communication in Shadowbane ranging from speech text displayed over-the-head to a vast number of channels you can speak in. For local chat, text can appear over the player's head and/or in a separate chat window (based on your personal preference.) <br><br>Players will also be able to talk via private messages to other characters, members of their guild, city-wide broadcasts, and members of their adventuring group.   Players can also move these channel windows around or turn them on and off as they wish.  <br><br><font color=red> and yes more </font color=red><br><br>3.01  How customizable is the interface? <br><br>In a word: insanely customizable!  (Okay, that's two words, you got us.) Shadowbane's interface is designed to be as flexible as possible. Several windows will appear on the screen during play, displaying information and serving as a home for game controls. While playing, you will be able to adjust the transparency of each window, move them around on the screen, resize them, and much, much more!<br><br>3.02  Can I move the interface windows?<br><br>Definitely!  As stated above, the interface is extremely customizable to fit your personal playing style.  Any of the (interface) windows can be moved anywhere on the screen.  <br><br>3.03  How do I resize windows?<br><br>It's easy.  Much like the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) in the Windows and Macintosh operating systems, many of the windows can be resized simply by clicking and holding down a control tab in the bottom right corner of the window, then dragging with your mouse until the window reaches the desired size. <br><br>3.04  Can I move buttons off of windows?<br><br>Yes. Rather than having to deal with nested menus of control buttons, numerous "controls" can be dragged out of their windows and placed anywhere on the screen.  And buttons aren't all: you can also pull other items off of  windows and menus, such as your status bar controls (health, stamina, and mana).<br><br>3.05  Can I make windows transparent?<br><br>Again, yes. Tired of all your open windows blocking your view of play? In Shadowbane, almost all windows can be adjusted to any level of translucency or opacity. Any controls or items that displayed in that window will not be effected, though. <br><br>3.06  Can I make "hotkeys"?<br><br>Yes, you can assign your own hotkeys.  "Hotkeys" are keyboard shortcuts that give you quick, easy access to various game commands without using the graphical user interface. You will be able to assign your own custom hotkeys for specific Skills and Powers, game commands (like exiting the game), or even activating animated emotes known as "Socials."<br><br>3.07 Are there different interface skins?<br><br>Yes, actually.  In addition to the standard interface that will be provided with the game, a number of example "secondary skins" will be provided.  The interface for Shadowbane is so configurable that we even allow players to build their own interface skins;  this means you can swap out all of the art resources and build an interface more to your liking, just by painting new windows and playing with some configuration files under the covers.<br><br>Eventually, we hope to allow players an area on the website to trade and showcase the skins they create.  (Please note, however, that Wolfpack cannot support the use of external skins, so use of them will be at the player's own discretion.) <br><br>3.08  How do I move my character?<br><br>To move your character around, simply place your mouse cursor over a location and left-click.  Your character will proceed in a straight line to that spot.  If you wish to move continuously, hold the left mouse button down and your character will move in the direction of the cursor until you either left-click on an area or release the mouse button. Move the cursor, and the character will turn to match it. <br><br>3.09  How do I make my character run?<br><br>While a moving character normally walks, running is faster (art imitates life!)  There are two ways to make your character run in Shadowbane.  The first option is to click on the Run/Walk button which will place a walking character into running mode (another click will return a running character to walking mode).  If using continuous movement as described above, you can also make your character run by positioning your mouse cursor away from the character's position, towards the edge of the game area window.<br><br>Be aware that running will deplete your character's stamina, and once your character's stamina drops below a certain point they will automatically drop into walk mode.  The Stamina Control Bar indicates your character's current stamina level.  By walking a while or standing still, your character will start recovering stamina, and soon you'll be able to run again. <br><br><font color=red> and more more too :) </font color=red><br><br>4.01  What is a Character?<br><br>A character is your 'avatar' in the world of Shadowbane, the role you adopt when interacting with the game's ongoing story. You control your character's statistics, appearance, movement, and actions. <br><br>4.02  How many characters can I have?<br><br>Currently, every player will receive 5 character slots per account.  Only one character may be used in-game at any one time. <br><br>4.03  Will my character need to eat or sleep?<br><br>No.  "Resting" allows your character to refresh and heal between periods of combat and travel, but characters never need to "sleep" in Shadowbane.  Any consumable items found in game (i.e. food or drink items) simply increase your character's natural recovery rates of stamina and health.  <br><br>4.04  Is there Permanent Death?<br><br>No.  When your character "dies" in Shadowbane, they are brought back to life at the "Tree of Life" to which they are bound (usually in a nearby City.) <br><br>4.05  Are Names Unique?<br><br>Yes, character first names are unique on a server-by-server basis.  Characters who travel from one world to another will have their "home world" name attached, in order to allow other players to recognize them.  (For example, if Catherine the Great were to leave the World of Viriang and journey to the World of Dalgoth, her name would be displayed as Catherine from Viriang.)  This also allows players to easily recognize "foreigners" from other Worlds.   <br><br>Last names in Shadowbane are not unique: players can create entire clans of the same last name if they wish. <br><br>4.06  How do I create a Name?<br><br>The first thing you will do when creating a Shadowbane character is choose a name. Shadowbane characters, like the players that run them, have both a first and a last name. If you like, you can opt for an epithet (a term used to characterize a person or thing, such as Catherine the Great or Lief the Lucky) instead of a last name.  As stated above, first names are unique to each world fragment (or server.)  Last names are not.<br><br>A character's first name can be no longer than 10 characters, and can contain approved special characters (such as ' or -) but it cannot contain any blank spaces.  Your last name (or epithet) also can be no longer than 10 characters, but here both approved special characters and blank spaces are allowed.  Both first and last names are filtered for profanity, and inappropriate names will not be allowed. <br><br>4.07  What are Character Points?<br><br>At the beginning of Character Creation, you are given 30 points to help customize your Character.  Character Points are used to select your Race, obtain Talent and Trait Runes, and to modify your Character's Attributes.  Unspent Character Points are saved for later use in game (at no penalty to the player.) <br><br>4.08  How do I select my Race and Gender? <br><br>The next part is quite simple:  Choose what gender you wish your character to be (and yes, there are only two.) Keep in mind, however, that some races (such as Dwarves and Half Giants) are gender specific for reasons relating to the backstory.  Likewise, some of the classes are gender specific (such as the "Huntress" and "Fury" specialty classes.)<br><br>The following races are available to starting characters: <br><br>Aelfborn: The Half Breeds, Children of Two Worlds <br>Dwarves: The Shaper's Sons, Born of Stone <br>Elves: The Firstborn, Kings in Exile <br>Half Giants: The Brutes, Pillars of Strength <br>Humans: The Sons of Men, Heirs of the All-Father <br>Irekei: The Outcasts, Devil Men of the Burning Wastes <br>Shades: The Pale Ones, Born of Darkness <br>The exact cost (in character points) of each race varies, as does the attribute minimums and maximums. (For example, making your character Human costs nothing but you must spend 25 Character Points to become an Elf.)  To select a race, the player must simply choose the appropriate Runestone from the table of available Races.<br><br>Also note that gender does not play a role in determining the the minimum and maximum statistics of your character. <br><br>4.09  Can I customize my Character's Appearance? <br><br>There is an enormous amount of customization that can be done to your player character.  Depending on the Gender and Race chosen, various aspects of your Character can be personalized to fit your taste, including such things as: skin tone, hair style, hair color, facial hair style, and facial hair color.  <br><br>Increasing or decreasing certain Attributes will also affect your character's height and weight. <br><br>4.10  What are Base Classes? <br><br>Choosing your character's apprenticeship (also known as your "base class") is perhaps the most important choice to make during Character Creation.  Players may choose one of the following four apprenticeships:  Fighter, Healer, Mage, or Rogue.  Bear in mind that some Races are restricted from taking certain classes.  A Dwarf, for example, cannot become a Mage. <br><br>Choosing an apprenticeship will determine the base set of skills and powers available to your character.  In the course of gameplay, characters will be able to also choose a Specialty Class and a number of multi-class kits (or Disciplines) to gain additional skills and powers. <br><br>Apprenticeships are selected, as with Races, by choosing a Runestone from the table of options.  There is no cost to obtain an Apprenticeship for your character. <br><br>4.11  What is a Specialty Class?<br><br>Specialty Classes (also called Professions) are advanced, more specialized careers that characters can follow in the world of Shadowbane and can be chosen based on a character's apprenticeship, race and gender.  Do note that some Specialty Classes are available to more than one Base Class.  Choosing a Specialty Class will offer the character a host of new Skills, Powers, and other benefits (such as Class specific weapons and armor.)    Characters MUST choose their Specialty Class before they reach Rank 1 (10th level) or they will automatically switch over to the appropriate default (Promoted) Specialty Class of Priest, Thief, Warrior, or Wizard.<br><br>In order to join the ranks of a Specialty Class, a character must find a Runestone of the appropriate type and attune themselves to it.  Be advised that a character is limited to one Specialty Class; once attuned, a Specialty Class Runestone cannot be removed.<br><br>To learn more about specific Specialty Classes, click here. <br><br>4.12  What are Disciplines?<br><br>Disciplines are a form of multi-classing in Shadowbane, and represent a distinct area of expertise that a character can pursue. Some Disciplines focus on specific styles or types of combat, while others represent membership in specific groups, study in a particular school of magic, or even inborn supernatural abilities. While every character has only one Class, they may follow up to three Disciplines. As with their Specialty Class, a character joins a Discipline by attuning themselves to a Runestone for that Discipline.  <br><br>All Disciplines convey some sort of benefit to those who seek study or practice them. Some provide skill rating and attribute bonuses, and many also grant access to new Powers and Skills that would otherwise be unavailable. Some disciplines are specific to certain races and classes, and still more are hidden within the game and can only be found through gameplay.<br><br>Note, however, that characters will always receive the same number of Practice Points to spend on Powers and Skills, including those obtained from Disciplines.  Thus disciplines provide more options to players, but not necessarily more power!<br><br>4.13  Can I choose my Specialty Class or any Disciplines during Character Creation?<br><br>No, only the apprenticeship (or base class) of your character can be chosen in Character Creation. Once your character has spent some time adventuring, specialty classes and disciplines will become available.  <br><br>4.14  What are Attributes?<br><br>Attributes represent the physical statistics of your player character, and determine (to a large extent) your character's potential within the Shadowbane world.  Each character has five primary attributes that measure their mental, physical and spiritual capabilities. Each attribute is expressed as a number (which falls, typically, in a range from 1 to 100.) Having a "100" in any particular attribute means that your character has reach the theoretical maximum limit a human can achieve.  Each attribute is defined as follows: <br><br>Strength:  A character's physical strength and brawn. Stronger characters do more damage in combat, and can carry heavier loads. Fighters tend to concentrate on strength above all else.<br><br>Dexterity:  This attribute measures raw speed, agility, and general coordination. Characters with high scores will hit their foes more often in combat, and are better at dodging incoming blows. Rogues tend to prize Dexterity above all other stats, but any class will find Dexterity very useful and important.<br><br>Constitution:  A measure of toughness, resilience, and fortitude, a high Con score ensures that a character can endure more punishment before dying. Constitution is the basis of a character's Health and Stamina scores.<br><br>Intelligence:  Reasoning, memory, and education are all factors in a character's Intelligence score. Higher scores give characters a bonus to their skill levels, and also speed skill advancement. A must for Mages.<br><br>Spirit:  Spirit defines how strong-willed a character is, and also measures how "in tune" a character is with the inner workings of the universe. A high score indicates acute sensitivity to divine or supernatural influences, and will yield a high Mana score. Spirit is a Healer's most essential attribute.  <br><br>Every character also has three derived attributes that are determined by their race, modified by their primary attribute scores, and increase with each new level gained by your character. These attributes are expressed as point totals, and characters will lose and regenerate points under certain conditions. <br><br>Health: A measure of how well characters deal with injury, hit points decrease every time a character gets hurt. When they reach zero, the character dies.<br><br>Mana: Strongly influenced by Spirit, Mana is used to power magical spells. Each spell cast will reduce the character's Mana total. Once all Mana is expended, a spell user will be powerless until their Mana can be recovered.<br><br>Stamina: A measure of a character's endurance, Stamina measures their capacity for physical activity. Running and fighting can use up a character's Stamina quickly, but Stamina points are also quickly recovered. Unlike Health and Mana, Stamina increases very little over time. <br><br>Each Race starts with a specific set of Starting Attributes that are modified when you choose a Class.  Also note that each Race has defined Minimum and Maximum Attributes, which can only be overcome through the use of "Talents and Traits." <br><br>4.15  How do I modify Attributes and add Talents and Traits?<br><br>In the final stage of Character Creation, players are given the chance to flesh out their Characters by increasing and decreasing Attributes, and by purchasing "Talents" and "Traits."  A Talent or Trait is a particular gift or area of expertise (such as "Heroic strength" or "Raised by Church") which will, in many cases, allow players to overcome normal racial attribute maximums and/or give them access to hidden in-game powers.  As with Races and Base Classes, Talents and Traits are represented by Runestones, and may be purchased with Character Points. <br><br>The Runestones with brown symbols denote "Traits," special advantages granted to a character based on their background, history or training. Traits typically impart a bonus to the maximum value of one or more of your attributes, giving your character the potential to exceed his or her racial limitations.<br><br>The Runestones with gray symbols denote "Talents," special gifts or abilities that are granted to a character through birth, fortune, or bloodline. Talents typically provide characters with an intrinsic benefit in some particular area of gameplay, such as "Nightvision" (increased visibility in darkness), "Combat reflexes" (faster combat initiative) or "Iron will" (heightened resistance to mind-affecting powers.)<br><br>If you have any points left, players can also adjust their Attributes by clicking the small buttons beside each attribute in the Statistics window. The plus ("+") button raises the corresponding attribute by one point at the cost of one Character Point, and the minus ("-") button decreases the attribute by one point, freeing up a Character Point in exchange. Note that characters will be unable to sell down an Attribute below the minimum value or raise it higher than the maximum value for your race (unless modified by Talents/Traits, as described above.)<br><br>As players adjust their Attributes, note that the derived Attributes are also changed.  In addition, their character's appearance will sometimes shift (as the "Strength" and "Constitution" attributes can increase and decrease your character's height and bulk.) <br><br><br><font color=red>BuBBa<br>Crusaders <br>Clan High Lord</font color=red><br><IMG SRC="http://bopcastle.com/images/crusadershl.gif"> <br> <A target="_blank" HREF=http://bopcastle.com/cob/cob.asp>Bird of Prey Castle</A><br> <A target="_blank" HREF=http://www.shadowbaneportal.com>Shadowbane Portal</A>

            <br><P CLASS="post">
              <font color=red>More info Released today</font color=red><br>5.01  Where do I start? <br><br>When your character first steps into the world, they will appear inside of a Safehold.  A Safehold is a protected town fashioned by the world designers (Wolfpack, that is).  Players cannot engage in combat if any kind while in the Safehold and surrounding areas, and these towns cannot participate in Guild Wars.  Conveniently for starting characters, Safeholds tend to be located near low level adventuring areas. <br><br>5.02  What Starting Equipment will I receive? <br><br>The initial possessions your character has will be dependent upon the Race and Base Class you chose during Character Creation; thus providing your character with a "starting kit" consisting of clothing and a weapon.  Initial items have no monetary value to any of the merchants in the game, and cannot be sold for profit.  <br><br>5.03  What are Levels and Ranks? <br><br>Both characters and monsters in the world of Shadowbane are referenced (in terms of power) by their Level. Level is always expressed as a number, running from one and going up.  Level defines how seasoned and experienced a given character is and how effective they are as members of their Class or Profession.<br><br>Rank, a by-product of Level, is a measure of the status that comes along with reaching higher levels. I.e. a character or monster's rank is equal to their level divided by ten. Thus, characters spend Levels one to nine at Rank 0, and both a 39th level Wizard and a 33rd level Druid would be considered Rank 3. Rank provides a good (but not decisive) means of gauging a foe's power, but it can still be deceiving. A Level nine monster, for instance, is much deadlier than a Level one beast, and both would read as Rank 0.  Some items and powers in the world are also rumored to allow a character to disguise his or her Class and Rank.<br><br>As the measuring stick of a character's power, Rank has other important uses in Shadowbane. As the old saying goes, Rank has its privileges: an increase in Rank can sometimes give access to new Powers, Skills, Disciplines and equipment.  As each Class in the game is represented by a single icon, these icons are in turn used to display the Rank of the character or monster currently selected. <br><br>5.04  How do I Gain Experience? <br><br>Every time a character defeats an opponent, he or she will gain Experience Points (XP).  Experience Points are an abstract measure of a character's improvement;  the amount of experience gained for killing a foe is determined by comparing the Level of your character and the Level of your opponent.  The higher level your opponent is compared to you, the more experience you will gain.  The reverse is also true; lower level opponents yield less.  <br><br>A diminishing Experience Point return generally ensures that high level characters tend to advance more slowly, but this isn't always true. Also, certain events (most notably your character's death) can temporarily increase the amount of experience needed to reach the next level. <br><br>5.05  How do I Gain Levels?<br><br>Whenever a character reaches 10,000 Experience Points, he or she will advance to the next Level.  Each time a new level is reached, your character's receives a number of benefits, including an increase to their maximum hit points, stamina and mana.  Additionally they are granted a number of Practice Points and Character Points which can be used to increase Skills and Attributes respectively. <br><br>In accordance with the diminishing returns system, fewer bonuses are granted as players increases higher and higher in level. <br><br>5.06  How do I Raise Powers, Skills, and Attributes?<br><br>Skills and Powers are special abilities that shape the individual nature of a character.  Only a few Skills and Powers are available to a beginning character, but more will open up as you advance in Level.  To advance in a Power or Skill (including those obtained from Disciplines), you must visit a Trainer suitable for your Class.  Training Halls are located in towns and cities throughout the world.  Most trainers will charge a fee for their services and are limited in how far they can train a character in any particular skill or power.  <br><br>You may increase a character's various Attributes by spending Character Points gained through leveling.  These points may be used at any time after they are awarded, and do not have a monetary cost attached to them.<br><br>5.07  What are Professions/Specialty Classes?<br><br>Specialty Classes (also called Professions) are advanced, more specialized careers that characters can follow in the world of Shadowbane and can be chosen based on a character's apprenticeship, race and gender.  Do note that some Specialty Classes are available to more than one Base Class.  Choosing a Specialty Class will offer the character a host of new Skills, Powers, and other benefits (such as Class specific weapons and armor.)    Characters MUST choose their Specialty Class before they reach Rank 1 (10th level) or they will automatically switch over to the appropriate default (Promoted) Specialty Class of Priest, Thief, Warrior, or Wizard.<br><br>In order to join the ranks of a Specialty Class, a character must find a Runestone of the appropriate type and attune themselves to it.  Be advised that a character is limited to one Specialty Class; once attuned, a Specialty Class Runestone cannot be removed.<br><br>To learn more about specific Specialty Classes, click here. <br><br>5.08  What are Disciplines?<br><br>Disciplines are a form of multi-classing in Shadowbane, and represent a distinct area of expertise that a character can pursue.

Thus disciplines provide more options to players, but not necessarily more power!<br><br>To learn more about specific Disciplines, click here.<br><br>5.09  What is a "Soft Cap"?<br><br>Unlike many games which have a "maximum level" that characters can achieve through the course of gameplay (a "hard cap" on levels, if you will) Shadowbane's leveling system is designed around a "Soft Cap" approach.   The Soft Cap works as follows : <br><br>The amount of experience a player earns from killing foes is dependent upon the character's Level when compared to the level of their opponent.  Thus, as characters increase their level, they must seek out increasingly stronger foes to continue gaining the same amounts of experience per kill.  Eventually even the strongest monsters in the game will begin to result in smaller and smaller yields.  Couple this with the fact that the benefits of gaining levels decline as a character rises in Rank (to the point where players are receiving nothing more than the bragging rights of the newly gained level.)<br><br>Practice Points decrease their benefit as Powers and Skills approach mastery, and a high Rank character receives far fewer new hit points, stamina points, and mana than a character that rises from first to second level. Furthermore, Attributes have maximum values (determined by character Race and modified by Traits, if any).  The implied plateau created by the diminishing returns is called the "Soft Cap," and it places an indirect limit on how powerful a character can become.<br><br><br><font color=red>BuBBa<br>Crusaders <br>Clan High Lord</font color=red><br><IMG SRC="http://bopcastle.com/images/crusadershl.gif"> <br> <A target="_blank" HREF=http://bopcastle.com/cob/cob.asp>Bird of Prey Castle</A><br> <A target="_blank" HREF=http://www.shadowbaneportal.com>Shadowbane Portal</A>
