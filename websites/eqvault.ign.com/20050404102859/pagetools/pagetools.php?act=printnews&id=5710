Right now they are only starting with four servers, but I would guess more are on the way.  Here's the full text from the EQ Live post:<blockquote>Server Merges<br><br>On March 22, 2005, we will begin the process of merging some of the EverQuest servers.  As we have seen from the recent success of the Zek merger, combining some of the EQ worlds is beneficial for players’ experience.  In fact, we have been pleasantly surprised to find that the new Zek server now has a higher population than the four combined servers had prior to that merger.  We hope that by merging some of our lower population servers with a higher population server, we will continue to enhance your gameplay experience<br><br>Merging Servers<br><br>On March 22nd, Antonius Bayle will merge with Kane Bayle and will retain the name Antonius Bayle.<br><br>On March 23rd, Bristlebane will merge with Solusek Ro and will retain the name Bristlebane. <br><br>We understand that server identity is important to our customers and we will be integrating server titles into the title system to allow you to display your server of origin, should you desire to do so. <br><br>Unutilized Character Purge<br><br>Immediately preceding the merger, all characters below level 10 that have not been logged in for over six months will be deleted from each of the merging servers and will not be available after the server merge.  If you have a character on any of the servers being merged that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for more than six months, you will need to log that character in prior to the scheduled merge date for the relevant server. <br><br>Shared Banks on Merging Servers<br><br>If you have characters on two servers which are being merged together, you will need to clean out the shared bank on one of those servers. After the merge, only one shared bank will be available on each merged server.<br><br>Character Limitations<br><br>If you have more than eight characters in total on two servers being merged together, only the first eight characters (in alphabetical order) will be displayed after the merge.  Characters other than the eight displayed characters will not be available for selection until currently displayed characters are deleted.  All characters from both servers will remain on your account provided that the character was not below level 10 and had not been logged in within the last six months.<br><br>Corpses<br><br>Prior to the scheduled merge date for your server(s), please be sure that you clear any unclaimed character corpses from the world.  Character corpses will not be transferred to the newly-merged server.  Once the merger is complete, all corpses on the servers affected by a merge will have been purged.<br><br>Duplicate Character Names<br><br>It is possible that characters on servers affected by the merge will have duplicate names. In the event that characters on the new, combined server do share a name, the character with the most played time will be entitled to keep the name. All other characters will have the letter X appended to their name and will be eligible for a name change.  Characters can use the in-game /changename command to request a new name.  The new name is subject to the conditions set forth in our naming policy which can be found here: Naming Policy.<br><br>LDoN Leader Boards<br><br>After each merge is completed, as characters log into their newly-combined server, the leader board will be re-populated with standings. Although your points will be unaffected by the transfer, your standing may have changed based on the new, combined population totals.<br><br>Complimentary Character Move<br><br>Shortly after each merger is complete, we will allow all customers affected by a merge a one-time, complimentary character move to the server of their choice.  For each customer with an account on a newly-merged server who request such a move, all characters associated with that customer’s account will be transferred to the selected server.  All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer.</blockquote>It should be interesting to see how existing guilds will accept the merges.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 25 Feb 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#5710<br>Printed On: Mon Apr 4 3:29:05 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
