Here is the latest from Kytherea at EQLive:<br><br><blockquote>Due to all of the information that our community has submitted, we have determined two problems with customers not being granted all of their veteran rewards. <br><br>First, as many of you know from tech support, there was a billing discrepancy on accounts before 4/01, when our billing system changed.  Our policy is that customers are enabled from their account creation date up to 4/01 as we feel this is the most appropriate solution for our customers without reliable data.  This data has been live since 5/12 and was not the cause of some of the issues today.  What we didn't determine and fix until now is that some customers were not being credited with time enabled until their subscription cycled after 4/01.  This is most likely the cause for customers who are not receiving all the rewards they are entitled to,  including the reward for the next eligible year as a bonus for subscribing to the Sixth Anniversary Promo year.<br><br>We have also identified that in some special billing circumstances, such as changing from regular account subscriptions to All Access or Legends, that the system was not crediting the appropriate subscription time accrued.  This issue has also been addressed for those customers. <br><br>We thank you very much for all of your information as the only resolution was due to contacting customers in the community to track these specific circumstances down.  Please log out of the game completely, repatch and log back in; your veteran rewards will be automatically updated to any characters that are enabled for veteran rewards. <br><br>In addition, we have not forgotten about those customers who's subscription time accrued is being miscalculated due to being exempt for any period of time.  This is still being worked on as well.</blockquote><br><br>She also addressed the issue of splitting off a character from your main account, with less pleasant news: "there is nothing we can do about a character that split off from the account getting the rewards.  I'm sorry!"<br><br>If you are having problems, be sure to log out all the way, type /veteranreward when you get in, and look under your AA tab for the veteran's AAs.  </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sat 14 May 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#7652<br>Printed On: Fri May 27 7:51:04 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
