The character holding the gear should be the character who was there to loot the corpse, and was presumably also a participant in the battle that resulted in the item.  Got the Belt of Dwarfslaying?  You killed Dain.  Got Quarm's Hammer?  You killed Quarm.  Passing that gear onto characters that have never seen those mobs or those zones cheapens value of the accomplishment.<br><br>Secondly, allowing the transfer of no_drop items eliminates an important aspect of player progression.  If every alt on an established account begins their life with a Plane of Time gift pack, then they don't have a whole lot of gear upgrades to look forward to.<br><br>Most importantly, your proposal would allow the sale and trade of no_drop equipment.  It wouldn't take someone long to realize that they could load up a mule with high end no_drop gear, and then move said mule to another account.  <br><br>-Prathun</blockquote><br><br>You can find the entire thread on the official boards <a href=http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=20519#M20519>Here</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 12 July, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=174">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=174</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:08:29 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
