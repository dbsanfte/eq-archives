<b>Forward:</b><P>
I'm writing this to help other classes can get a feel for how Clerics tend to use mana. Because of the way the game is designed, players usually have to put their lives in the hands of the cleric, so it is best to understand how we 'do our thing'. Clerics are the cause of 90% of all the downtime in EQ. At the higher levels, when group leaders ask for a mana status, the only person they are really concerned with is the Cleric, so understanding the cleric and his mana will help everyone in the long run. The only way to write something like this is to make some broad generalizations about clerical play style, and of course not every Cleric will agree with what's written here, but I tried to use maximum efficiency as a baseline. If we can be best prepared to to work together in the most efficient manner possible, we can save two very precious things, mana and time... oh... and of course a third thing, deaths. 
<P>
<b>Starting Out</b><P>
For starters, when full grouping, a cleric must adjust his/her spell slots dramatically from soloing depending on the presence of undead vs. living opponents. And of course, we usually eliminate any fear/spook spells when venturing indoors. As a general rule of thumb, most casters keep gate spell memmed always, though one smart tip is to keep GATE memmed in your 8th spell slot. This is because if charmed, only the 8th spell slot is available for use by the mob's AI. But in lvl 40+ groups, you must ask yourself, am I going even use Gate? Do I have an Evacer? Would I leave my party behind in the face of certain death? This usually depends on the situation and who you are grouped with. When grouped with good friends or guild mates, it is not uncommon to free up the gate slot for another heal/stun/dd spell. But when grouping with strangers, it is often best to keep Gate memmed. When in the plane of hate, gating or evacs are NOT an option (unless you've got a fresh revivable corpse for special cases not worth discussing). 
<P>
Now, a good rule of thumb (for everyone- but especially clerics) is to try to focus on your classes' individual strengths. A cleric's main areas of strength are in 4 types of spells, listed in order of strength. 
<P>
Healing, Buffing, "Stunning", and Undead DD. 
<P>
<b>Healing</b><P> 

A) Healing. 
<P>
"Clerics, Druids and Shamans all heal similar amounts of HP, the Cleric's bonus is that he/she heals about 15% more HP than the other two Priest classes." <P>
-GZ from interview on EQCleric. 
<P>
This alone is reason enough to leave the healing to a cleric, but it also comes from the fact that we have spent months perfecting the art of healing. Its what we do. Its what we do best. It is the strategic element of healing that we have learned to enjoy. 
<P>
I could write a whole editorial on advantages/disadvantages of cleric/shaman, or cleric/druid party match ups, etc.. but when grouping, I'm just happy to have a secondary healer, even if its a Paladin. This is what I will focus on first, a cleric's behavior when grouped with a secondary healer (Druid/Shaman or Paladin) and how to work best with him/her. Now... the last person a cleric usually heals is his/herself when there is a secondary healer, so above all, the secondary healer should keep a careful eye on the CLERIC's bar, because if the mobs frenzy on the cleric (which is not uncommon, though avoidable) even alteration specialized clerics have a hard time getting heal spells off with 3-5 mobs interrupting him/her. Any high level party will tell you that you MUST try to keep your cleric alive. If people other than the cleric die, you can still be resurrected to your spot. If the cleric dies first, it can mean for some major downtime. This is also why in the planes, when things go bad... the clerics camp. When clerics ARE frenzied on, one of our only defenses is Divine Aura/Barrier. The cleric should always announce to the group that they are DIVINED. This is because we cannot be cast on for 18 seconds while divined. Paladins can waste a LoH if the cleric does not announce his DA. The anti taunt factor of being Invulnerable is fortunately quite good, and the 18 seconds are more than enough time to get the mobs off your cleric. Also, keep in mind, that when a cleric is Divined, even Evac spells will not affect him/her. 
<P>
Greater Heal. Once a cleric receives the RESOLUTION spell at lvl 44, it makes the GHEAL spell obsolete. Reso is not only a buff, but also a Heal! And it is actually more mana efficient than GHeal. It casts faster as well. Sometimes, when grouped with casters, the best combat heal a cleric has is Resolution :250 hp heal for 110 mana. Compare that to Gheal's 300 hps for 150 mana, and you see its simple mathematics. As an additional bonus, this refreshes the duration of the Reso buff. There are two situations that must be kept in mind when using Reso as a combat heal. A) Resolution does not overwrite the druid spell Skin like Nature, and B) if a higher level cleric buffs a party member with Reso, then your Reso will not take hold. Despite these drawbacks, Reso can be very effective as a heal, so don't be surprised if you notice that you are getting more Reso buffs than you need. 
<P>
Superior Heal and below have been very well covered and is generally understood, but at lvl 39, clerics get two important healing spells that often throw a wrench into our efficiency strategy. These are Complete Healing and Word of Health. One heals completely for 400 mana, the other heals 100 pts to EACH member for only 180 mana. Depending on the situation and environment, I am sometimes called upon to memm 4 heal spells at once. Greater , Superior, Complete Heal, and Word of Health. It becomes a matter of personal preference and timing with which when to cast AE heal, but even with 3 group members it is mana efficient. 
<P>
Complete Heal is a spell which should be announced. We have to announce this one because it takes SOOO long to cast. 10 full seconds. Also, once we have announced our casting to the group, it is a shame to see a second healer waste their mana on the target, or worse yet, a paladin waste his LoH. By committing to the complete heal it basically says that you are without cleric for 10 seconds, this can be a very dangerous time for any pure casters to bomb away during combat. But if you have a high level Tank or 44+ Necro or Magi pets then it is best to start casting CHeal on them when they get to less than two bubbles. CH takes so long that the buffed tank/pet will likely receive up to 2000 hps of healing for only 150 more mana than the 600 hp superior heal. Achieving this absurd health/mana ratio is what brings smiles to the faces of us clerics. :) It is a good idea to keep a HOTKEY set up for a CHEAL group message because it also reminds the tank that they MUST stay in range of the CH if they wish to stay alive. Despite all that you may have heard to the contrary, Complete healing isn't really much of a taunt (even against plane mobs) . It's surprising, but if your tank has attacked the mob long enough to need a CH, then he/she is WAY up there on that mob's hate list. 
<P>
The final heal spell that clerics get is the lvl 49 AE Heal. This spell heals 500 points of damage to all members of the party for 600 mana. a potential 3000 points of healing. It is also our fastest casting good heal spell.. There is always the question as to when we should cast this or even keep it memmed. Its a huge taunt on the cleric, and can cause an unwanted Frenzy. But this spell is really a situational strategic spell. Mobs that AE attack often require this spell to offset the damage to the group. 
<P>

<b>Buffs </b><P>

Ah, cleric buffs... the 'Downtime Demon' of every bard/enchanterless party. I say this because by nature, everyone wants the buffs. This is understandable, but in reality, not practical. After the first couple of fights a cleric is able to determine the 1-3 people in the group who take damage in a fight. The other members of the party tend to only take damage from area effect spells if any damage at all. Id say 9 out of 10 fights ends up with the tanks (warrior/paladin/sk) taking far more than half of the total party damage. This is a good thing. This means things went well. The mobs concentrated their attacks on the member(s) with the best defensive skills and armor class (tank) and the tank was able to successfully taunt any attacks off the cleric/mages. By looking at how the fights are going, the cleric can assess who needs which buffs most. If he/she notices that there are NPC wizards casting ae fire spells (Ghoul Magi camp for example) , then perhaps a full round of fire and magic resists for everyone might be beneficial. If he sees that the tanks are getting burned by Force Shocks and other Magic bombs, he may deem that those being targeted get a magic resist. If he ends up having to constantly cure poison (plane of hate) then resist poison may be worth casting. But... if you are lucky enough to have a lvl 49+ enchanter in the group... let him/her cast Group Resist Magic. It is only 70 mana for the whole group, and gives 15 more resist than RESIST MAGIC. 
<P>
It is common sense to keep Resolution on all members of the party, but 'symbols' becomes a mana luxury that sometimes needs to be rationed. Keep in mind that clerics often DO have the time and mana to symbol the whole party, and during those times, they usually do. 
<P>
Try to understand. To give a symbol of Pinzarn (lvl 34 spell) to every member of the group costs 1200 mana. When you get a good groove going, and are doing continuous pulls, it is best to only only use that mana on the tanks, and med up for the incoming fights. A good cleric knows the class makeup of his party, and when he sees the red bar move on a line that SHOULDN'T move (wizards for example) he is very quick to notice. As a matter of fact, one of the few reasons to keep Greater heal (or Reso) memmed. If a wizard for example opens up with ice comet before the tank engages, well then, he may not live long enough for superior heal to finish casting... but most casters know this, and mistakes like that are few and far between. Enchanters though, present a much more difficult challenge. They must be fully buffed at all times. A good enchanter is often attacked when doing crowd control/charms. In many cases, the two most active red bars are the TANK's and the ENCHANTER's. Because enchanters have a very low natural hps, Naltron is a must for this class. Other than clerics, enchanters are the most important class to keep alive, as their surviving can often mean the difference between a successful fight, and a mass ress. 
<P>
Most Clerics are careful about casting Symbol of Naltron (lvl 44 spell) because of the regent. Each cast costs 10.5-13 pp per Peridot and 315 mana. Multiply that by a party of 6 and you have 66-78pp and 1900 mana for one round of one buff. The benefit is often not worth the 1500% price increase over the 7-11gp Jasper for symbol of Pinzarn. Naltron is great when manastoning up for mass resses (in which case I even wear adamantine rings for the 150 extra hps). Naltron is also beneficial in preparations for tough break-ins, corpse recoveries, mana-transferance, or on tanks/enchanters in the more challenging areas (Efreeti break, Boss rooms, Planes, Dragons, etc.) 
<P>
There are several mobs in the game that cast AE dispels. These mobs make the clerics cringe. There is one way to combat this though... Crap buffs. AE dispels often wipe the first two, or first four buffs from the person's buff stack. So if the cleric casts crap buffs first (endure cold, disease, poison, etc.) then the important buffs like symbol, Reso, and shield remain for the fight. This is very situational, and sometimes there are mobs that make buffing useless. Take this on a case, by case basis, and determine whether waiting for the buffs are worth it. 
<P>
Generally, up until around lvl 44, clerics find themselves being the primary buffer for all the members of your party. It is at 44, when you will group with high level druids, where for the first time, you will have someone with a superior buff. Skin Like Nature's benefits are very similar to Resolution, but SLN gives a valuable 2 hps per tick regeneration effect. When stacked with pack chloro, this is arguably more efficient than resolution. But... SLN costs 300 mana a cast, and prevents the Reso combat heal. Generally, druids tend to cast this spell only on themselves, but the druid should tell the cleric whether they are buffing themselves with SLN so that the cleric doesn't waste mana on a Reso that doesn't hold. Druids and Shaman also have the same RESIST spells as clerics. When you have a druid or shaman in the group, its best that they take the Resist buffing responsibility. By sharing the mana drain, there is less downtime, which everyone appreciates. 
<P>
On a separate note, it has become more and more obvious as the game has evolved that the most important three melee statistics in the game are HP, AC, and Resists (Magic, Fire, Cold). Even the shaman websites talk about the relative unimportance of the basic stat categories during combat (there are exceptions). Many high level tanks have shed their serpentine bracers and black pearl items in favor of Strength and AC items. This is why NOW more than ever, there is a great demand for cleric buffs. Despite what we might consider a "Paltry" Return on Investment, the ARMOR line of buffs are a MUST for the tanks in the party. An extra 25-32 ac to the tanks may end up saving thousands of points of healing over the coarse of the spells duration. Though I would recommend that this spell be used on tanks only, as they are getting the most benefit from the mana. 
<P>

<b>Stunning</b><P>
If your party is prepared for it, especially against very hard hitting mobs, the cleric can be more useful to the party as a preventative healer, than by casting his/her healing spells. This is accomplished through the STUN line of spells. 
<P>
"Chain Stunning" is one of the most underused, but effective anti-damage strategies in the game. Though other classes get their versions of stun spells, no class is better suited for chain stunning than the cleric. Against the living, clerical offensive DDs are weak and slow when compared to pure casters. But the stun line of spells can effectively paralyze even the mightiest of opponents. Clerics are able to chain the ghoul lord, the froglok king, the efreeti lord djarn, and several other high mobs so that they sometimes don't even need to heal. If done well, the mob will get very few swings in. Stuns are often resisted, but overlapping them can compensate for the resisted efforts. Stuns are also low mana spells compared to the big heals and big dds, so after the fight, there are very few heals that need to be done, and chain stunning even a boss mob takes less than half of a cleric's mana. This is why 'chaining' the stuns become so effective. Once a cleric has Stun, Holy Might, and Force, he can begin to chain stun great foes into submission as his tanks wail away. One thing to keep in mind is that this anti-damage offensive method renders the druid thorns or magician flameshields useless, because the mob doesn't get a chance to hit often enough to warrant the mana for the spells, though when the mob does aggro on someone it will be the chain-stunning cleric. 8D But that's why clerics have Divine Aura, and platemail. 
<P>
A stunned mob is also much easier to hit. Stunned mobs do not Parry, Riposte, Dodge, etc., so the tanks get many more hits in. Also, stuns are perfect at interrupting casters. One 30 mana stun can stop a 600 point DD from hitting a party member, though if there is no nuker in the group, it is sometimes better to nuke away at the caster mobs to eliminate their threat as quickly as possible. Stun, nuke, stun, nuke is an excellent way to eliminate an npc caster threat. Quick killing on caster mobs can be looked at as obvious anti-damage, and is pretty much common knowledge since we first met the beautiful Hags in the Unrest Train Station. 
<P>
In most cases, Permastunnage works really well, but only if you have the tanks to dish out the damage. If you have only one tank to do the hacking and slashing, then you have to keep the mob stunned for too long for it to become mana efficient. In the planes, where mobs attack for insane amounts of damage, Permastunnage is especially effective. A permastunned plane mob can often act as a 4000+ hp preventative heal. 
<P>
There is one thing that cannot be overlooked when stunning. Pushback. Stuns have a secondary effect of pushing the target back a bit. When chain stunning, you must keep in mind where the mob is. If you notice that the mob may be pushed too far (off a cliff, into another aggro range, etc.), you may want to revert to heal mode, and leave stunnage for a different locale. 
<P>

<b>Undead DD</b><P>

This one is very difficult to assess. On the one hand clerics are blessed with the "Nukers of the Undead" tag, on the other, it is just one small element of what we do. So this element of a cleric's strategy is very much based on the group diversity structure. In general, clerics who NUKE all the time are frowned upon because they make their group members wait so long for them to regain their mana. But like every spell, there is a time and a place to use these. 
<P>
One of the only times that a cleric has an advantage in offensive firepower is against the undead. For many levels, there are very few classes that hold an edge over clerical mana-efficiency against undead. A cleric can get off 5 banish undeads in the time it takes a wizard to fire 3 Ice comets. The wizard will have done about 400 more total damage, but will also have used more mana. Combined, a wizard and a cleric are a tough duo to beat when facing undead. Ice comet does 2.8 damage per mana, whereas Banish does 2.6 though ice comet has a longer casting time, and both banish and ice comet have little or no recast delay. This of course does not take resists into account, because then luck gets thrown into the equation, which makes the discussion pointless. 
<P>
When grouping with a cleric, it is unfair to assume that the cleric should be the master nuker because you happen to be fighting undead. Unlike wizards, clerics are called upon to do much more than just nuke away. Many clerics (myself included) don't even keep undead dds memmed if there is a nuker in the group. We are the best healers, not the best nukers. If there is a nuker in the group, its often best to leave the nuking to them. It also frees us to concentrate on heals/stuns/buffs. A good use of Undead DDs is to finish off opponents, or to eliminate one of the opponents in a bad pull situation, otherwise for mana efficiency its best for us to let the tanks enjoy themselves as they do their thing with those bladed weapons. Sometimes though, the cleric might want to throw in a nice dd to finish off the mob before it decides to wander off. : ) 

<P>
<b>Concluding:</b><P>
So there you have it. Thank you for reading my little guide. I hope it helps you to better understand the intricacies of the cleric in your group. Of course, each and every cleric you group with will have their own style of play, but the more you understand about priests, the better we can serve our party. 
<P>
Good luck, and for god sake, don't die in post hell levels... I don't wanna have to come ress you. ; )
