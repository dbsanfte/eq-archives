Or should I find the designers that worked on LDoN and find out how they plan on tuning LDoN to the 65+ crowd?  Give me some ideas and i'll get you the answers!<br><br>To post a reply click "Post a comment" and let me know what you think!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thu 21 Oct 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#2713<br>Printed On: Fri Nov 26 17:42:45 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
