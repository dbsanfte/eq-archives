Before it would show them standing in that spot for a few seconds.<br><br>- (Test Only) Fixed /pet report after you zoned with a pet, it was showing a list of unknown spells. Should really be fixed this time.<br><br>- Those who managed to get their research skill above 200 will have it reset back to 200. Sorry about that.<br><br>- Bard issues with "Your spell is too powerful for you intended target." should be fixed.<br><br>- Some small fixes with the tribute revamp.<br><br>Note: Getting some bugs on this and wanted to clarify that Suspended Pets DO NOT zone and that it is working as intended.<br></blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thu 01 Jul 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#163<br>Printed On: Fri Nov 26 20:29:56 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
