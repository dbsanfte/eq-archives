Here's a quick rundown of posts in the past 24 hours.<br><br><blockquote><b><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63496">Tureptan Spirit has been renamed</b></a><br><br>The beastlords spell Tureptan Spirit has had a healing component added to it, as well as a name change to Thrushers Mending.  This change went live with the update on the 14th.<br><br>Thanks all. <br><br>Brenlo</blockquote><br>And another...<br><blockquote><b><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63501">More Omens Coming</a></b><br><br>Greetings all,<br><br>We are aware that some outlets may not yet have copies or are currently out of copies of EverQuest: Omens of War.  We are working with our retail partners to get more copies out and they should arrive over the next few days. <br><br>Thanks folks,<br><br>The EverQuest Team</blockquote><br>And finally...<br><blockquote><b><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=63506"><br>Patching Difficulties?</a></b><br><br>We have found that some users have been having difficulty with patches recently, due to some modifications we made to the patching server. We have since addressed the issue and there should be no problems going forward. For those of you who are having problems with patching, we recommend flushing the Internet Explorer cache, which should fix any problems. Be sure to save any login data you may need as it will be lost after you clear your cache.</blockquote><br><br>I'll keep them coming as they are posted.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thu 16 Sep 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#1685<br>Printed On: Fri Dec 17 3:26:19 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
