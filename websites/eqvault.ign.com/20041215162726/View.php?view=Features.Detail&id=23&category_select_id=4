<p class="pageheader">Omens of War Preview
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>09-06-2004</b> - 
<p>
For over five years EverQuest has undergone so many changes they are almost impossible to list, from a new level cap with Runes of Kunark and Planes of Power, to new models with Shadows of Luclin and even instanced content with Lost Dungeons of Norrath,  Even with all of the enhancements, SOE continues to add onto EverQuest with its 8th expansion, Omens of War.  
<p>
At first glance, Omens of War seems like it may be the most inspired expansion yet.  It’s no big secret that more recent expansions have had some problems, and due to this SOE has tried to open the lines of communication with the players and guilds in order to find out exactly what they want.  The much-publicized Guild Summit was the first step to this, and it had huge results: SOE delayed Omens of War for two months to change and add many topics that came up at the Guild Summit.  
<p>
I recently was given a tour of Omens of War by Alan “Brenlo” Crosby, and it left me quite surprised.  Before going into the tour I was a bit skeptical – Gates of Discord did not impress me very much, and even though the media I had posted over the past few weeks has been great, it’s a whole new game when you actually see it in action.  To say the least, I not only came out impressed, but also amazed at the scope compared to the last few expansions.
<p>
The first zone I was shown was “Dranik's Scar”.  This is a large, very green zone, with a feel that reminded me of Maiden’s Eye from Luclin.  This is also the first time I got a taste of some of the new engine graphics.  The first and most noticeable are the new shadows.  Every PC and NPC in the new zones have shadows.  Although they were a bit buggy on my video card (Radeon 9700), they looked fantastic most of the time and certainly were on par with most new releases.  
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=134"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=134"></a>
<p>
Another new effect I first saw here was what Brenlo called “Multiple UV Filters”.  I guess the easiest way to explain it would be multiple texture effects in one area.  One example I was shown was a stone structure which not only had a texture effect that looked like realistic stone, but also had moss growing on it – the two combined gave it a very realistic look.
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=135"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=135"></a>
<p>
Next, we traveled to Riftseekers Sanctum – a very goldish brown dungeon area filled with ice.  The first thing I noticed was the amazing texture work on the roof of the area into which we ported.  The best way to describe it would be “creepy”(well, maybe not for those of you who enjoyed the 70s).  
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=136"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=136"></a>
<p>
Then I was able to see the new fire effects.  Fire no longer has a big plus shape in the middle of the flames.  Instead, they're now rendered in full 3D and act as light sources.  The first example I saw was on a group of enemies called "Pyrilen," who had fire as hair and on their tails.  
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=137"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=137"></a>
<p>
Brenlo then decided to show that the fire was really hot, and a corpse recovery followed.
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=138"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=138"></a>
<p>
After that short sidetrack, we went over to the other side of Riftseekers Sanctum, and I saw the “Gelidran” – basically the opposite of the Pyrilen.  These monsters enjoy the ice instead of fire, and not only have an icy “mist” around them but freeze the ground as they walk on it.  Finally, I got a demo of the new level up effect – certainly a long time coming. 
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=139"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=139"></a> <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=140"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=140"></a>
<p>
After being singed and then frozen, we headed off to Harbingers Spire.  This zone was a very dark, dungeon-like setting.  The first thing I was shown was a large, spiral red pillar with red electricity emitting from it.  Screenshots do not exactly do this justice – it really rocks when you see it in motion.  I was even told by Brenlo that one of the effects was not currently working on my video card, so when that’s fixed it will look even better!
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=141"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=141"></a>
<p>
Subsequent to "ooing" and "aahing" at the Spire, I was shown another new model, this one was for a monster named “a discordling rafter”.  It looked like something straight out of Star Trek – very creepy.
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=142"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=142"></a>
<p>
The second to last zone we visited was entitled “Anguish, the Fallen Palace”.  Of all the zones we visited, this was my favorite by a landslide.  First I saw a shocking new enemy, an “ohm knight”.  Following the elemental theme from earlier in Riftseekers Sanctum, these enemies have lightning as part of their body and arms.
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=143"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=143"></a>
<p>
Next up I saw the new water effect on a gigantic bridge.  The new water effect is stunning – and will not only be used in Omens of War but in every zone.  
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=144"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=144"></a>
<p>
Finally, we moved to what could be one of the coolest areas I have ever seen in EverQuest.  A gigantic, fallen palace (wonder where the zone name came from?).  This area looked extremely aged and the detail was spectacular.  Everything from the gate with its wooden, teeth-looking bars, to the flags on the very top which are ripped and run down.  
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=145"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=145"></a>
<p>
Last but not least was “The Wall of Slaughter”.  This was a very barren zone, mostly dirt and some run down buildings.  In the small area I ran around it was pretty bland – but it did have two of the coolest enemies I saw.  First up was “a savage feran”.  This enemy had what appeared to be individual tentacles coming out from his head, each with its own movement pattern and, of course, shadows. 
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=146"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=146"></a>
<p>
The next enemy I saw was called “a bazu thrasher”.  Screenshots cannot do this guy justice.  He is freaking huge and the animation is fantastic.  He basically looks like a 20-foot tall, stone, super-evil gorilla.
<p>
<a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=147"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=147"></a>
<p>
Between the new zones which look really good (and only 1 requires a flag for you casual players), there are many other features which look great.  For the low level crowd, the new task system will help you level up faster, with tasks taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes.  For the higher levels, everyone knows about Epic 2.0s and level 70 + new AAs.  There is also a new title system that allows you to earn and choose your own title, something that you can earn through many ways, including crafting.  Finally, and best of all, the Priest of Discord is getting a new and improved use!  He will be teleporting players to Omens of War once it goes live.
<p>
Overall, I was very impressed by this tour.  Don’t get me wrong, everyone knows that gameplay will be the final “make or break” aspect of Omens of War – something that only we players will be able to decide whether it is good or not.  I would like to thank Alan and everyone else at SOE for the tour. Keep up the good work guys, and don’t disappoint us!
