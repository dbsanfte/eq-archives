A level 60 character taunting an even con or higher level NPC will now use the character's taunt skill to determine success rate, similar to what occurs below level 60. The chance to taunt is roughly the same. In addition, the reduction in your chance to taunt creatures higher level than yourself now occurs at a slower rate and the minimum chance to taunt an NPC is higher. Also, you will now gain a bonus to your chance to taunt NPCs that are lower level than yourself. To go along with the change to use a character's taunt skill after level 60, paladins and shadowknights have had their taunt caps increased to match warriors and ranger's skill cap has been increased to 200. <br>- Taunts that fail because of distance will no longer cause you to have to wait the cool down period before attempting to taunt again.<br>- Ranged combat should behave much more consistently now.<br>- Increased the sense and disarm range on many traps throughout the world.<br>- /con will now properly report whether an NPC can see you sneaky rogues.<br><br><br>*** Tradeskills ***<br><br>- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.<br>- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have finally been discovered. <br>- Merchants across the world realized that they were selling small pieces of ore at a loss. They have mutually agreed on a price increase. <br>- The poisons from the Omens of War era will no longer magically create a vial; they now require two of the appropriate poison vial. <br>- You will no longer be able to combine ingredients that you have up for sale in the bazaar.<br>- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.<br>- Failing to create Frost Bunny Stew will now return your pot to you.<br>- Fixed the bug to the evolution of the tradeskill trophies for players using lower than master certificates while having a 300 skill.<br>- Bristlebane's Challenge and Bristlebane's Challenge Meats have changed to No Drop. <br>- Fixed a bug in the wording of the Grandmaster's Book of Barbarian Culture.<br>- Expanded the shark skins that can be used to make advanced poison vials.

This should make these quests more accessible by allowing characters to collect the items needed, then get the quest and hand them in to complete it. <br>- Added an experience reward for the "Bring Me Their Heads" and "Engines of Destruction" tasks in the Devastation and Stronghold of Rage.<br>- Fixed a problem with the Shaman epic 2.0 Elder Spirit of Enlightenment in West Freeport. Seemed he wanted to enlighten himself by wandering where he shouldn't. He should now happily lead shamans from the Jade Tiger Inn into the courtyard for the ritual.<br>- The drop rate of the Twilight Sea armor quest gems has been increased significantly. In an effort to keep the amount of money entering the world from those gems roughly the same, the value of the gems has been reduced as a result.<br>- Shalowen the Pure will now return The Chalice of Life if you have completed the single group missions in his arc in order and turning in the chalice of life drop from the Corruption of Ro raid.<br>- Exploring the Valley of Xanzerok for the Arcstone quests should now work correctly when levitating.<br><br><br>*** Events ***<br><br>- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been removed.<br>- The events in Deathknell, Tower of Dissonance now have individual lockout timers instead of applying a lockout to the entire zone. <br>- Made some tuning changes to the first raid event in Deathknell.<br>- The Deathknell Enforcers will no longer use Immobilizing Stone. <br>- Added a tether to Maestro Tan`Lor in Theater of Blood.<br>- The lava spout traps have been removed from the Tirranun encounter. <br>- The traps in the Inktu`ta raid should fire off much less often, as well as be easier to locate and disarm. <br>- Mayong will now teleport back to his spawn point if he wanders too far from his room. <br>- Fixed a crash bug that could occur in the Demi-Plane of Blood during the Performer event. <br>- Drekish the Enforcer of Ro will now properly reset in the event of a failure in the Corruption of Ro raid. <br>- You now only need one flagged player to initiate the 18-man Kunark Monster Mission raid: Fall of an Empire. <br>- The invaders that breach the walls into the Stronghold of Rage will be a bit less easy to split. <br><br><br>*** Missions ***<br><br>- Increased the distance that the Dwarf armies must be from basecamp in The Defense of Thurgadin monster mission before they return to full combat potential. Units moving to forward locations are guaranteed to be back in combat states when they reach their destinations but may still be thinking of resting while they are in transit. <br>- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission.

This includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.<br>- The corpse summoners in the guild lobby are no longer fooled by shrouding down to lower levels before handing in a soul stone. <br>- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick. <br>- The treants in Theater of Blood that have been shedding hooves and horse meat will no longer do so.<br>- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to Stronghold of Rage easier.<br>- The angry and hurt Faydedar that Dolgin helps people bait no longer has any viable meat on him. <br>-Terrorantula's children should no longer warp across the desert.<br>- Summoning a horse should no longer upset nearby NPCs.<br><br><br>*** Maps ***<br><br>- Cartographers have been very busy.

Monsters rejoice!<br>- The Universal Chat system will replace the old Channel Server for all channel operations. All player-owned channels will be moved over automatically and using channels in the new system is the same as before, so you should not notice any difference. One of the primary benefits of this change is that channels now support cross-server and cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work with this change however we do intend to remedy this situation if possible in the future.<br>- Luclin character models are now available to everyone, whether they own Shadows of Luclin or not.<br>- Increased the amount of experience you gain toward your shroud progression when you kill an NPC as a shroud. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works. This does not affect the evolving tradeskill trophies, which don't gain experience from killing creatures.<br>- Fixed a number of rendering anomalies that could occur throughout the game.<br>- Targeting corpses should now be much easier and much less confusing.<br>- Item links can now be sent across Universal Chat channels!<br>- Ogre females using voice emotes for Agree and Disagree will now play the proper voices.<br>- Player and NPC names should now be rendering correctly at all times when they are overlapping.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 14 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18341">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18341</a><br>Printed On: Sun Jul 23 14:23:03 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
