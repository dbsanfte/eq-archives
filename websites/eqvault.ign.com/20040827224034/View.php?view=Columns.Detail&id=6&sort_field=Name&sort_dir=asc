<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
<I>"Oh it's you. When I heard the door creek I thought it was those strange barbarians from the north coming back. What's that? How am I you say? Well let me just say that things have been a bit slow around here the last few days. I had a group of North men come in from Halas, and they scared of most of my regulars. Not that I was eves dropping you understand, but they were whispering about some strange spear their tribe's Shaman had become obsessed with. The spear of fate they called it. They were heading to Freeport and the jade tigers den, something about searching for a great spirit. Of course I could have helped them out but I wasn't about to after they scared old Tom Wheatbriar out of his skin with their dancing light spells. It might amuse some folks, but not the common village folk from down the road. Have I sparked an interest in you? Don't tell me you are seeking one of these items of great power too? Well just you be careful that the search for it doesn't take over your life!"</I>
<p>

<B>EPIC FEVER.</B>
<p>
What is epic fever? Epic fever has become a growing epidemic. Basically it's the obsessive pursuit of the epic item. Each class has an epic weapon open to them that until very recently was just about the best item they could get for their particular character class. Bellow is a list of class specific epic weapon.
<p>
Bard
<p>
Beastlord
<p>
Cleric
<p>
Druid
<p>
Enchanter
<p>
Magician
<p>
Monk
<p>
Necromancer
<p>
Paladin
<p>
Ranger
<p>
Rouge
<p>
Shadow Knight
<p>
Shaman
<p>
Warrior
<p>
Wizard
<p>
Singing Short Sword
<p>
Claws of the Savage Spirit
<p>
Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh
<p>
Nature Walkers Scimitar
<p>
Staff of the Serpent
<p>
Orb of Mastery
<p>
Celestial Fists
<p>
Scythe of the Shadowed Soul
<p>
Fiery Defender
<p>
Swiftwind
<p>
Ragebringer
<p>
Innoruk's Curse
<p>
Spear of Fate
<p>
Jagged Blade of War *
<p>
Staff of the Four
<p>
* Blade of Strategy and Blade of Tactics
<p>
The statistics for these epic items are great by comparison to many other items within the game, although the recent expansions The Planes of power and Legacy of Ykesha now offer items that in some cases even surpass epic weapons.
<p>
As their name suggests these items are not easy to acquire.
Epic items were introduced to offer a player the chance of engaging in a long and involved quest with great reward for their efforts. The typical epic quest will involve world wide travel, the acquisition of rare or hard to find items, and battles with awesome adversary's even deities.
Often it will involve faction work and a great deal of group or guild cooperation if you plan to achieve your epic goal.
<p>
Obviously with the reward being offered for the completion of the quest, it is little wonder why so many players pursue their epic and although the quests can not be finalized until higher levels many players are creating their new characters with the acquisition of that class's epic in mind.
<p>
I remember creating my new wood elf druid, sinking points, and working hard on the one handed slash skill. There are very few one handed slash weapons of worth that a druid can use, but many more one handed blunt weapons he can acquire at lower levels. I still maxed my one handed slash skill because my epic will require that particular talent.
<p>
Epic fever causes a player becomes so fixated with getting their hands on their, epic that the regular day to day playing of Everquest takes a back seat.
They stress over each and every part of the quest, get mad if their guild doesn't make a hard committed effort in helping them get it, and even jump from guild to guild in pursuit of their "Holy grail" of Everquest items.
<p>
Epic fever has destroyed guild relations, friendships and even real life relationships.
<p>
I witnessed one particular situation where a person who had recently joined a guild, flamed and ranted at the guild and subsequently left it within 2 weeks as they had not helped him achieve a single part of his epic.
<p>
He did not care that other longer serving and more deserving members where ahead of him, all he cared about was HIS epic.
<p>
Yes this is a selfish attitude to take, but until he began his chase for the epic, many had said he was a great person to play and game with, and had acted selflessly many times.
<p>
So was it the hunt for the epic that changed him?
I decided early on not to get too attached to the idea of getting my epic for my main character, and instead just try to get parts of it done should the opportunity present itself.
<p>
Many of the players I have grouped with regularly in the past have become infected with epic fever, and you see it spreading all over the far reaches of Norrath.
<p>
What are the symptoms?
<p>
Every time you log on, are you looking to finish another piece of your epic quest?
<p>
Do you only look to join groups or go on raids that offer you the chance of an epic drop?
<p>
Do you find yourself not bothering with upgrading items that fit in your epic slot because theirs no point and your epic will be better?
<p>
Do you consider acquiring your epic more important than leveling?
<p>
If the answers are yes, you sound like you have epic fever.
<p>
So is there a cure?
<p>
Fortunately there is indeed a cure for this disease.
<p>
Firstly you need to get used to the idea that it will take a long time to get your epic, and allow yourself to play and enjoy the other aspects of Everquest in the mean time.
You need to get back to the reasons you played EQ in the first place, and do the things you used to do before the inclusion of epic weapons.
<p>
After all, there are many exciting things to do in Norrath, with many exciting zones to explore and other good items to acquire. Acquiring your epic is not the pinnacle of playing EQ, and allowing yourself to become obsessed with getting it is not a good thing.
<p>
Obsessions in general are not considered good, and even in the virtual world of Elves and Dragons, they can lead to your downfall.
<p>
Epic fever not only has the potential to ruin you EQ friendships and guild connections, it also has the power to ruin the enjoyment of the game for you.
<p>
If you are reading this and are thinking to yourself "gee that sounds like me, I want my epic so bad" then stop, step back and take a look at why you play EQ.
<p>
Did you start playing to get an epic weapon? No of course not, so just get back to what EQ has to offer you and allow the pursuit of your epic to be something that may one day become a reality but is not the only thing you strive for…
<p>
<I>"Ah I see I have given you something to think about. I'm glad to see that you have a good head on your shoulders young adventurer. I've seen many a young lad or lass chase their dream all the way to the grave. Before you go let me leave you with something else to think about. Are things always what they seem?"
<p>
As the lights dim you think you caught a faint blue tint to the human barkeepers hand as he hands you your cloak...</I>
