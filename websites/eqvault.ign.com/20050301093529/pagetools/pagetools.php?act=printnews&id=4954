Here's a clip:<blockquote>Does SOE consider every role to be of equal value to a group?<br> <br>As the game has changed and evolved, the roles have shifted in their value.  For example, the advent of longer buff timers means that a buffer might not be as needed in a pick up group as a DPS class is because the buffs can be acquired by players in a safe zone long in advance of actually reaching the content that requires them.  This is another tricky part of this puzzle that we are sorting out.  We are looking at the group roles and intend to make sure that each role is necessary.</blockquote><br>Interesting stuff, and you can read the whole post <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&message.id=68">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 21 Jan 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#4954<br>Printed On: Tue Mar 1 1:35:29 PST 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
