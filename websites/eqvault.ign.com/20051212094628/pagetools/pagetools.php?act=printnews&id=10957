Designed to bring people into EQ in a limited fashion, it allows free game play in the tutorial setting for an unlimited time.<br><br>If an Escape to Norrath player decides he or she wishes to purchase an EverQuest subscription, they can transfer to a regular server.<br><br>Look for the disk in your Depths box, or download it on line.  Escape to Norrath is designed to bring in new players and can be a great way to introduce your friends to the game, for free, without buying the complete EverQuest game. Existing EverQuest players can play on the Escape To Norrath server by using the EscapeToNorrath.exe in their EverQuest directory. <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 13 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10957">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10957</a><br>Printed On: Mon Dec 12 1:46:28 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
