Not like a fedora, but sparkly and velvet hats!  All different ones.  Awesome!  And what a nice guy too, glad I got to know him.<br><br>Gloriana from that same site is completely funny but her best comment at breakfast on dealing with men in the workplace was her discussion on constantly having to say "eyes up!"<br><br>There may be videos of some of your community reps playing Dance Dance Revolution. !<br><br>Breasts, of the female kind, were definitely not forgotten at the summit and now are irrevocably blended in my mind with pandas.  That's just wrong, as Amy, your community manager, would say.<br><br>Don't ask Merloc <a href="http://www.graffe.com/">of Graffe's Wizard Compendium</a> to play Canadian twenty questions because the way he does it it's not NSFW.  However, I think a moosecock really is an animal, isn't it?<br><br>Happy coincidental meeting:  the only other person on the bus from the airport with me was none other than Boanerges, who I have known online for about five years now.  When he introduced himself to me, my eyes got big as saucers and I said "OMG, I am Kwill!"  He was as shocked as I was.  Hopefully pleasantly.  He was as nice as I expected though and we had a great time reminiscing about our server on the way to the hotel.<br><br>Unless you are fired by Brenlo at least three times, you can keep working for him.  And yes, he is funny in person.  I learned that if he teases you, that means he actually might like you.  Poor Merloc thought Brenlo hated him but he really doesn't.<br><br>Loral is exactly the same as you would imagine him to be from his posts.  He had all the devs completely obsessed with his evil agenda and how they might get rid of it, which included feeding it to the monkeys.  There was an actual an evil agenda on paper I found out later, and Brenlo ate some of it.  I am not making this up, I saw the paper in his mouth.<br><br>Niami "den mother" from EQTraders is just as nice in person as she is in the game.  She gave some of us a tour of the zoo and was just an all around good person to know.  Plus she's friends with the famous romance writer who plays EQ.  And she won a huge stuffed cat at Dave and Buster's on one of those quarters falling over the edge things!<br><br>All the devs were such good sports about answering our questions, even Zorillius (Craig Knapp) when I whipped out my questions sheet at dinner when he sat at my table on Saturday night (he SAID we could ask questions at dinner).  However, I am going to vote in Dev Ryan as the person most likely to work with David Spade in those credit card commercials. "No."  Actually Ryan is very cool and will change things if it makes sense to do it.  He still says no though.<br><br>My guild should be thrilled since Craig took my sheet of their questions with him to look at later.  I got a little worried afterwards though when  he did mention something about banning people because all their real character names were on that sheet. <br><br>We rarely mingled with the EQ2 people although one EQ2 Dev tried to bring me over to the dark side ("you should be over here!") at dinner.  I have no idea how their summit went, although I heard it was productive.<br><br>Zajir the items dev is *very* convinced that he's right on how he's done his itemization and loot drops.  But in his favor, he did listen to our suggestions.  And he was willing to talk at length about stats which made all the stat-head people happy.<br><br>When the marketing guys came in to our summit room and said "how do you like our box art" half the people in the conference room said, "what box art."<br><br>True trivia: on the wall at SOE there's a very well done painting for the Champions of Norrath box of two scantily clad warrior women very close together about to beat each other up.  Turns out that's the second version, the first version looked like thay might kiss each other and that one got rejected as being not "T for teen".<br><br>All the artists leave the overhead lights off above their cubes all the time.  So the room is perpetually dark.<br><br>There are some people that just love the statistics aspect of EQ.  And can't stop talking about specific items and what stats they have. I told Rashere that if it had been 50 years ago they would have known the batting averages for everyplayer on every team in the major leagues.  Maybe they do anyway.<br><br>Frodlin (your warrior correspondent) kept me fascinated for like 30 minutes at dinner on Saturday explaining Roman warfare tactics.  He was moving around salt shakers and boxes on the tables to demonstrate all these lines of soldiers and stuff, it was pretty cool.  He also told me at the zoo how the Romans raised exotic animals for the gladiator games.  And he did admit he isn't liked by monks but that's only because he doesn't like people not posting what they really want.<br><br>They gave us little remote control cars from the Gearshift game as a prize, and we all took them out to play with them at dinner on Saturday except they were all on the same frequency which made for a much less competitive environment.<br><br>I met a very nice GM that had been working for SOE for three years and still liked his job.  He was sorry they got rid of the prison room for bad players though.  You have to be old school to remember when they summoned your character to the GM secret room for a chastizing.<br><br>Shackleton the rogue correspondent came all the way from England for the summit and was shocked that the waitress at Gordon Bierch's knew what a bitter was.  Must have been all those Brit coms we watch on TV here.  <br><br>I had a long discussion with a couple of the devs about how their job is amazing and unique in that when they do something, they have thousands of people complaining about it the next day.  Even when they do lots of things right, but one thing wrong, the community focuses on just that one thing.  It's a tough life!<br><br>Leaving the roundtable conferences on the bus, most of us were happily clutching plastic souvenir glasses they originally gave out at the New Orleans fan faire.  That's kind of pathetic, isn't it?  We love SOE.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 3 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11511">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11511</a><br>Printed On: Sat Dec 10 9:32:58 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
