Because of this, I want to try to keep things moving on the weekends – at least a little.  So beginning today I’m going to start a weekend recap every saturday.<br><br>This weeks version is going to be a bit short due to the transition process that’s still in the works – but here we go!<br><br>Here at EQ Vault this week we had a <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=19&category_select_id=1">Q&A with Alan Crosby</a> dealing with the recent Guild Summit and a few <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/image299/eq-299x184-1.jpg">exclusive Omens of War screenshots</a>.  We also had the first chapter of a new Fan Fiction series entitled <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Fanfic.list&category_select_id=7">“Silent Agreement”</a><br><br>Around the web this week a new update in the Developers Corner describes the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63024">changes to Tavci</a>.  Stratics has a <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/features/oow/exclusiveepic.php">sneak peak at Magician Epic 2.0</a>, and PlanetEQ also has a couple exclusive <a href="http://www.planeteq.com/features/omensofwar/omens.shtm"> Omens screens.</a><br><br>Expect this to be a bit larger next week.  If you have any suggestions about this shoot me an e-mail.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EQ Vault<br>News Date: Sat 07 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#195<br>Printed On: Sun Aug 22 1:24:38 PDT 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
