<br>By <a href="mailto:avalonb@yahoo.com">Avalon</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>08-10-2004</b> - 
<p>Silence was before his master again in a matter of hours.  He used a series of gestures and signs to explain what he had seen at the city.  His master was lost in thought for some time, then said, “Yes, it seems that a great enemy has come to our shores.  We will have to work even harder to strike fear into these creatures, drive them from our land or enslave them!” His voice was a rasping whisper.<p>
Silence waited for his master’s reply patiently. His thoughts were calm, peaceful as a pond deep underground, and just as dark.  He knew only hate and fear.  Hate drove him to kill and fear drove him to terrorize his opponents whenever possible before killing them.  <p>
The master finally spoke, “I charge you to find one of these creatures, kill it, and bring it back to me.  I, in turn, will have the shamans and necromancers examine the body, as well as tell them of these brown skinned robed creatures you spoke of.  Perhaps there is some lore regarding them in our vaults.  Bring me my specimen.”<p>
Silence left the city again for the second time that day, this time with a mission he would enjoy much more.  He used the same route as before.  Every time he passed through the fields, he looked with pride down into the giant pit in the middle. It held possibly one of the greatest triumphs in Iksar history:  the victory over one of the kings of dragon kind.  His skeleton still lay amid the rubble and other corpses.  So large was it, that one could see it from far off.<p>
After he spent some time on it, he continued on his way to complete his mission.  This was his homeland, and he was very patriotic about it.  He would not see strange creatures overrun the land of his ancestry.<p>
He crept within sight of this strange city again.  He waited to see one of these creatures leave it, hopefully alone.  It was not long before he spotted one.  The first thing he saw was that it was alone.  Either these creatures were extremely dumb, or they were more powerful than he thought.  He hoped for the former but planned for the latter.  <p>
Looking at the creature more closely as it approached, he tried to find some weakness in its armor.  There were a few areas where slender blades might penetrate, but none that a fist or palm could do much damage against.  Most likely he would have to find a way to relieve this thing of its burdensome metal skin.  There were indeed leather straps binding it together.  He also noted, the creature never looked into the treetops, it just kept looking around, focusing more on looking at the ground. <p>
He climbed into the trees and slipped silently along the branches to other trees until he was positioned just above the creature.  He looked for the straps again, but could not see them.  He would have to hurt this thing some before he could get them loose. <p>
Dropping out of the tree and landing with not so much as a whisper of the wind, he struck at the open area between the helmet and the breastplate, driving his talons deep into the collarbone.  The creature gave a great cry at this sudden attack and spun around whirling Silence around behind him.  Still holding on with one of his claws dug in deeply, he used his other hand to undo the straps under its chin.  Having that done, he yanked the helmet off.  The brute reached over his shoulder, grabbing the lizard, threw him forward thirty feet and into a tree. <p>
Silence regained his feet quickly, knowing on this occasion that a sitting Iksar is a dead Iksar.  The creature eyed his quarry from a full ten feet in height.  No more fear and hatred had Silence seen than that in his life.  For hours it seemed these two combatants stood facing each other, locked in a staring contest, waiting for the other to move.  <p>
So this thing is not dumb after all.  This means that it is incredibly powerful.  He grimaced inwardly at that thought and the pain in his back from having hit the tree so hard.  Luckily, the Iksars were blessed with regeneration unmatched.  This blessing was of course bestowed on races created by Cazic-Thule.  He began to circle around this monstrosity.  The creature eyed him knowingly, and slapped his large hammer against his palm in a menacing way. <p>
Silence saw a glint in his eyes, and quickly looked the creature over seeing a leather strap.  He lunged straight for the creature and rolled to the side slicing the leather strap open as he felt the air go from his lungs and the sensation of flying once more. <p>
He cursed inside to his God that these things hit harder than an avalanche of boulders.  He landed with a roll and stood up turning around to face his opponent again.  The creature’s armor hung half on and half off, yet it didn’t seem to notice.  Silence felt very abused with bruises and broken scales all over. <p>
He knew he had to do some damage to this thing to slow it down before he could work at the other strap.  He waited for a perfect chance to dive in and drive his claws deep into the thing’s ribs.  The brute obliged by raising his hammer above his head preparing to strike.  Before the moment was lost, Silence drove in straight and true, he felt his fingers go deep into the flesh.  It felt rubbery and thick, not like skin. <p>
The monster kicked him square in the chest to push him away.  Yet again, the Iksar was flying backwards, this time halted barely a few feet from it as he felt a heaviness of the hammer blast the air from his lungs again and drive him to the ground.  He lay there catching his breath while eyeing his enemy.  It had to be slowing down some by now.  It was damaged and tiring from swinging that huge piece of metal.  Surely it was slowing down! <p>
The thing lumbered over top of him and raised the hammer again for another strike.  Silence saw his opening again, and took action.  He threw his leg up between the creature’s legs and spun sideways thrusting his legs in opposite directions.  As he was brought to his feet, the creature came crashing down on its hammer. <p>
He spotted the other strap, and quickly sliced it apart.  Kicking the breastplate open, he nearly fell down with surprise.  There were no wounds on its chest.  None!  He couldn’t believe it.  This creature had the same regeneration that the Iksars had.  That meant only one thing.  Somehow, this creature was a minion of Cazic-Thule also. <p>
While he was trying to sort out what he should do, he had not been paying attention to the creature.  Behind him stood the full fury of his enemy.  Up went the hammer above its head.  And down it came…. Exactly where the iksar had been standing. <p>
Silence quickly jumped into the tree above and cart wheeled over holding onto the branch as he whirled down.  His foot connected solidly with the back of the thing’s head.  With the agility he was praised for, he quickly wrapped his legs around the creature’s neck, and yanking back heard a snap. <p>
He let the body fall to the ground, then let go of the branch and fell to the ground.  He circled the corpse a few times watching to make sure it did not get up again.  He sighed with relief and began pulling it along behind him slowly. <p>
He had many things to ponder on his way back.  What were these creatures?  How did they have the same ability to heal as Iksars?  Were they related in some way through Cazic-Thule?  How was he going to make it back to New Sebilis while carrying this thing?  It was definitely heavy, and even more bulky than heavy. <p>
Through the night and well into the next day he pulled the body behind him.  This trip normally took around three hours, this time it took fifteen. <p>
As he passed the patrols outside the city, the soldiers eyed him with some awe, and then charged him with weapons drawn.  Immediately he let go of the creature’s legs and crouched into a stance ready for the guards. <p>
Instead of hitting him though, they jabbed their long spears into the creature behind him.  He heard a grunt and the thing collapsed again.  Somehow it had healed its broken neck.  It took it fifteen hours to do it, but it actually did come back to life. <p>
Yet another thing to wonder about.  He resumed his efforts and managed to drag the monster back to his master. <p>
As he entered the building, his master looked up and nodded knowingly.<p>
“It is as I feared, we have been found.”<p>
