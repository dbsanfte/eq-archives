This round one of the main topics is communication between the developers and the players.  Interesting read for sure.  Here's a clip:<br><br><blockquote>Please remember, even if we're not posting or discussing certain topics in the forums, we're listening.  The team not only reads your posts, but discusses them internally on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, many of the requests and issues you present to us do not have easy solutions.  With every change, update, and addition, we must consider all of the possible ramifications on nearly 8 years worth of content and systems.  Because of these risks and the shear scale of the game and our player base, we have to take our time with certain changes.</blockquote><br>So go give it a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63132">read!</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EQ Vault<br>News Date: Mon 09 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#199<br>Printed On: Sun Aug 22 1:25:41 PDT 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
