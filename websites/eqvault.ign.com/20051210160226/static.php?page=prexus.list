  Prexus merged with Kane Bayle.</font></strong><strong><font size="+1"><br>
  </font></strong>Updated on August 3, 2005
<p>Complied by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! </p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://banishedshadows.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Banished Shadows</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Banished Shadows is a guild built on the principles of Fair Play, Honestly,
  and Loyalty. 

<p>We are not a raiding guild, though we do like to raid. We attempt to take
  down any target our members request and pursue content to make us stronger.
  Our raids are never mandatory. </p>
<p>If you are looking for a very relaxed and fun home to group, raid, and level.
  This may be the guild for you. </p>
<p>May be any race or class, Level 30+. For maximum guild participation - Level
  46+ is recommended. <br>
  Must register and maintain an active website account. <br>
  Must read and abide by our Bylaws. <br>
  <br>
  Must group with an officer and receive a favorable recommendation to receive
    a guild tag. <br>
  Get to know us in game - /join bs:apps to meet us. <br>
  Some exceptions may apply. If you have any questions, please look for an officer
in game.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crossroadinn.com/forums/index.php?c=14" target="_blank"><strong>Circle
of the White Rose</strong></a><br>
&quot;Circle of White Rose is a casual easy going family type guild...</p>
<p>There are very few rules, but here they are:</p>
<p>1. NO BEGGING!!! This includes begging for money, begging for gear, begging
  for power leveling, etc.</p>
<p>2. NO BEGGING!!! Oh, I think I covered this! </p>
<p>3. If any items are removed from the guild bank, they are to be used by guild
  toons unless cleared by the guild leader Llolani!</p>
<p>4. Raids: Be prompt and on time for raids... If it is scheduled to start at
  6:00 pm CST, I expect everyone to arrive by 5:30 pm CST for organization...
  If you arrive late, and we have already started, it is up to you to get to
  us, we will not backtrack to come get you...</p>
<p>5. Allied guilds deserve the kindness and respect that we give our own guild... </p>
<p>6. Please keep guild as clean as possible... No heavy cussing in case of small
  children (we don't have many at the moment, but just in case) </p>
<p>7. HAVE FUN!!! HAVE FUN!!! HAVE FUN!!!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.otn.co.uk/cnd/" target="_blank"><strong>Clan Na Dreolan</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>Who are the Clan?<br>
  Clan nan Dreolan is a mostly european everquest guild on
  the Prexus server. We are a guild of friends, both RL and in game, who enjoy
  the game of Everquest.
  We balance the &quot;family Guild&quot; atmosphere with a mature raiding style.
  Most of our members are resident somewhere in europe but we also have a good
  number of American members. Where you are in the world does not matter to us
as long as you are a friend.</p>
<p>Our raids and events are usually arranged to suit European timings.</p>
<p>Clan Philosophy<br>
  The Clan does not believe in dictating what others must do
  to have fun. Therefore we do not force members to attend raids, gain equipment
  or keys/flags. We are
not a mandatory raiding guild.</p>
<p>Charter<br>
The clan's charter is simple. It's basically &quot;Treat each other with respect,
and have fun&quot;. Or to put it another way: &quot;Be excellent to each other
and party on dudes!&quot;</p>
<p>We do raid - quite a lot actually! Take a look at our raids section to see
  what raids we've been on recently. But our raids never require anyone to attend
  if they don't want to. Clan members seem to enjoy raiding, especially when
  we take on targets that are harder than we might reasonably expect to beat.
  We win those encounters by being well organised and following the instructions
  of the raid leaders diligently. We also welcome friends from outside the clan
  on our raids when we have room (which we usually do).</p>
<p>So although we don't force anyone in the clan to farm flags or keys - most
  of the regular raiders do those things anyway. We enjoy raiding together and
  we're keen to keep moving onwards and upwards.</p>
<p>Guild Rules<br>
  Rule 1. Treat each other with respect and courtesy.<br>
  <br>
  The Guild itself is mainly based on family and friends (RL or in-game) joined
    together to really get some more fun out of the world of Norrath. For the
    moment we're mostly Europeans within the Guild, but Guild membership is open
    to any friend of any nationality in any timezone. If you are from another
    timezone remember this though, since most of our raids and events take place
    in primetime GMT/BST. Also worth mentioning is that even if most current
  members have characters of level 60 and above there is no level-restriction
for applying.</p>
<p>As much as you want to know us and our ways within the Guild, we
    want to know you. The easiest way to do this is to join our raids, join our
    groups and join the channel we maintain for this purpose: cnd:cnd. The channel
    is also a good way for you to get information you may want, answers to questions
    you may have and also a good source to know if something is going on. (To
join it, type /join cnd:cnd in the game).&quot;</p>

as well as Omens of War.<br>

<p>Raiding is non-mandatory but definitely encouraged.<br>
<br>
  We are looking for players motivated by more than their own desires.If you
      are a person who's only goal is to advance your character at the expense
      of all
    others, this is not the guild for you.<br>

<p>We have 2 tiers of the application process:</p>
<p>The first tier is invite status. This is the stage where you are interested
  in us, and we are interested in you. We will invite you to our raid chat channel,
  and start asking you along on raids. While in this status, you are a GUEST
  and we are trying to get to know you. Do not expect any loot while in this
  status, Alts and bots have more rights then you. A typical invite status will
last a month or more depending on how often you are on and able to attend raids. </p>
<p><a href="http://handofka.tehomgz.net/phpbb/" target="_blank"><strong>Hand of Ka</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  &quot;We are a guild that originated
    as a close knit family that likes to 'do more with less.' We started in 2002
    as
  a group of 10 friends that enjoyed gaming together in EverQuest and making
  things happen that we had no business attempting with such small numbers. We
  are still going strong and are progressing through Planes of Power. We are
  looking for like minded people to join us on our wild journey of blowing stuff
up. </p>
<p>I am the guild leader. Our officers are Evermann and Kezrith. Please do not
  hesitate to contact any of us should you have any questions. </p>
<p>Our recruitment is open to all classes. We have a level requirement of level
  60. If you are a real life family member of an existing Hand of Ka member,
  your application is more lenient. Please speak with myself or an officer regarding
  this. </p>
<p>Hand of Ka is a family style guild that raids. We are not hardcore raiders,
  and we appreciate our days off to mess around. On the same note, we do take
  our raiding very seriously and work very hard at achieving our goals. We like
  to keep a balance of raiding and nights off to do our own thing. We raid two
  to three times a week, usually Tuesdays, Wednesdays and/or Thursdays. We are
  looking for a membership that wants to support the guild in this manner. If
  you do not feel that this suits you, then Hand of Ka may not be the guild for
  you. Similarly, if you are looking for a hardcore, raid every night kind of
  guild, you're also looking in the wrong place. </p>
<p>Once you have posted an application, you will be given access to our &quot;Friends
  and Applicants Forum.&quot; Here you will find any information regarding our
  applicant chat channel and any future raids you may join in on. It is imperative
  that you keep up with reading our message boards so you are informed as to
  the upcoming events. </p>
<p>Our application length is three weeks, after which time an applicant goes
  up for vote with our membership for up to one week. Two no votes will end an
  application. One mortal enemy vote will end an application. If you do not have
  enough &quot;yes&quot; votes by the time the voting is through, you will be
  asked to reapply. </p>
<p>Any applicant carrying another guild's tag or applying to other guilds during
  their application time with Hand of Ka will not be considered for membership. </p>
<p>Our loot system is based on merit. Basically, you get what you put in to Hand
  of Ka. Our merit is based on attendence to events, and also includes consideration
  in how an item will best upgrade the guild as a whole. We strive to progress
  the guild together as one unit and not the individual.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.legionofkings.com/" target="_blank">Legion of Kings</a></strong><br>
  &quot;Currently only recruiting new Kings Levels 40+. Thanks.<br>
Membership and Rule of the realm</p>
<p>1) We feel begging is dishonorable, and puts all at an uneasy spot. No one
  likes having another begging them for stuff. SO There is to be no Begging as
  a King! This mean no begging (for money, gear and powerleveling) from others
  both guildies and non-guildies</p>
<p>2) We feel our guild is a family so we ask that we all get along and treat<br>
  guildies with the respect and friend ship that you would wish from your own
    real family. We ask also that sence this guild as well as the game in general
    has kids it it , Please keep it clean!!!</p>
<p>3) We Have a play nice rule here. Thous No Kill stealing, Camp stealing,<br>
  or riping off others. No bad mouthing others in OOCs, Shouts, or even in guild
    chats and try to re main as honorable as our name sugguests.</p>
<p>4) Levels; Of course we would love to have all level 70s here. but we ask
  if you feel our rules are something you can live with and feel like this guild
  is a guild that you can only grow with and become loyaled. Then we would be
  willing to allow you in at level 40+.<br>
  We do ask that if possable that you make it to our officers for an invite,
  sence at time our officers may be grouped or camping a mob and cant always
  run to you.</p>
<p>5) The most important rule is... we are all here to have fun, to make friends
  and to build our characters up. so have a goot time!</p>
<p>6) We all put into each others characters a not only time and friend ship,
  We work together as a group to get you better gears and levels as we hunt together.
  It Saddens us to see after some have grown to a point to where they can be
  of a help to others in the guild. they leave us to go to other guilds. No Loyalty
  there. We ask, if you Join our ranks you stay and work to better this guild
  with us, In turn we will become that higher level guild sought after by others.</p>
<p>7) We hold a confirmation vote on new members after one month of membership.
  This is not a vote on how well you play EQ. It is a vote on whether or not
  you fit in with the guild &quot;personality&quot;.</p>
<p>8) We use a DKP point system for dividing up loot on raids. Its designed to
be fair to all.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.namelessorder.com/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>Nameless
Order</strong></a><br>
&quot;Nameless Order was founded originally by a close-knit group of
friends from Ultima Online in a guild called the Circle of Honor. The guild was
always very small
and we had a lot of fun over the years together.</p>
<p>Eventually, many of us migrated to the world of Everquest in early 1999. Among
  the original members to inhabit the newly formed world of Prexus were Cersei,
  Solthen, Krome, Flugan, Monteroy, and Syrina, Zardym and Emeril. Since those
  pioneering days, however the guild has grown by leaps and bounds. Originally
  we had set out to be a small and close-knit guild here as well, but our adventures
  brought upon many wonderful new friends. With that, however, has also brought
  upon a number of changes as to whom we should invite into the guild. Thus the
  officers performed this composition of this document.</p>
<p>These are the rules for joining the Nameless Order put into place so that
  a vast number of our members can interact and get to know the person and player
  behind the character.</p>
<p>To be considered for Nameless Order, and to raid with us during your recruit
period, applicants must be a minimum level of 70.</p>
<p>In addition to the level requirements, the following alt abilities are very
  highly recommended (note: You need at least 250 AA&#8217;s or more to apply,
some classes require more.) [see website for class details.]</p>
<p>Application Process:<br>
  In order to be considered for joining Nameless Order, the applicant must be
    in good standing with the Prexus Server community, and may not be currently
    guilded with another guild, or actively applying and raiding with another
    guild. While the guild is always willing to give new applicants the benefit
    of the doubt, we strive to maintain the highest level of integrity among
our members.</p>
<p>Nameless Order is a raiding guild with an average of 4 raid nights per week
  and other guild activities at least one other night per week. If you are applying
  to the guild, it is imperative that you raid with us in order for the guild
  to get to know you. It is also important to know that the guild relies on raid
  attendance for success. If you feel that you are not able to raid with the
  guild, we might not be the best fit for you. While there is no set limit of
  raids that you must attend in order to apply/join Nameless Order, you must
  actively raid with the guild for at least one month before your application
  will be considered, usually longer.</p>
<p>Once an applicant has spoken to an officer or recruiting coordinator about
  joining, then their name will be posted for internal discussion. After a few
  days, the applicant will be notified if he/she will be able to raid with us
  as a recruit. Or if he/she won&#8217;t be considered at this time.</p>
<p>Once you are officially considered a recruit, you will be invited to join
  our official recruits channel.</p>
<p>Any applicant applying to other guilds will have his or her Nameless Order
  application rejected.</p>
<p>After at least one month of active raiding with us an applicant will be put
  up for decision on whether to tag or not.</p>
<p>If the recruit is not accepted into the guild on their first month, they may
  continue to raid with us so long as they received no &quot;mortal enemy&quot; votes,
  and they MAY be considered in the following month's tagging decisions. </p>
<p>Remember: Getting to know as many members as possible is greatly to a recruit's
  advantage.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the necessary votes to join, recruits are added to the guild
  as probationary member for a period of 60 days. These 60 days will be the final
  evaluation period before becoming a full member of our guild. Active attendance
  on raids and active leveling will be expected during this time.</p>

Rage</strong></a><br>
Welcome to the homepage of Noble Rage. This humble gathering of like-minded individuals
has come together in order to form a guild of Noble purpose and intent, fighting
our way through adversity
with our Rage against injustice. This shall be our gathering point for members
to come together in search of good times, achievement of goals, and the bettering
of the world we play in.</p>
<p>Noble Rage is a guild of many diverse members. We have members from a wide
  variety of backgrounds in our guild. The focus of the officers in NR is to
  provide an environment where individuals can grow, and thereby strengthen the
guild as a whole and increase our ability to take on bigger and harder mobs.</p>
<p>Language / Guild Chat<br>
  Norrath is made up of a completely mixed population men, women and children.
    Therefore it is improper behavior to use profanity, expletives or discuss
    overtly sexual topics in any form of public communications including; shout,
    out-of-character, guild say and say. Derogatory comments about race, religion,
    and sexual orientation will also not be tolerated. It is contrary to our
    guild's objective to create an environment that makes any individual unconfortable.
    As members, you should seek to make a pleasant experience for yourself, and
your guildmates.</p>
<p>Spamming, be it guild or any other form of chat is discourteous and regarded
  as poor manners. This includes repeatedly asking for prices, assistance, or
  any other thing. Additionally, selling is NOT permitted in guild chat. Selling
  should be conducted in the auction channel or on the forum pages established
for this purpose.</p>
<p>Our Priorities:<br>
  1. Respect!<br>
  2. Have fun!<br>
  3. Raid like you mean it!</p>
<p>Explanation of Priorities:<br>
  All Noble members of this guild will be held to a high moral standard. In every
    word and deed, you are an ambassador of this guild and all its members. Nobles
    should strive to avoid even the appearance of dishonorable behavior so that
    our name will be upheld as a guild of honest and fair people. Nobles must
    respect all other players, their fellow guildmates, and themselves. Please
    be open and honest at all times when offering up your opinion - and allow
    others to be so as well. Since there are minors that play this game with
    us, Nobles are expected to keep the guild chat channel free of expletives
    and overt sexual topics. In other words, keep it PG-13 or better. A Noble
    should also maintain adherence to this policy in all OOC and SHOUT channels
    as well. That is what tells and other created channels are for. </p>
<p>Raids and Raiding:<br>
  Your attendance at raids is never required. However, when you choose to attend
    a raid, you will be expected to show up on time, pay attention, and do your
job.</p>
<p>Application Requirements:</p>
<p> * * Applicants should be Level 62 or higher with few exceptions in special
  circumstances.</p>
<p>* Applicants are required to carefully read the Guild Charter and Code of
  Conduct listed in the Information Section. If there are issues with any of
  the content, please discuss these with an officer before applying.</p>
<p> * Applicants must answer all of the Application questions to the best of
  their ability and as honestly as possible.</p>
<p> * Applicants must be unguilded or in the process of leaving their current
  guild. Please do not apply to Noble Rage if you have any pending applications
  with any other guild(s).&quot;</p>

Destruction</strong></a><br>
.In late 2003, some supremely driven very crazy and wonderfully hopeful friends
  formed a small guild. We all laughed at them of course, sitting in our comfy
  lil family guilds, wishing we could see some of the new zones but unable to
get the flags or make 7 day a week raids. </p>
<p>They were going to Time........that's what they told us anyway and an entire
  server giggled madly at them, NO ONE gets to Time raiding a few days a week
  the uber guilds said, you shall fail miserably and we will enjoy every moment
  of it. </p>
<p>A week later several very confused, slightly hesitant and supremely newb raiders
  took the field led by this lil band of friends. We loved the game, we loved
  each other, we were finally gonna get some uber loots!!! </p>
<p>We died, we wiped, we sweated and cussed and keyed and flagged and one year
  almost to the date, we stepped into Time under our own steam. We cried together
  and laughed together and yes we even snarled at each other once in a while,
  and the raid leaders developed terrets I'm told and sometime broke out into
mad uncontrollable cursing.</p>
<p>With all the hope in the world for our guilds future we made our first few
  forays into Time on the already dying server of KB. In our time we absorbed
  several smaller guilds, and we saw players bad and good alike come and go,
  and we remained hopeful for a time, until that day our core players began to
dwindle and the population on Kane Bayle sunk to an all time low. </p>
<p>Dishearted, these brave wonderful and hopeful people, finally made the hardest
  decision a guild must make, for both it's name and the people who deserved
  so much better. We disbanded and split our population between 2 guilds hoping
  that we would all find new homes and continue to progress, for that is why
  we played. </p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Two days before this post, &quot;the call&quot; became irresistable, and a
  wiser, but rested leadership pulled the PD tag from it's resting place, dusted
  it off, polished it up and opened our hearts to new possibilities. We were
joined by some of our most cherished old PDers. </p>
<p>So the door is open, only the future will tell, but again we don our beaten
  and slightly used armour, pull our swords from the shelf and start forward
  on a brand new journey............the ticking of the clock in Time has not
  lost it's allure, but we also know there are other journeys to be taken, and
  together we'll make them. </p>
<p>Let us see what the future holds. Let us hold those first brave raiders of
  PD in our hearts and remember that friends and dreams are made when a guild
  takes it's first steps forward into the sun. </p>
<p>We embrace our new raiders and hold those who've been on the long journey
  close, in time we too will build a history together. </p>
<p>We've been tested by time, conquered the unexpected, weathered the storms
  and suffered the lose of those we love, and still we stand........ </p>
<p>LET THE DESTRUCTION BEGIN!!</p>
<p>Updated Aug 2nd: We are opening up recruiting for a few classes to bolster
  our roster. If you think you are a stellar player and have something to offer
  us
  that makes you
  stand apart, feel free to apply and we will review your app. </p>
<p>We have beat Quarm and will continue to farm time. we are continuing To raid
  Uqua as our last step to get into Qvic in GoD progression as well. </p>
<p>Do you want to experience high end EQ raiding, but can't play EQ as a full
  time job? Do you enjoy real life too? Do you want serious gaming friends? Do
  you know your class well, want to raid, and are you willing to listen well
  and follow instruction? If you answer yes to these questions, then PD may be
  the perfect fit for you. </p>
<p>Planar Destruction is a raiding guild however we do not raid every day. We
  raid four times a week, Monday Wednesday Friday 8:00 PM eastern US time, and
  on Sunday 6:00 PM eastern US time. We raid targets that are fun, profitable,
  and help increase raiding proficiency. PD is a serious raiding guild that does
  not require daily raiding -- it is a raiding guild where real life comes first. </p>
<p>If you are level 70, Time flagged and know your class well, then please apply
  now. We will not accept your application if you are below 70. </p>
<p>Minimum AA: 100 <br>
Normal Raid Schedule: Sun 6pm est, Mon, Wed, Fri 8pm est </p>
<p>We are currently accepting the following classes:<br>

Alliance</strong></a><br>
Choosing the right guild is one of the most important decisions you can make
in EQ. Joining a guild that fits your playstyle and goals can have a huge positive
effect on your enjoyment of the game. Joining a guild that does not fit your
playstyle and goals can lead to a lot of frustration. </p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to help you decide whether Shining Alliance is
  the right guild for you and, if you decide it is, explain the rules we use
  for admitting new members.</p>
<p>Much of this will be done in FAQ form because it's easy and I am lazy.</p>
<p>What sort of guild is Shining Alliance?</p>
<p>Shining Alliance is a casual guild that raids. Shining Alliance is not a raiding
  guild.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the difference?&quot;, you might ask.</p>
<p>The main differences are as follows: </p>
<p>1)We raid less often than a raiding guild. Raids days are Wednesdays and Saturdays.
  (Usual starting times are 6pm eastern on Wednesdays and 12 eastern on Saturdays.)While
  we may raid something on a day other than our raid days this is very, very
  rare. Generally, if a mob isn't up on our raid day, it doesn't get raided by
  us.</p>
<p>2) Raid attendence is not mandatory. Sometimes you can't make it to a raid.
  Sometimes you just don't feel like it. That's fine.</p>
<p>3) We have no mimimum level or AA requirements. We want good people whose
  company we enjoy. We don't care what level they are. (It is worth noting, however,
  that the vast majority of our guild is level 70, so while there is no minimum
  level to join, it is a lot harder to get to know people if you are too low
  level to group with them. It's not impossible, but it is harder) </p>
<p>How do you handle loot?</p>
<p>Loot is awarded by a vote of the officers. </p>
<p>When loot drops, we ask for tells from anyone that would use the item and
  then the officers look at the list of people that asked in and vote for who
  will receive the item.</p>
<p>There are many factors that we consider in awarding loot, including raid attendence,
  guild seniority, level, attitude, how long it has been since a person got something,
  how much of an upgrade something is, what will benefit the guild most, and
probably a few other things that I am forgetting. &quot;</p>

  &quot;Qvic access has been attained and we're now gearing up to advance even deeper
    into GoD. We're still progressing thru OoW, with a hit of Epics here and
    there. On top of all that, we've had a movement to progress thru DoN underway
as well. It's a busy time with lots going on. We are still seeking a few more
    solid raiders for specific classes to come along. If interested please visit
    our Recruitment Board for additional information.

<p><a href="http://www.swordoffate.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Sword of Fate</strong></a><br>
Fate has many faces on Norrath. Its workings can be seen in the machinations
  of the gods and dragons. To a lesser extent, Fate can be seen in the actions
  of the mortal races. Most mortals are swept along by their fates. A rare few
  have been chosen by Fate to do otherwise. They have the ability to seize control
of their destinies, their fates. </p>
<p>We are those people. We have recognized the spark that marks greatness in
  each other. We have come together to form the Sword of Fate because we are
  the strong, the ones able to seize our own destinies. We are each strong on
  our own, but together our strength increases exponentially, until we become
  like a force of nature. Fate is no longer something we answer to, but something
  we control. The spark that the chosen of Fate carry comes not to any one race
  or creed, but to many. Thus, membership in the Sword of Fate is not limited
  to any one race or class. </p>
<p>We do not just use our strength and drive to further our own ends. We realize
  that sometimes the spark may reside in others and merely need a little fanning
  to bring it to life. In accordance with that, in addition to supporting each
  other, we keep an eye out for those that may need a little help. This does
  not mean that we perform charity for those that won't help themselves. In fact,
  we despise those that new to adventuring, cry out for free money or items.
  They are not choosing their own Fate, but letting it come their way in the
  form of charity from others. However, we will lend a helping hand to those
  deserving of it. Sometimes a person can try to seize their own fate before
  they are truly experienced enough to handle it, or maybe a person needs a little
  assistance with a fateful quest that could ignite the spark that allows them
  to take their own destiny and control it. Such brave and worthy adventurers
  can find the assistance and companionship they need among our ranks. We always
  stand ready to assist those with the desire and the courage to seize their
  Fate. </p>
<p>The Sword of Fate is a dynamic group that has come together to forge a great
  destiny for all of us. Perhaps you could have the spark, the strength that
  would allow you to become one of us. Only time and your own actions will tell.</p>
<p>What is expected of a member of the Sword of Fate? </p>
<p>A member of Sword of Fate conducts herself or himself in an honorable fashion,
  and with consideration of earning the respect and admiration of everyone on
  Prexus. There are no specific rules, but a member of the Sword of Fate is trusted
  to recognize and follow the honorable course of action in any situation. Members
  are expected to be of high character and integrity, and will be held accountable
  to that responsibility. </p>
<p>The highest expectation is to have fun and enjoy your adventures in Norrath.
  A member of Sword of Fate can do this without kill stealing, training other
  citizens of Norrath with mobs, or doing anything else that might prevent others
  from having fun or enjoying their adventures. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that your actions reflect not only your honor, but the honor
  of the whole guild. The guildtag over your head has earned a great deal of
  respect on the Prexus community through the actions of those that have come
  before you. </p>
<p>I don't need no stinkin' rules... </p>
<p>...but I do get by with a little help from my friends. The Sword of Fate is
  a guild of like-minded friends who as individuals are great but as a team are
  greater. A guild by design forged to develop trusting relationships not for
  dependence but for that on which you can depend. As the guild grows larger
  it has come to our attention that this trust can be abused, spindled and mutilated,
  and this cannot be countenanced. </p>
<p>Let it be known the officers of Sword of Fate hold the honor and reputation
  of this guild in high esteem, and in matters of dispute and controversy may
  issue commands which are meant to be followed in order to protect this honor.
  Members of The Sword of Fate can expect the guild to promote the development
  of working together of common goals, and an atmosphere where you can as a member
  of The Sword of Fate have respect and honor for and from the general population
  of Prexus. </p>
<p>The Sword of Fate guild is NOT A DEMOCRACY though members who offer suggestions
  can be assured that they are taken into consideration. Ghriz is the head of
  the guild and has final say on any issue or the power to veto any command by
  any officer. If you wish to challenge an officer's order you may petition Ghriz.
  If Ghriz is offline you still must accept an officer's order as legal and valid
  and follow it as given. Officers should make every effort to consult all other
  officers online for a consensus before making a member follow an order he/she
  may wish to challenge. </p>
<p>Ayar and the officers of The Sword of Fate guild retain the right to discipline
  or banish any member of Sword of Fate for any reason whatsoever. As a member
  of the Sword of Fate you have the right to petition Ghriz and the officers
  for grievances at the Sword of Fate bulletin board on the Sword of Fate website,
  or through the use of his personal email. </p>
<p>Greetings potential future member of SoF: You've begun a long and arduous
  task. Asking for membership into our family isn't for the faint of heart. SoF
  strives
  to be a very, very close family.
    We are particular about whom we invite, and about the standards we expect
  from our members. </p>
<p>The most important thing you need to know about our application process is
  its purpose: to make sure that you can learn as much as possible about us,
  and us about you, so that you can feel comfortable that SoF is right for you,
  and vice versa. The more we learn about eachother during the application period,
  the better. We want all of our new members to feel completely at home and comfortable
  with us from the moment they add that guildtag to their name. If a new member
  joins us and then feels lost in a crowd of new faces and unrecognized names,
  then the process has not done its job. SoF is a family, and we want you to
  feel like part of the family already when you join us. That's what the process
  is all about. </p>
<p>The process of joining can be a very different experience from applicant to
  applicant. Don't be discouraged if you see someone who applies after you carrying
  around our guild tag before you. Depending on your play style and level, and
  how well you know us and our members before you apply, it may take significantly
  longer to get your required number of votes. </p>
<p>The fastest and best way to make friends with our members, and gain votes
  is to join us on raids. Raiding is where you will have the most exposure to
  our members and officers. For folks who are below raid level (~55) you may
  find it very difficult to interact with enough people to get your votes. Join
  a raid you've never been on before, ask questions, and find out how we do things. </p>
<p>So you say you're not high enough level to join us on raids...Work us over.
  Send tells to the officers and members who are online. If we're free, we'll
  see what we can do about getting some time set up with you. But
  don't let your sponsors off the hook. Work with your sponsor to set up raids
  appropriate for your level. Work with your sponsor to set up groups. And don't
  be afraid to initiate your own events, too, even silly stuff like tea and cookies
with Emperor Crush. </p>
<p>It's a long, difficult and sometimes trying road. But we can assure you that
  it is well worth the wait!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thanatopsis-order.org/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>Thanatopsis
Order</strong></a><br>
Thanatopsis Order is looking to grow and to do this we have implemented a new
recruitment policy. </p>
<p>We are a casual/family type guild that raids a couple of times a week. We
  are currently trying to progress in the world of Norrath and are wanting of
  people that want to participate with the guild and see it grow for our mutual
  benefit. </p>
<p>As most of the guild is at or above level 60 the following level guidelines
must be met: </p>
<p>1. Level &lt;51 - Not admitted* <br>
  2. Level 51-54 - Probationary member** <br>
  3. Level 55-60 Accepted <br>
  4. Level &gt;60 Preferred </p>
<p>* Exceptions will be made for close friends and family but will be considered
  probationary members (see next footnote). Gearing up these people will be the
  responsibility of the friend/family member, not the guild. <br>
  ** Probationary members will not be allowed access to/participation in guild
  hand-me-downs, raid loot, loot rolls, loot merits, or resources in the guild
bank until they reach level 55. </p>
<p>We do not require:<br>
  1. any flags <br>
  2. keys <br>
  3. AA&#8217;s <br>
4. gear minimums</p>
<p>Out of respect for other guilds we will not accept membership applications
if: </p>
<p>1. You are tagged with another guild during your application. <br>
2. You are applying to many guilds simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.thesilentminority.net/" target="_blank">The Silent Minority</a> </strong><br>
A European guild. Recruitment open.</p>
<p>&quot;Aims and Objectives<br>
  To grow in size and strength while always maintaining quality. <br>
  To strive to be able to support our members in what they want to achieve. <br>
  To work together to make our shared EQ experience the best it can be. <br>
  To make the name of TSM respected, so that others will want to join us. <br>
  To have fun together! <br>
  <br>
The members of The Silent Minority:<br>
Ask for guild help only when they really need
  it, knowing that other members will stop what they're doing to help another
  member in real need. <br>
  Help out other guild members when they can knowing that guild members won't
  ask unless they really need help. <br>
  Strive to forge and strengthen friendships between members. <br>
  Constantly improve the guild's reputation by their conduct, acting with decorum
  and consideration in their travels, offering advice and assistance to those
  in need. <br>
  Treat all other guilds and individuals without prejudice. <br>
  Always keep a look out for good people who might be interested to join The
  Silent Minority. <br>
Entry Requirements</p>
<p>To join, a player must bring at least one character of level 62 or higher.
  Although we do have alts in the guild it is encouraged that you concentrate
  mainly on the character you apply with. Alts are not allowed into the guild
  until they are level 20 either.<br>
  Above all, The Silent Minority's bottom line is quality. All members are competent
  players, but more importantly, they are good people. This is essential, and
  prospective members must have extensive association - hunting or equivalent
  - with supporting guild members.<br>
  Please be aware that The Silent Minority is predominantly a GMT guild. This
  does not exclude players from other time zones, but please be aware that in
  general, the guild's busy times are likely to be GMT-orientated.</p>
<p>Please be unguilded when you apply to us.
      Also we don't like applicants to apply with several other guilds. If you
    apply to
      us
      then
      do so
      100% and show
  some faith. No one gets turned down if there are no real big issues.</p>
<p>The Silent Minority has a 'recommended' Level of 62. Since we are a elemental
    planes guild applicants should at least have this level. Exceptions are made
for RL friends of existing members.</p>
<p> All new applications to the guild now require a sponsor, this
  sponsor can be anyone who is a FULL MEMBER of The Silent Minority. This person
  acts as your
    link with the rest of the guild. Without a sponsor you can not be invited
    into the guild. If you do not have anyone to act as a sponsor, then take
    the time to group with and get to know some TSM members. Also feel free to
    join the Application-Channel of TSM (type &quot;/join tsmapp in game&quot;).
We will announce free groupspots there so you get to know us fast. &quot;</p>

Unity Recruitment Policy</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>&#8226; Level 70 required and AA as required by class.<br>
  &#8226; 
  You must have completed the CoA signet quest.<br>
&#8226; 
  You must be 18 years old and maintain your own account.<br>
&#8226; 
  You must have 200 in all resists without buffs.<br>
&#8226; 
  You must have an invis device or be capable of invising yourself.<br>
&#8226; 
  You own all expansions to the EQ game.<br>
&#8226; 
  You can raid when we raid, 5:00 PM PST &#8211; 11:00 PM PST.<br>
&#8226; 
  You cannot belong to another guild.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are about to embark on a wonderful journey to become
  a full-fledged member of Unity. Unity is the &#8220;best GD guild in EQ&#8217;&#8482;!
  We welcome you to apply if you meet the following considerations:</p>
<p>For your application to be seriously considered you should already be Level
  70, no exceptions. There are also required AA's for many of the exciting classes
  within EQ posted here that you should review that were created and revised
  by our current and past members; skills they deemed essential to your class
  for survival within our challenging raid-oriented environments.</p>
<p>You should have all of the expansions to the EQ game in order to apply. Considerations
  will be made on a case by case basis for players or applicants when new expansions
  are released, but the general rule is that you have thirty(30) days from release
  to get up to current on your subscription. Unity is committed to the high-end
  content in the most current expansion, period. You would do us no good to be
  one step behind.</p>
<p>The most productive member to us will also have access to old content. While
  it is not required that you have things like a &#8220;VP Key&#8221;, &#8220;ST&#8221;, &#8220;Time&#8221;,
  etc., it will be considered a bonus towards your application if you have managed
  these feats in your past and can aid us should we elect to return to previous
  content for an evening to annihilate small furry creatures and vent some frustrations
  over broken content.</p>
<p>One of the most important things is your capability to raid with us time wise.
  Unity is a guild that is spread all over the globe. We have members in likely
  about half of the time zones on the planet. Thus, we have some very dedicated
  raiders that raid on our schedule despite the personal inconvenience to themselves.
  Unity raids between 5:00 PM PST (8:00 PM EST) and 11:00 PM PST (3:00 AM EST),
  and while we don&#8217;t always run that late, raids can run over what is initially
  expected. You&#8217;re encouraged to come to all raids for which you are online
  and leave when it best suits you. We appreciate the extra effort of all members
on the tail-end of a late night raid.&quot;</p>
