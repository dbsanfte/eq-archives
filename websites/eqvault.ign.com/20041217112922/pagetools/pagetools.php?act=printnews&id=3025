I have a crapload of great stuff to throw up for you guys.<br><br>It was definately crazy, and a load of fun.  I think the first thing i'm going to throw up is a rundown of the fantastic costume contest - I have many many pictures of all the great EQ-related (and Shrek) costumes.  Should have this up tonight or early tomorrow - then stay tuned for a full fan-faire report Tuesday or Wednesday.<br><br>Stay tuned!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sun 31 Oct 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3025<br>Printed On: Fri Dec 17 3:29:15 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
