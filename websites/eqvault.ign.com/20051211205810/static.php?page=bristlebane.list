 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Bristlebane Guild List</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Bristlebane Server Guild List!<br>
  Bristlebane merged with Solsek Ro.
</font></strong><strong><font size="+1"><br>
  </font></strong>Updated on July 20, 2005
<p>Complied, not by a bot, but by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! I would especially like
  guild leader names and recruiting officer names to list for each guild.</p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.archoverseers.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Arch Overseers</strong></a><br>
  &quot;we have been regearing up our new apps and have been reaching into the depths
  of norrath and beyond. with most of our recruiting almost done we are moving
  foreward . we still have a few room for a few needed classes ( tanks,clerics,rogues)
  so if you think you might be interested then feel free to contact tiien or
drogon .<br>
<br>
You must make a magelo profile so we can see how many AA you have and where you
spend them &amp; the current state of your character. Also make sure you meet
our current requirements:<br>
  Class: ANY<br>
  AA: 250<br>
  Playtime: 5pm CET (8am PST) - midnight CET (3pm PST)<br>
  Flags: Kod`Taz highly preferred, Time high preferred (we don't flag you for
  now)&quot;<br>
  <br>
<a href="http://www.circleoflegends.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Circle of Legends</strong></a><br>
&quot;Primary Raiding Hours: 4pm Central - 11pm Central. </p>
<p>KT Flag - Required! If you do not play at least 5 nights a week you should
  apply elsewhere! This
is a DKP guild, items are earned with raiding points.</p>
<p>First, take a look below and see if your class is taking new recruits, and
  who the contact is. Then, take a look at the requirements (further down), and
  see if you fit them. Third, contact the appropriate Class Leader (listed immediately
  below) to discuss your qualifications. If you cannot reach the Class Leader,
  contact an officer. Exceptional candidates (highly geared/flagged/aa'd) are
  always considered regardless of class status. </p>
<p>The approved applications have been moved to an internal forum. If you wish
  to apply to become a Legend please copy the application template, fill in the
  answers and private message them to Denya, Aaira, or Rylaar. If your application
  is approved it will be posted to our applicant forum and you will be given
  access to that forum. To be an app: <br>
  1) You must be at least level 69. No ifs, ands or buts. If you aren't at least
  level 69 now, come back when you are.<br>
  2) A solid connection to the internet.
  As it says a number of places. We raid a lot, so a fast connection is vital.
  If you are lagged to death on raids,
  we can't make use of you. Sorry.<br>
  3) Expect to app for two weeks or more. This
  is an investment in your and our time, so be prepared to raid alot and to put
  alot into it.<br>
  4) You MUST be highly active, we like to raid and we can't do
  that if our members are not online. If you don't play at least 5 days a week,
  we do not
  need you.&quot;<br>
  <strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.clanoftheroc.com/" target="_blank">Clan of the Roc</a></strong><br>
No posted recruiting thread or requirements, but they are taking applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clubfu.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Club Fu</strong><br>
</a>&quot;ONLY looking at STANDOUT applicants..OTHERWISE recruitment is CLOSED for
now. If you play more than 30 hours weekly, know your class in and out and feel
like dying in the worst possible ways EQ can offer, maybe Club Fu is something
for you. But before applying, take the time to read this post. </p>
<p>Above all, Club FU is a raiding guild. We raid every night, if you're online
  you're expected to raid too. We exist with one purpose in mind and that is
  to kill hard stuff. We are not a family guild, we dont cater to individuals
  and we don't tolerate drama. If you're the type of person who will deguild
  over loot issues, please spare us the trouble and dont apply. </p>
<p>Club FU is not a democracy. It is run top-down by Pouty and a few officers.
  Pouty is usually spammed or unconscious, if you have problems getting a reply
  (we all do), try asking an Officer. You are expected to do as you're told.
  If you have problems taking orders, please do not apply. </p>
<p>Unlike most high end guilds, Club FU is not DKP based. Loot is assigned by
  Pouty in a stragegic way that benefits the guild as a whole. Pouty will weigh
  your playtime, the relative worth to your class compared to others, how big
  an upgrade it is and a dozen other intransparent factors. If you prefer knowing
that 14.5 Anguish raids will give you X lewtz, please do not apply. <br>
<br>
Level 70 <br>
- At least 250 *WISELY SPENT* AA. This is a bare minimum, more is always better <br>
- You must be available to raid from 5pm to 10pm PST at least 4-5 days per week <br>
- You must have some form of self invis <br>
- You must have a form of EB <br>
- A method of self-gate available (potions are fine) <br>
- Casters / Priests must have a horse <br>
- Alcohol Tolerance 200 (yes, quite seriously) <br>
- You must have all 7 insignias for the anguish quest. (Other apps and FU members
are often helping with these, but do not take in-guild assistance for granted) <br>
- You must have the majority of your spells / discs. FU occasionaly kills 69/70
dropping mobs, but you are expected to get these on your own. <br>
- You must know at least 9 different ass jokes about Engell (send a tell to Theleos
for help in this department) </p>
<p>Recruits already flagged for Anguish will have a fast track on joining our
guild.&quot; See the website for specific class requirements.</p>

</a>&quot;Darkblood is a raiding guild. While we are built on the foundation of family
and friends, we are committed to exploring the raid content of EverQuest. We
expect you to know your class well and to play in a style that is consistent
with our goals. Be Cool, Have Fun, Grow, Learn, Achieve. It's a lot more than
something we just say, all these objectives must be met. While we don't require
  raid attendance, we are still a raiding guild. If you don't like to raid, or
  have low playtime, then DarkBlood might
  not be a good fit for you.  DarkBlood typically raids between 7pm EST and 11PM
EST. </p>
<p>DarkBlood currently has HIGH need for Bards, Shamans, Paladins, and Enchanters.
  Please see the list below for our level of need. Generally we are looking for
  applicants to be level 70 with 100+ AAs however quality applicants will always
  be considered. We will flag applicants for needed zones but Gates of Discord
flags are a plus.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqempyreal.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Empyreal</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Empyreal (Em*pyr&quot;e*al) - Formed of pure fire or light; refined beyond
  a[&quot;e]rial substance; pertaining to the highest and purest region of heaven;
of or relating to the sky or heavens. </p>
<p>We are currently focused on progression
    and farming in Txevu, Tacvi, and Omens of War events with one night a week
    in the Plane of Time. Although not a focus,
  we will at times just go and have fun in Dragons of Norrath, and even older
  Norrath content.</p>
<p>We are always focused on defeating the biggest and best content
    available, while of course gearing our members with the best available gear
    out there!
    The guild will hold honor above all else, we will not allow any slander between
    our own members, non-members, or other guilds. Our membership will respect
    the rules Sonly Online Entertainment has set forth, and the rights of members
of this guild as well as non-members. </p>
<p>This guild is about having fun, and
    provide a mostly casual atmosphere, while going after the biggest and best
    content in the game. Our raids will take place
    5-6 times a week and start around 5-6pm PST (8-9pm EST) and end around 10-11pm
    PST (1-2am EST). We have a minimum 30% attendance requirement for members
  and try to obtain members that do play often and love to raid. If you do not
  like
    to raid, and
    have an aversion to getting the best gear in the game, this is not the guild
    for you. However, if you love to see and defeat the best content this game
    has to offer and are able to put up with defeats while maintaining the fortitude
  to keep going until a goal is reached, then this guild is for you!</p>
<p>1) MUST be Level 70.<br>
  2) Alternate Advancement Abilities as listed below.<br>
  3) All Resists of 125+ Unbuffed.<br>
  4) Plane of Time and/or KT access, both preferred.<br>
  5) Love to Raid and can do so often during our &quot;raid times&quot; as stated
  above. <br>
  6) Can function as a team member and get along well with others (no drama).

  2) 100aa (preferred not required) <br>
  3) Playtimes &gt; 20 hours weekly. <br>

<p><a href="http://www.eyeofmordor.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Eye of Mordor</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
&quot;The Eye of Mordor is interested in getting more members of all classes and we
  look for active players (who can be online at least 4 times a week). In general
we look for new members of level 67 or higher.<br>
<br>
On the subject of multiple applicants: I will answer you all, and you will all
get a chance to join should you desire it. I merely wish to warn you that we
have an 8-applicants-at-a-time limit in
EoM, and once that limit is filled those who have applied and are not among those
8 will have to wait until a spot has been vacated by someone (keep in mind that
the trial period is one month). This will be done strictly by date of application
unless other reasons come into
play (need of a particular class, etc). So, rest assured, we are pleased to see
so many applicants and you will each
get your turn if you just hang in there. If there are any questions, ask them
in your application thread or look me up in-game, Silvershadow or Starmender.&quot;

<p><strong><a href="http://www.vytco.com/" target="_blank">Lords of Prophecy</a> </strong><br>
Recruitment status:: OPEN </p>
<p>&lt;Lords of Prophecy&gt; is a raiding guild. Accordingly your character must
  be developed to a certain level and have some flags and AAs. &lt;Lords&gt; is
  not a guild for everyone. We raid 5-6 times a week. Our normal schedule is
  Monday and Tusday - personal (FFA days), Wednesday through Sunday - raids start
  at
  5-6pm PST and continue until 10-11pm PST</p>
<p>Following is the list of requirements your character must meet to be considered
  for recruitment in &lt;Lords&gt;. For all classes: Must have all expansions.
  Must have minimum of 50AAs unless table below specifies higher amount.&quot; See
  the <a href="http://www.vytco.com/html/recruitment.htm" target="_blank">website</a> for
  a list of class requirements.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mnightguild.com/phpbb2/" target="_blank"><strong>Midnight</strong></a><br>
  Applications currently closed.<br>
  <br>
  We do not give specific class requirements because
    it is hoped that you purchase the correct AA's when you devote all of your
    time to your character. For example, if you're a cleric and you don't have
    the max healing AA's or the DI AA's, etc, do not apply unless you get those
    AA's. We do, however, enforce that all applicants have 200 or more AA's to
    apply and meet the requirements for HP, M, and AC. If you are just short
    of 200 or the other stats, please let Krinadon, Sindaael, or Wuznita know
  and we will expect you to meet the requirements before you are tagged a member. </p>
<p>We also require all members to have a shrinking device, some form of an invis,
  and can travel between and through zones without dying, getting lost, or holding
  us up. We also require that you have all, or at least most of the main, spells
  for your class. If you're a cleric with group bali, new heals, etc, then get
  them before applying.&quot; All classes must have a minimum of 6K hitpoints and
7K mana for casters. Warriors need a minimum of 11K hps. See the website for
details.</p>

    &quot;The Mischiefs is to be in every way be a support system for our friends.
    To make sure that we maintain integrity, while reaching out to help others.
    Always holding our heads high as we preserve excellence in the name of freedom.
    We are not only friends here but a huge family, that spread throughout Norrath
    and throughout the world.  This guild exists solely on the leg of its members
    efforts. There is no age limit as long at the person applying is of mature
    sound mind. Guild Chat is open because we here are all mature people and
    should be able to handle whatever comes.  First and foremost this is a family
    guild. Raiding is a fun activity that we all enjoy doing as a family.&quot; No
posted raiding times or recruitment policies.</p>
<p><a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/bringofvalor44669" target="_blank"><strong>Ring
    of Valor</strong></a><br>
&quot;We are a raiding guild. We raid from 2pm to 10pm-ish PST, and kill anything
we
deem worthy during those hours. Sometimes we go earlier or later.. and somedays
we give it a rest. But the goal is to enjoy a fine beverage with one foot on
the smouldering corpse of something really big... several times a night if possible!
A member is expected to attend all raids, above and beyond any other concerns
in
game. Be focused, knowledgeable and dedicated to having fun while raiding
and treat the other guildmembers with respect. <br>
<br>
Currently Arwyn is Guildmaster of Ring of Valor's Everquest chapter. Below the
guildmaster we have guild elders. Elders are just that... the real oldtimers/ex-guildmasters/etc.
who've paid some serious dues in EQ and Ring
  of Valor. They are there to whisper guidance and to help the officers/guildmaster
  do a better job. They typically don't meddle in the day-to-day affairs however..
thats what officers are for. Guild Officers are elected by their peers and blessed
by the guild elders to DO A JOB for the guild. Officership isn't a reward, its
a title given to
someone who is doing serious work for the guilds benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>The more often you play and raid
the better chance you have of getting in.&quot; Recruitment is closed for most classes.
  See the <a href="http://p070.ezboard.com/fringofvalor44669frm2.showMessage?topicID=1030.topic" target="_blank">website</a> for
  details.<br>
  <strong><br>
  <a href="http://www.clawofnagafen.com/" target="_blank">The Claw of Nagafen</a></strong><br>
We are a family oriented casual raiding guild. If you want to raid every single
time you log on, this probably isn&#8217;t the place for you. We usually have
2-4 nights where we raid on a large scale per week. We are a guild that understands
real life obligations/family and that not everyone can live on EQ. We are a place
where you can still advance in Luclin and PoP while continuing to advance your
character. We are a guild where you will get to see the end game, we just do
it at a slightly slower pace than everyone else. We are currently focused on
VT
and the Elementals.</p>
<p>We are not a guild that is interested in gearing you for the uber guilds.
  We are not a guild that is interested in gearing your alts. We are not here
    to guild your recently ebayed 65 monk. We are not interested in entertaining
    your application if you have applied to every other guild on Bristlebane.
    We are not currently raiding heavily in Velious or ToV. We are not a guild
    that will KS, train, or do any of those things that gets attention on the
Smutboard in the name of &#8220;friendly competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minimum
  level for an invite is level 62. You may apply before level 62 with permission
  from the class officer, but you must be level 62 before an invite can be extended.
  Characters below this level range will find it extremely difficult to contribute
  to most guild experience groups or raids. Tier 1 &amp; 2 flags are required
  for admittance. If you do not posses these flags it might be a good thing to
  try to do with CoN members during your
    application period. You are also required to have 1 insta-click item that
works indoors. The minimum time for completion of an application is 1 month.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veeshans-fury.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Veeshan's Fury</strong></a><br>
  Recruitment open. &quot;We generally raid around 6PM EST to 12AM EST during the
  week. Raids can go much later on weekends. Currently we have about 40-60 members
  who play regularly, most of whom are level 70. We now have an official level
  requirement of 67+,
  since
  a character
  that is under level 67 probably won't be able to contribute as much or handle
high-end content as well as our existing higher-level players. We are aligned
with Norrath's Keepers.<br>
<br> 
Do I need to have
a Vex Thal key or Emperor key to get into VF? No.<br>
<br>
Do I need to be flagged for
Plane of Tactics, Tower of Solusek Ro, Elemental Planes? No. We or our allied
guilds will help you get the flags you need. We
  currently do not flag apps for Rallos Zek, Sol Ro Minis or God, or Elemental
  Gods unless
  on special invite by a VF raid leader. We will 85% you into these locations
as needed.&quot;</p>
