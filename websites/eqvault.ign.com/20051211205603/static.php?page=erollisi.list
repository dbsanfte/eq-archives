 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Erollisi Marr Guilds</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Erollisi Marr Server Guild List!<br>
  </font></strong>Updated on July 27, 2005
<p>Complied, not by a bot, but by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! I would especially like
  guild leader names and recruiting officer names to list for each guild.</p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><strong><a href="http://www.afflictionguild.com/eqdkp/viewnews.php" target="_blank">Affliction</a></strong><br>
  Affliction is a raid guild that has completed the Plane of Time (Planes of
  Power expansion) and currently embarking on the content in Gates of Discord
  and OoW. Most of our guild members are 'working adults' which means we do not
  have the 'hardcore' raiding attitude of some guilds; however we are far from
  a 'casual' guild - we take our raiding seriously. 
<p>We are primarily an EST-based guild, although we have members from across
  the world. Our raid times are roughly 6:00pm EST onward Monday - Friday and
  Saturdays starting 10:00am EST and continuing throughout the afternoon. Sundays
  are generally 'Optional'; however you may be required to attend a raid at any
  time at the discretion of the officers. </p>
<p>Affliction operates a DKP-based loot system. Points are earned through attending
  raids and may be spent as the member wishes (i.e. loot is not 'reserved' for
  certain classes, however some degree of discretion is expected when bidding
  on loot that maybe more suited to another class). If you are thinking of joining
  Affliction for loot only, however, stop reading now. We are proud of our friendly,
  quirky, guild atmosphere and have no place for disruptive loot-whores, no matter
  how much play-time they might have. </p>
<p>Guild Focus <br>
  Our current guild focus is concentrated on the Gates of Discord and OoW expansions,
    although we continue to make regular forays into the Plane of Time for a
    spot of Godslaying. </p>
<p>About You <br>
  If you would like to join Affliction, you should be capable and willing to
    make yourself available to attend our activities. If you are not interested
    in serious raiding, cannot take orders, get along with your guildies, or
    focus on the task at hand, you will be wasting your time, and ours. </p>
<p>Progression Requirements <br>
  As a rule we are looking for members that are at least level 69, preferably
    level 70. This rule may be relaxed on an individual basis (subject to requirements
    set by the class advocate), however if you are not at least level 69 then
    you will not be able to participate in certain events (e.g. those in Riftseeker's
    Sanctum). </p>
<p>Please note that our current focus has moved on from the Planes of Power expansion.
  We no longer raid the elemental planes as a guild. 'Backflagging' new trial
  members to join our activities in the Plane of Time is done via the recently
  introduced 'alternate quest' system. </p>
<p>We recommend that you have some basic knowledge of the GoD expansion and you
  should be flagged at least as far as the Kod'Taz zone (i.e. you have passed
  Tipt / Vxed and the Sewer trials or Smith Rondo). Affliction has defeated the
  Ikkinz and Uqua zones and there are currently no plans to revisit these zones.
  Backflagging for Qvic access is again done via the recently introduced 'alternate
  quest' system, however applicants that are already flagged for Qvic access
are preferred. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.crimsoneternity.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Eternity</strong></a><br>
  Crimson Eternity is one of the server&#8217;s oldest guilds, and was built
  on the premise of having a family atmosphere. Over time, we have also matured
  into a high-end raiding guild, but we have not forgotten our family guild roots.
  We place high value on friendship and teamwork amongst the guild members, and
  integrity in our conduct. We also remember that at the end of the day, its
only a game, and RL&gt;EQ.</p>
<p>Notes for New Applicants</p>
<p>- CE is an Eastern time zone guild. We tend to raid 4-6 nights a week, usually
  starting around 1830-1900pm EST. Raids are usually done by 10:30pm EST, although
  we do very occasionally run a little later.</p>
<p>- If you are logged on, raiding/participating with the guild is expected (although
  not mandatory). We do not have mandatory raiding, nor do we have mandatory
  levels of attendance. However, the simple fact is that the social player who
  logs on only once or twice a week is probably not going to have sufficient
  playtime for CE. </p>
<p>- Only apply if you feel CE is the guild for you. If you apply to other guilds
  AND CE at the same time, we will turn you down. This is shows you will settle
  for any guild and it does not matter which.</p>
<p>- You must not have a guild tag when you post your application. If you are
  guilded with anyone when you apply, we will discard your application.</p>
<p>- CE has a no-cussing policy in public channels and /gu.</p>
<p>- People that actively flame others/stir up trouble on the public message
  boards (e.g. EMarr board) need not apply.</p>
<p>- We expect respect for all your fellow players, so don&#8217;t apply if you
  think it acceptable to train people, kill steal, not respect acknowledged camps,
  dispel snares, or otherwise be a jerk to your fellow human beings, no matter
  what the provocation.</p>
<p>- If you are a non-invis capable class, you will be expected to keep a stock
  of invis potions at all times. Raids should not have to be delayed because
we had to CR you because you didn&#8217;t have invis potions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.harbingersbrotherhood.com/" target="_blank">Harbringer's
    Brotherhood</a></strong><br>
  Recruitment is has been re-opened - if you are level 60 + and have been working
  on your Emp and VT keys ... we may be the guild for you. Our guild is comprised
  of casual raiders, we have no set playtime requirements but we ask if you are
  on and we are raiding that you attend. Our Raid times/dates are Mondays, Tuesdays,
  Thursdays and Sat/Sun starting from 8:00 pm est. to approx 12 am .. later on
  weekends. We are focusing on gearing in Vex Thall and completing Tier 1 and
  2 Planer Progression. If you have any questions feel free to look up any member
  of the HB and they will direct you to an officer or you can email me at kfromm@csolve.net.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.magister-guild.com/main/" target="_blank">Magister</a></strong><br>
  We frequently get asked: Is Magister recruiting? Do I have what it takes to
  be a member? What are your requirements for joining? Do you accept cross server
  applicants? Can you please bot me until you win the latest expansion and then
  call me so I can rake in the loot? The answer to these questions are yes, maybe,
  keep reading, yes, and no - your time would be better spent eating a bullet.
  Magister is always looking to add the very best players to the roster, whether
  they come from Erollisi Marr or another server (even Tunare). We expect complete
dedication and maximum effort from all members and applicants.<br>
<br>
  Raid Times: Magister is a primarily EST guild, with daily start times at 4:00pm
  PST/7:00pm EST. We raid 6 days a week (Sunday through Friday). Saturday is
  reserved for
  smaller projects such as epic fights, questing, AA's or individual expansion
progression.</p>
<p>Level/Alternate Advancement Requirements: For all classes, we require 70th
  level and anywhere from 200 - 600 alternate advancement points depending on
  class need. Sometimes we have more of a need
    for certain classes than for others. If you are a &quot;low need&quot; class,
    it does not mean you won't have a chance, but it DOES mean you better have
the things that makes us go &quot;hmmm&quot;. </p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.midnightfury.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Midnight Fury</strong></a><br>
  Please contact Caffino with any questions. <br>
  Requirements: <br>
  Level 70 <br>
  KT flag <br>
  Qvic and Time flags (not required but a plus) <br>
Some form of gate, EB, and invis</p>
<p><a href="http://mysticcoercion.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=23524&TabID=212798" target="_blank"><strong>Mystical
    Coercion</strong></a><br>
    There is no set &#8220;minimum&#8221; level requirement to join MC. You will
not be turned down due to level or lack of AAs, etc.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mysticallightfighters.com/" target="_blank">Mystical Lightfighters</a></strong><br>
Mystical Lightfighters is a hybrid family/raiding guild.</p>
<p>We raid most evenings starting at 8pm Eastern Standard Time, and raid as much
  as five days a week. Our current focus is raiding Plane of Time and the Ikkinz
  trials, while striving to maintain a family guild atmosphere.</p>
<p>Application Requirements<br>
  We are looking primarily for applicants that play
  during the evenings with regularity and that can raid and group with us as
much as possible.</p>
<p>Minimum Level: 68<br>
  Minimum AAXP: 100<br>
  Minimum Flagging: Elemental access (and working towards KT)</p>
<p>An up-to-date Magelo profile is also required</p>
<p>We have just finished a backflag run for Tier 1 - 3 (elemental access gods),
  and any missing pre-elemental flags must be obtained on your own if accepted.
KT access is a plus as we have recently begun raiding the Ikkinz trials.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.primalevolution.com/" target="_blank">Primal Evolution</a><br>
  </strong>Do you like to raid, have fun and are online several nights a week during EST
raid times?</a></p>
<p>Our KEY mantra is:<br>
  The number one thing at PE we look at is Fun as a team &gt; All. We do things
  that we determine are fun and look to progress as a team. New content and fun
  events are more important than loot.</p>
<p>LEVEL REQUIREMENTS<br>
  As of June 17, 2005, Primal Evolution is requiring the following level minimums:</p>
<p>All classes - Level 69+<br>
  Various AA requirements as listed below</p>
<p>Applicants who do not meet level or AA requirements but feel they are a strong
  candidate should contact Bydr or Crystilla. We will look at those on a case-by-case
  basis.</p>
<p> - Apps that are removed from our app guild Chaotic Evolution (lack of required
  raid attendance, etc.) will obtain an in-game email (assuming they have DoN
  to retrieve it) explaining why they were deguilded and whether or not they
  would be allowed to reapp if their situation changes.</p>
<p>Primal Evolution is a Time/Qvic capable raiding guild that raids 5-6 days
  a week.<br>
  - Sat are a EXP day.</p>
<p>RAID TIMES<br>
  Targets are generally called around 7:30 PM (EST) and we end around 12:30/1
    AM (EST) which is around 30 hours per week of raiding. People who can't commit
    to raid at least 15 hours of online time during that time period need not
    apply; PE is about raiding so if you don't like to raid, please read no further.</p>
<p>GUILD GOALS<br>
  Our current short term goals are to A) gear up our new members in Time/Qvic
    and B) progress into Inktuta/DoN (tier 4 currently). Our long terms goal
    is to progress to Tacvi and work on MPG trials for Anguish access, while
    continuing to have fun in DoN as well. <br>
  - Current content is Txevu, MPG trials (starting on these), Time, Qvic, Inktu'ta,
  DoN, OOW spell mobs (sometimes).</p>
<p>***Expansions required for apps: PoP, GoD, OOW and DoN.***</p>
<p>CHARACTER BOXING<br>
  We are currently looking for players who prefer to focus on a primary character
    for raids/exp, rather than multi-box for their enjoyment. Apps who like to
    box in groups are ok, but in raid situations, we prefer 1 character applications
    only.</p>
<p>ILLEGAL 3-PARTY SOFTWARE<br>
  We do not condone the use of these softwares and prefer NOT to accept applicants
    who have used/do use them.</p>
<p>CLASS NEEDS<br>
  We are currently looking for CROWD CONTROL (Enchanters), DPS (Beastlords /
    Rangers / Wizards / Necros specifically) and PRIEST (Clerics / Shaman) classes
    primarily ! The length of our application process can vary based on the applicant's
    flag/raid history with us but lasts about 2 weeks in general.<br>
  - Classes NOT listed above are encouraged to speak with Bydr or Crystilla first
  before applying to see if there is availability. </p>
<p>This AA is not required but it is strongly recommended that all non-gating
classes invest in this: Origin </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.primalevolution.com/" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://www.resilienceguild.org/vb/index.php" target="_blank">Resilience</a><br>
</a></strong>Resilience is a raiding guild.<br>
We are primarily on evenings American Eastern time, and raid as much as seven
days a week. Our goals are to see and experience all the game has to offer, while
having the best time possible!</p>
<p>What are we looking for in Applicants?<br>
  We are looking primarily for people on during the evenings with high playtime
    that can raid with us as much as possible. As a general rule we raid from
    8pm ET to 12AM ET. People that are self motivated and want to work as part
    of a team to see the whole team move forward are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>*** Requirements/guidelines applicants should be aware of ***<br>
  Should be Level 70 with ~85 AAs<br>
  All applicants should have completed or be actively working on Time and Kod'Taz
  access<br>
  We have just reached the Plane of Time, and while we do backflag with Elemental
  Gods, any other PoP tier flags must be obtained on your own. KT access is a
  large bonus, and you should strive to have this as well. Once you start your
  probation, your time will be heavily devoted to guild raiding, so time to grind
  AA/Level is heavily restricted, and we may ask you to complete certain critical
  AA before we start your probation.<br>
  Our current demand for classes is:<br>
  HIGH priority - Clerics, Bards, Wizards, Necros, Shaman<br>
  MEDIUM priority - Magicians, Rogue, Druid, Clerics, Enchanters<br>
  LOW priority - All other classes<br>
  All applicants are evaluated individually regardless of current demand. Playtime,
  flags, AA points are all used in determining whether to extend an offer of
probation.</p>
<p><a href="http://reviction-guild.com/main.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Reviction</strong></a><br>
  <em>Be sure to go to <a href="http://reviction-guild.com/" target="_blank">Reviction</a>'s
main page to see their flash movie!</em></p>
<p>Before you submit your application, there are a few things that you should
  realize and come to understand about both the application process and the guild
itself. Let's try to clear up those things now, rather than later.</p>
<p>Reviction has been around for over 3 years now, and the guild was built on
  the premise of being a family atomosphere. Though, in that time, we have also
  matured into a high-end raiding guild, we have not forgotten our family guild
  roots. We place high value on friendship and teamwork amongst the guild members.
  After all, none of us would have gotten as far as we have in the game without
  the aid of our fellows. If you're not able to get along with people, and like
  to fight... save both us and yourself some time, look elsewhere. If you are
  a team player and a likeable individual, please read on...</p>
<p>First, a lot of people want to know how long the whole process takes? Well,
  the application process takes anywhere from 3 weeks to a month.</p>
<p>Secondly, what does Reviction expect from you, as an applicant? Well, from
  the start, you should completely fill out the application form, and do so in
  a thoughtful manner. Answer the questions meaningfully, and don't be shy. Write
  a few sentences -- long applications tell us a lot more, and are received better,
  than a few sentence fragments and one word answers.</p>
<p>The application is designed to give us a high-level understanding of what
  you and your character are all about. While we ask for flag and magelo information...
  please don't think that you would be rejected purely based on your flags or
  gear. You are expected to work towards catching up on flags as part of your
  application process. Some flags are pertinent, others are not. The flags that
allow you to raid where we raid are the important ones.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rise-guild.com/" target="_blank">Rise</a><br>
  </strong>See the forums for more information.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.triuneguild.org/" target="_blank">Triune</a></strong><br>
All applicants must have spoken to a Recruiter and been given approval to apply.</p>
<p>All applicants must have a minimum of level 70, 100 AAs, must have GoD, OoW,
  and DoN expansions, and must maintain a 40% raid attendance during the four-week
  app period. Apps must have the KT flag. If you have any questions, please feel
  free to contact one of our Recruiters online: Keldora, Guerrilla, Irky, Raevael,
  Lilandraa, Origin.</p>
<p>If you have a bad connection or computer, please do not apply. Constant ld's
do not help you or the guild.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.whitsendguild.net/" target="_blank">Whit's End</a><br>
</strong>To enter our probationary period you must have obtained, at a minimum:<br>
Level:
68 in any class<br>
  AA's: Run 3/Regen 3<br>
  Item, Spell, or Clicky for: Invis, Shrink, EB, and Levitate<br>
Resists (Recommended): 100+ in all categories<br>
A note on flags and keys:<br>
While we do not currently have any predetermined flagging
  or keying requirements, it is highly recommended that you obtain as many PoP
  and GoD flags as possible.
    We will attempt to 85 any unflagged people into raid zones, but understand
    that these spots are limited, and are often given away on a first-come-first-serve
    basis. There's a good likelihood that you'll miss raids if you lack a number
    of flags. Missed raids means missed DKP, missed attendance, missed loot,
and missed progression.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to secure your own flags. We do not attempt the
  lower-tier backflagging mobs often. It would be in your best interest to attend
  as many PU raids as possible.<br>
    <br>
    To complete our probationary period and become a full member of the guild,
you must complete the following:<br>
Attendance: Raids regularly, avoiding major gaps
    in attendance, is on time whenever possible<br>
  Buffing Classes: Must have MGB<br>
  Pet Classes: Must have Pet Hold or will not be allowed to use their pet on
raids</p>
