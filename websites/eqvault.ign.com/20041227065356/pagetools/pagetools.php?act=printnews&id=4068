Here's the clip:<blockquote>Hello Paladins,<br>I have news about Holyforge!!  Holyforge was not working properly due to a change that was made to the Slay Undead AA.<br> <br>Holyforge was not corrected to work with Slay Undead when this change was made.  This issue has been corrected and will go live in the 12/15 update.  Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge.</blockquote><br>Next Monks are going to have some <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=monkbalance&message.id=6626&no_redir=true#M6626">AA changes</a> in the Dec. 15th patch:<blockquote>Greetings Monks,<br> <br>I have some information about some AA changes that will be coming to you in the 12/15 update.  These AA's will be refunded and you will be able to purchase the new version of them.  Below are the details on what is changing.<br> <br>Crippling Strike has been changed to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare.
