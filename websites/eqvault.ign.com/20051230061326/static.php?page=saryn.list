  Saryn merged with Mithaniel Marr server.</font></strong><strong><font size="+1"><br>
  </font></strong>Updated on August 9, 2005


<p>Complied by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! </p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://av.vanaric.com/forums/index.php" target="_blank">Altered Vision</a><br>
&quot;We need enchanters and DPS classes and a couple more paladins (and other tanks)! 
<p>Notes: Altered Vision is a guild that raids on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and
  Saturdays at 7:00-7:30pm CST+.<br>
  We do not force attendance, but if you can't USUALLY make it to ALL 3 raids
  of the week, chances are you won't be admitted
<p>We will be accepting all classes for the time being, regardless of your flags.
  You need to get Tipt as soon as possible. We will get Time keys for those that
  need them (but we will not be redoing EP gods as that is a thing of the past
  for us)</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:<br>
  &#8226; 
  Level 68, for ALL classes<br>
&#8226; 
  Must have run3<br>
&#8226; 
  Way of self-invis/gate<br>
&#8226; 
  Shrink item<br>
&#8226; 
  All resists reachable over 100 unbuffed<br>
&#8226; 
  A sense of humor is a good thing to have. A lot of us are assholes, but we
  mean no harm (most of the time.) During raids, we get our stuff together and
  are able to be serious, but if you don't like to laugh, this guild is probably
  not the right one for you.<br>
&#8226; 
  All members joining MUST update their flags on our points site. If you do not
  have the patience to simply click things to let us know where you are in progression,
  you will not be made a full member. When you are invited, contact Sokahar for
  the information on how to do this.<br>
&#8226; 
  We want members that are here for the long run. If you aren't really sure you
  want to join, or don't plan on staying long, just don't apply. It's not only
  a waste of your time, it's also a waste of ours.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coalescenceguild.com/" target="_blank">Coalescence</a><br>
  &quot;A little information on our guild: We are an Eastern Standard Time (EST) raiding
  guild. We raid Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday at 6:30pm until 11:00EST. We practice
  a Dragon Kill Point (DKP) system in which members bid earned DKP via private
  messages to the loot distribution team. Highest bid wins. (No negative values
shall be generated.) </p>
<p>Level requirement: 70, all classes</p>
<p></p>
Basic Requirements:<br>
All classes are required to have Run3 or better <br>
The ability to obtain 150 on ALL resists UNBUFFED <br>

  outdoors (two preferred) <br>

Permanent Enduring Breath item <br>

<p>Class Required AAs: (Note: All classes are required to have 200+ AA. Also,
  all casters must have SCM3.)&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/cassault/" target="_blank">Collective Assault</a><br>
  &quot;Recruitment is reopened. (read requirements section if your interested and
are one of the things listed below)</p>
<p>We're looking to add skilled people of all classes. We choose Quality over
  Quanitity - Mainly looking for good, nice to play with people who know their
  stuff. Only recruiting a certain amount of each class, once we have that amount
  active of each class, we close down their recruitment section. Classes we're
  specifically looking for are:<br>
  Bards
  - 1<br>
  Beastlords - 1<br>
Berserker - 1<br>
  Clerics - 2(400aa minimum, must have high playtime)<br>
Druids - 1<br>
  Enchanters - 1<br>
  Mages - 3<br>
Monks - 3<br>
  Necromancers - 3<br>
  Paladins - 1(must be 9k hp unbuffed and 500aa+)<br>
Rangers - 1<br>
  Rogues - 1<br>
  Shadow Knights - 1(must be 9k hp unbuffed and 500aa+)<br>
  Shaman - 2(Needs HIGH
  playtime)<br>
  Warriors - 1(Needs HIGH playtime, Must want
  to be a part of a tank lineup each night. 500aa+)<br>
Wizards - 3</p>
<p>These spots go very fast and the numbers open decrease at a fast rate. Get
  your applications in asap or you may miss out!</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we are accepting applications till we have an applicable number
  of each class to do certain encounters, we have raid percentages and keep track
  of who's active/who's not... This means a 12 day trial period where you get
  to know us and we get to know you, after those 12 days we choose if you stay
  or go, tell you the result and its your choice from then out. Once we reach
  our goal for each class, applications will be stiffened up and requirements
  will be higher. --CA officer staff-- note: we are not your average floozy guild,
  everyone here is here til the end and we are expectant that you will be too,

<p><a href="http://www.hneguild.com/" target="_blank">Heaven and Earth<br>
</a>&quot;If
  you were wondering if we still recruit; the answer is yes, we are always looking
  to add the
  very best to our roster. And while we do have an extensive roster that fills
  all
    our current class needs, we will always be looking to add the very best to
    our roster. So what kind of player is right for Heaven and Earth? First and
    foremost we are looking for players that play A LOT. We add those players
  that have a desire to fight the end game mobs, players who want to achieve
  the most
in Everquest, and players that don't give up or complain when things get tough.</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth is a raid-oriented guild. Times to do experience are considered
  extra curricular activities. To win, you often have to die learning and our
  raids are negative exp events in most cases. This is one of the reasons why
  our level requirements are so high. We are looking for East coast players preferably,
  but we do have a mix of all time zones. We raid at least six nights a week
  and our raids will begin around 8pm EST and go on till midnight on weekdays.
  On weekends our raids begin at 6pm EST and go beyond midnight. If you cannot
  make this sort of commitment to attend almost every night and on time, then
  maybe Heaven and Earth is not the guild for you.</p>
<p>Below are the list of REQUIREMENTS, not what we would like to see. Applications
  that are sent that do not meet the requirements will be rejected.</p>
<p>Level Requirements:<br>
  All classes must be level 70.</p>
<p>Equipment:<br>
  Enduring Breath item<br>
  Jboots (The instant cast ones, not store-bought TBoots)<br>
  Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring(3k approx.) or 8th+ Coldain Ring(Quest) or Amulet
  of Necro</p>
<p>Resists:<br>
  100 MR while simultaneously keeping 100 in FR, CR, PR, or DR when the situation
    requires. This is not hard to obtain with just standard diamond/blue diamond
    resist gear.</p>
<p>Alternate Advancement Points:<br>
  Need a minimum of 200 points or more. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem getting
  if you are 65 and have been playing for awhile.</p>
<p>Connection:<br>
  Reliable non-win modem connection to the Internet. We cannot afford to have
players that go LD every 5 minutes during our raids.&quot;</p>

  &quot;Hail and well met. Thank you for your interest in membership in our fine guild.
We consider Isengard to be the finest of the many great Saryrn guilds. </p>
<p>We would like to tell you a few things about our guild so you can be sure
  that Isengard is the guild for you. Isengard is a guild of friends that like
  to raid and we are determined to experience all of the content available. As
  a friend&#8217;s guild, we support each other by assisting fellow members with
  quests, by thinking &#8220;Isengard First&#8221; when putting together experience
  groups, by treating each other with respect both in game and within our forums,
  and by maintaining the high level of ethical behavior that has been the trademark
  of Isengard since the first day. </p>
<p>As a raiding guild we jointly strive to achieve a high degree of success through
  cooperation, attitude, experience, and discipline. Typically, we will have
  raids scheduled at least six days a week with Sunday as our typical day off.
  Our raids typically start at 7:00 PM Central time. We expect our members to
  be at the raid staging area on time and with the equipment and supplies that
  you will need for that raid. Members are expected to be attentive during the
  raids with a minimum of AFK&#8217;s and other disruptions and are expected
  to listen closely to directions and to follow those directions.</p>
<p>Loot is awarded using the DKP system that was started October 1, 2003. A copy
  of this system is posted for your review and your application is based upon
  your understanding and acceptance of the policy. The findings of the officers
  as to the successful bidder using the DKP system are final. All candidates
  are expected to read and comply with all guild policies. </p>
<p>If you think that above description is what you are looking for in a guild,
  then here are the suggested requirements to be considered:</p>
<p>1. You need to be level 68 and have a minimum 125 AA. Specific AA requirements
  are as posted Here</p>
<p>2. You need to be able to achieve simultaneous unbuffed resists of 100.</p>
<p>3. We require all new applicants to have all currently available expansions
  and to continue to acquire new expansions as they are released.</p>
<p>4. We expect all new applicants to have at least one instant click item and
  preferably two, a shrinking device, and an Enduring Breath item.</p>
<p>5. We expect all applicants to be Elemental flagged. We will require you have
  Plane of Time and Kod&#8217;Taz flagged before receiving full membership.</p>
<p>6. You will be required to make a Magelo profile and to link this profile
  on our homepage. You will be expected to update this profile as you improve
  your skills and your gear.</p>
<p>7. As a recruit, you are expected to participate in at least 65% of the raids
  held during your probationary period for which you have zone access. You are
  expected to make a concerted effort to obtain all flags you do not have and
  which the guild has determined to be a priority for all members.</p>
<p>We have limited openings for:</p>
<p>Clerics (1)<br>
  Druids (1)<br>
  Rangers (2)<br>
  Wizards (1)</p>
<p>Applicants are generally required to be level 68 with 125+ AAs. A full list
  of requirements can be found here along with the application procedure.</p>
<p>Exceptional candidates of other classes will be considered on a case by case
  basis.</p>
<p>Please meet or exceed our requirements before posting. High raid time players
  are required. If you wish to have your application kept confidential, you can
  send it via PM from this forum. (Send PM button below)</p>
<p>If you would like to talk to someone in game, please contact Ciril or Satascal.</p>
<p>We are requiring all applicants to be level 68 (70 soon) at this time and
  have a minimum of 125 AA. Below is a list of the AA that we expect our members
to have before receiving a full tag. </p>
<p>All Classes: <br>
  Planer Power 5<br>

<p>Please note that AA abilities are a free choice and many people have different
  ideas about which abilities are the best and most beneficial. Isengard does
  require all Non-Hybrid Buffing classes to have MGB and all classes that have
  Radiant Cure available to have RC1. Other then these, please be assured that
  your application will not be rejected because you don&#8217;t have these particular
  AA abilities but we do expect that you have AA abilities that are near the
  same level and we do expect you to make a concerted effort to add these AA&#8217;s
  to your character. As usual, the guild leader and officers of Isengard reserve
  the option to add or refuse any applicant if they feel it is best for the guild
  as whole. <br>
  <br>
  Please note that we are more flexible about these requirements for classes
    that we have an exceptional need and for folks that have a strong prior relationship
    with the guild and our members. Don't assume that you do not measure up but
  also don't automatically expect that we will waive any of these requirements.&quot;</p>

<p>We start fighting for our raid at 7pm Central Time on Wednesday and 12pm Central
  Time on Sunday. We follow Daylight Savings Time. Central Time is GMT-6. Targets
  will usually be called 15 minutes early, groups made 10 minutes early. This
  means everyone should be buffed, at the location for the raid, and ready to
  go by 7 and 12, not just sauntering up to the windmill at 7 and 12. It is very
strongly recommended everyone show up 15 minutes before the Raid Start.</p>
<p>BEHAVIOR:<br>
  At all times, and in all mediums (be it on channel, on the forums, in private
    messages and tells), all members are to be respectful of one another. Publicly
    bashing one group or another in a non-constructive manner will result in
    first a warning, and then a guildremove. Doing so on the forums will result
    in the posting being locked and/or deleted, as well. Private complaints to
    the officers are permitted, if you are unable to resolve problems with another
    player yourself.</p>
<p>We require all members to be the following:</p>
<p>Have some method of self-shrinking at all times<br>
  Have some method of self-invising at all times<br>
  Have some method of self-gating at all times<br>
  At least one insta-click buff item<br>
  The following is the list of our current class desirability and minimum requirements
  by class. If you do not meet our posted level or AA requirements, you may still
  app - just make sure you understand the sections in the rules regarding this.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanctussolum.com/" target="_blank">Sanctus Solum</a><br>
Level 70<br>
Cleric/Druid &#8211; 200 aa<br>
All other classes &#8211; 300 aa</p>
<p>Above all, we want mature, dedicated, players who enjoy Everquest. Sanctus
  Solum separates itself from other end game guilds by maintaining a smart, reliable,
  player base which allows us to raid only 3 times a week. If your burnt out
  with a 6 to 7 day a week raiding schedule, if you&#8217;re a pacific coast
  player who is leaving work early and still showing up to raids late, if your
  meals consist of hot pockets and you haven&#8217;t had a date in 2 years, send
  us your application. We&#8217;ll offer you 3 nights a week of efficient raiding
  killing the same targets that &#8220;hard core&#8221; 6-7 night a week guilds
  do. This is your chance to have a life and enjoy Everquest as it was meant
  to be played, as a hobby.</p>
<p>The following people can be contacted in game for more information: Aonodorus,
  Exdio, Freja, Gordas, Swabby.</p>
<p> Attendance Policies<br>
  1. Sanctus Solum will hold required raids on Monday, Tuesday,
  and Thursday from 6 PM PST to 10 PM PST (9 PM EST - 1 AM EST). <br>
  2. Members of Sanctus Solum are required to maintain a 70% attendance level
  based on the previous 30 days. Members who are above the 70% attendance level
  are placed on &#8220;Full-Time Status&#8221;. At any time a member drops below
  70% attendance they will then be placed on &#8220;Part-Time Status&#8221;.
  As soon as a &#8220;Part-Time Status&#8221; member regains their 70% attendance
  they will once again be placed on &#8220;Full-Time Status&#8221;. <br>
  3. Attendance will be taken by an officer at each and every raid encounter
  and then immediately updated into the DKP system thus making every member&#8217;s
raid attendance level fully up-to-date at all times.&quot;</p>

  &quot;The home of a family guild that just likes to have fun with friends! Feel
  free to look through our guild charter, rules and regulations. Email us at
  scionsofmarr@yahoo.com
if you are interested in a guild that makes you feel like part of a family. </p>
<p>Scions of Marr is looking for individuals who are reliable and loyal; individuals
  that understand fairness and common courtesy. Most of all candidates are expected
  and are required to be team players, showing understanding and consideration
for their fellow players.</p>
<p>Scions of Marr is a family guild that likes to hunt and hopefully soon, raid
  together.</p>
<p>Expansions<br>
  Scions of Marr encourages all members to obtain all expansions to
provide maximum opportunities for in-guild grouping and exploration.</p>
<p>Class and Level Restrictions<br>
  We currently do not have any class or level restrictions.
  We hope that all members will help each other in obtaining levels quickly so
  that we may become
a more powerful guild that can begin raiding.</p>
<p>First and foremost - Everquest is a game, and we are there to have fun. Although
  we expect a particular behavior among our members... both with guildies and
  fellow players, we encourage a good time to be had by all. <br>
  We are still in the developing phase of our guild. But we are hoping to ally
  soon with another guild that will offer our higher end players options for
  raiding and experience grouping. <br>
Epics will be worked on as time and ability permits.</p>
<p>As a member of Scions of Marr, we ask that you conduct yourself with courtesy
  and in a manner which you would like to be treated. You represent all of us
  during your time on Everquest. While these rules may be common sense, they
are just a reminder.</p>
<p>We are a family guild, hence there may be children playing on their parents
  accounts. As this is often the case, we ask that you conduct yourself in guild
  chat in a manner that is child friendly. If you have something to say to someone
  that is of a questionable nature, please do so in tells. If you do not care
  for swearing please turn on your swear filter.<br>
  Everyone is there to have fun, and listening to someone rant obscenities in
guild chat will only take away fun others are having.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sotguild.com/" target="_blank">Shards of Time</a><br>
  &quot;We are a raiding guild that raids 4-6 nights per week and are taking down
  some of the more difficult mobs and quests. Most of us live in Eastern and
  Central
  time in the U.S. and Canada, so we raid evenings in those time zones, typically
  beginning at 8 EST / 7 CST. We are a group of friends that enjoy hanging out
  and playing the game, while also working towards some of the more difficult
  game content. We realize that this is just a game and beyond that is some weird
  reality called RL, and try to strike a balance between them. We are currently
  an elemental guild on the threshold of Time. As such, having your Elemental
  flag will give you a much better chance of getting in the guild. Epic 1.0 raids
  will not be scheduled by the guild, so if you are working on your epic and
  want help, you will have to be patient and ask for help on non-raid time. Epic
1.5 raids will be scheduled around other guild raid events.</p>
<p>Our loot policy revolves around the DKP system. The DKP system was designed
  to ensure the fair distribution of loot throughout the guild, letting people
  pick which loot they want to &quot;buy&quot; with their points. Every raid
  you attend you will receive a certain number of points. Loot that drops will
  be bid on using anb auction system. When asked, a person may &quot;buy&quot; the
  item with their earned DKP. No DKP points will be earned until you are a probationary
  member, and no DKP can be spent on loot until voted in to the guild as a full
  member following the probation period, unless no mains/hydras at the raid bid.
  We reserve the right to restrict bidding on certain items to a certain class
  (i.e. If a Blade of War drops, it may be restricted to warriors first). A full
  explanation of our loot policy is here. If you have any questions please contact
  me.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines for our guild.</p>
<p>1. If you are not 70, are you willing to put forth the time during your application
  period to get 70 while still raiding at our scheduled events? If you are 70,
  are you willing to work on AA and attend our raid events? To reduce agro radius
  and a myriad of other reasons, we request all aspiring applicants work on getting
  to lvl 70 before working on AAs.</p>
<p>2. Are you a person that can maturely deal with frustration, without rants
  or temper tantrums?</p>
<p>3. Do you have patience to deal with the fact that everything in Everquest
  is gained by hard work and nothing will just fall in your lap?</p>
<p>4. Mandatory Requirements for all classes:</p>
<p>*Permanent EB (Enduring Breath) item. This does not mean an item with a &quot;clicky&quot; EB.Some
  examples are Lodizal Shell Shield, Knotted Turtlebone Ring, Fishbone Earring,
  elemental helms, or tribute.<br>
  *Self Shrink - either by spell, illusion, potion or item; ex. Anizok's minimizing
  device, ants potion, Wand of Imperceptability<br>
  *Self Invis - either by spell, ability, potion or item<br>
  *Self Gate - either by spell, ability, potion or item<br>
  *Simultaneous unbuffed resists of 150 for all resists.<br>
  *You MUST have the means to do the above&#8230;&#8230;do NOT expect others
  to do it for you. We don't care if you do it by potions, items, spells, or
  innate abilities, just make sure you can.</p>
<p>5. Please see the list below for current level and other requirements. We
  are always looking for great players so if you don't meet the requirements
  below, you can still put in an application. The recruiting officer will talk
  with you about your application and what can, if anything, be done for you
  to become a member.</p>
<p>6. We do not require all new applicants to have all currently available expansions;
  however, it is recommended and you may not be able to attend some raids without
  them.</p>
<p>7. You are required to make a Magelo profile and link this profile in your
  application. Your application may be denied if no Magelo address is included.
  At a minimum, Clefus will bitch that it isnt there. You are also expected to
  update this profile as you improve your skills and your gear. If you do not
  know how to make a magelo profile, see this useful guide.</p>
<p>8. Are you willing to raid? Make no mistake this IS a raiding guild and although
  raiding is not strictly required, we expect you to be at the raid if you are
online. Helping the guild is helping oneself.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=9506&TabID=77818" target="_blank">Society
of Honor</a> <br>
Society of Honor is, first and mainly, a group of friends and family who play
EverQuest together. We believe phat lewts and uber-xp take a back seat to a good
time making friends.</p>
<p>We're scattered around several different time zones, but peak traffic for
  us seems to be between 5PM and 12PM CENTRAL STANDARD TIME. If you're not online
  at those times, you may not see many of us around.</p>
<p>We schedule one raid per week, on Saturday night. On any other night and frequently
  on weekends we'll occasionally throw together a mini-raid for some significant
  drop. This may vary from 2 people to help in LGuk to a dozen people to sweep
  Hate. Since many of our members have not completed any epic, our organized
  (?) raids focus on completing as many 1.0 epics as we can.</p>
<p>Our raids are fairly casual. Whenever possible, we welcome folks who arrive
  late and rarely start exactly on time. We don't mind if someone kills some
  yard mobs during down times. I'll give several alerts about special hazards,
  like pit traps and non-agro mobs that shouldn't be attacked, but otherwise
  I expect folks to know the roles and manage themselves. You will rarely hear
  me shout, &quot;Everyone stay behind me till assist is called!&quot; Some will
  never hear it. Against PoP gods, you may need an ogre shouting orders, but
  for us, halfling hints seem to be enough.</p>
<p>Dying is part of the game and in that we're grand masters. If the worst thing
  that's happened to you this week was a (series of) death in EverQuest, I recommend
  therapy. Don't stress, ressurrections happen and experience lost is often regained
  (and regained again.) Even if I'd spent my whole time in EQ leading raids,
  wipe outs would still happen. I haven't; they do. If you find youself dead
  at your bind, have patience, swap war stories, and kill some spiderlings; silks
  are at a premium. We'll recover as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Some of us are old-timers in EverQuest and enjoy research, so we often have
  answers for just about any odd EQ question. For me, this alone is sometimes
  enough reason to be in a guild. Even if the only people online are bazaar mules,
  you may still get an answer on guild chat.</p>
<p>We're a family guild with couples and at least one minor. We generally strive
  to keep guild chat clean, but you never really know WHAT you might hear. Guildchat
  is an open mike and that provokes some to attempt comedy. May Bristlebane have
mercy.</p>
<p>Level requirement.<br>
  46+ for mains. Lower alts are fine. We will never exclude friends or family
of an existing member on account of level.</p>
<p>Membership/Recruiting.<br>
  Since we are a social guild, anyone who is interested in becoming part of a
    friendly group is welcome.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://thegryphons.com/" target="_blank">The Gryphons</a><br>
GUILD VISION<br>
The Gryphons is a friendly guild that seeks to raid in the higher
end zones while maintaining a balance between living and playing.</p>
<p>We will achieve this by :<br>
  - ensuring we all contribute to maintain the friendly
  atmosphere<br>
  - learning and stretching each of our class abilities<br>
  - learning our raid tactics and performing to the highest standard at each
  guild raid<br>
  - supporting and helping other guild members directly and indirectly at raids
  so that everyone can achieve the same standard in equipment and knowledge<br>
  - talking, discussing and debating with the guild leadership our individual
needs from the guild</p>
<p>We play on GMT and EST, and schedule raids to suit members, while taking out
  targets of opportunity when available. Our members are primarily above level
  60, though recruitment begins at 55+. Full members below 60 are asked to achieve
  level 60+ and 65 as soon as possible, but maintain a suitable real life balance.<br>
  <br>
  RAID DAYS<br>
  The mandatory raid day is Thursday 19.30GMT to 23.30GMT. If you are
  online during this time, you are expected to attend the raid unless agreed
  with the
  designated Raid Leader.</p>
<p>Raids of opportunity may occur at other times, however Tuesday 19.30GMT to
  23.30GMT is a secondary raid day that we will seek to fill with raid opportunities.
  While not mandatory, it is important that we begin to treat these days as vital
  to the guild progression into the higher end zones.<br>
  <br>
  The Gryphons are looking for individuals who are reliable and loyal; individuals
    with a good sense of fairness, common courtesy, and moral standards. Candidates
    should possess maturity both in their actions and way of approaching others.
    Most of all candidates are expected and required to be Team Players, showing
understanding and consideration for their fellow players.</p>
<p>The Gryphons is a family guild that likes to hunt and raid together. Members
  are expected to participate in the guild's raid or grouping day every Thursday,
  if they are on at the time.</p>
<p>The Gryphons disallows membership to more than one guild and at the time of
  applying for membership the aplicant may not be member of another guild, nor
  with any characters on a second or third account. Likewise, the applicant may
  not have pending applications with any other guild.</p>
<p>The Gryphons encourages all members to obtain all expansions to provide maximum
  opportunities for in-guild grouping and exploration.</p>
<p>Level restrictions: level 60<br>

<p><a href="http://winterslegacy.com/modules/news/" target="_blank">Winter's
Legacy</a><br>
Winter`s Legacy is a semi-casual raiding guild founded on strong values of friendship
and dedication. We exist on the server Saryrn and have a lengthy history dating
back to the original release date of Everquest. Our primary focus is progressing
through game content and having a fun time doing it. While we value a family
atmosphere, we are dedicated in succeeding in our raid encounter endeavors. We
want players who are not only loyal to the guild, but also have the desire to
do the impossible. Those are the players that are not afraid to die, are excited
to learn encounters rather than being spoon-fed strategy, and most of all, who
do not complain and bail when times get tough. This is the type of organization
that we are.<br>
</p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT: Winter`s Legacy is a balanced guild who (while enjoying
  a famly atmosphere) is primarily focused on progressing through Everquest content.
  Discipline, maturity and professionalism are demanded at all times. We desire
  players who: 1) are dedicated to the guild, 2) have the desire within themselves
  to do the impossible, 3) are willing to make personal sacrifices in order to
  help advance the guild, and 4) do not complain when things are tough. This
is the type of guild we are.</p>
<p><br>
  RAID TIME: Our raid times are TUESDAYS at 8:00 PM CST and SATURDAYS at 5:00
    PM CST. In addition, officers reserve the right to form raids on nights that
    follow a major game patch. All raiding is mandatory, meaning that if you
    are online during a designated raid time, you are required to be there. Every
    raid will utilize the LOOT POINT SYSTEM. In many cases, raid times will extend
    up to and past 12:00 AM CST. Where raiding is concerned, it comes down to
    this: We raid certain nights. You need to be there and participlate if you
    ever expect to earn any loot or flags in this guild. So, it is in your best
    interest to show up at raids as much as possible. If your attendance is lacking
    and you have an obvious consistent non-presence and participation at raids,
    your membership may be revoked at the discretion of the guild officers and
    leader.</p>
<p><br>
  VALUES:</p>
<p>- we value hard work and the dedication it takes to improve oneself and the
  guild as a whole.<br>
  - we value team work and the willingness to help fellow guildmates.<br>
  - we value our players' dedication, focus, and the ability to perform without
  supervision.<br>
  - we value our players' desire to succeed.<br>
  - we value not only the ability to lead well, but also the ability to follow
  well.<br>
  - we value and encourage improvisation and innovated thought.<br>
  - we value punctuality and good raid attendance.<br>
  - we value a sense of humor.<br>
  - we value our ability to succeed.</p>
<p>These values make up the core of what Winter`s Legacy is. If you do not share
or respect these values, then you do not belong in Winter's Legacy.</p>

  of Norrath in pursuit of bigger and better things, old world zones or prior
  key requirements (for example, the Emperor Ssraeshza key (Ring of the Shissar)
  and Vex Thal key (Sceptre of Shadows)) are no longer considered to be active
  flag/key requirements. Should the guild however decide to raid these areas
  on a given evening, you may be left behind if you do not possess these flags/keys.<br>
  ** Flag/key requirements are subject to change based on continued guild advancement
  and progression. </p>
<p><br>
  ** EXPECTATIONS ** </p>
<p>1. We expect that you have some raid knowledge prior to joining Winter`s Legacy.
  We understand that in order to learn, you must do...however, do not expect
  us to hold your hand and lead you through the game. You should be fairly familiar
  with Planar Progression and the encounters involved before applying. <br>
  2. You must maintain a certain degree of dedication to the guild. If you are
  not a team player, than this guild is NOT for you. Guild hoppers need not apply. <br>
  3. Read and become VERY familiar with the Charter&#8230;it is your guide. No
  exceptions will be made for blatant breaking of a charter rule or policy. Ignorance
  of the rules is not a valid excuse. <br>
  4. Register with the website and utilize the forums to keep yourself updated
  on guild information. <br>
  5. Play often and attend raid nights. If you are unable to attend, post in
  the forums to notify the raid leaders of your absence. Respect the raid leaders
  and officers who organize raids so all members may participate. <br>
  6. Raid nights are Tuesday 8pm CST and Saturday 5pm CST. Be there if you can! </p>
<p><br>
  ** HOW TO BEGIN THE MEMBERSHIP PROCESS **<br>
  (Note: Minimum level to apply to Winter`s Legacy is 65, however special consideration
  may be made for classes of high or low desirability, or for family of current
  guild members. All applicants MUST complete an Online Application prior to
  being considered for membership.) </p>
