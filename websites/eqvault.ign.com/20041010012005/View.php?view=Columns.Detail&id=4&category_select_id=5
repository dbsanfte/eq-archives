<div class="pageheaderauthor">By <a href="mailto:blackystavern@hotmail.com">Blacky</a></div>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
<B>"To guild or not to Guild, that is the question?"</B>
<I><p>
"Welcome weary traveler, pull up a stool and rest ye a while in the black Storm tavern. I"ll be your host for the evening. My Karana seems mighty mad this night by the looks of that raging storm outside, but don"t worry the roof is strong and so is the ale. Wench! Be sure to stoke that log fire for our guests. Sorry about that, now then as you are here let me entertain you with a few words from a well traveled adventurer."</i><p>

Before we start let me give you a little insight into who I am. My name is Blacky. I have been an avid player of MMORPG"s and in particular EverQuest since its release in February 1999.I remember the ultimate buzz the first time I logged on and the first time I engaged in Player Versus Player combat. I have witnessed and been a part of the games evolution, and have actively researched and studied many issues and changes within the game and the gaming world.<p>

One of the big decisions facing many players is should I join a guild and if so when and which one?
I have had characters in many different guilds, been officers of several and have created and run two. All of these experiences taught me a lot about guilds, their benefits and their potential floors.
A fairly recent case study showed that 81.1 percent of Everquest players do have their characters in a guild.
Also it shows that 7 percent of players are leaders of a guild, and approximately 36 percent or one third of players are officers of a guild. The same study shows that a higher percentage of female players tend towards leadership roles within a guild, than male players.<p>

Before we can answer the question of should I join a guild, we need to look at several different aspects of the game, and how a guild fits into the world of Norrath.
A guild typically is a group of like minded or similar goal orientated players that decide to form an alliance to help farther their Everquest career.
In the very early days, when Role playing was much more an active part of the game, many guilds were formed out of racial or ethical bonds. I remember when dark race guilds would actively guild war with light race guilds, and all was done in the name of role playing and gaming flavor. Things have changed a great deal since then, and now the creation of guilds seems to be inspired by very different desires.<p>


<B>Guild Classifications</B><p>

There are really three categories a guild can fall under. A role playing guild (which as mentioned is a dying breed), a family guild or a raiding guild.
With this being said, it is also important to look at the different role a guild can play on differing server types. Player Verses Player or PVP servers offer additional reasons why one would want to join a guild. The number one differing factor is safety from hostile PVP players. Larger groups offer more security than small groups or solitary characters.<p>


<B>ROLE PLAYING GUILDS</B><p>

As previously stated, a role playing guild will rise in the world of Norrath out of several players deciding to align themselves together with a role playing theme.
For example, a group of human and high elf characters create a guild and name it "The order of light". The guild forms an ethos of being brave and true and honorable, and dedicated to the defense of the land and the destruction of evil. They will role play their characters when they interact with other players, and attempt to seek out similar guilds to interact with. For many this can be a very enjoyable way to play Everquest.
This type of guild will suite the die hard role players and social addicts that play for the interaction not to beat the game.
<p>
<B>Pros:</B>
<p>
    * Will role play, after all Everquest is a mass multiplayer ROLE PLAYING game.
    * Will be very friendly and closed nit, with good character interaction.


<B>Cons:</B>
<p>
    * Will most likely be a small guild.
    * Less likely to be able to tackle much of the high end game.
<p>
<p>


<B>FAMILY GUILDS</B>
The next classification is the family guild. This guild is born when a group of friendly players who love to group and play together form a guild with the interest of having other players to group and interact with. Through the guild, players get to know other players more in-depth and form a bond of trust with these players. When they log in, it is easier to find people to group with, and it also makes going to the higher level and more challenging zones far more possible. Typically these guilds hold together well and the Everquest experience is enhanced through greater degrees of player interaction and friendship, while providing outlets for opening your character up to more exploration and greater achievement.
This type of guild will suit the average Everquest player, and is a good social outlet, while having the ability open to you to progress your character fairly well.
<p>
<B>Pros:</B>

    * Will most likely have a fairly large member base.
    * Will be a good social guild.
    * Will be strong enough to tackle much of the high end game and help you progress.

<p>
<B>Cons:</B>
<p>
    * May not be able to tackle the top tier of the game well.
    * Will most likely not role play.
<p>

<B>RAIDING GUILDS</B>
<p>
Finally we have the raiding guild. These guilds are usually formed after players have experience a higher level end of the game and are made to ensure grouping in large enough numbers to take on the higher end game, and achieve some of the more demanding goals or to acquiring some of the better items available within the game.
This type of guild is often referred to as an "uber guild" and will suit hardcore players who want to tackle the top end game and gain top tier loot and items.
<p>
<B>Pros:</B>
<p>
    * Will most likely be able to tackle almost every mob or zone in the game.
    * Will offer the best chance of gaining top tier items and equipment.
    * Will do a large number of raids.
<p>

<B>Cons:</B>
<p>
    * Will most likely not be so socially active.
    * Will almost certainly not role play.
    * Will have a rigid recruiting and playing policy.

<p>
Of course some guilds can be an amalgamation of the three, and change and evolve as the players within the guild become enthused with different goals or wish to explore a different path or style of play.

<p>
How should I select a guild that is right for me?
<p>
When you are looking to join a guild there are certain things to consider. First and foremost what kind of guild do you want to be in, and what do you hope to gain or contribute to a guild?
Most role playing guilds will be smaller, and will spend a lot of their time just enjoying the flavor of the game, so if you want to be able to go on lots of exciting raids this is probably not the best fit for you. On the other hand, many raiding guilds can also be time demanding, so do you have long enough play periods to seriously contribute to an active raiding guild?
Next I would try to find out what the guilds reputation is. Ask players if they know about the guild, and try to find out how long it has been active. A long standing guild that has stood the test of time, most likely has good leadership and a strong member base.
Next try to group with some members of the guild in a casual environment, and ask a few questions. What do you like about your guild? How long have you been a member? What are its rules or guidelines? And finally what are its new member requirements?
 Next try to speak to a guild officer or the leader, and find out how to go about joining. Also see if you feel you can fit into their guild ethos and structure.
Another good point to mention is what time zone is the core of their members in.
For example, if you are in England and under Greenwich Mean Time, you may not find many players online if (for the most) part the guilds players are in the United States and on Eastern Standard Time. A seven hour time difference can cause problems.
One very important factor to remember is not what can my guild do for me, but what can I do for my guild.
Although the main reason for most players to join a guild is to benefit their character, and enhance their enjoyment of the game, a good guild will soon lose interest in helping you if all you seem to do is leach from the guild. Remember to participate for the growth of other players too. As characters within the guild become better equipped and more powerful, the guild will be able to move on to bigger and better things, and tackle tougher mobs and zones.
With all three guild types there are some things to be aware of. Many guilds are ruined by cumbersome or unnecessary politics and lose sight of why we play. After all Everquest is a game, and most players play for fun. Some players seem to lose sight of that, and it"s not uncommon to come across a guild that demands time commitments from its members.
It may have level restrictions, probationary periods and rules to govern how you play your game.
Many of these guide lines need to exist for them to have the guild operate the way they want it to, but be aware of it and if you can not live up to the guilds stringent rules set save your time and theirs by not joining.
Make sure you put into a guild what you expect to get out of it, and above all enjoy the benefits of belonging to a good guild.
<p>
<B>What if I want to solo?</B>
<p>
As you can see, there are many advantages to joining a guild, however many players (especially at lower levels) feel like they want to solo more or try to carve their own unique niche into Norrathian society.
If you are thinking of going this route, at least in the beginning there are a few factors to consider when creating your character. Firstly not all race and class combinations are created equal, and some favor solo play more than others.
Anyone reading this that has played a warrior and a druid will most certainly agree that you can solo far better as the druid.
In general the best classes for soloing are going to be Necromancers, Druids or Bards.
That"s not to say other classes can not solo, but the aforementioned classes are better equipped to do it without long periods of downtime, due to manna burn out or hit point loss.
As you gain in levels, soloing becomes more difficult and at the higher end of the game, it is almost impossible to progress well if at all trying to solo with certain classes such as a warrior.
This is no way an attempt at discrediting the less solo equipped classes, as in a group strong tanks and clerics are a must. It just merely points out that if you are looking to go the solo route then maybe a Cleric or warrior too name but two classes, is not the way to go.
<p>

<B>Finishing statement</B>
<p>
To finalize this topic I would just like to recommend that at the very least a player should join a guild at some point in his life. Everquest has evolved to a state that without a good guild you will miss out on much of the high end game, and some of its more rewarding aspects.
Everquest was designed to be a group promoting game and is engineered towards that end. Grouping is more lucrative than solo play, and therefore as guilds offer better grouping potential to a player it makes perfect cense that it is to your benefit to join one.
Of course there is also the exciting avenue of starting your own guild, but I think we will leave that for another time.
<p>
"Well it looks like the rain has lifted so I suppose you will be off. Drop in again when your travels bring you this way, and be careful on the roads at this late hour. You never know what might be leering at you from the shadows."<p>
