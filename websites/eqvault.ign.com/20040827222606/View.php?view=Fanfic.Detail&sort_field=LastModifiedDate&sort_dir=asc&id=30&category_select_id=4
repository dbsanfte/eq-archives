<br><span class="pageheader">The Catalyst, Part 5</span>
<br>By <a href="mailto:">Jordan Thomas</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-10-2004</b> - 
Chapter 5:
<br>
<br>“Looking back, I suppose I must admit that being in close proximity to actual gods was fascinating. At the time, I was understandably upset. Recently, one of my brightest young footpads asked me what I would have done differently, if I had been able to think clearly during the Sundering. He wanted to know how I would have approached the god of thieves, had I the chance. I thought for a moment, and then said I would try to pick his pockets.” - From Shades of Gray, The Memoirs of Modus Operandi Thousands of leagues away in the tight Halfling community known as Rivervale, a diminutive druid sat upon The Great Wall. The wavy stone barrier separated the city itself from the grove outside, where goblins often lurked in great numbers. The druid, one Grimple Dovetree, sat deep in meditation. Two of Rivervale’s Leatherfoot Raiders stood nearby and looked on, bored but wary. The esteemed nature-priest of Karana was to be protected at all costs, they’d been told. All they knew was that he’d been in a trance for just over an hour now, and a storm was brewing. Normally, that would have been a good sign. Karana was the Lord of Storms, after all. But as the guards gazed out over the wall, they realized something unnatural was afoot. This was not an ordinary gale. Dark folds of black vapor curled about the normal clouds, creating huge, twisting spirals of foreboding. Thunder filled the air, and the guards shivered at the sound. There was something ominous about the sound, a portent quality. They looked down at Grimple uncertainly. His brow was creased, and he had begun to shake. Suddenly, his eyes popped open, and he spoke, a wild overtone to his voice. “The gods walk Norrath this day,” he said. “May the fates be merciful.” * * * Inside the box he had stolen from Catalyst, Modus found only a small parchment. He heard inhuman cries of bloodlust echoing in from the upper chambers, but he found himself riveted to the words on the paper: You are a low down, no-good, unscrupulous thief. And I like that. Ye might nae be too predictable to the sheep ye manipulate out there in the world, but I know ya, boy. I’ve been watching you for years, and laughin’ at the way ya work. I sure hope that poor Teir’dal doesn’t think that box ye stole was really meant for him. Anyway, it all worked out for the best, if you’re reading this. Which I know ye are. It’s one of the perks. Anyway, that “Catalyst” character ain’t played out his part yet. He’s a bit of a strange beast, he is. When he was born, his Teir’dal patrons ripped out his soul and set it in a jar. They knew what they could use him for, even before he had opened his eyes for the first time. The Three Vessels of Rage. He’s vessel number one, boy. The soul currently living in his poor beleaguered body ain’t his. It belongs to a dwarf who lived a long time ago, a revenant who can only feel hate. That dwarf is vessel number two. I do believe your ‘employer’ means to be vessel number three. I’d imagine by the time you’re staring like a fool at this letter, that dwarf has already enacted his vengeance on the high elves. But it ain’t the inkie’s fault. Ya need to get him out of there, and to the Battlefield. Ye’ll know what I mean soon enough. Ye can’t stop the birth of the Hate King, boy. That whole Three Vessels business is just one part of the ritual that births the bastard. The dark elves all over Norrath have been at it for years. But ye can save the darkling. Bring him back to his ‘family’. The results will be a heck of a joke. Just remember, he cannae act without his true soul. Watch yer back, Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane The Original Thief Modus leapt to his feet, eyeing the letter. He quickly came to a decision to follow the instructions, and refrain from considering it overmuch. It was too perfect to be the work of anyone else. The mercenary was a skeptical sort, but there was something otherworldly about the entire situation. As much as he loathed the idea, it appeared he would have to take a stand of some sort. His gaze fell upon his prone band of thieves, and he addressed them all with confidence. “On your feet, men! Time waits for no one. The Unseen must act, or be trampled under the feet of those who would manipulate us. Follow me, and keep your weapons at the ready!” With that, Modus charged down the hall, both rapiers drawn and bobbing in front of him. His pace dropped off steadily though, as he began to hear the moans. Musical elven voices, but warbling and ragged in a hellish chorus. Pain itself was present in the sound. Modus heard the padded steps of his band catching up, but he skidded into the main upper-audience chamber without stopping. What he saw shattered his professional calm, and he dropped his blades in shock. Blood filled the marble hall, and dripped from the massive oaken dining tables. Red splatters on pristine white, and carnage everywhere. Elven nobles were haphazardly sprawled about the room, both dead and dying. Their wounds were innumerable, and their cries of agony echoed off the looming walls. As he grimly surveyed the scene, Modus realized he couldn’t help any of them. None of the council members had been prepared for Catalyst’s psychotic attack. They were slumped in their chairs, and wore frozen expressions of shock. The revenant-possessed dark elf had murdered them all. And in the center of the circular dais, the murderer sat, covered in blood. His eyes had a vacant shine to them, and no less than seven sharp weapons lay strewn about him in disarray. His face looked like it was carved of obsidian stone, frozen in a tranquil stare. Modus looked down at him, and thought that somehow, he looked like a dark angel, even in the horrible ring of sin which surrounded them all. He could not help but feel sorry for the soulless Teir’dal. It felt strange to be sympathetic for Catalyst in that silent moment, surrounded by mutilated victims. The half-elven rogue didn’t think about it for long. A rumbling, droning chant began to resound in the room, seemingly from nowhere. It was an evil sound, a low-pitched voice that made the mercenaries queasy. The men glanced around, searching for the source of the dark song, but stumbled back as the spectral glow began to pour forth again from Catalyst’s immobile form. As the band of thieves and spies stood watching, the glow detached itself partially from the dark elf, and began to suck bands of black energy from the blood covering the chamber. With each pulse, the swirling maelstrom grew. All at once, everything seemed to explode into action. The huge double-doors ahead of them burst open, and through the foyer streamed several dark Elven warriors, weapons drawn and eyes glowing red. Aniyal herself strode in behind them, head held high, and grinning her deadly grin. “The Father comes,” she said simply. Modus drew himself into a tight crouch, and picked up his fallen rapiers. His eyes darted from left to right, examining the posture and expression on the faces of his Unseen. Some were dazed, but many of them were scowling savagely. The half-elf had to act fast. He had been afraid of this. The perverse glow above Catalyst was shifting colors now, and the demonic chanting was coming to a crescendo. Some of the phosphorescent plasma clung to the sitting warrior, while yet other parts of it splashed onto Aniyal, trickling about her body. Between them, the wrathful dwarven spirit phased into being. The energy was connecting them, ricocheting between all three. “Run for your lives!” Modus shouted, over the din. But he was too late. Already, one of his finest assassins had plunged her dagger into the back of another Unseen, a man whose position she was jealous of. Her face was a chiseled grimace of pure fury, and she began to laugh as he slumped to the ground. Some of the others had broken out into swordfights as well, screaming at each other like natural enemies. A few of the Unseen had engaged the Teir’dal, and cries of battle melded with the continuous chant. From between their clashing blades, yet more motes of black light swept into the coalescing central presence. Modus pressed himself back against a wall, watching the chaotic scene unfold. For once in his life, he had no conception of what action to take. In the swirling, unholy luminescence, the warriors’ shadows danced about the walls in towering black caricatures. A few of the Unseen turned and ran at his warning, but already several had fallen in the fight. They were caught in the rapture of hate, one of the purest passions of man, and Modus could do nothing to stop them. Even Modus was beginning to feel angry for no reason, remembering many times he had been exploited or hurt as an orphan, and - A shadow-bathed street in Freeport, under a low red moon. The boy was hungry, close to starving. He had to swipe some food soon, or he wouldn’t have the energy to make it through the night. The carnival was still in full, garish operation though, and the dazzling magical lights of the performers stood in stark contrast to the gloom in his heart. At least there would be plenty of fools on the street. One of them had to have a gold coin or two, maybe a mealbag. He climbed up on the roof of Zimel’s Blades, and watched for a mark. Sure enough, a loud tourist and his chattery wife broke away from the crowd, and wandered off, probably headed back to a hotel somewhere. The boy knew it was time to strike. He leapt silently from roof to roof, following the couple until they clumped down into a by-way, an alley of sorts. Without a sound, he dropped down onto the cobblestones behind them. One quick slash from his bootknife dropped the man’s purse into his hand. The fop never knew he was there. The boy watched, from the shadows, until the couple rounded the corner and their voices faded away. With glee, he poked his finger inside the pouch to get at the contents, and perhaps finally fill his belly, but his joy was short lived. Something heavy struck him in the head from behind, and smashed him face-first into the wall. The pouch flew from his hands, and skittered to a stop. The boy sunk to the ground, then weakly turned over to confront his attacker. Two of the local human toughs stood over him, guffawing darkly. “Aww, look at the little mutt, I think you hurt him,” laughed the larger of the pair.” One o’ his pointy lil’ ears is bleeding.” “Aye, I’m ta thinkin’ his tainted weakling blood has made the kid slow. Thanks for the gold, whelp,” spat the second thief. “Stay off our turf, half-breed. Next time we’ll take one of those funny little ears,” grunted the large one, and made as if to kick the boy. Screaming in hunger-borne anger, the boy leapt forward and plunged his dagger into the leg of the burly rogue. With tears of fear and rage, the young orphan scampered off into the night, listening to the sweet howl of surprise. He would make the bastards pay, someday… he would - Modus’ hand was shaking, a dagger drawn. His brow lowered, he was caught in pure ire, trapped in the memory. He could see his own hate spilling out, and flowing toward the spectre in the center of the room. He knew he was being tricked, and it just made him angrier. But he would not be used. Not by anyone. “N-no!!” he shouted, and dropped the dagger with considerable effort. But to his dismay, the whirling ball of darkness and light began to take a definite shape. And it was laughing. A horrible, venomous chuckle poured from within. It phased between Catalyst, the dwarven visage, Aniyal, and something new. A gaunt head, a deformed face with every line sharp and rigid. There was no love in the eyes of the apparition, no compassion. It was the expression of ultimate loathing. The face of Innoruuk. And the lord of hate spoke. “I HAVE COME! ” roared the head. “The ritual of rage is complete. The final piece in place, and born I am to this pitiful rock once more. Three vessels filled, three vessels turned. Hate from victim, hate for vengeance, hate in malice. All are mine. ” The head of Innoruuk paused for a moment as if in thought, and then regarded Aniyal, who stood rapt before him in ecstasy. “You have done well, my child and third vessel,” it said. “Thy ritual was perfection itself, and your service will be rewarded. Make your way to the homeland, where the hatred of Innoruuk will be given flesh. Another shard of my essence was birthed in the cursed Surefall, and another in thy city. Spread the word of my passage unto this plane, and congregate in the forest. Your kin will bathe in the blood of the heathen godling Marr, and eat of his torn body. None shall survive the wrath of Innoruuk!” With that, the head collapsed in on itself, and let out a multi-voiced shriek as it rocketed through the ceiling. Everyone in the room screamed at the sound, and only dropped their hands from their ears long after it had faded away. The few in the room who remained alive and sane looked around blankly, stunned by the face and voice of a god. Modus watched distantly as Catalyst seemed to relax where he sat, but retained a strange purplish glow. From where Innoruuk’s face had been, a spectral body fell to the ground. It was a stocky dwarven form which landed lightly on its feet, and stared for a moment at the sky. “At last, me kindred… release…” it said, and faded away. Aniyal looked down at Catalyst, and then at Modus. “You have both served as excellent tools. Goodbye, mercenary. Goodbye, manse’toru. I have no more need for either of you. When the Father razes this pathetic surface land, perhaps your deaths will be swift.” The priestess turned to the remainder of her elite guard, as if to leave. Modus could see the rune on her back glowing now, almost glittering with power. But in afterthought, Aniyal turned back to regard him, and winked. “Never fear, mercenary. Do you seek your payment? Simply look around this room. These sun-bleached scum need not their riches anymore,” she laughed, and began to intone a series of harsh dark Elven syllables. “My payment shall be taken now,” Modus muttered, and threw his sharpest daggers directly at Aniyal’s eyes. She smiled as they whirled toward her, and then disappeared, along with her entire entourage. Modus turned away as the blades clattered into the distant hall, and spat. Norrath seemed to be doomed, and he had played a part. He heard Catalyst stand up. Everybody else was dead, and he knew it. He hoped that at least half of his men had escaped. The room was the worst thing he’d ever seen, and he tried not to look around too closely. Even if the world survived, Felwithe would never be the same with the death of its Elders. He spun around to face the dark elf, the shadow factor himself. The blood-soaked warrior still glowed faintly, and wore an expression of incredible sorrow. Sighing wearily, he bent down and picked up a long, thin sword and held it at the ready. “Come, justice,” he said. “Destroy me, the living weapon of Innoruuk. I have slain your people.” Modus stared at the forlorn Teir’dal for a long moment, and then said, “No, I think not. They were not my people, though their loss saddens me. Too much blood has been spilt here today already. Like me, I think you have simply been used as a pawn between Aniyal and her god.” Catalyst nodded, and slipped the blade into a sword-belt he found on one of the nearby dead. He buckled it on with deliberate motions. “I can feel him within me though. I can taste the power he left behind. The song in my mind has changed.” “Good,” Modus grunted, looking over the odd fire that still circled Catalyst’s head. “What your courteous holder has forgotten is that the subtle movements of a few key pawns can easily take out the Queen. What say you, Teir’dal? Shall we knock her from her lofty perch?” Catalyst felt himself smiling, for the first time he could remember. It was such an odd sensation. He even chuckled quietly. “I’ll take that as a yes,” the mercenary said. And then he was knocked from his feet by a massive bolt of lightning which boomed from the ceiling. Catalyst was thrown back as well, and the two of them sat staring at the small figure who appeared, standing amidst the hanging ozone and the rising dust. The sound of the blast still echoed in the otherwise-silent hall. Grimple stood there, his mouth agape at the carnage in the room. “Gods above us. What happened here? It’s horrible,” he sputtered, and then covered his mouth in revulsion. Modus let out a deep breath, and quietly cursed his friend’s penchant for grand entrances. “Old friend, Innoruuk was summoned here. This is the blood of his birth. More than that, you do not want to know.” Modus got to his feet slowly. Somewhere outside, he could hear a repetitive booming noise, getting slightly louder with time. “Who’s the inkie,” Grimple asked, staring incredulously at Catalyst’s bloody face. “Remember the one they call ‘Catalyst’, halfling? This is him, and he has already played his part in the darkness of this day. It was not his fault, and he needs our help. All of us have to get out of here, fast.” “Well now,” Grimple retorted, still eyeing Catalyst. “That’s what Druids were made for! We will run with the speed of the wolves. I could sense ye were in trouble, but to tell you the truth, half-breed… we’re all in trouble. Karana visited me during my meditations this morning, and he was so very sad. Innoruuk is not the only one -- all the gods have come.” The booming from outside was definitely closer now. It was shaking the hall. Everything vibrated with each resounding thump. The three oddly matched men looked at each other with trepidation, then turned and charged up the spiraling marble stairwell. They burst through the foyer and clattered out onto the grand balcony of Felwithe. As they stared into the Faydark night, their heavy breath came to a quick stop. Five thousand torchlights broke the darkness, flickering in formation. Each dancing flame illuminated the blue-black skin of the orc who held it, and on each of their faces was the scowl of bloodlust. The orcs of Crushbone had come to sack Felwithe in its darkest hour. As the three stood aghast, a faint whistling noise could be heard. Out of nowhere, the body of a high elf flew at them from the night sky. Modus ducked and shouted in surprise, and the corpse splattered against the whitewall behind him. Then they saw what threw it. Towering over ten stories high, a gigantic Orc loomed over the Crushbone armies. In one hand it held an axe the size of a drake’s wingspan, and in the other it clutched a few crushed elves. Even from several hundred yards, they could see its mighty jaw moving in laughter. Its voice was a baritone scrape, a rumble like a continuous landslide. “Crushbone,” Grimple whispered, “The Orcish god.” As the last syllable left his lips, a stream of high Elven soldiers poured out of the gates below them, engaging the orcish shock troops. The fight had begun, and it was wild and desperate, even viewed from above. But Modus’ eyes were glued to the gargantuan deity. It was loping right at the city, its head directly level with the balcony on which they stood. “Grimple,” Modus breathed, “There’s no time for running…get us out of here, now!” The halfling looked up at Modus, terror and sadness welling in his wise eyes. “I cannot,” he cried. “Such a spell is far beyond what I can do alone! I cannot take all of us at once!” “I can,” Catalyst said, with inhuman calm. The rogue and the druid turned to regard their quiet companion, and watched as he rotated his eyes skyward. An electric purple fountain burst forth from him, and bathed all three in its light. Modus was still staring at the dark elf in utter surprise when everything went black.
