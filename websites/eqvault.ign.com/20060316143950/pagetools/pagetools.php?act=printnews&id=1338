The biggest was for EverQuest: Online Adventures players.  On Thursday we posted an all new <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=22&category_select_id=6">EQOA Dev Diary</a>.  Earlier in the week, we had some <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Fanfic.Detail&id=43&category_select_id=8">new fan fiction</a> from Avalon, and two exclusive OoW AA abilities.  Wednesday we had a <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=129">never-before-seen screenshot</a> from the upcoming PS2 game, Champions of Norrath: Return to Arms.  Finally on Friday we had two new epic riddles in one day and some <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=133">pencil art</a> of the upcoming Ranger's Epic 2.0.<br><br>News this week was somewhat slow, but a few things happened.  Monday SOE <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63311">cleared up some confusion</a> over focus effects post-65. On Wednesday SOE opened up the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/">registeration</a> to the upcoming Fan Faire in New Orleans.<br><br>That's it for this week.  Remember if you have any news send it along to me and i'll get it up.  And finally tonight, many of us have friends and guild members that live in Florida and are dealing with the hurricane this weekend.  On the behalf of EQ Vault i'd like to wish everyone involved good luck and you are in our thoughts.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 4 September, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1338">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1338</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:39:50 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
