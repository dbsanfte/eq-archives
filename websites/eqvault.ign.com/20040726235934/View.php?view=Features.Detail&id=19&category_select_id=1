<p class="pageheader">Community Summit Interview: Alan Crosby
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-22-2004</b> - 
<B>From your standpoint how well did the guild summit go, did it meet your internal expectations?</b>
<P>
The summit was a great success.  I had two goals for the summit.  One was for the players and the developers to come together and see each other as people with passion for the game.  The second was for open and candid dialogue.  We spent many hours talking with each other not at each other.  I think we all came away with a better understanding of both sides of EQ.
<P>
<B>When did the idea for the guild summit come about and do you feel that it was worth the expense?</B>
<P>
The idea came about just before E3, so in early May.  Tom Taylor, Vannoth, put all of this together in that short, four week period and did a wonderful job. 
The experience was well worth the expense.  We had open, honest communication and gathered loads of great feedback.  The attendees got to see some of the inner workings and, I think, walked away with a new understanding of them team and some of the challenges we face.
<P>
<B>What was the most common piece of feedback that you received?</B>
<P>
There was so much discussed, it is hard to lock down one thing as most common.  I did hear quite a bit of concern regarding the power gap between casual guilds and raid guilds, however.  Many felt that there is a barrier between the two that cannot yet be bridged with current content.  The team is considering this feedback and looking at what changes can be made to help.
<P>
<B>From the feedback you received what surprised you the most both good and bad?</B>
<P>
To be honest the only surprise for me was that even the high level attendees had concerns about the mid-level and casual game.  They provided some good suggestions and insights for the less vocal play styles.
<P>
<B>Now that the summit is over what steps are being taken to follow through with the goals of the summit and with the feedback you received?</B>
<P>
As a team we are continuing the communication.  We have set up a message board for all of the attendees and it is already seeing quite a bit of use.  We do not wish for all of the dialogue to end now that folks have flown home.
<P>
We have compiled all of the feedback we received and organized it into long term, short term and not likely categories.  We have already started to implement some of the short term changes and are planning out the lengthier ones.  Stay tuned for changes to be posted on the EQ site as we move them to the Test server.
<P>
<B>It came out during the interaction with Mr. Smedley that Gates of Discord was tuned for characters above the current level capacity and that the title did not receive enough testing. How did something like this happen and what steps are being taken to make sure future expansions do not have these problems? </B>
<P>
Several things happened all at once that lead to the problems we had with Gates.  For Gates testing, we had too few people (due to limited invites) and an unstable test environment (as the DX9 and Collision changes were on the beta server).  So the testing was not completed as thoroughly as it should have been.  We are addressing these concerns by allowing more testers in, with a better test plan and by providing a stable test environment, so that the beta testers can actually play in the new content.  We will be asking some guilds to come over as a whole and test as well so that we have people experienced in working together doing so in the beta.  We think these changes will go a long way towards making sure this does not happen again.
<P>
As for the level increase, the original plan was to have a small bump in levels on the 5th anniversary, followed by another bump to 70th level with Omens.  However, once Gates was near completion the decision was made to have the level increase with Omens and that left us with content that was too difficult and too short a time line to change it prior to Gates going live.  So we attempted to make changes to the content without them being tested by groups of players to make certain the content was balanced for the current levels.
<P>
It came out during the summit that there will be a push to introduce new players to EverQuest. What are some of the challenges of trying to get new consumers to pick up EverQuest with other products coming to market what benefits does EverQuest offer a new player today?
<P>
We think that EverQuest stands well against the other titles coming out in the weeks and months ahead.  EverQuest has much to offer and will continue to be around for quite some time.  EverQuest has tons of content with lots things to do and places to visit.  I doubt many players have actually seen every zone.  One of the challenges EQ does face is that it is 5 years old.  However, we feel that the graphics upgrades and readily available content will make EQ stand out against many of the new competitors.  
<P>
<B>I think there is a perception that if you don’t belong to a large, and active, guild then there is very little high-level content that can be accessed within EverQuest?  Do you think that this perception is valid and how do you plan to change it, either it cause or false perception?</B>
<P>
My personal opinion is that there is plenty to do, no matter what level character you play or what level guild you joined.  Now, there is content that is aimed at the more advanced guilds, however they got to that content by working through all of the previous zones. They have that content because they have conquered everything we have put in front of them.   As gear gets better and content moves along, the other groups and guilds will get there too.  Maybe not as fast, but they will get there and we hope, have a great time doing so.
<P>
<B>With the introduction of the new tutorial the EverQuest newbie experience is much improved. Though level 10 a character always has something to do but after level 10 the player is left without much knowing of where they should go and why. There is a lot of content for that player to experience but they aren’t guided to it well. Do you agree with this sentiment and is this something that is going to be improved?</B>
<P>
EverQuest is non-linear.  There is no sweeping quest that eventually gets you to an end boss, which you defeat and win the game.  Your story in EQ is driven by you and your character.  You decide what you want to do and you create your own story.  We want you to meet folks and together decide where you interests lie.  It is in clearing a swamp of nasty invaders?  Fighting Orcs on their home turf? Or perhaps delving into an undead dungeon?  It's really up to you.   For those of you who find you lack a direction, talk to the people around you, make a group and have some fun together.  EQ is at its core a social game and it is that interaction that keeps so many of us playing. See the sights and have a good time and the stories of your exploits will write themselves.
<P>
<B>We would like to thank Alan for his time and for showing us such a good time at the summit.</B>
