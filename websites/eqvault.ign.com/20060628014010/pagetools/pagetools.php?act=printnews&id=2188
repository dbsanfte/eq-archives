These questions are directly from them!<br><br>Here's a clip:<blockquote><b>blapfrog:</b> Are there any easter eggs players may not be aware of in the game; along the lines of the smedly grafitti in qeynos, and perhaps griffons doing the macarena when charmed?<br><br><i>There are bunches of easter eggs in EverQuest. One example is in the tutorial, each NPC there is named after a member of the design team. You can also find most of the design teams corpses in a high level Gates zone. </i></blockquote><br>You can read the full article and all six questions <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=35">here</a><br><br>Remember these questions come straight from you!
