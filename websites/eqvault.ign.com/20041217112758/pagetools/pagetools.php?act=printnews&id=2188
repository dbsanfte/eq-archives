These questions are directly from them!<br><br>Here's a clip:<blockquote><b>blapfrog:</b> Are there any easter eggs players may not be aware of in the game; along the lines of the smedly grafitti in qeynos, and perhaps griffons doing the macarena when charmed?<br><br><i>There are bunches of easter eggs in EverQuest. One example is in the tutorial, each NPC there is named after a member of the design team. You can also find most of the design teams corpses in a high level Gates zone. </i></blockquote><br>You can read the full article and all six questions <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=35">here</a><br><br>Remember these questions come straight from you!  If you want to get in on the action for the second set of questions - reply to <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=76511350&replies=0">this thread</a> with your questions.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Mon 04 Oct 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#2188<br>Printed On: Fri Dec 17 3:27:51 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
