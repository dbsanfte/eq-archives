This will be looked at right away.<br><br>If you don't get an AA when you finish a mission, zone back in and it should work.<br><br>Abundant Healing does block Gift of Mana and they are going to fix that.<br><br>They will check out the pet AA that causes the pet not to flurry in the middle and fix it.<br><br>The session then turned to loot in Depths of Darkhollow.  Craig wanted feedback, and he got it.  The community correspondents all felt that the loot was not worth the reward for the difficulty of the encounters because to defeat the encounters you had to have gear better than what currently drops.  Zajeer, who works on itemization in the game, gave us a very detailed explanation of how loot works in DoDH.  Basically, he designed each of the DoDH zones to be equivalent to existing zones, and made the loot equivalent as well.  Items reflect the difficulty of content.  However, it was pointed out that the difficultly levels of the DoD encounters are not really eqivualent to the older zones, and the loot should be better accordingly.  Craig and Rashere were willing to consider this point.  The dev team also explained to the participants that the disparity between loot and difficulty sometimes occurs because one person designs the encounter and another does the loot tables.  They assured us that this coming week they would look into any discrepancies where the loot is not equivalent to the encounter difficulty.<br><br>It was also mentioned that they build items to get through the content, and not just to embellish statistics.<br><br>Zajeer also explained that the Dreadspire/Hive Queen encounters were to be the equivalent of Time/Quarm gear drops.  Many of the items have a clicky effect if you can't equip them so they are still useful.<br><br>The gap between the casual player and the raider was discussed, and the dev team pointed out they designed the game so that raiders have 50% better gear than what drops for a casual player in single group encounters.  That is their rule of thumb when designing raid-level drops.<br><br>The dev team also answered a tribute question. No-drop items will never be tributable, but any item that drops and has value is tributable.<br><br>The entire group was feeling very positive about monster missions, and not so much about the shrouds, because of their limited usefulness at high levels, which the devs pointed out was completely intentional.  Shrouds were never designed to relplace any player of the same level, so no one looking for a group would get left out in favor of a shrouding player making a different class.  Above 50 shrouds are below average compared to any player of equivalent level and class, and will remain that way.  The shrouds are designed to have fun playing a different class without rolling a new character at the middle levels, and to play with lower level characters.<br><br>The idea of a reward for progressing through all the monster missions was well recieved by the dev team.    It was brought up by a community correspondent that some missions just don't seem to have a place in the progression.  The devs explained that some stand alone and are just a task to focus game play.<br><br>The progress of shroud experience was brought up.  Players wanted to know if it was supposed to be this slow.  It is slow, Rashere admitted, but he wanted it to be slow and completely separate from other experience for your main character.  Light blues all the way to reds will give you experience for your shroud progression, however, so any time you kill something that gives you *group* experience it does progress the shrouds (raid experience does not count, they stated).  The shroud experience is not affected by class or race in any way.<br><br>The evolving items are the same way, said Zajir, having a slower progression than regular leveling experience.  Intelligent items are slower but he wants them to be slow so the player experiences the text.  Static zones drop evolving items, Zajir told us, and he expects it would take 10 hours a week killing NPCs to get a level on the evolving items.  The evolving items currently have eight levels, while the intelligent items have three.  Zajir is waiting for feedback on the intelligent items before he changes anything on the experience for those.<br><br>It was suggested the leadership experience be given without the person being a leader by setting a button (like AA exp), since Health of Health's target is so important and it's hard to be leader when you don't have it.  The dev team said they would look into it.<br><br>The find NPC command was discussed.  Eric Kosky explained that in the old zones, the pathing issues make it impossible for the server to figure out how to tell a player to find the NPC using the path ("mysterious forces prohbit you from finding your destination" -- that's a server problem).  He will look into possibly implemeting a compass marker to point direction.<br><br>They will not change mod rods, as they entire dev team said they aren't big fans of them in the first place.  Why? because they don't want instant mana regen, it makes the encounters too trivial.<br><br>The dev team will consider making a click item command, but the item will have to be in an open slot.  What the devs don't want is a player to be able to click lots of items all the time, as it's game unbalancing.  The same goes for more potion slots and bandolier slots, clicking through unopened bags, and so forth. The good news is, they just forgot after the last fan faire to make invis potions stackable, so they will be fixing that. (Update: Loral has reported this has been implemented and should be in for the next patch).<br><br>They like the idea of guild wars, and will think about that.<br><br>They know taunt isn't working for high level mobs and they are looking at that.<br><br>They understand that the time out when you go link dead is frustrating, but feel it is too exploitable if they come up with any solution that so far has been suggested.<br><br>They will seriously consider putting a banker in the guild lobby.<br><br>Class balancing is continuing and is an ongoing process.  It is happening, according to Craig, they just have not posted anything.<br><br>And that's all my notes!<br><br>I will sum up my experience at this community summit by saying that I met a lot of great people who are trying to make the game really good for the players.  Your community correspondents really care about representing your classes, the development team cares about making a fun and balanced game that isn't too easy, and the community representatives from SOE really like the players and want to help your game experience be enjoyable.<br><br>As far as individual fixes on various things, if it could be exploitable by a player or makes the game too easy, then they are not going to do it.  Too much power, or mana regen is not where the development team wants the game to go.  They want the players to experience as much of the content as they can, and progress their characters in an individual way without constraints on what your should do.  Above all, they want you staring at the computer monitor when you play because you are engaged and having a great time playing EverQuest.<br><br>Everyone who was at this summit was representing you, the players, as best as she or he could.   They had lists of questions and had the chance to ask all of them and get answers.  The dev team were all open to questions, comments, discussions at every dinner, outing, and roundtable break.  I feel I learned so much about what EQ is about again and what is important to the development team.  They really want to entertain you and make the best game out there.  It can't be too easy or it's not fun, whatever "fun" might mean to you.<br><br>I would encourage you to read all the other fan sites for their take on the summitt -- <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/news_page.php">EQ Traders</a>, EQInterface, Caster's Realm, Stratics, <a href="http://crucible.samanna.net/viewtopic.php?t=908">The Spirit Realm and Samanna's Crucible</a>, <a href="http://www.eqclerics.org/forums/showthread.php?t=20678">EQ Clerics</a>, <a href="http://mobhunter.com">Mobhunter</a> and of course what your community correspondents post.  There was so much going on that everyone's take on this is important.<br><br>A big thanks goes out to SOE staffer Lauren for her organization that made this a seamless event and to Alan Crosby, Brenlo, for all his hard work, as well as to the devs and the community managers who worked so hard the entire four days to make our visit such a success.  Thank you!!<br><br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 2 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11495">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11495</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:31:39 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
