I would like to apologize for not getting a message out to you sooner and I will make certain that I get any new updates out as soon as we get them.<br><br>We do have some news for those of you awaiting word on EverQuest for the Macintosh. We have prioritized the current issues that we know of and have assigned one of our programmers to look into any server issues and make changes and fixes as necessary to the server code. We will also be working to resolve any client issues and update things for your EQMac clients. We do not have a time table for any changes yet, however the process has begun and we will post more information on EQMac changes as we gather details.<br><br>We appreciate all of our dedicated Macintosh players and thank you for being a part of Norrath.<br><br>Brenlo <br></blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sun 27 Jun 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#158<br>Printed On: Tue Dec 21 16:51:44 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
