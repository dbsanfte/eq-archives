I was going to wait until I received the in-game screenshots from the BoTB tournament to put this up - but it seems I will not have them until Monday so I’ll create a new section with just the screenys when I receive them.<br><br>Included with the report are 10 pictures as well.  <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=37&category_select_id=9">Check it out!</a><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 05 Nov 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3206<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 8 3:52:00 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
