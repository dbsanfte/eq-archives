This exploit is used to effect other players. We know of this exploit and are in the process of permanently banning any user that has used this exploit and will ban anyone else who uses it as well. The exploit will be fixed with an update tomorrow morning, but in the meantime anyone who takes advantage of the exploit will be banned."<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 22 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11210">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11210</a><br>Printed On: Mon Dec 12 1:49:10 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
