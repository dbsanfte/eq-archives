<B>DKP & Raid Point Systems - The Rich Keep Getting Richer!</B>
<p>
<I>"The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it." -Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations</I>
<p>
Most of us know what DKP is. If you've been in a guild awhile, you've earned a few in your time, like the rest of us. "Dragon Kill Points," or points awarded to raid members for their participation and contribution towards the accomplishment of a common goal have become the gold standard of most heavy raiding guilds in EverQuest. (For those unfamiliar with a DKP system, raids or mobs are assigned a certain point value that is awarded to participants of that particular raid/kill. DKP point values are also assigned to items that drop off of mobs on raids, and players exchange their earned points for the right to loot items of their choice, the right to loot usually going to the person with the most points who goes in on the item.)
<p>
This system seems fairly simple and easily maneuverable at first glance, but the inherent flaws in the system begin to emerge when guilds progress and DKP points earned by players soar into the hundreds if not thousands. Granted, it makes sense to save your points for that one item you really want, but when someone else wants it as well, and they've been saving twice as long, you may very well never see that item.
<p>
What can guilds do to counteract this cycle, and make sure that the coveted items don't only go to the "rich" of that particular DKP System?
<p>
Some guilds have incorporated a "use them or lose them" policy to discourage DKP hoarding, and to some extent, this works. However, there are those people who hoard simply because items they do not want, or cannot use, aren't dropping. For guilds that raid more than 3 times a week, the "use them or lose them" approach would be a good way to even out the playing field a bit. When mobs are being killed over and over again in a given month, it raises the odds that the desired items will drop, and allows more opportunities for people to spend their points. But once a guild steps up into farm mode and only raids maybe once or twice a week, this philosophy becomes exponentially less effective as opportunities to spend are less abundant.
<p>
So what do the farming guilds that raid less frequently do? Well, one system I have observed quite closely recently has many people up in arms. When guilds raid only once a week or so, players oftentimes find other things to do with their time aside from grinding or adventuring. Sometimes, these activities involve returning to old world, Kunark, or Velious boss mobs and killing them for items that used to be coveted and are still somewhat valuable to players, either as a piece of alternate gear, or as a way to make some extra platinum. (For example, the Avatar of War in Kael Drakkal who drops flayed barbarian skin leggings, flayed barbarian hide mask, the coveted Blade of Carnage, and a few other items, many of which are droppable.)
<p>
Once point values are assigned to items, many guilds have tables on their websites allowing guild members to readily see the point values of any item that has ever been looted. I have observed lately that some guilds have started charging DKP even when the items are dropping and being looted outside of an organized guild raid. The philosophy is this: If you are able to kill those mobs now that it used to take raids to do, it is only because we as a guild have helped you attain gear and experience that makes you ABLE to do this - in return, if you want to farm these items for yourself or for your twinks, you should have to pay for them. Fair? Maybe not. Sensible? Yes. If the items off of these lesser mobs are now trivial for someone's main character, they should have to spend points to grant it to an alternate character or a twink.
<p>
There is a direct correlation between the "uberness" of a character and his or her amount of unspent DKP - if they have a lot saved up, it usually means they are currently wearing most of the best items for their class already if they are not spending points like mad to upgrade their equipment. At any given time, you can probably tell who the newer members of a guild are simply based on their DKP points - usually, when someone joins a heavy raiding guild, they do a lot of spending right off the bat to try and compensate for their gear that is often inferior in comparison to that of their class peers.
<p>
The other side of the coin must be examined as well to grasp the full scope of this dilemma. Why should raids organized by a few guilded friends looking for something to do be subject to the DKP system of that particular guild? If they take the time to organize the raid and get the necessary people there to accomplish the kill, why should they have to pay for items that drop? The sensible person would say don't let anyone outside of the raid know what is going on, but as we all know, people talk, and I suspect the information would eventually be divulged to the powers that be, and the DKP penalties would be appropriately inflicted. Some would argue that what people choose to do in their free time is their decision and should not be examined and taxed by the officers and decision makers of the guild. There is a valid point in this theory, one that has many people who have been the victims of this procedure up in arms about the restrictions it imposes on what players choose to do outside of an organized guild event.
<p>
There's quite a significant economic analogy that exists in this philosophy when compared to the economy of America. Everyone who knows anything about taxes knows that people who make more money are taxed at a higher rate. Different tax brackets exist because 25% of a $20,000/year salary is significantly more than 25% of a $200,000/year salary - certain checks and balances exist in order to keep it "fair" when it comes to income in America's market.
<p>
Perhaps a solution exists that would allow prices for items to be inflated based on the amount of unspent DKP the player has. If that person has more to spend, perhaps they can afford to pay a little bit more than the person who doesn't have as much to spend for the same item. This would certainly mirror what we do in society today in order to keep the cost of living affordable for those who don't have the luxury of wealth.
<p>
We have no IRS in EverQuest. There aren't tax brackets based on platinum. Unfortunately, without an established system to monitor and appropriately tax the hoarders, the rich will just continue to get richer.
