<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
Randi gathered the wet linens into her apron. She crossed the yard to the clotheslines that she and Airlia had tied between the two big oak trees in their yard. As she walked by the raspberry bushes she noticed there were some that were ripe and ready to pick. "I will have to gather those after I hang these up;" she thought. She laid the pile of linens on the ground and shook each piece out in the wind as she secured them to the line. When she finished she walked to the raspberry bushes and knelt down to pick up the basket they the tree that they kept there for the berries. On her knees now, she hummed to herself as she gathered the plump deep red berries. Carefully, one by one, she put them in the basket so they would not crush the ones on the bottom. The wind changed suddenly. Squinting her eyes from the sunlight, she looked at the clouds. She turned to the laundry and thought she must have been wrong to think something was amiss. It was still early in the day. It was too early for Airlia to return. Airlia was a friend of Randi's. She was more than a friend was. She was more like a sister. She was a good 17 years younger than Randi was and over a full head taller. They seemed as different as night and day to each other. Randi was a short olive skinned human girl with long black hair where Airlia was a tall fair skinned high elf with long blonde hair. Their appearance never seemed to be an issue. They were friends. They enjoyed each other's company and that is all that mattered.
<br>
<br>Airlia and Randi had been sharing a house together for over four years. Airlia just recently had been married and had moved her husband into their home as well. The home they shared had once belonged to a half elf uncle of Randi's. He had no children so he left his belongings and home to his only brother's oldest child. That was Randi. The small cottage was cramped but very comfortable. There was a great room that encompassed a table with 4 chairs, a hearth and a long table that they used to prepare food on. They slept in the loft, which had a sturdy ladder leading up to it. Since Airlia and Euclid had been married, the three shared the loft but now they had rigged up some long drapes of cloth from the ceiling so the two newly weds could have their privacy. Randi slept closest to the ladder and really did not care too much for privacy. She had been divorced six years and had no intention of every remarrying or bringing a new man to her sleeping mat. Randi had been married 3 times already and Airlia always teased her that the problem wasn't with the men, that maybe the problem was with her! The first two times she married, it was to the same man. They divorced because they were apart for most of their marriage but tried to work it out and remarried after 1 year. After a few months they went back to the same old routine and discovered that they were better off without each other so they parted ways.
<br>
<br>Randi's third marriage was an entirely different ordeal. She fell in love at first sight with a man who seemed to sweep her off her feet. He was everything she ever wanted. He was kind and generous, he was sincere and noble and he loved her. His eyes sparkled when he looked at her. She met him shortly after her divorce. After their first meeting it seemed that the two of them never separated. Where you saw one, the other was close by. They seemed made for one another. He had just recently been through a divorce, as had she. He would tell her stories far into the night in between making love. She gave everything to this man. She vowed never to love another and soon they married. It was an impromptu marriage set in the woods where the two of them were alone hunting. They stopped to camp for the night and he drew her to him, held her tight then got down on both knees. He laid his sword out before him and handed her a ring and vowed to his god, Mithaniel Marr that he would love her all his days and be true to her always. She was taken aback and cried tears of joy. There was no official ceremony but under the moonlight and beneath the tall trees that night they made a vow to each other and to his god and her goddess of their love for one another. It seemed a perfect fit. She thought nothing could ever come between them. Randi badly wanted to start a family and so did Lucian. He had two daughters from his first marriage but was hoping to have a male child to raise. They were delighted when Randi became pregnant. Their life seemed complete. Tragedy reared its ugly head four months into her pregnancy and she lost their child. She cried for days and seemed not to be comforted. Lucian withdrew and kept to himself. He started spending many hours everyday at his temple. He cursed his god for bestowing this tragedy on him. He questioned his faith. He prayed for hours at a time. Randi became more depressed and stopped caring for herself. She went unkept for days at a time, not noticed by Lucian, or if he did, he never acknowledged her. He stopped speaking to her as if it were her fault. At least that is what she was thinking. One day he returned to their home early and sat her down on the floor with him. He proceeded to explain to her that he had finally seen what the problem was that he was having. He told her that it was not because of her. He told her that he had searched deep in his soul and discovered that he no longer belonged here with her. He said he needed to go back to his children and take care of them. He told her that loosing their child made him realize how important his first two children were to him and that he needed to be with them and their mother. He stood and packed his few belongings. She was still on the floor, in tears again when he came into the room. He knelt down on both knees in front of her and laid his sword out in front of her as he had so long ago. He held her close; told her he always would love her and bowed his head. He said goodbye to her as he broke his vows to her and his god. He stayed there for what seemed forever to Randi but was only a few brief moments, and then said someday that they would meet again. He picked up his sword and turned to walk out the door. He never looked back. Randi sat on the floor until the darkness crept slowly across the floor as the sun set. Her throat hurt from crying and she was still stunned. She never spoke to him before he left now she longed to have him back to yell as loud as she could, proclaiming her love and how much she wanted him. Many days went by and it occurred to her that since they had never been officially married, she guessed they didn't need to get "officially" divorced. She too packed up a few belongings and walked out her front door. She left their home behind, never looking back and abandoning it as it stood.
<br>
<br>Randi never got over the loss of their unborn child or the loss of her beloved Lucian. She vowed never to remarry and forced herself go on. She decided to put her energy into her religion and studies. It gave her something to do and got her mind off her troubles. She traveled far and worked with different people, exploring and hunting in between her studies. Her journeys lead her to cover most of Norrath. During her travels she visited the home of her parents in Surefall Glade. That is when she found out about the house and property her uncle had left her. She stayed with her mother and father for several weeks then packed her belongings and made her way across the lands to Freeport. That is where she bought a ticket at the local port authority to take the boat across the sea. Now she knew there was no turning back.
