<p class="pageheader">Beastlord Guide
<div class="pageheaderauthor">By <a href="mailto:lilwill000@gmail.com">gunda_we</a></div>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>08-23-2004</b> - 
<p>
Introduction:
<p>
Beastlord is the second newest class to Everquest.  Primarily a pet class, it focuses on DPS (damage per second), although the Beastlord is able to perform many other roles.  Beastlord is one of the three classes that can increase mana regeneration.  Bard and Enchanter are the other two.  It’s safe to refer to a Beastlord as the “jack of all trades” class.  
<p>
Being a hybrid between Shaman and Monk, your equipment selection is rather small.  For weapons you can take your pick of 1 handed blunt, 2 handed blunt, piercing and hand to hand.  Leather armor is your only choice for protective gear.  
<p>
At level 9 you will be able to cast your first spell.  That is also when your pet, the bread and butter of this class, comes into the picture.
<p>
<p>
Creation:
<p>
Your first choice when creating a beastlord will be your race.  This is strictly preference.  There are a few advantages and disadvantages to each.  Another thing that might effect your final decision is that your pet is dependant on your race.  Example: Vah Shir, the cat race, gets a tiger as pet.  
<p>
Barbarian is a good aligned race.  A wolf would be your pet.
<p>
Strong points:<br>
-Third best melee stats of all races. <br> 
-Strong wisdom.<br>
Weak points:<br>
-No night vision.
<p>
Iksar is an evil aligned race.  A scaled wolf would be your pet.
<p>
Strong points:<br>
-Innate health regeneration, swimming, foraging and armor.<br>
-Agility.<br>
-Infra-vision
<p>
Ogre is not an evil race although they are generally disliked.  A bear would be your pet.
<p>
Strong points:<br>
-Best melee stats of all races.<br>
-Can’t be stunned from the front.<br>
-Some night vision.<br>
Weak points:<br>
-Low wisdom.
<p>
Troll is an evil aligned race.  A bear would be your pet.
<p>
Strong points:<br>
-Second best melee stats of all races.<br>
-Innate health regeneration.<br>
-Some night vision
<p>
Vah Shir is a neutral race.  A tiger would be your pet.
<p>
Strong points:<br>
-Well balanced stats.<br>
-Innate safe-fall.<br>
Weak points:<br>
-Innate hunger (will eat food faster than all other races).
<p>
Once you have selected your race, the next choice will be where to put your bonus stat points.  As a Beastlord you will receive 20 points do with which to do as you please.  It is recommended to put these points in wisdom.  Wisdom affects your mana pool which drains as you cast spells.  It is also one of the harder stats to find equipment that raises it.
<p>
Your next choice is religion.  Unless you are picking a religion for role-playing reasons, it would be best to stay Agnostic.  Religion can play a part in your faction, which can cause others to not like you.  
<p>
<p>
Alternate Advancement:
<p>
This section is dedicated to answering a few of your questions regarding AA abilities once you start getting within reach of the end game.
<p>
General Abilities:  Since you have to pick 6 of these to get to the next they need  to be addressed.  
<p>
-Run 3 will prove invaluable.  When entering an area where the casting of movement speed increasing spells is not permitted, you will thank this guide for advising you to take this ability.  <br>
-Innate Regeneration.  You can never really have enough regeneration going -- the more the better.  Considering your other choices, this may be the best.<br>
-Innate Metabolism.  Some choose to take this over Innate Regeneration.  If you are Vah Shir it would be advisable.  This ability decreases the amount of food you eat.  Stat food users will learn to love this ability also.<br>
-The rest of the abilities are merely ok.  It is recommended to go on with other abilities before coming back to these.  There shouldn’t be any rush to get them.
<p>
Melee/Priest Archetypes Abilities:  This is when the AA choices really start to open up.  There are a few goodies here that will be explained.
<p>
-Combat Agility is great for any Beastlord who plans to take hits.  This skill gives you a greater chance not to get hit at all.  <br>
-Combat Fury will give you the ability to score critical hits.  If you are looking for ways to increase your damage per second, this would be an ideal choice.<br>
-Combat Stability works somewhat like Combat Agility.  The difference is that Stability actually kicks in when you are hit, decreasing the amount of damage you take.  Combat Agility and Stability go hand in hand.<br>
-Finishing Blow is another skill that you may want to come back to later in life.  The catch here is that the majority of the mobs you will be fighting at this level are going to be out of the level range of this ability.  <br>
-Natural Durability increases your hit points with each train.  You really can’t go wrong here.  No matter how you spend your time in game, you will benefit from having more hit points.  <br>
-Natural Healing is another health regeneration increaser.  Come back for it, eventually.<br>
-Healing Adept increases the amount of health that you heal per cast.  Good for a soloing beast, as it gives more healing for less mana.<br>
-Healing Gift gives you the ability to score the occasional “Exceptional Heal," which works just like a critical.  Occasional, however, being the keyword.
<p>
Beastlord Abilities: It only gets better from this point on.
<p>
-Ambidexterity is quite the expensive choice, but it will indeed increase your damage per second.  If that is what you’re looking for, this is the ticket.<br>
-Frenzy of Spirit will turn you into a monster until it runs out.  This works like your discipline Beastial Fury, except that it's much more effective and only has a 15 minute recharge timer.  If you’re looking for damage, pick it up.  <br>
-Hobble of Spirits is a great ability.  You may perhaps want to hold off on getting it though.  The ability to snare can be great, but there are better choices.<br>
-Mend Companion is another great choice to look into.  With Mend and Hastened Mending, chosen from Planar Abilities, you will be able to nearly complete heal your pet every 9 minutes.<br>
-Paragon of Spirit should be had as soon as possible.  It gives you the ability to cast a spell, that doesn’t take mana, which will regenerate your group's mana and health over 6 ticks.  This alone can often kill the need for downtime.<br>
-Pet Discipline is like sending your warder to obedience school.  You order him to hold and he will sit and watch you die before he attacks without the command.  Very useful and should be acquired as soon as possible.<br>
-Physical Enhancement is like training Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability all at once.  If you are going that route with your Beastlord, don’t forget to pick this up.
<p>
Planar Advancement: Most of these have a pre-requirement.  For example, Lightning Reflexes requires that you have completed Combat Agility.
<p>
-Innate Defense will further decrease the amount of damage you take if hit by a melee attack.<br>
-Lightning Reflexes will further decrease the amount that you are actually hit.<br>
-Beastial Frenzy will give you the ability to double attack.  Beastlords do not get this by default like some of the other classes.  For each train it increases your damage per second even more.  If this is the route you are taking, you probably should start here.<br>
-Suspended Minion gives you the ability to put your pet in your pocket.  You can travel across an area and take him out once you get there. After your second train,  suspending him keeps his buffs intact.<br>
-Fury of Ages increases your chance to score a critical hit.  If you have Combat Fury, this will only make it better.
<p>
Gates of Discord Abilities: Many of these are just for fun.  
<p>
-Swift Journey will increase your run speed even farther after getting run speed 3.<br>
-Convalescence will increase your health and mana regeneration even more.  You need Mind and Body Rejuvenation to train this.<br>
-Weapon Affinity will increase the amount your weapons “proc”.  For a Beastlord this is something like a double edged sword.  A Proc can generate aggro -- something you may not want.<br>
-Bestial Alignment will turn you into a warder and lasts for 30 seconds.  During this time you are a little more resistant and will perform like your warder.  The more trains you take, the more damage.<br>
-Feral swipe is another fun ability.  It just adds to your array of attacks.  It has a one minute timer, and if you manage to critical with a 2 handed blunt weapon while using this, it will be a beautiful thing.<br>
-Warder Fury will increase your pet’s damage per second by giving him the ability to score critical hits.  <br>
-Warders Alacrity will give your pet the ability to flurry.  Flurry gives you an extra attack for that round of combat.<br>
-Mastery of the Past is worth at least one train, unless you managed to keep up your casting skills during that long road to 65.  Training eliminates the chance to fizzle up to the intended spell level.<br>
-Sinister strikes ability is another damage per second increaser.  By now you’ve noticed that you hit a lot weaker with your off hand.  This will give it a little more power.
<p>
A few notes on Alternate Advancement.  Taking your most common role into consideration you will probably want to go with the more health and damage avoidance oriented approach when starting out.  Paragon, MGB and Pet hold are often requirements to get into a raiding guild and with good reason.  Paragon and MGB can be used together.  If the coordination is there, you can have constant mana regeneration through the hard part of an encounter.  You can’t beat that with a stick.  Pet hold is just a no compromise.  Stray pets can often cause an entire raid to fail.  
<p>

General Tips:
<p>
-Your hand to hand skill will rise beyond any of your other attack skills, although it is best to keep them all as high as you can.  Make sure that hand to hand stays at the max for your level.<br>
-Your primary stats are going to be strength, stamina and wisdom.  These affect your damage, health and mana respectively.  When considering upgrades, keep this in mind.
<p>

Grouping Tips:
<p>
-This may be hard to remember at times but you must always keep your pet’s taunt off.  Each time you summon a pet, you will have to turn this back off.  Your pet can generate a lot of aggro.  The monster will direct that aggro towards you, not the pet.  The healer and tank of the group probably won’t appreciate this.<br>
-Spells such as slow and weaken can really draw aggro.  If possible, wait a few seconds to join the fight after casting one of these on the mob.  If resisted, make sure you’re well out of range before you try again.<br>
-At 44 you will be able to learn the spell Spiritual Light.  This spell gives you and your group increased mana and health regeneration.  The effects are somewhat minimal but every little bit counts.  Later in your life you will have access to a few other spells like this.<br>
-Know your role.  When joining an already established group don’t be afraid to ask what needs to be done.  Not knowing you’re the slower could cause disaster.<br>
-Watch for pet push.  Pet placement is a critical aspect that you will have to learn at some point.  A pet has the ability to push the mob.  It’s usually best to angle your pet toward the tank a few steps out.  That way you are pushing to the tank instead of away.  If your pet pushes the mob away from the tank and he doesn’t have firm aggro, the mob will go after whoever does.  Also, watch for walls.  Non-tank classes attack from the back.  If you’ve pushed the mob into a wall, that will take away the ability for them to do that.  
<p>

Soloing Tips:
-If the mob summons, forget it.<br>
-If the mob is immune to slow, forget it.<br>
-You will almost always want to pull the mob to you with a “slow” spell.  A mob that hits hard and fast could spell trouble if he gets to you and resists your first attempt at slowing him.  Pulling with slow will buy you time.<br>
-Know when to pull off the mob.  If you are getting low on health but your pet isn't, let him take a beating for a few.  Your pet heals are a lot more efficient then your regular heals.  It may not even be necessary to join the fight if it’s possible for you to keep your pet healed.  Sit back and gain some mana.
<p>

Raiding Tips:
	<p>
-Don’t be afraid to ask your class leader or raid leader what to do.  A common mistake is using your MGB up before the encounter.  More often than not a raid leader will want you to save that so that you can have it ready to Paragon the raid at the designated time.<br>
-Make sure pets are allowed before you summon one.  Pets are not always welcome for several reasons.  Don’t worry though; you still have more to contribute.
