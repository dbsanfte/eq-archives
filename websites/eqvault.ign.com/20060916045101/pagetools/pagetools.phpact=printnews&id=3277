Well <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=38&category_select_id=4">here it is</a>.  Here's a clip:<blockquote>For the past couple months I’ve been playing a lot of EQ2. While my characters have not reached high levels, I have had the opportunity to learn the basics. As of the end of beta I had a level 22 Ranger and 14 Warrior. I’m writing this article mostly due to all the threads I’ve seen on various boards (including our own) comparing EQ to EQ2. They are very different games – aimed at very different types of players. While there is a chance you’re like me, and can enjoy both, many people will greatly enjoy one and not the other.</blockquote><br>If you want to call me an idoit, flame me, etc, just click "Post a comment" up top!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 8 November, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3277">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3277</a><br>Printed On: Fri Sep 15 21:51:01 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
