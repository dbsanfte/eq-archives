<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
The Age of Reason
<br>
<br>
<br>I've been around MMOG's for a while. I started out in online games playing Legend of the Red Dragon and Falcon's Eye, back when 9600 baud was a fast modem and you had to figure out connection protocols. I played MajorMUD when MajorMUD was basically nothing more than a couple of college computer geeks fulfilling their own D&D fantasy. Graphics consisted of colored alphanumeric characters called ANSI. Or something like that. That was epochs ago in computer years, and I have a hard time remembering much of it, seeing as I spent most of it in a caffeine, sleep-deprived stupor as I pursued a few people through imagined caves and castles over the internet to prove that I really was better at hitting the right keys at the right time than they were.
<br>
<br>I gave up virtually every other game to play EverQuest. I even talked some friends and family into joining me. I logged in the first day it was open and was stunned. Here was every boyhood fantasy about fantasy RPGs come true; a 3-D graphical world in which my 3-D graphical avatar lived. Unbelievable. For three years I played the game as much as work, family, and other obligations allowed. I took an interest in the direction of the game and of the MMOG industry as a genre. It was interesting to note, from reading board after board, how many different views there were about how such games should be constructed. People are very passionate about their hobbies, and that passion is less fettered by social restrictions on the internet. The internet subculture of personality surrounding the games became as interesting - if not more so - than the games themselves. There was drama, intrigue, outrage, and ... well, it was soap opera-ish. It seems to be less melodramatic these days, which is a good thing. Back then, it was the age of Lum the Mad and Tweety, and if you weren't ranting, or banning, or screaming at the top of your lungs, you were ignored.
<br>
<br>However, while that was entertaining, and even fun, in my opinion it ultimately did more harm than good, because it set a precedent of low tolerance and an acceptance of visceral attacks based on personality, with no real protection of viewpoint or debate. It wasn't as conducive as it could be to drawing out the discourse the industry could really use; in fact, it tended to ridicule and shut up those that weren't in intimate agreement with those in control of the boards.
<br>
<br>It's important to understand that people can disagree with you and it not be an insult. There are things about EverQuest I thought were just flat-out wrong, but that doesn't for a second diminish my respect for what they - the people at SOE - accomplished. I felt PoP was a mistake and harmed the overall good of EverQuest; but that doesn't mean I think that all the employees of SOE are all (insert invective insults here). Disagreement is not personal attack or an indictment against everything a person or company ever does; disagreement is the vehicle by which understanding, improvement, and progress is accomplished by diverse groups with different opinions. I disagree with SOE on some things, but I love the guys and the company for giving us EQ. Make no mistake about it, I'm a big fan of SOE and EQ, but that doesn't mean I think they walk on water and never make a mistake.
<br>
<br>One thing I currently disagree with is the potential inclusion in EQII of a death penalty of losing a random item, or forcing a choice of items to sacrifice. While I think it's a good option to include, I think the player should also have the choice of taking a big exp-debt hit, and perhaps some temporary stat reductions. I don't think it should be "loss of an item or wait for a rez". I can explain why I hold this position, but I think it's more important at this point to state that because I have it, doesn't mean it's that big a deal to me, and doesn't mean I think everyone else's view is wrong. I won't threaten not to buy EQ unless my demand is met; I don't claim that my opinion is the best way to go ... I'm capable of changing my mind. Also, the game isn't finalized now, and some might feel it is premature to debate such things when we don't even know how it's going to be implemented in the game.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, debate about such things now is a good thing, even if we're off-base or misinformed, because it gives the devs a chance to see (if they are listening) how people feel about it, and see out-of-house discussions about it that might give them ideas or new ways of looking at it. They might realize that they haven't really thought through all the consequences of their design decisions. Sometimes, when you're programming a game, you lose sight of the broader implications of your design, and fresh perspective might bring it into focus. And ... what the heck? We gotta do something to keep from clawing our eyes out before EQII goes live.
<br>
<br>That's what this column is about; generating discussion about topics that might prove useful to the developers at SOE - or other game companies, and making an effort at keeping that discussion civil and respectful. Perhaps Rants are fun to read, and entertaining, but they foster an atmosphere of attack and defense, which isn't, in my opinion, the best way to promote a free flow of ideas. Maybe the Age of the Rant is over in the MMOG fan site culture. Perhaps it's the dawn of the Age of Reason.
<br>
<br>Let's be civil out there.
