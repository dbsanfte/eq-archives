Wednesday we had a new Omens epic riddle.  Thursday we had some new, <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=148">high resolution artwork</a> of the Rogue epic and the answer to Wednesdays riddle, plus yet another riddle!  Finally on Friday I posted the answer to the riddle.<br><br>On the news front, Monday the Omens of War NDA was lifted.  Tuesday Omens launched officially, and to aid players in that launch SOE posted the <a href="http://vaultnap.ign.com/index.php?act=sites&sid=64&mod=submitnews">PDF Manual</a> Wednesday.   Thursday brought a whole load of EQ Live updates including renamed spells, news on finding Omens to buy, and how to fix patching difficulties.  Last but not least, Friday brought some news about a Warrior AA being refunded. <br><br>Be sure to get your entries in for the contest! Only about 48 hours to go.
