<p class="pageheader">Ranger: A Beginner's Guide
<div class="pageheaderauthor">By <a href="mailto:">Dana Moreland</a></div>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-11-2004</b> - 
First, the reason for this guide. After having read many other guides I find all of them lacking in some way for the truly new Everquest player. This guide is an effort to give the new Everquest player what he needs to have fun for the first month or so of gameplay. After that you will have a better idea of what you would like to do yourself and you won't need someone else telling you what to do. Because I believe the Ranger class is the easiest class for the new Everquest player, this is also a good beginning Ranger Guide.
<P>
The first thing you will do is choose your Race, Class and God. You want to be a Half-elf Ranger worshiping Karana. Why? Three reasons: First, as a Half-elf you get infravision. It is annoying to play a human at night. Either you need a light source or you can't see at night, especially in the dark tunnels. With infravision you will hardly notice the difference between day and night. Second, as a Ranger you get tracking. This is the best skill in the game for a new player. With one key press you get a list of every creature within range of you and how tough they are. And finally, by worshiping Karana, the rain god, you get to start in Surefall Glade, the best place for a new player to start. It is small, quiet and safe. You don't need a map to find your way around, you will be one of the only players in the Glade, so your message window will not be filled with "spam" and you can always just sit down beside your guild master to rest in perfect safety. After choosing your race and class you will have 20 "extra" points to put into your starting attributes. I suggest you put 10 points into wisdom to bring your total to 75 (the minimum needed to succeed with your spells) and 10 points into dexterity to bring your total to 95 (needed to excel at your second best ability, archery). For more about rangers and tracking see note 1 at the end of this article.
<P>
Now once you enter the game you will start in the ranger's guild. Look at your inventory (hit the "I" key). Notice you have a sword and a note. Left click on the sword to select it and put it into your "hand" space. To read the note right click on it. Now go outside (left click on the door to open it) to the archery practice field (over the little bridge and around to the right) to find your guild master. Give him the note (left click on the note, then click the note on him). He will give you a tunic (put it on) and tell you who your trainer is. Go to your trainer (he is at the fire between the ranger's guild and the archery field). Right click on him and select the skills you want to be trained in. Train at least one point in 1H slash and one point in Tracking. Choose other skills that look interesting (like fishing) or just put the last three into 1H slash. Don't worry, you will get 5 more "points" every level so if you miss something now you will get a chance to train for it later. Tracking is your most important skill but you only need one point to get it (and all of your other skills) started. All of your skills will increase as you use them (and you will use tracking a lot).
<P>
Before I go any further there is one thing you need to do. The various Everquest commands have "short cut" keys that they have been mapped to. One of the most important that you will use all of the time is the auto attack key. This key is defaulted as the "A" key. You should remap it to another key that you will not be using to type any messages (like the "=" key). You can do this by selecting the options button from the window selection. Just go through the list of commands and select the auto attack command, then hit the new key you want to use for it.
<P>
<B>Level 1-2</B>
<P>
Now follow the path leading away from the ranger's guild to the right around the cliff and into the tunnel. This is where you will like having a half-elf instead of a human. At night this tunnel gets so dark you cannot see a thing, if you are a human. As a Half-elf you will hardly notice any difference. About 80% of the way through the tunnel you will "zone" to Qeynos Hills. Your screen will freeze. Don't panic, your computer is just loading all of the info for the new area. When it finishes just keep going until you are at the other end of the tunnel. Step just outside the exit and have a look around.
<P>
Qeynos Hills is your happy hunting ground for at least your first 5 levels. The two guards at the entrance are your friends. If you get into trouble just run back to the tunnel entrance and they will take care of any monsters that are chasing you. To find the location of the tunnel entrance, just type /loc. Remember this number; write it down. Now set up tracking as one of your hot keys (in the window with the four tabs, select the skills tab, click on a number and select tracking) and click on it. Notice the list of things that came up on the tracking screen. At the bottom of the screen select the "range" option for the sort order. Each creature within your tracking range will show up on this screen color coded by how tough they are for you and sorted in the order of distance from you. Red are the toughest (don't mess with these), then yellow (very risky), white (an even fight, these are the ones you will be fighting most of the time). Because you are only first level nothing will show up blue (easier, you should win) or green (a cake walk) yet. The best creatures to attack now are Snakes and Skeletons. There are different versions of each of these creatures so be sure you are only tracking the white ones. Click on one of them and then click on the track button and you will start getting messages telling you which direction your victim is in. Turn (hit the right or left arrow keys) until your messages say your victim is straight ahead, then start running (hit the up arrow key) until you see it.
<P>
Now right click on the thing you see to be sure it is the same thing you are tracking. Then left click on it to target it, hit your auto attack key, then move until you are right next to your victim. If you are attacking snakes (or other low creatures) you should hit the page down (3 on the number pad) key to "look down" at your victim so you can see him. Once the music starts and you see the attack messages, the fight is on. Watch your health bar. As soon as it gets down to 60% (two of the 5 "bubbles") look at your victim's health. If it is down further than yours you are doing fine, just sit there and enjoy the battle. If it has not moved very much (still shows 80-100%, only down one "bubble", then it is time to run. If you used "Page Down", hit the 5 key on the number pad to look straight ahead. Turn around until you can see the cliff face, the tunnel entrance and your two friendly guards. Run for the tunnel entrance. Keep running until you are just inside the entrance. Then turn around. If you are lucky you will see your two friends kill your victim for you.
<P>
If you win the fight, you get to loot the body. Right click on the corpse, then right click on the items. The best ones are the snake jaws and poison sacks, and the skeleton tibias. Try to concentrate on only two types of victims because you can only carry 6 different kinds of loot at this time. Now click on done and then go back to the tunnel entrance.
<P>
Now weather you won or lost your battle, rest at the tunnel entrance until your health is 100% and then repeat the above hunting directions. Never go too far from the tunnel entrance and the guards. Always start by using your track ability to find the snakes and skeletons you want to kill. Keep this up until you cannot carry anything else or until you have reached level three, or until you have had enough for one night. When you are done go back through the tunnel into Surefall Glade and camp for the night. In order to leave the game, click on the sit button, then on the camp button. After 30 seconds you will leave the game. When you restart Everquest and reenter the game you will appear in this exact location to start your next game play session.
<P>
When you need to sell your loot, go into the ranger's guild and enter the room to the right. Behind the counter there are three merchants. Right click on the middle one and sell your loot by clicking the item and then on the sell button. Notice that there is a number next to most of the items you looted. These are "stackable" items. You can have up to 20 of one item type per "box" in your inventory if they are stackable. If they are not stackable then each item will take up one box. That is why you wanted to kill only snakes and skeletons and take only the poison sacks, jawbones and tibias. You should get about 2gp for each one of these items. When you are done you will want to buy at least two backpacks, but no more than 4, so you can carry more than 6 different things the next time you go hunting.
<P>
<B>Level 3-4</B>
<P>
Once you reach level three you are ready to become an archer. Start by going back to your trainer and put one point into archery and one point into fletching. Go to the ranger's guild merchant and buy a quiver. Now go over to the archery range and see Jarse Kedison. Right click on him and buy a fletching kit, for about 1pp. Then buy three bundles (20 items per bundle) of each of the four parts of an arrow: points, shafts, fletchings, and nocks. Buy the cheapest one of each type: field, wood, round and large. They should cost about 6 cp each. Now find a nice quiet spot and sit down. You are going to practice making arrows. Open (right click) on your fletching kit, your backpack and your quiver. Put one bundle (20 items) of each arrow part into the top four slots of your backpack (while holding down the shift key, click on one of your arrow parts, then put them into one box of your "open" backpack). Now while holding down the Ctrl key, click on one arrow part and move it into your fletching kit. Repeat for the other three parts. Be sure you have one (and only one) of each arrow part in the fletching kit. Now hit combine. If you are lucky your pointer just turned into 5 arrows. If not don't worry, it will eventually. If it worked, put your new arrows into your ammo slot and repeat the process. Yes you are going to do this at least 60 times. Once your ammo slot is full (has 20 arrows in it) start putting your arrows into your quiver. Also notice that every once in a while you will get a message that your fletching skill has gone up. You want to keep doing this until your skill gets to 16. If you need to buy another set of arrow parts do so and keep making arrows until your fletching skill equals 16. Once it reaches 16 however, stop making arrows. It is time to make a bow.
<P>
Now go into the ranger's guild and see Tonsia and buy a hickory staff and a piece of hemp string. Put these into your fletching kit, hit combine and you should have a brand new bow. If not try again. Put the bow into the bow box of your inventory. Once you have a quiver full of arrows and a new bow it is time to go hunting. One last note on arrow and bow making. If you should run out of money before completing the process (fletching skill 16 and a completed bow) return to Qeynos Hills and kill a few more snakes and skeletons. However, if all you killed and collected was the items I mentioned above you should not need to. For more about fletching, see note 2 at the end of this article
<P>
Before you leave Surefall Glade go back to your trainer and put one point into foraging. Until now you have been eating (bread) and drinking (water) automatically. You start the game with 20 "units" of each item and you use about one item of each per game day. Eventually you will run out of them and start to get hungry and thirsty. One of the ways you can cure this is to forage for food and water. Put forage on a hot key like you did tracking and every time you see that you can, hit it. Your forage skill will increase very slowly (compared with your other skills, like fletching) and you won't have much success for a while, but eventually you will be able to feed yourself for free. If you have any "extra" training points you may want to put some of them into foraging to help it along.
<P>
Go back out into Qeynos Hills, and track as before, but now you can track anything that shows blue or white. Don't bother with anything that shows green because they are so easy that you will get little if any experience for killing them. And do not hunt wolves and bears; they are your friends. I would also stay away from Gnoll pups. You can handle them but if you start killing them now they will start attacking you without warning. You don't need someone beating on your back when you are tying to kill that skeleton. When you have tracked your victim within sight, instead of walking up to it, you are now going to shoot it with your new bow and arrows. Click on the range attack button (on your attack screen) and you will shoot an arrow at your victim. Now for the fun part. As soon as you shoot, hit the down arrow key and start backing up. When your range attack button comes back up, hit it again. You should be able to get off 2-3 shots before your victim closes the range and starts to attack you. Now hit your auto attack key and enjoy the fact that you start the fight with your victim already wounded. If your victim tries to run away before you have a chance to kill him: turn off auto attack (hit your auto attack key again), follow him at a safe distance and shoot him with your bow to finish him off. By using both your bow and sword in every fight you should advance both skills nicely.
<P>
Continue to hunt at the "north end" of Qeynos Hills, killing anything that shows white or blue until you get to level 5. You can go a little further from the guards, just stay near the road so you don't get lost. Do not go over the hill to the "east side" of Qeynos hills. There lies death at the hands of some very big skeletons and Gnolls. Stay within sight of the cliff face. If you do get lost, first try tracking the guards. If they show on your list, just track back to them. If they are too far away to track, then use the /loc command and get back to the guards that way. You did write down the location of the guards didn't you?
<P>
If you run out of arrows then go back to Jarse Kedison in Surefall Glade and buy a new set of arrow parts, but this time use the medium nocks. Combine them as before and keep making this type of arrow until your fletching skill gets to 36. Continue to sell you victim's parts to the merchant in the ranger's guild each time you come back to Surefall Glade. Note how much the different parts sell for and concentrate on killing and looting the best things (stackable items that sell for at least 2gp each).
<P>
<B>Level 5-6</B>
<P>
Now once you get to level 5 it is time for your quest to begin. Go to Errin Pinewhisper in the ranger's guild. Left click on him and type /hail. He will say something to you with a couple of words in brackets []. Answer him using these key words and he will tell you about the pine scout armor quest. Ask about each armor item and write down the ingredients. Take the box he gives you and put the armor templates he gives you into it for now. Now go to your trainer and train one point in kick. To use it set up a hot key for it similar to what you did for tracking and foraging except this time put it under the attack tab. Whenever you are in melee with a creature click on kick. You will get an extra attack every 2-3 swings. Every little bit helps. Finally make up a fresh batch of arrows as before but this time using parabolic fletchings, then head back out to Qeynos Hills.
<P>
Now that you are level 5 you can hunt anywhere along the road in Qeynos hills. You are going to travel to the middle of Qeynos hills to the little house. Just follow the road south from the tunnel until you can see the house. Notice that there are two guards here as well. Now do a /loc and write done the numbers. This will be your home for a while. Now get out that ingredient list and look for the large/giant field rats and the large/giant whiskered bats. These are your new victims. Start hunting them. Remember only hunt them if they show white or blue. The one exception is a rat or bat that you need that shows yellow IF you find him close to the house/road and your weapon skills are 30+ and you are feeling lucky. If you can get 3 good bowshots and a couple more good hits with your sword and kick before your victim starts pounding on you, you might win vs. a yellow creature. But if your victim is not almost dead when you get down to 50%, health run for the house and the guards. These are big creatures and it will take more than one hit for the guards to finish them off.
<P>
By the way if you die at anytime before you reach level 10 don't worry. You will be "resurrected" with all of your stuff at the north end of Qeynos Hills. That is one of the good things about being a new player. There is no penalty for dieing until you reach level 10. But you want to get into the habit of not dieing now because it can be a real pain later.
<P>
Now whenever you get all of your rat and bat items or you reach level 6 or you get tired of Qeynos Hills you will need to get those 17 silk threads. You will make them from 34 spiderling silks. The easiest place I have found to get spiderling silk is Toxxulia Forest. It is a little trip but you are up to it. Keep heading south (away from Surefall Glade) along the Qeynos Hills road until you "zone" into North Qeynos. Keep following the road into the city. Now Qeynos can be very confusing but we are only interested in going to the docks for now. Once you enter the city "keep your right hand on the wall". What I mean by that is if you can turn right, do so. Keep following the path. If the path turns keep following it but if you can go left/straight/right, go right. Eventually you will come to a dock. Now check what time it is: type /time. You want to be on the dock at 8am. I don't know what other times the ship comes (if at all) but I have always caught it at 8am (game time). When the ship arrives just walk out along the dock and onto the ship. After a few minutes the ship will leave and you will see the city of Qeynos fade into the distance. After another few minutes you will "zone" into Erudin Crossing, and then into Erudin. When the floating dock comes out to meet the ship in Erudin get onto it. Wait for it to return to the dock. Then walk off of the dock and onto the wood pier. Now walk around and explore. You will find a "transporter" platform that will take you to Erudin proper. You will see a sign that says welcome to Erudin. Step off of the platform and turn right. Follow the path around to the right again keeping your right hand on the wall just like before until you enter a tunnel and "zone" into Toxxulia Forest.
<P>
Do a /loc. Write down the number. Also note that the "guards" here are called sentinels. Use the same methods as before to get back to your safe spot if you get lost (and you will). Now Toxxulia Forest is not Qeynos Hills. It is a dark and confusing forest. This is where your tracking skill will really shine. Start tracking widow hatchlings and spiderlings. Notice that they both show green or blue. This means that they will be very easy to kill. Notice also that almost everything else shows green or blue. This means that you have little to fear from anything in the forest. This is good because almost everything in here hates you. They will attack you if you get too close to them so don't walk up next to anything other than the 'lings that you are after. The hatchlings and spiderlings will drop between 0 and 6 spiderling silks each. So it should not take you very long to collect your 34 silks. If you are attacked by a "stranger" right click on it. If it shows green or blue and you feel like it kill it. If not run back to the tunnel entrance. You may have to "zone" back to Erudin to avoid your attacker. The sentinels are not as nice about killing your attackers as the guards in Qeynos Hills were. After all you are the stranger here. One more thing, if a poacher attacks you, you will want to kill him and save his head. You can return it to Gillarian Naelev in Surefall Glade for some experience and other benefits.
<P>
Now that you have your spiderling silk it is time to head back to Qeynos hills. Go back through the tunnel into Erudin and again keep your right hand on the wall. You will find a teleport platform in the "north east" corner of Erudin that will take you back to the dock. Again check the time and wait on the floating dock until the boat shows up. Enjoy the ride back to Qeynos. To get back to Qeynos hills keep you left hand on the wall this time and you will find the city exit and the road to Qeynos Hills. On your way you will want to stop at Fhara's Leather and Thread and buy a small sewing kit from Fhara Sernhart. As soon as you exit the dock you will turn left. The first small building you come to is Fhara's. Once you get back to Qeynos hills hunt there near the house until you are level 7, then head back home to Surefall Glade. For more information about Qeynos and Erudin see note 3 at the end of this article.
<P>
<B>Level 7-8</B>
<P>
Now it is time to complete the quest. First go to your trainer and train one point in tailoring. Now make the silk thread by putting two spiderling silks into the small sewing kit (in two separate boxes, don't stack them) and combining them (just like you made all those arrows). Repeat the process until you have 17 threads. Now take all of your quest items and organize them in a bag or two so you are ready to make each piece of armor as soon as you get the ruined gnoll chain piece you need to complete each one. Also don't forget to make a new batch of arrows. This time use med nocks and parabolic fletchings. This will give you longer ranged arrows so you can start hitting your victims even further away. If you collected some poacher heads don't forget to give them to Gillarian Naelev in the ranger's guild. For more about quests see note 4 at the end of this article.
<P>
If you have not collected all of the items you need for your armor don't give up. After having killed so many rats and bats you will have noticed that some of the items are NO DROP. This means that the person who looted that item is the only one that can use it. You cannot sell it, traded it, or even drop it. The only way to get rid of it is to destroy it. The NO DROP items that you need are the only ones that you must get for yourself. The rest you can buy from the merchants or even from other players. So if you are missing something look for it at the merchants in the house in Qeynos Hills and the ranger's guild in Surefall Glade.
<P>
Now go back out into Qeynos Hills and find a group. You will need help with the gnolls. You want the big ones because they are the ones with the armor. The little pups will not have any. Do a /who and see who else is around. Look for warriors, paladins, clerics, druids and rangers level 5-10. Ideally you want 2 warriors, a paladin, a cleric, and a druid (you are the ranger), but you will have to take what you can get. You can also see who is in Surefall Glade and North/South Qeynos by typing /who all 5 10. You will get a list of everyone in the game who is level 5-10 and where they are. Then use /tell [their name] to ask them if they would like to help you kill gnolls in blackburrow. Tell them that they can have any treasure the gnolls have, but you get the ruined gnoll chain armor parts. Have everyone meet you at the house in the middle of Qeynos Hills. To invite the others to join you left click on them then click the invite button on your group window.
<P>
To get to Blackburrow from the house, head north east to loc 3200,-1000. Go into the cave entrance in the cliff face. Blackburrow is an "open" three level dungeon. The first level is a clearing with a "hole" in the center. Gnolls will "spawn" (appear out of thin air) all around the clearing. Most of the higher level ones are on level two and three but for now start with the ones on level one. Tell your group to stay near you, near the cave entrance, with the warriors in the front with you and the clerics and druids behind you.. Target one of the "Gnolls" on the far side of the clearing with your bow and start shooting. He will run around the hole, gathering one or two of his friends and run toward you. Keep shooting until they come to you. Have the warriors take them on in hand-to-hand and have the clerics and druids heal the warriors. If needed you can step in with your sword and help finish off the Gnolls. If any of the Gnolls starts to run away have a druid cast snare on it and you arrow it to death. If things get too tough, (someone falls below 40% health) run for exit (that is why you stayed near the cave entrance). Go into the tunnel and "zone" back to Qeynos Hills, the Gnolls will not follow you into the next zone. Stay in the tunnel until you have a chance to heal up then go back into Blackburrow. Be very alert when first entering Blackburrow, especially if you see another group of players sitting around in the tunnel. There may be many Gnolls at the entrance that have been "trained" to the exit by the last group that got into trouble. And if you see the message "train" while in Blackburrow, be on the alert. It means that someone is leading a group of Gnolls toward the exit from the levels below. This is what you want if there are not too many of them and there are enough of you. Watch for them to appear across the clearing from you, target one of them and start shooting. Enter the fight the same way as before but watch you health closely. With a lot of Gnoll guards, commanders and shamans you can get hurt very quickly. Again if things get rough just run back into the tunnel and zone.
<P>
As soon as you kill a gnoll (or group of gnolls) and the area is quiet, loot the gnolls and take any ruined chain armor they have. Let the others have the rest. The next time you have to zone back to Qeynos Hills to rest, take the ruined armor piece and the other ingredients and put them in the quest box and combine them to make your new piece of armor. Soon you will look very cool in your complete set of pine scout armor.
<P>
<B>Level 9 and beyond</B>
<P>
At this point you are no longer a newbie. You should have finished your quest (and have the armor to prove it), have excelled in fighting (archery), your unique skill (tracking) and a useful trade skill (fletching). Now you get to start using magic. Go back to your trainer in Surefall Glade and train one point each in Abjuration, Alteration, Divination, and Evocation (four of the five spell types, you won't need the last one Conjuration) and Channeling (the "core" skill for magic users). Go to the merchants in the ranger's guild and buy the following set of level 9 ranger spells: Endure Fire, Flame Lick, Glimpse, Minor Healing, Skin Like Wood and Snare. Write them into your spell book and memorize them. Go outside and start practicing them. Throw the helpful ones (Endure Fire, Glimpse, Minor Healing and Skin Like Wood) on yourself and any other new rangers (level 1-5) running around the North end of Qeynos hills. Remember when you were a new ranger and how much you liked it when someone healed you or made your skin like wood? Now you can return the favor. Practice using Snare and Flame Lick on the lower level (green and blue) creatures. Slow them down with Snare then cast Flame Lick, then run away from them. Or Snare a creature and then shoot it while running backwards.
<P>
What you do from here is up to you. You can go back to Blackburrow and hunt some more Gnolls, this time trying the second and third levels of the "dungeon". You can hunt lions and spiders in West Karana where you can use all of your ranger skills to their fullest. You can explore Qeynos. Talk to the merchants and NPCs and see what kind of quests they would like you to do. You can take up another trade skill like baking or brewing where you can use all those things you have been foraging. You can talk to the rangers and druids in Surefall Glade. Many of them have other quests that you can perform now, including the "follow on" quest from Errin Pinewhisper, where you can get the Pine Scout Sword to match your armor. You are also now experienced enough to start on the first of the ranger only quests, the trueshot longbow. It will take you to another continent before you are finished but this is a great way to see the world with a purpose. See note 5 below for more about the trueshoot longbow quest.
<P>
Or you can start a brand new character. Now that you have seen a little of the Everquest world through the eyes of an easy to play character you might want the challenge of a pure magic user, or the intrigue of a rogue or the raw killing power a pure warrior. It is up to you. Have fun and if you every need any help look for me on The Seventh Hammer.

<B>Notes:</B>
<P>
1. THE reason for playing a ranger is the tracking skill. Only three classes get this skill and no one else gets it at level one (druids get it at level 20 and bards at level 35). This is the most useful skill for the new player because it does so much with only one key press. Frankly I don't see how any other class ever finds anything they want without tracking. One of the things you may want to do is offer to help other players track down the creatures and NPCs they are looking for. You can group with a warrior, tell him to follow you, lead him to within bow range of the thing they are hunting, fire off one of your arrows to draw it to you, then let them bash it to death. You get a share of the experience for using your unique skill without the risk of having to fight hand-to-hand.<BR>
2. For everything you ever wanted to know about fletching see the web site: http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/. This is absolutely the best guide to fletching. As a ranger you should become at least a master fletcher (fletching skill = 100), if for no other reason than to make yourself a decent bow and keep yourself stocked with arrows (much better and cheaper than anything you can get from a merchant).<BR>
3. If you have any trouble finding your way around Qeynos or Erudin, or you just want to explore them (or anywhere else for that mater) without getting lost, see the web site: http://www.eqatlas.com/. This site has the best set of maps of Everquest I have found.
4. The reason I chose the Pine Scout Armor quest is because there is a similar armor quest for just about every race/class/god combination in Everquest. All of these quests can be completed by "newbie" characters, level 5-9. This will give the new character something to do during their formation years and they will have a set of magical armor that is better than anything they can typically afford at this point (level 9) when they are done. Also each of these armor quests has a "follow on" weapon quest resulting in a good class specific magic weapon. Notice that all of these items are no drop (you cannot give or sell them to another NPC or PC, they belong to you and you alone), Lore (you can have only one of each of them, so don't loose it) and Magic (effective vs "magic only" creatures). Not a bad start for a level 9 character.<BR>
5. The Trueshoot Longbow is an involved quest and the first "major" quest for a ranger. If you are careful you can accomplish this quest while still only level 9. For a "walkthrough" of this quest see the web site: <a href="http://www.eqrangers.com" target="_new">http://www.eqrangers.com/</a>One of the hardest parts of this quest will simply be getting to Freeport. You will have to run all the way across the continent from Qeynos to Freeport. It is a long way, crossing no less than 7 'zones' including two very dangerous ones. Once you are in Freeport the rest will be easy by comparison. The last part of the quest is the actual making of the bow. The higher your fletching skill the better chance you will have to make the bow but plan on many failures. I would suggest you have a fletching skill of at least 150 and enough 'parts' for at least 20 tries before you get to Kelethin. You don't want to go all the way back to Freeport and start the quest all over again just because you only had enough parts for one try. Just like with the other bows and arrows you made there is a chance that you will 'lack the skill to fashion the components into something useful'.
