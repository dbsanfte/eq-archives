 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Povar Guilds</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Povar Guild List!<br>
  </font></strong>Updated on August 2, 2005
<p>Complied, not by a bot, but by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! I would especially like
  guild leader names and recruiting officer names to list for each guild.</p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.theaoa.com/Forums/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>Arbiters
of the Apocolypse</strong></a><br>
No posted recruiting information. Website appears under construction.
<p><a href="http://www.bladesoflaw.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Blades of Law</strong></a><br>
&quot;Blades of Law...a people oriented
  guild, but
we enjoy raiding together and progressing. So long as I am able to type, so long
  as there are servers to log into, so long as Norrath winds on her digital journey
  around her sun, and Luclin shines brightly in the skies, Blades of Law will
  be around to wield the Dagger of Loyalty, the Sword of Honor, the Axe of Justice,
  and the Scythe of Duty, that the values we hold most dear not ever be extinguished
from this world. 
<p>Blades of Law is a non-mandatory raiding guild. We believe that our members
  are more important and of greater significance to our defining characteristics
  than the speed at which we progress or how fast and how uber loot is obtained.<br>
  <br>
  That said, we are still looking to attract people who are both willing and
  able to raid and contribute to the guilds overall goals.  
<p>Blades of Law raids nightly regularly starting at around 6:30 - 7:00PM EST
  and continuing until about 11PM We are currently regularly raiding in Time,
  God and working into Anguish with due diligence. Required expansions at this
  time include PoP, Gates of Discord, Omens of War, and Dragons of Norrath. <br>
  <br>
  If you believe you would be a good fit for BoL or have questions or comments
  send a tell to Senthiele online.</p>
<p>I- We are looking for someone who is a strong player; someone who has good
  knowledge of his/her class and a general strength in game knowledge and ability.
  We are not a guild that constantly berates it's members or uses excessive vulgarity
  in guild chat. If these are things you enjoy, save the time and look elsewhere. <br>
  II - We are seeking someone with a good connection. The locations in which
  we are currently raiding require a great deal of stability. <br>
  III - We do not backflag for PoP zones with the ease at which access is granted
  for PoTime these days. We would prefer that applicants be at least Kod Taz
  flagged, but we are also willing to invest in good people ad encourage you
  to apply anyway if you feel BoL would be a good fit. <br>
  IV - We would like to see some significant AA's also, but there is no set in
  stone number. If your class is listed as low or no need, but you feel you are
  an exceptional applicant, we still encourage you to apply. <br>
Class needs at the moment are as follows: <br>
High Need: DRU, CLR, ENC<br>
Moderate Need: BRD, MAG, SHM, WIZ, ROG<br>
Low need: MNK, RNG<br>
Little to no need: BST, BER, PAL, SK, WAR, NEC.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://catalysts.melnibone.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Catalysts</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Catalysts is an EQ guild on Povar focused on raiding
  and maintaining a &quot;
  laid back&quot; and friendly atmosphere. We are dedicated to raiding and guild
  progression with an easy to manage schedule. &quot;Catalysts&quot; will
  have constant and steady progression on what we can raid and how effectively
  we accomplish those raids, but without the hardcore raid attendance requirements
  of other large raiding guilds. Along with progression, our primary focus will
  be creating a community that our members find fun and rewarding to be a part
  of. We will have goals that our members can work on every time they log
  on and hopefully give everyone a sense of accomplishment
every time they play.</p>
<p>I. GENERAL CONDUCT<br>
  1. Members of &quot;Catalysts&quot; are expected to always
  have a fun loving and easy going attitude.<br>
2. Members of &quot;Catalysts&quot; have a strong will and
are not easily discouraged.<br>
3. You will be expected to put the needs of your guildmembers above
anyone else's in-game.<br>
4. Treat others how you would want to be treated.<br>
5. Always be respectful in /guildsay
and the forums.<br>
6. Never Kill Steal, Spam, Ninja Loot, or break any other SOE
rules of conduct.<br>
7. All characters must be either in &quot;Catalysts&quot; or left un-guilded.
  Alts under 55 can be in Royal Order of Norrath. You can not have characters
in any another guild than Catalysts or Royal Order of Norrath.</p>
<p>II. RAID ATTENDANCE </p>
<p>1. We will have 4 planned raids a week, if you are online you are expected
  to attend.<br>
2. We aim for a 50% or better raid attendance rating. We know
  real life gets in the way. If something will prevent you from being online
  for an extended
  time, let an officer know so we keep you on the roster. Special cases are allowed
  and will be handled o&shy;n a o&shy;ne-by-one basis, with the officers having
the final say. </p>
<p>All applicants must be level 65.</p>
<p>Flagging - You must be elementally flagged or only need PSR. (exceptions
    are made dependant on the needs of the guild). It is the member's responsibility
    to get their backflags. We will try to help as schedules allow, but if the
    member cannot be on or we no longer do the needed flag, the member will need
    to arrange to get their backflag. There are various means to do this with
  our allied guilds, flag raids, or building a group on an off night. It is the
  responsibility
  of the member to arrange this, though.</p>
<p>You should try to maintain at LEAST a 50% attendance raiding during your
  trial period. If you cannot maintain 50% attendance during your trial period,

<p><a href="http://www.darkova.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Darkova</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Darkova is an Everquest raiding Guild on the Povar server. Our primary goal
  is to progress through the game in a reasonable timeframe with a small, active,
  and well equipped raid force. To accomplish this, we have set certain standards
  to ensure a healthy, forward-moving community. Among those standards are rules
  and restrictions such as level requirements, participation requirements, and
  game play requirements. In the end, we want to enjoy the game along side like-minded
  players who are serious about taking their chosen class as far as possible
in a drama free, mature environment.</p>
<p>Darkova has one leader, and six officers. Each person has a purpose in the
  leadership role, and are expected to do their job. As with the membership,
  officers are not added if one is not pulling their weight, they are simply
  replaced with someone who will. Officers are not allowed to guild remove members,
  that is reserved only for the leader. </p>
<p>The guild started March of 2004 on Morden Rasp with two members (the leaders)
  and gradually grew to a roster of about 45 people. We began raiding in Temple
  of Veeshan: Halls of Testing a few weeks after receiving the tag from a GM,
  then moved through Velious picking up classes and raising the requirements
  as we grew. Today, our community is quite stable. </p>
<p>We are currently raiding Elemental Planes with our primary focus on farming
  Fire at the moment. We also raid OoW mobs like Menlo, LtBK, Velktorkin, 1.5epics,
  etc.. PoTime is our next goal, and we are shooting for summer 2005.<br>
  <br>
  The membership is made of of players who are online often and serious about
    progression. Since we only recruit active players, we can raid with relatively
    low numbers, therefore gearing up quickly. This also allows us to manage
    the community with less effort, and we do like to keep things simple in all
    aspects. As a member of Darkova, there is never a question of &quot;if&quot; you
    will get loot. Only &quot;when&quot; you will get loot. And that is entirely
    up to the individual based on how often they attend raids, and how often
  they spend points.</p>
<p>The forums are heavily moderated, restricting any discussion on politics,
  religion, or just general drama. Members are expected to take their personal
  issues to PM's or tells and deal with them directly, in effect, not pestering
  the rest of us who are only trying to enjoy ourselves.</p>
<p>Indeed, Darkova is not a &quot;family&quot; guild by stereotypical definition.
  Although we are friendly people who are helpful outside of guild agenda's,
  we are dead serious when it comes to direction and progression. Becoming a
  member is not easy, and remaining one can be equally as challenging. Before
  you consider joining our community, please take the time to read over the content
  on this page. Although we are some-what flexible, ultimately the standards
  are set in stone.</p>
<p>Membership status is never permanent, everyone is expected to participate
  in the majority of raids which begin anywhere from 6pm EST to 11pm and beyond
  depending on the raid.<br>
  <br>
  General Requirements:<br>
  Must not be guilded while recruiting.<br>
  Must have Elemental Access. We will not backflag.<br>
  Must have a reliable internet connection and computer. <br>
  Must register on the forum with in-game name. <br>
  Must be prepared to work heavily on faction, keys and reaching the level cap. <br>
  Must be willing to run certain factions into the ground regardless of class,
  race, or deity. <br>
  Must be able to participate in the majority of our raids. Being online requires
  that you participate. <br>
  Must be willing to leave experience groups immediately upon a raid call (attempting
  to find a replacement is acceptable within reason). <br>
  Must recruit with main character - Alts are not eligible for loot. <br>
  Must not have alts in any guilds within competition range of Darkova or higher. <br>
  Must have ALL expansions.<br>
  Must have and post a Magelo profile with application. </p>
<p>Transfers from other servers are very much welcome here. All we ask is that
  you provide us some minor background information such as former server, prior
  guilds and perhaps even your old server community forum. Failing to do so can
only mean a bad reputation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalempire.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Final Empire</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  &quot;Final Empire is an upper end (65+) Time+ raiding/grouping guild on the Povar
  server. We behave with honor and expect those who wear our tag to do the same.
  We support our members and treat each other with respect, and see the game
  as a balance between raiding/progression and social interaction. The guild
  was originally formed with the philosophy that RL &gt; EQ. So, we don't lean
  on members to play more or raid more if their lives are such that they can't.
  That said, we do raid a lot and focus on progressing, so for the members who
  can play a great deal of time, there is loot and high end content. For those
  who play sporadically, they simply help when they can, but realize that there
may be raids they can't attend due to their missing flags. </p>
<p>We use a DKP system for loot distribution so the players that do raid more
  often have more points to spend on loot. Some items are awarded by the leadership,
  usually epic or quest pieces. </p>
<p>The guild is run by a leader, officers and class leaders. We have open guild
  meetings every couple months to get feedback from members on current issues,
  to resolve any conflicts and to plan for the future of the guild. Also, the
  leadership has an open door policy concerning member concerns or diificulties
  and we pride ourselves on being very responsive. </p>
<p>So, if you are looking to be part of a supportive and fun environment that
  focuses on progressing to the higest content of the game, Final Empire may
  be perfect for you. If you have any questions about the guild, please contact
me (Aristein). </p>
<p>Final Empire is a newly Time Flagged guild on the Povar server. We currently
  raid at least 4 nights a week. As a progressing guild we naturally have requirements
  that all potential applicants must attain in order to be considered for admittance
  as an applicant. If you do not meet these requirements, do not feel shunned,
  simply continue to strive to meet these requirements before submitting your
  application. In addition, submitting a PM to an officer expressing your intent
to apply when you meet requirements will also be noted. </p>
<p>General Requirements </p>
<p>These are requirements that all applicants, regardless of class, must reach
  in order to be considered for admittance as an applicant. </p>
<p>- You must have a magelo profile, if you do not have one, proceed to magelo.com
  and create one before you apply. <br>
  - Time flag is considered a bonus. <br>
  - Any GoD flags, beginning with KT are also considered bonuses. </p>

  &quot;LK is not like other guilds. We have no desire to be. We're staying small
  on purpose, capping our numbers and gearing up the people we have. We do not
  accept
applications for the sake of having applications. </p>
<p>Lore Keepers was built on the premise of doing more with less. We are determined
  to keep our skill high, and our loot pools small. If you are applying, we expect
  you to be able to have a regular evening playing time and be able to make at
  LEAST 50% of our evening raids or more. If you are unable to raid at least
  50% please do not apply.</p>
<p>Lore keepers is a raiding guild. Raiding is not optional. If you have a hard
  time leaving your XP/Adventure groups when a raid is called, or consider yourself
  a casual raider, don&#8217;t bother applying. If you have any illusions that
  because you got into guild X or Guild Y you're a shoe in here, please dispel
  them now. We&#8217;re attempting to build a strike force of skilled players
  who know their class and are mature in their dealings with other people. </p>
<p>We are not a &quot;family guild&quot;. We all throw punches at one another
  in jest, and expect everyone to roll with it. We do not take everyone and anybody.
  If you are thin-skinned, this may not be the guild for you.</p>
<p>If you are a ego maniac that likes to stir up problems to get things your
  way, you will probably be removed from the guild, regardless your self-percieved
  value. If you have a problem, youre expected to handle it like an adult. We
  want everyone to get along as much as possible. </p>
<p>If you are not self-sufficient, able to make your way through zones without
  dying, not able to handle yourself when raiding is slow or not enough people
on, then Lore Keepers may not be the guild for you.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.night-eternal.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Night Eternal</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Night Eternal is a raiding guild on the Povar server. Our primary objective

  join our ranks. We accept only level 70 players (except in some circumstances)

<p><a href="http://ourguild.net/index1.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Reflections of Insanity</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Reflections of Insanity is not a large hardcore raiding guild. It started
    as a group of friends looking for a place to be together and have fun and
    we want
  to keep it that way. As more friends continue to join us and our numbers grow
  the basic reason for us forming has and will not change anywhere in the near
future. </p>
<p>For the time being our goals are simple. We want to lvl our friends who have
  not yet hit 70, we want to see our friends get their spells they are missing
  as well as upgrades to their gear and some aa in their pocket. The upgrades
  we are looking at are epic 1.5, DoN gear as well as GoD and OoW drops.</p>
<p>We plan on doing GoD progression as well as tier 1 PoP and DoN progression
  as well. We also plan on doing a lot of DoN missions to upgrade our newer members
  thru items purchased with crystals so we can start progressing on to harder
  content.</p>
<p>A large percentage of our members now are lvl 70 with a good number of AA
  and we plan on getting all our other members up there with us asap. We plan
  on keeping our numbers within reason and building our strengths and learning
  to work together as a team. We hope to help other guilds with their progression
  as well and making some good friends outside the guild to work with as well.</p>
<p>We believe in having fun, seeing new things and succeeding where others think
  we should fail. We push ourselves and the people with us to always improve
  but we also dont expect you to play above your means or commit any more time
  than you can spare. Real life is always more important and we will still be
  here the next time you log on. To some extent we are a family guild and are
  very close and any new people who join should expect to fit right in as we
  are all friendly people. In some ways we arent a family guild and of you are
  offended by language and a twisted sense of humor you may be a little uncomfortable
  with us lol.</p>
<p>I expect a lot of great things to come from this guild. We have a lot of skilled
  and knowledgeable players and we have learned to work together and adapt. The
  people we have with us are some of the best players and most fun people i have
  played with in the 6 yrs of everquest under my belt and i can only see it getting
better in the future.</p>
<p>We don't have alot of rules here but the ones we have we are very serious
about.</p>
<p>1) Drama - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE!!! - We started this guild to have
  fun and to make new friends and to hang out with old friends as well. DO NOT
  START DRAMA - we are all adults here and should act as such. If you are asked
  to take something to tells please do it NOW! If an officer is needed we will
  start a separate channel to deal with this, I hope it never comes to this.
  If you are asked to drop something in guild chat and you do not we WILL guild
  remove you then and there. Depending on the seriousness of what has transpired
  you may be invited back after you calm down and have explained the situation
  with an officer and both sides can agree.</p>
<p>We are friends plain and simple and if you like to cause drama whether its
  to get attention or just to cause us grief we don't want it. We are very serious
  about this rule, we have all experienced drama and that's not what this guild
  is about.</p>
<p>2) Loot- Being a guild of friends we don't think people should fight over
  loots, we think we can sort things out as friends and come to a decisions that
  is fair to everyone. In most cases loot will just be rolled on seeing as we
  are a smaller guild, we do expect you to respect your guildies to and if you
  win something not to roll on the next item as well, share the wealth it all
  benefits us in the long run. Just use common sense and courtesy. If you have
  a &quot;raiding bot&quot;, which is basically a toon that is essential to groups
  and guild activates that you play well and at the same time as your main, we
  have no problems with you rolling for that toon. Remember though we consider
  you and your bots the same person and really don't want to see you roll for
  your bot then next loot roll for your main. If the same person is getting something
  every group or event we do people will eventually have bad feelings and that's
  not what we are about. We want everyone to get something and to be happy and
  to upgrade their toons. Again this all comes down to courtesy and common sense
  and working together as a close group of friends.</p>
<p>3) Respect - respect all members and officers alike, we are all humans behind
  the toons and we all have feelings. If you want people to respect you show
  them respect back.</p>
<p>4) Language - this is pretty much a free for all, sing, scream, swear and
  have fun BUT if you are offending someone and they state as much change the
  subject and tone it down NOW- I don't want people complaining about language
  but I also don't want people getting insulted plain and simple. If you get
  offended easily turn on the language filter. I don't expect personal attacks
  to be taking place either, this will be closely monitored and disciplinary
  action may be taken if things get to out of control.</p>
<p>5) Guild Chat - I only have 1 rule for guild chat that the Language doesn't
  cover! This is a game and it is no place for Politics or Religion!!! Some people
  feel very strongly about these subjects and I do not want a holy war erupting
  in channel. Respect others beliefs and keep it all out of guild chat!! People
  die for religion and Politics every day, we play this game to escape real life
  not to drag it into our channel.</p>
<p>6) Raids - we are not a mandatory raiding guild, if you want to raid great,
  if you don't have fun with what ever you are doing. You may get an tell from
  an officer asking if your coming in case you were afk when it was called but
  it is not us pressuring you we just don't want you to miss out.</p>
<p>We do not do dkp as of now, we are small enough that loots can be used to
  better us all and I trust us all to handle things fairly.</p>
<p>If you have a friend that wants to raid with us that is great! Just inform
  an officer before hand. If we roll loots and friends are there we WILL let
  them roll just a different set of numbers that will reduce their chances a
  fair bit but they still get a chance. The exception to this is if it is a shared
raid where we need these people to succeed then everyone will roll the same.</p>
<p>If someone makes a mistake DO NOT jump all over them, we all screw up its
  part of life. Let an officer know what happened and someone will talk to that
  member at an appropriate time. We learn from our mistakes and its not your
  job to make someone feel awful for making a mistake the already probably realize
they made.</p>
<p>7) Bots - Alot of us here bot toons. We have alot of roles that bots can and
  do cover. We feel since bots play such a large roll in alot of what we do they
  should be treated in alot of the same ways mains are. If you are in a group
  though and a members is LFG it would be nice if you had a bot that wasn't playing
  an essential roll to your group if you could drop and replace it with a member.
  I realize this cant always happen, maybe your bot is your slower or healer,
  maybe you are camping an item specifically for that bot, this is all understandable
  and people shouldn't get upset if someone wont drop a bot. In any of my groups
  if I have my bot along and all he is doing is dps I will drop him for a regular
  member. I will also play my bot as a main to fill in a group as needed and
  I'm sure all the others with Bots feel the same way. Bots are a valuable part
  of any guild and should be treated as such.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://valheru.us/" target="_blank"><strong>Valheru</strong></a><br>
  &quot;The Valheru Train shows no signs of stopping as we fly through everything
    that stands before us. Epic mobs or Gods, nothing stands a chance, so move
    out
of the way!</p>
<p>Valheru was founded back in the fall of 1999 by 3 people, Elminis the Ranger,
  Kendahl the Shadow Knight and Lornoth the Paladin. Back in those days we were
  one of the larger guilds on server with 175+ active members but not very advanced
  in the realms of raiding. As in anything the time came where we each wanted
  to go our own way and many of the guild merged with a present Povar guild Blades
of Law. </p>
<p>Now in 2005 Valheru is back and being administered by a similar Council and
  Officership as Blades of Law used in the past. Everquest has changed and with
  so many new guilds forming, some high end guilds merging those of us seeking
  change and a blast of the good ole' days decided to reform Valheru. </p>
<p>A number of the members of Valheru have obviously been in one of the premier
  guilds on Povar and in my opinion the model guild of the server when it came
  to advancement and membership and its general reception to the server in Blades
  of Law. </p>
<p>We are seeking to just have some fun and not let the drama that kills so many
  guilds and the minds of so many enter our hallowed halls. Sure we would like
  to advance and continue off where some of us had left, but this reformation
  is more about having fun with a game that most of us have really completed
  95% of considering all the expansions. </p>
<p>Valheru will not be a mandatory raiding guild nor are we planning on trying
  to compete with the high end guilds on server but we are seeking to find our
  own niche' on the server. As many long term players on server we all have those
  alts that are now likely 65+ and we just never really get to play them and
  as such we are hoping to push some older events to be done with alts for a
  change of pace. </p>
<p>We of course will pursue Time, Qvic , Anguish and the new expansion coming
  out Dragons of Norrath. Guilds need goals and we have a lot of them but we
  are about having some fun first and not dealing with the type of drama many
  of us have dealt with in many situations. We are recruiting good established
  members , we are also pushing to be a family oriented type guild so we encourage
  couples and family members to consider us as well as offering some opportunity
  to newer Everquest players a chance to join a knowledgable group of players
  to learn from and have some great times with in Everquest. </p>
<p>Valheru will consider all applications of race, level, experience, flags,
  keys and NFL affiliation ( I suggest Patriots as the choice here ). We are
  looking to create an opportunity for 50 to 60 members a chance to raid and
  advance while doing it with a smile on your face and no drama to take from

<p><a href="http://www.visionariesguild.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Visionaries</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  &quot;Visionaries strives for a casual, family feel guild. Although we raid hard
    and raid often, we have no desire to be &quot;uber.&quot; We simply enjoy
    the spirit of adventure and camaraderie. Much of the guild have lives outside
    of Norrath &#8212; we're just here to conquer the mobs and have fun. If we
    are lucky enough to get awesome hordes of treasure while killing, then even
better.</p>
<p>To this, we do not impose attendance requirements nor do we tolerate the &quot;loot
  whore.&quot; We encourage all members to participate in guild events, and this
  is the surest way to be noticed and rewarded. We have a very detailed and fair
  loot system, based on DKP points. Basically, the more you help the guild (eg,
  raid with the guild), the more you profit. </p>
<p>No &quot;official&quot; guild raids are planned below the Epic, Planar, or
  Mid to High-End level. At this point, even Epic raids are scarce, but will
  be planned provided no other targets are available, and the individual has
  shown the initiative to quest the bulk of it themselves.</p>
<p>We value your time as well as ours, and the decision to App with us should
  not be taken lightly. We are a raiding guild, but it doesn't mean we are loot
  hungry. We raid both small &amp; big mobs, whatever needs to be dead to accomplish
  our friend's goals as an individual and as a guild. We raid to upgrade our
  friends within our guild. We raid because we have fun being around our friends
  and seeing our friends obtain a piece of armor to better their character and
  their enjoyment online, as well as better our guild.</p>
<p>If you are the type that will disband from a guild because you disagree with
  an officer's award decision, please withdraw your application. This isn't the
  guild for you. If you are thinking of using Visionaries as a stepping stone
  to gain loot, flags, we will see through this and you will be ask to leave.
  But if you are the type that love to raid &amp; help friends, and can wait
  your turn for your award, and have a desire to find true friends, and a place
  to call home then please read on.</p>
<p>All members shall act in a mature way to reflect the integrity of Visionaries.<br>
  This applies to all forms of communication, whether in guild chat, group chat,
    or external EQ forms of communication like e-mail and message boards. Remember
    that you show off the guild tag wherever you go in Norrath!<br>
  No Visionaries member shall use foul, belligerent or disrespectful language
  in guild chat. Profanity and name-calling will not be tolerated.<br>
  Always offer support to fellow members of Visionaries whenever one is encountered
  in transit.<br>
  No Visionaries member should ever put a citizen of Norrath ahead of a fellow
  guild-mate.<br>
  Anonymous shall not be used by any Visionaries member. Rather, use the &#8220;Role-playing&#8221; switch. <br>
  No Visionaries member shall kill steal, Ninja-loot or train any individual,
  group and or guild. Any such member will be considered for removal from the
  guild.<br>
  If, during your tenure with Visionaries, it is viewed by the Guild Leader that
  your behavior is of a greedy, whining, complaining, demanding, overbearing,
or unhelpful nature, you shall be /Guild Removed.<br>
<br>
  BASIC RULES <br>
  You MUST be able to move from zone A to zone B without getting lost and without
  having someone holding your hand while you move. This also includes, having
  invis potions if you can not cast invis on yourself, a shrink item if you&#8217;re
a fatty and a Enduring Breath item if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>
<p>You MUST know the zones Visionaries raids, you must know how to get to several
  spots in different zones on your own. This also includes having maps of the
  zones you don't know. If you own LoY, you should DOWNLOAD and install the ingame
maps.</p>
<p>We are looking for some key classes to help us move thru SSRA and VT. If you
    have a GOOD Attention span, team player and can listen well... we might have
  a spot for you in Visionaries. Right now we are accepting these classes </p>
