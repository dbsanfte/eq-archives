<br><span class="pageheader">Mubbon</span>
<br>By <a href="mailto:">Duane Covalt</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
Taking out his tack and hammer yet again, the old troll tacks up a tattered parchment. The writing, somewhat faded by the sun and abrasions of some worn pocket, tells of a story of a young half-ling's adventures...
<br>
<br>Gather around and hear a tale never told before, of a halfling who lost his way and his belief's in but a moment's time. Remember that what you hear came not from the mouth of the halfling but from a narrator connected in no way to the fur-footed hero.
<br>
<br>Mubbon was orphaned at a young age when his parents failed to return home from their quest to destroy the threat deep within the citadel of Runnyeye. After being distributed to half a dozen halfling homes, he finally became accepted into the Quickfoot family.
<br>
<br>The Quickfoots were a proud furr-footed family of three. He grew up with the halfling whom he learned to call his brother, Earwig Quickfoot. Both being of the same age, they often played in the Thicket and caught bixies together. Earwig had the natural halfling streak about him, taking to his trade like his mother and father, rogues. Mubbon on the other hand was told of his parent's lifestyle, both being avid Clerics of Bristlebane. He thought as one of the greatest respects to his departed guardian's he would follow in their footsteps, and perhaps one day Bristlebane will give him a sign telling him that his parents did not die in vain.
<br>
<br>Thus began the life of Mubbon Surefoot, a struggling Acolyte to the mischievous God Bristlebane. His deeds were noted by the deputy's of the thicket and he became known as one of the many menaces to the Runnyeye Goblins. He would often lead a party of his friends and allies deep into the Citadel to ambush the goblin knights while they did their routine patrols.
<br>
<br>The gallant halfling met with a crew of mismatched races upon the beaches nearby the Commonlands. Spying curiously to their intent, he learned they were all striving for working to prosper good to the land. He became accepted after an initiation speech and became a well known member among their group, always one to help out a nearby friend. This guild of do-gooders was famous for their frequent stops nearby the training grounds for the younger adventurer's, willing to donate armor, weapons and spells of power to those deserving and in need.
<br>
<br>Until one fateful day when Mubbon was at the wrong place at the wrong time. He ventured towards the Frontier Mountains, where he was urged to meet with his partners for a trek against the Gian'ts. What he saw appalled and frightened him, there lay the groaning bodies of several of his friends. Standing above them was a high elven wizard garbed in a black robe, a cynical smirk turning the corner of his lips.
<br>
<br>Biting back an intense urge to shout out curses, the steel plated halfling approached his friends and knelt. They still lived, but their breathing was to faint, they would not live much longer unless assisted.
<br>
<br>A sudden shock of pain coursed through Mubbon's body, eating through his flesh with searing heat. He stumbled back, the wizard stood still with evil intentions in his dark eyes, particles of light emanating from his fingertips.
<br>
<br>"Bristlebane smite you for that, evil elf!" Mubbon cried out, pointing towards the high-elf. Indeed he did, as a flare of red light caught over the elf and struck a blow to him that caused the elf to step back and balance himself, but still it barely harmed him.
<br>
<br>Unlatching the mace from his side, he charged the black robed wizard and struck at him. The elf dodged nimbly, stepping to the side and sending another shock of fire into the skin of the halfling. Frustrated and confused, Mubbon let the mace drop from his side. He would put his trust in Bristlebane to win this battle.
<br>
<br>Raising up his arms, he swung them out towards the wizard. A quick blow struck the high-elven wizard, stunning him for a moment. The clever cleric realized that it just might work and continually attempted to stun the wizard, breaking his concentration of spells.
<br>
<br>The wizard was obviously beginning to tire after some time, yet showing no signs of retreating. A determined glare was only offered to the selfless halfling, and in the moment of pause where Mubbon lost all track of reality and stared into the life-hating eyes of the evil high-elf... he was struck with an awesome force by the wizard.
<br>
<br>Stumbling back, Mubbon fell. He struggled to get up but knew he had naught the strength, his armor held him down. The mage stood over him, as he did the others, as if... in victory.
<br>
<br>"You shall learn to keep your business to yourself, halfling. You will learn the hard way..." The wizard began to chant, an unusual spell he had never heard uttered before. It stretched beyond the span of ordinary magic's, possibly even siphoning energy from the gods themselves.
<br>
<br>The next thing the halfling experienced was waking in the Lake of Ill Omen, naked and weak. He stumbled his way with luck on his side to Firiona Vie, where he gradually made his way back to Rivervale. But something had changed, it was as if the world began anew. He seemed to recall no familiar faces, nor did he understand how he became so weak.
<br>
<br>The wizard was casting a spell, as he last remembered. Could it have been that the wizard not only stole his possessions but also wiped his memory? No, that was not it... He could remember the names of most of his friends, yet he seemed not to ever see them. Mubbon walked into the bank of Rivervale upon arrival, asking to see what was yet to remain in his account. "I'm sorry but there are no boxes with your name upon it." Replied the vault manager.
<br>
<br>Mubbon paused in silence, his eyes drawing towards the floor. Turning back towards the door, the halfling slowly exited the building and headed towards the Fools Gold Inn. He had let down his friends, his order, and Bristlebane revoked Mubbon's virtuous gifts. He had been left alone, he was not worthy.
