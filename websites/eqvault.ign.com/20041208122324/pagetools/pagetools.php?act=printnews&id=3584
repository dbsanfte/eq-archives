Here's the <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&message.id=58&no_redir=true#M58">full post</a>:<blockquote><i><b>Five Elvish trumpeters stand playing a loud melodeous fanfare. When their tune ends, a herlad steps forward. His tabard bears the symbol of the Koada`Dal in the upper right corner and the Feir`Dal in the lower left corner.</i></b><br> <br>Hear ye! Hear ye! On behalf of King Tearix Thex, you are all coordially invited to join the Elves of the Faydark in celebrating the Festival of Leaves! We thank the forest for our prosperity over the past year and ask the spirits of the wood to protect us over the next. Join us in grand feasts and other special events held in celebration. Certain members of the Kelethin and Felwithe Guard will provide you with more information as the Festival makes it's way to your realm.<br> <br><i><b>The herald steps back behind the trumpeters. They play a short tune then turn and leave.</b></i></blockquote>Sounds like fun!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 19 Nov 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3584<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 8 4:23:16 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
