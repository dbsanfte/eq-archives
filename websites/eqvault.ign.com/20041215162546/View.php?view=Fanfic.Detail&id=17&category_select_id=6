<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-10-2004</b> - 
Had he not known it was coming, the slap may very well have knocked him on his round little ass.
<br>
<br>The little warrior staggered to regain his balance and stood up straight, wiping dust from his plate mail leggings and rubbing his jaw frantically, trying to erase the burn and ache left by the hand of the feisty dark elf.
<br>
<br>"Damn Darenya, what the hell was THAT for??"
<br>
<br>The dark elf settled down beneath the tree in the Knowledge plane, her blade deftly carving a slice of apple and popping it into her mouth. She chewed and giggled and stared at the sky through her dark moon pool eyes, the wind catching her white hair and whipping it into a maelstrom of ivory silk around her indigo-hued skin. She looked like some sort of creature of the night, her darkness out of place in the broad piercing daylight, her armor strong yet colorful, her weapons strapped at her side almost invisible beneath her silvery cloak. Though small in stature, the strength she harbored in her arms often surprised men and beasts five times her size, and combined with her innate agility and quickness, she was not a force to be reckoned with, and CERTAINLY not when provoked by the words of a cocky halfling warrior.
<br>
<br>"Perhaps next time, halfling, you will not be so quick to insult my mother, even in jest. You are lucky my weapons were not sharpened or I may have tested them on your bald little skull. I'm going to visit my trainer; I'll be back in time for our port. In the meantime, try not to get yourself smacked by another girl, alright?"
<br>
<br>She giggled and lilted off across the quadrant, her quick feet efficiently putting distance between them so that only moments later she was completely out of sight.
<br>
<br>Peter winced and grumbled, knowing now that his tendency to underestimate the wrath of a woman scorned was going to earn him many more scars in the future if he did not learn to control his tongue. He was used to the docile, subservient women of Rivervale, ones more likely to bake you a pie or pour you a beer as opposed to smack you upside your head. These crazy elven women were unpredictable and moody, much like the stories he had heard his father tell him when he was young, chronicles of brave adventures beyond the northern tundra through forests that stretched for miles on miles, filled with the soft steps of wood elves, dark caverns and crevices of stone littered with dark elves lying in wait to ambush weary travelers and lighten their purses of coin and jewels. He remembered many a night when sleep evaded him as images of doe-eyed brown-skinned elven women danced in his head, oftentimes leaving him restless and overtired the next day. Had Darenya not been one of his traveling companions and valued guild mates, he may have hit her back, but he at least had SOME training in decorum and knew that hitting a woman, unless your life was at stake, was out of the question for an honorable man.
<br>
<br>The booming voice of an agitated barbarian echoed across the green, and Peter instantly knew it to be the voice of his comrade Roth.
<br>
<br>"What in the name of Rodcet are you thinking, Kanya? You seriously want me to pay five platinum for that cow slop you call food? In all seriousness, I could wipe the goo off the bottom of my boot, and it would taste better...God, it's amazing what people get away with in big cities..."
<br>
<br>Peter winced as the forceful honesty of his friend reduced the poor vending girl to tears. She ran off to find her father, no doubt in search of revenge on the overbearing barbarian. Roth spotted his small-statured friend, and with large loping strides approached him beneath the tree. Peter laughed at the look of frustration on the barbarian's face. "And you wonder why you can't find decent prices at merchants here...for future reference, making them cry is not going to guarantee you the lowest price on their wares, my wild-mannered friend." Roth grunted and nodded at Peter, he was now digging frantically through his hopelessly cluttered packs in search of his poison components. Peter always wondered what might happen if Roth someday mistook one of his many poison components for a ration; he giggled as he pictured the look of disgust that would cross his face as he bit into a deadly mushroom or a twilight worm thinking it was food.
<br>
<br>"I haven't the time for your lame humor right now, midget. We are late for our visit to the Hate Plane, and if I miss out on one of those asphodels again, I am going to be grumpier than a hungry bear. Where is that blasted wizard anyway? He is half an hour late meeting us here, and I am beginning to wonder if he fell asleep again."
<br>
<br>Zorm was the wizard they awaited, and among other things, he was above all known to succumb to sleep easier than most. His dark skin and bright robes were well known throughout Norrath, and his leadership of one of the most powerful guilds on the continent had earned him the respect of some and the loathing of others. His power was unmeasured, and his clever manipulation of the elemental magical arts was legendary. Peter remembered the first time he had laid eyes on this wizard with the smiling face and the deadly power, it was back in the days of Karnor's Castle, and he remembered the shock he felt as he watched the wizard run frantically, several dozen drovlargs chasing him with quick and painful death on their minds. With the flick of his wrist and the wave of his hands, lightning had descended in a pillar onto the unsuspecting dogs, disintegrating them to ash before Peter's amazed eyes. Zorm had merely walked away, unmoved, flicking particles of ash from his robes. Peter would remember that image forever; it was there that the friendship had begun between these two men.
<br>
<br>Suddenly as if out of nowhere, the wizard appeared as a shadow at first, slowly materializing into the yellow-robed erudite they had been awaiting.
<br>
<br>"Uhh...sorry guys...I was um..delayed...I sort of...um..."Roth interrupted, impatiently. "Fell asleep, yes we know. Where is that blasted cleric and druid you were supposed to bring us? They fall asleep too?" Zorm smiled, yawning, his hair slightly frazzled from the transport, his robes askew. His hands stretched towards the sky, and magical power began swirling around him like a blue ball of lightning. "They are meeting us up there, they are arriving later than expected, something about an appointment they had in Kelethin. You know women, they are rarely on time to anything." Roth snorted, then began to chuckle. "Well, if that were true, I may fancy a look under your robes, for you are the most non-punctual person I know, wizard boy. I swear your name should be Zorm of the SOMINEXus with the way you fall asleep all the time..." Zorm smiled briefly, and then was lost in thought again, meditating quietly to regain his energy. Had they not known better, they may have thought him asleep again.
<br>
<br>Peter yawned, he could use a nap himself, and he settled his body against the tree trunk, the hilt of his sword poking uncomfortably into his side. Wiggling slightly to adjust himself, he stretched his stumpy legs out across the velvety grass and smiled as the warmth of the sun lulled him into a daydream. He remembered the days of his youth, scuttling through the forests of Kithicor with his lifelong friends Brend and Smalls, the three of them at age fifteen, donned in leather armor, wielding rusty weapons, thinking there was nothing that could stop them or defeat them. Little had they known that as darkness descended, horrors of unimaginable scope would materialize out of the forest, and he chuckled as he remembered the swiftness with which they raced back to the safety of Rivervale, thanking the gods for the spirit of the Smalls had blessed them with that hastened their retreat to more familiar and safe places.
<br>
<br>Oftentimes Peter found himself wishing for those days of naive innocence, the days before he was kin to the horrors the world had to offer, the pain it dished out freely, and the death and destruction that seemed almost a daily occurrence. Life was war, life was death, life was pain, and he had grown skeptical as he grew in seasons, learning that it was not the beauty and love one could rely on from this world, but rather the disappointment and heartbreak. He sighed, the cynicism that accompanied age and experience overwhelming him again, making him melancholy, suspicious. It was much more fun when he had known less, had more hope, had been more enthusiastic. A change was needed, and soon. He was startled from his reverie as the tap of a long blue finger wakened him from his stupor.
<br>
<br>"Wake up, short stack. We've got trouble."
<br>
<br>Darenya's face was paler than usual, her lips pursed tightly over her teeth, her jaw muscles working frantically. "Zorm, wake up, we need to go NOW to Hate, there's trouble. I've just heard from Rowena, there's more than we expected going on up there, and our ranks are falling fast. We have injuries and I even heard that one of our numbers...well...may have been...killed."
<br>
<br>She whispered the word "killed," the weight of it almost too much for her to speak of, her eyes narrowing into a grimace of hatred as she pondered the fate of one of her guild mates. "Quickly, join me, let's go..."
<br>
<br>Roth threw his vials haphazardly into his backpacks, checked his hilt for his Ragebringer, finding it sharpened and ready. He sighed heavily, his face hidden mostly by his overwhelming beard, the look of concern and rage unmistakable in his dark brooding eyes.
<br>
<br>Peter quickly shrouded himself in darkness, hoping the magic would hold long enough for him to reach the walls of Hate after their arrival. Darenya and Zorm did the same as they prepared to travel.
<br>
<br>Zorm fumbled briefly through his spell book, quickly committing the runes to memory, and with magical whisperings and chants, he wrapped them into a swirling portal of wind and smoke. Within seconds, they faded from view, a swift wind sweeping them away quickly.
<br>
<br>The whisper of ancient magic blew softly across the ground where they had stood only moments before.
<br>
<br>They were gone.
