It's a lot of fun no matter how much you play EQ -- EQ players know how to party!  In addition, meeting the people who make EQ happen gives you a completely different perspective on the game-- trust me on this.  They are a very interesting and fun-to-be-around group of folks.<br><br>So check out the link on our Features menu and get over to Las Vegas!<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wed 25 May 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#7901<br>Printed On: Fri May 27 7:53:44 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
