The zone will have increased loot drops and over a dozen new items added to its list. <br><br>We will also be changing the zone reset timer from 3 days to 5 days as some of the new items will be a bit more potent than those currently in the zone.<br><br>Go get your flags and be the first to find the new items.</blockquote><br>Should be fun to see what they do!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tue 30 Nov 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3838<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 8 4:41:00 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
