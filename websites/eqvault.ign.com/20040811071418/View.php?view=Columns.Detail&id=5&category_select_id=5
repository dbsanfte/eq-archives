<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
<I>"Hail to thee. I'm glad to see you again. You are becoming quite the regular these days.
It's always nice to see my ale and good food is appreciated, although many seem to come here to get information about the various wonders of Norrath.
<p>
Umm I wouldn't keep staring at him if I were you. Who is he? Lean over so I can speak a little softer. That is Kullom Faithforge, a Dwarf of considerable reputation and he is not in the best of moods it would seem, so if you want to keep your head on you're shoulders
<p>
I would keep your eyes on your beer.
<p>
What's that you say? A fine piece of Jewelry? Oh it is a fine diamond ring your right there, but It could be finer. Oh if you could find an Enchanter of considerable skill they could fashion that ring to offer you magical protection from many of the elements and ailments. Well for certain I can recommend someone she is over by the fireplace as we speak. Yes she's a Gnome but don't let her tiny size fool you, Wenjii is much more than meets the eye.</I>
<p>
EverQuest is a mass multi player online role playing game, or at least that is the genre of game it fits into.
<p>
By definition it is a computer game that is set in a fantasy role playing world. It allows players from all over the world to log into the same game environment and play simultaneously and also offers player interaction.
<p>
Since its release in February 1999 it has grown to epic proportion and has an unprecedented number of players. I began playing in the beginning and like me many players have chosen to devote a great deal of time to playing this MMORPG.
<p>
It has become such a titan that various University's and Psychologists have performed case studies on the whole Everquest phenomenon.
<p>
One of the big questions that gets posed is do players take the game too seriously, and does it become such an obsession that it affects real life?
<p>
Well obviously if a person chooses to spend a great deal of their time playing a game, then they are not doing other things. This does not necessarily imply however that they have no life or do not do anything else.
<p>
Lets look at a cross section of players and see how and what Everquest is to them.
It is not possible to clearly categorize people that play EQ but for the point of this article we will define some loose groups in which a player may fall.
<p>
<B>CASUAL EVERQUEST PLAYER</B>
<p>
This group of player is by far the smallest and will devote maybe a few hours a week to playing. To them it is JUST a game and they will casually group or solo and devote playing time to it much like they would any other computer game.
<p>
I have a few friends that fall into this category and mostly it is due to lack of playing time, or that they just do not have the enthusiasm that others may have.
<p>
<B>MODERATE EVERQUEST PLAYER</B>
<p>
This is your 10 to 20 hours a week player.
<p>
They do devote a fair bit of time to playing EQ, and probably do take their character development and their online friendships seriously.
<p>
Many players fall back into this category from time to time when real life demands go up, but often increase play time as and when they can. These players would say yes it is a game but it's a bit more than that.
<p>
<B>DEVOTED EVERQUEST PLAYER</B>
<p>
This is the 20 to 40 hour bracket, and I feel this is the majority of players on each server.
These players really enjoy playing and devote most of their free time to playing EQ.
They will be very socially active and seek to progress with some drive.
<p>
I would think that very few players in this category will look at playing EQ as JUST a game, and will take it very seriously.
<p>
<B>HARD CORE EVERQUEST PLAYER</B>
<p>
This is the 40 plus hour a week group that live, eat and sleep EQ.
<p>
They are players with more free time and can play for much longer stints.
<p>
I have known people in this group who have run over one hundred hours of play time in a week. To this group of players it most certainly is not JUST a game.
<p>
So looking at it we can see that to most EQ players it is not just a game, but why is this?
What reasons do people have for taking it more seriously than other games?
<p>
Firstly one must understand that the character's a player has progresses.
They gain in level and ability, learn new skills, acquire wealth and possessions and have a role to play in Norrath's society. This can be paralleled to real life.
<p>
We grow and learn we buy cars and homes and other items and we try to forge a career and a family.
<p>
Next an EQ player forges friendships and relationships.
<p>
They meet people online and have in depth conversations. Some players have their character get married within the game world. Many times they grow to be true friends and often will ultimately meet up in the real world. They in turn develop loyalties and ties to their fellow guild members or gaming friends.
<p>
I myself am married to a person that I originally met on EQ. If this seems strange to some you would be surprised to hear how often this has happened.
<p>
Again this is a real life comparison. We meet new friends and forge relationships. We have commitments and responsibilities to others in our lives, and feel that we can not turn our back on our friends.
<p>
Once a player joins a guild his online friendships will most certainly strengthen, and this factor alone is one reason why it is not just a game. You are interacting with real people, not just computer generated entities. My guild is such a tight nit family that many have met in real life, will rise to help each other in and out of the gaming world and will often personally sacrifice their time to this endeavor.
<p>
One of my online gaming friends, unfortunately quit playing for very good reasons, but we still keep in contact by email, instant messaging and by telephone. He is in another country but through the years we have played EQ together, I consider him a good friend, even though he does not live down the street.
<p>
It is important to realize that if a person chooses to devote a great deal of time to something, and they grow socially from that time, then it can not really be considered that they were just playing a game.
<p>
One of the things that will infuriate a devoted EQ player is to be told, what are you stressed about, it's ONLY a game. I can honestly see how some people will see playing EQ as just a game. From personal experience I know that for many it is much more than that.
<p>
There are also detrimental aspects to the whole it's not just a game mentality.
I have seen and heard of people breaking up or getting divorced due to one partner playing EQ too much and allowing their priorities get so far out of line.
<p>
I have seen depression set in when a corpse disappeared with all the items on it, setting the player back months. I have seen a player go through a mental breakdown when his main character and his account were banned and his EQ life was over. I have also seen people fight, fall out and argue in game as if it was a real life crisis.
<p>
So to some extent, keeping a check on reality and the fact that it is a game is important.
<p>
To close I will reflect on how EQ has changed things in my life. I have emigrated from the UK to the US. I have made friends in many countries around the world, I have got married and found a new career, I am writing this editorial and all of this is because of JUST a game?
<I><p>
"I turn my back for a few minutes and now look at you. Rooted to the spot, mesmerized and beaten to a bloody mess. Well you can't say I didn't warn you.
<p>
Thanks for at least letting them walk out of here in one piece Kullom, and I must Wenjii that glamour of Kintaz spell of yours, always leaves such a surprised look on their faces, HAHA. Well when you come to your senses you still owe me for that Neriak Nectar and the Elven Veal um Beer braised wolf that you ate."</I><p>
