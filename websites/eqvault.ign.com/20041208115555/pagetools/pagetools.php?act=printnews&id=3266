Considering just EQ and EQ2 alone would cost almost 30 bucks a month separately - this is a great deal!<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Mon 08 Nov 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3266<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 8 3:55:49 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
