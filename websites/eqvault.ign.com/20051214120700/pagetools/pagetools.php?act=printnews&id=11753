If so here is your opportunity!  Every week from about 5:30pm PDT on Monday until about 5:30pm PDT on Tuesday we will have <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=128385">this thread</a> available to you to post your questions.  <br> <br>On the 4th Friday of each month we will have a Q&A feature on EQLive called "Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme" with the questions you have posed that have been answered.  The next Halfling HodgePodge Extreme will be posted on EQLive on Monday, October 31st (yes that does say Monday...because I will be on vacation the week before.)<br> <br>We do not guarantee all questions will be answered.  We do ask that each week you post only 1 question per each forum handle. We also ask that you try to be creative with your questions, not repeating the same questions posed over and over again because not all questions are guaranteed to be answered.   If you saw a question you liked from previous submissions that was not answered, feel free to submit it again.<br> <br>As with everything, please follow the board posting rules.  Also keep all commentary and discussions out of this thread; we want only questions for the Q&A to be posted here.  Any posts with discussion or commentary will be removed from the thread, even if there is a question somewhere in the post.  If further clarification is needed on a question,  I will send you a PM to get that information.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 11 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11753">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11753</a><br>Printed On: Wed Dec 14 4:07:00 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
