<b>07-10-2004</b> - 
The air smelled green as she rolled over on her pallet and stretched lazily, her face exploding into a wide yawn. She hadn't slept long, but she had slept hard, and for that she was grateful. Rowena quickly rolled up her sleeping bag, extinguished the remaining cinders of the smoldering campfire with some of the stale water leftover in her canteen, and gathered her belongings. The forest was laced in sunlight and twitching with early morning life. Dew sparkled brazenly on the green carpet of the forest floor, and the air was brisk with the leftovers of winter as Spring fought to make her presence known after one of the harshest winters Kelethin had ever seen. She reached deep into her knapsack and withdrew a piece of dried fish and an apple she had saved for her breakfast, and wolfing it down hungrily, she wiped her face quickly on the back of her arm, noticing that her freckles had returned in full force from being outside so much lately. Every muscle in her body felt tired and sore from yesterday and rolling her eyes in a grimace, she silently cursed Gremio who was still snoring happily underneath a tree, oblivious to her loud yawning and the pots and pans she was banging as she tidied up the dishes from last night. Her older half-brother always seemed to be helping out a friend in one way or another with various cockamamie projects, and she was always his means of compensating for his last-minute labor shortages. One of these days, she would learn to say no to him, but he was so utterly charming and charismatic that she always ended up helping him, and then regretting it the next day.
<br>
<br>She had to admit, her adventure yesterday had certainly been unlike anything Gremio had ever dragged her on before. He had told her they were going to go help Threndil, a dwarven friend of theirs from childhood they had met one day in Butcherblock many moons ago while delivering mail for Kelethin's postmaster. They had been fast friends from the moment they had met, and had remained that way ever since childhood. It seemed like only yesterday when they had met Threndil and begun adventuring alongside him, and Rowena smiled as she realized with a sudden fondness that it had been almost fifteen years since the three of them had met outside Kaladim that warm April day.
<br>
<br>Early yesterday morning Threndil had met them at the prayer stones outside Kelethin and led them across the Commons to the seething and murky swamps of Innothule which had quickly become a nest of activity for prospective land owners and merchants. In an attempt to raise the value of that godforsaken puddle-ridden corner of Antonica, dwarven craftsmen and gnomish tinkerers had undertaken a joint effort to excavate and drain the swamps of their diseased waters and establish a thriving industrial trading post for foreigners and caravans passing through the swamp on the way to the gypsies in neighboring lands. The work was sweaty, humid and sticky, but they had managed to build several scaffolds along the earthen walls of the swamp that would eventually house the pipes and pumps and pulleys that would drain the water from the swamp in what would no doubt be a long and expensive process. Rowena wrinkled her nose as she picked at a lingering piece of green moss beneath her right thumbnail. She had bathed in the stream for almost an hour rubbing fancy Feir`Dal soap into her skin and hair to get that foul rotting smell off of her hands and out of her dark red hair, but it seemed she could still catch a whiff of it now and again.
<br>
<br>Gremio finally stirred with a resounding snort. He stood and stretched, and Rowena noticed how his arms had become wiry and strong over the past few years. He had become so good with a bow now that the Tunarean Soldiers had commissioned him to teach beginner archery to the aspiring rangers of Kelethin, a task he took very seriously and enjoyed immensely. He laced up his boots and scratched his rear end enthusiastically as he stood up.
<br>
<br>"Lovely, brother," she said, casting him a disgusted and disapproving look. "I can see why the priestess maidens of Felewithe simply FLOCK to you...those manners are simply irresistible." Rowena giggled ducked quickly as a handful of pebbles flew her way. "You bathed last night, remember? I have yet to wash off this swamp rot, and let's just say it has landed in places most uncomfortable," he bellowed, continuing to scratch and grunt. "Speaking of a bath, I think I shall have one now before we head back to Mother's house." Beginning to disrobe as he walked towards the stream, Rowena sat down and scratched a mosquito bite on her left knee. She had just begun to settle into a daydream when the hairs on her neck stood up without warning. Standing up quickly and reaching for her staff, she spun around just in time to dodge the business end of a rusty dagger that was headed straight for her skull.
<br>
<br>"Smash, kill, eat, stomp!"
<br>
<br>The orc was upon her without warning, he sped around in front of her as she headed towards the river, and as she tried to hop left and avoid his advances, she tripped on the strap of her backpack, stumbled, and caught the point of the orc's rusty dagger in the fleshy part of her left shoulder. Screaming and rising up quickly, adrenalin now fueling her, Rowena picked up her staff and swung quickly, catching the orc across his chest with great force, sending him flying into a nearby bush. Reaching her eyes towards the sky, she chanted the runes from memory, and roots issued from the ground, entwining the orc as he flailed helplessly trying to escape. Rowena stalked towards the trapped beast, seeing the fear and seething hatred in his eyes as she approached. He spit at her, coating her in foamy warm saliva, fueling her anger even further. Reaching high above her head, she brought her staff down firmly across his skull, almost enjoying the hollow popping noise his head made as it cracked open. With a loud thud and sickening ooze, the orc fell silent, still entwined in dark thorny roots from her spell. She fell to her knees in front of the corpse, frantically wiping orc spit out of her face and hair. Turning at the sound of approaching footsteps, she relaxed when she realized it was Gremio running up the path towards her, frantically lacing up his trousers, shirtless, covered in water, shaking his head like a dog in a rainstorm. He knelt down next to her, and his wide grey eyes caught sight of the crumpled orc body in the bush, and he raised his eyebrows, comprehending.
<br>
<br>As her heartbeat began to slow, she suddenly felt the pain in her shoulder overwhelm her, and reaching to touch her wound, she swayed heavily, seeing her hand covered in her own dark blood. "Sit down, Weens...don't pass out on me, I am not a healer, and my bandaging skills are sad indeed!" She could sense the panic in his voice, and as he cradled her softly to the ground, she could feel the warmth of blood trickling down her arm and the throbbing pain in her shoulder grew sharper with each breath. Gremio walked around to examine the dagger that had fallen out of the hand of the slain orc, and holding it up to the light, he could see the tell-tale smear of green mixed with the cherry red of her blood along the tip of the dagger. Poison. She was not only sliced up, but that filthy animal had poisoned his dagger....
<br>
<br>"You certainly smashed his head in nicely, he must have really pissed you off!" Gremio tried to lighten the situation as he quietly and deftly wrapped her wounded shoulder in bandages. She winced as he tightened the bandages into a tourniquet and fastened it with a metal clip. "Don't complain, I don't want you bleeding to death on me, I have to stop the flow of blood somehow..." his hands, usually dexterous and skilled suddenly felt overly-large and clumsy as he secured the bandage with a final rough tug. "Let me get you some water, sister...you are the color of that orc's skin right now, such a lovely shade of green!" She felt so sleepy, all she wanted to do was curl up and fall asleep, but he pressed further. "Drink, Weens...don't you dare go to sleep, not until I get you to the cabin...Mother will know what to do better than I." He splashed her with some cold spring water from his canteen and forced her to drink a few quick cold sips before he propped her up against the trunk of a nearby oak tree. Quickly packing the horses with their packs and supplies, he lifted her deftly atop her horse and climbed up behind her, wrapping his arms tightly around her as he spurred the horse towards the village. "Hurry up, Lucy, let's go, you blasted nag..." he kicked her harder, and the horse snorted her disapproval but finally started cantering North towards Kelethin.
<br>
<br>As the horse ran frantically, Rowena felt her breakfast churning in her stomach. Her eyes were so heavy, she couldn't keep them open any longer, and finally succumbing to the seductive sigh of sleep, she closed her eyes and fell forward onto the wide neck of the horse, her arms dangling limply on either side. Looking down at her wounded arm, he saw the black fingers of rot reaching through the white bandages he had just applied, and with horror-stricken silence, he realized that the poison had set upon her faster than he had expected it to. With a wrenching scream, he spurned the horse faster, branches cutting his face as he whipped through the forest at breakneck speed, his eyes burning with determination and frustration. Orcs began to emerge from behind trees and out from under rotting stumps, their toothy crooked grins spreading across their broad smashed faces... "Too late, too late, too late....." he heard them chanting in the forest as he raced past their filthy burrows, he heard them hissing at him with laughter as they watched him weave between fallen trees and rocks..."the ranger is too late, she is gone...gone....too late too late too late for her, aiyeeeeeeeee!" He would not stop and beat them all into the ground, although his rage was so overwhelming that he could barely see straight. He grasped her limp form tightly with one arm, whipped the rein hard across Lucy's neck, and pressed on.
