Here's a clip:<blockquote><br>The alternate advanced abilities in Omens appear far more useful than the ones we saw in Gates. Most continue the progression of previous AAs such as critical damage increases, healing increases, and stat increases. Some offer a lot of utility such as a ninth spell-gem and five more buff slots. For 25 AA points, one can up their mana regeneration cap from 15 to 20. Each class has a few unique and interesting abilities as well.</blockquote><br>Be sure to check out the full article right over <a href="http://mobhunter.com/000032.html">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tue 21 Sep 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#1821<br>Printed On: Fri Dec 17 3:26:47 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
