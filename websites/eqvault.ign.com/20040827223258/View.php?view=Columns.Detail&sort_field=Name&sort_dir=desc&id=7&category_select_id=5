<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
<I>"Good evening. I am so glad to see you again. I trust you learned a little lesson last time you were here. I did warn you about the Dwarf and the Gnome enchantress though hehe.
<p>
I have just finished baking a fresh snow griffin souffl?. It"s a bit rich for my taste but a lot of travelers seem to enjoy it. Here, let me serve you up a good size helping, with some of my famous Neriak nectar. You seem a bit down this evening what seems to be the trouble? Oh, I see, getting hostile responses from some of the locals. Well they like plain talk around here, no time for fancy colorful language. Perhaps I can give you a few pointers on how best to tackle them."</I>
<p>
One of the things that have raised a lot of debate among a section of MMORPG gamers is ironically part of the game genres name and that is role playing.
<p>
Back in the early days when EQ was fresh and young role playing was alive and well.
A large number of the Norathian population role played their encounters and guilds often had a role playing theme. Unfortunately that has changed a lot, and role playing is almost non existent in EQ. There are still a few players and guilds out there that try to role play, but when they do, they receive comments such as "don"t waste my time" or "I don"t have time for that role play stuff".
<p>
It is very disheartening for those that try, and for the few that do role play it has become something that is almost exclusively reserved for guild events, where the theme of the event supports "in character" actions.
<p>
I personally feel that a huge part of the fun in a MMORPG dies when a server loses role playing.
<p>
Many players, of course, do not wish to role play or do not even understand the concept.
Way back I remember running a role playing guild and setting campaigns and quests for our members to enjoy. As an evil dark elf guild we set forth on a quest for revenge against the evil Erudite city of Paineel, and punished them for their past crime of steeling the dark secrets of Necromancy from Neriak"s library.
<p>
The rewards were mostly pure enjoyment of play and a feel that we were bothering to follow the games history and storyline. In today"s EQ world that kind of event would be considered a waste of time. Now EQ seems to be almost exclusively about loot, leveling and acquisition.
<p>
Many of the "would be" role players that I have spoken to believe that the game makers are largely responsible for this by the way they have allowed the game to develop.
Understandably the gaming industry produces games for profit, and will allow a game to become what the core of its players want or accept.
<p>
If players always beg for new zones and new loot then that is what the gaming company will see as important.
<p>
The whole irony is the very idea of a game being a mass multi player role playing game and having little or no place for role playing.
<p>
Should perhaps the genre become MMOG and forget the role play all together?
Some games after EQ did try to make role playing servers and EQ has since followed suit, but even then on those servers it is still rare to find role playing of any depth or continuity. Even trying to police such a server and trying to keep players from breaking the role playing theme is all but impossible.
<p>
The early allowance of a role play tag on a characters name suggested that the community could be divided by name color into role play and non role playing players, but it did not happen. Instead, for the most part, it seems it was added to keep the role players from bothering those who did not wish to role play.
<p>
One of the problems that face a game that is designed to be a role playing game is the diversity of what people define role playing to be.
<p>
To most role players, role playing is getting inside the characters race and class and developing a persona for that character. Creating a history and beliefs and living life within the ideals of what their character would have.
<p>
The idea of openly discussing last night"s football game in general say or shout would be disdained and the ooc channel is in existence for that very thing.
Role playing hostilities would be kept in character and not allowed to flow over to personal vendetta between players.
<p>
One of my memories of role playing a dark elf was denying a druid a buff under the premise that as an enemy to the Tierdel people I would not help him slay our guards. I always sent a tell to go along with my say to confirm that I was role playing and was not just being mean.
<p>
In the early days I usually got tells back saying "hehe no problem" and then they would respond in say with comments such as "bah that is what I would expect from a vial Dark elf such as you". This however changed to where more and more you would just get flamed and insulted. Often with profanity being thrown at you in a context defiantly not intended to be taken with an in game theme.
<p>
If you are a reader who does not role play let me give you a taste of some of the things in game I have experienced while role playing.
<p>
Imagine if you will a guild of 40 plus dark elves preparing to defend their city from the imminent onslaught of humans and elves. The edge of Nektulos forest alive with the sounds of a dark elf army ready for war.
<p>
East commons finds itself home to an army of paladins, elves and other warriors of light, shouting their disdain for the vial Tierdel that inhabit the nearby forest of eternal night.
Both army"s move forward and suddenly the common lands are alive with the sounds of war, and the forces of light and dark battle for supremacy.
<p>
How many of you have witnessed and been a part of such an event?
<p>
How many of you that have not would like to be?
<p>
With the game as it stands, it is not very likely that you will be. I have not seen a guild war in years and the last one I saw had no reason for happening other than for the sake of it, just to experience it.
<p>
If role playing was more prominent the game would be different in many ways. More GM events would take place, more fantasy flavor would be in the air, and guilds would have another reason to exist.
<p>
EQ is still a fantastic game and offers things that very few games can. It still leaves you logging of with a worthwhile feeling and the fact that what you did today matters tomorrow. It still is, in my mind, king of the MMORPG genre and will hopefully continue to be so.
<p>
A part of me cannot help but wonder however, what could it have become if role playing would have survived?
<p>
For the most part, EQ players now accept or go along with what the game has become and have let go of the what if.
<p>
Still though I have conversations with players that remember the golden age, and wonder how much more EQ would be if role play was alive...
<I><p>
"Well now, if you want to find out more about the area from the locals then remember to speak to them in simple speech and don"t confuse them to much. Your rooms are ready for you when you wish to retire. Ill keep the fire stoked to keep you warm tonight. Oh and um if you hear any strange howling outside, I would suggest you just pull the covers over your head and keep your eyes closed. Good night and may you sleep well hehe."</I>
