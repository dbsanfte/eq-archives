We had multiple things every day almost.  Some of these I have not created static pages for yet and they are only news posts, so just scroll down to see them.  Monday we had <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/?cat=4">6 exclusive Omens of War screenshots</a>.  Tuesday we had <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Fanfic.Detail&id=41&category_select_id=8">part two</a> of the fan fiction series entitled "Stumbling First Steps".  Wednesday we had a new Topic of the Week asking <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=74073206&replies=0">"What is your favorite zone?"</a>, and a fun riddle sent over by SOE.  Thursday we had an exclusive new NPC called <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=117">The Dragorn</a>, and our weekly exclusive Alternate Advancement Ability - this week for Shamans.  Friday we had a look at the new Druid spell called "Oaken Guard" and the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/images/bersepicart.jpg">artwork</a> for the Beastlord Epic in Omens of War.<br><br>When it comes to news this week, very little seems to have happened.  No daily developer corner and EQ Live updates - my guess is because the team is away at GenCon.<br><br>Remember if you guys have anything you want us to post please <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/siteinfo/mail.php">submit it</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sat 21 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#893<br>Printed On: Fri Dec 17 3:25:43 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
