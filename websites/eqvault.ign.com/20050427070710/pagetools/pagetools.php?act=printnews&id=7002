Some players want to experience as many different aspects of the game as possible, but may not have enough time to play multiple character types.  Other players with the time and skills to devote to the game will find new avenues of reward opening to them within the game.<br><br>The secondary market for online games has grown tremendously over the past few years, fueled by games like EverQuest II.  More and more of our players take part in non-sanctioned activities, which have lead to a host of problems for our customers, including fraud.<br><br>By establishing a legitimate outlet for these activities, SOE will be a leader in determining the future direction and growth for this emerging market.  Once again, we at Sony Online Entertainment are blazing a trail for the online gaming genre, just as we did six years ago with EverQuest.<br><br>Station Exchange provides players a way to take part in this growing secondary market in a more secure manner.<br><br>Since all the Exchange activities take place within SOE’s servers and game worlds, each party is comfortable knowing that he or she will systematically receive his or her side of the transaction.<br><br>Station Exchange will initially be rolled out to new EverQuest II servers, after which we will gauge the success of the program and determine whether (and how) to bring these features to other current and future titles.  This will also allow us to determine the demand for these activities within our games. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> How is this going to work? <br><br> <br> Station Exchange allows secure player-to-player transactions of characters, items and coin through SOE’s game servers.  When a player opts to sell the use of something within the game, that item is immediately removed from the game world for the duration of the auction and placed in a holding space within an SOE Exchange server. <br><br>For the duration of the auction, the item or character cannot be accessed by the listing party.  The “seller” will be able to list the item or character on the Station Exchange website, and will be charged a nominal listing fee.  SOE’s Exchange server will provide the game community with stats on the item or character that is listed so that potential bidders can see exactly what they will be bidding on. <br><br>When an auction is completed, the final bidder will receive a notification that the auction has been completed and that he or she has won the right to use the item or character being bid upon. The buyer will then need to make payment via the credit card on file with the Station Exchange service.  Once the Exchange server has completed the transaction with the seller’s PayPal account (minus a percentage of the transaction price), the item or character will be transferred to the buyer’s game account.<br><br>Upon logging into the game after payment is made, the winning bidder will find the item attached to an email sent to the in-game mailbox of the avatar he or she selected on the Station Exhange website, or the new character will appear in a character slot.<br> <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> How will this affect me as a player? <br><br> <br> We will be introducing new servers that will be Exchange-enabled.  Over time, we will look at possibly enabling Exchange on current servers -- based on the desires and activities of our communities.<br><br>Players who wish to join an Exchange server will be given an opportunity to transfer one or more characters to that server, at no charge for the transfer.  Once a character is added to or created on an Exchange server it can not be moved to a non-Exchange server. However, if we activate Station Exchange on a previously existing server, players who wish to transfer to a non-Exchange server will also be given an option to transfer their characters off of the Exchange server, at no charge for the transfer. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Will I now own EverQuest II characters, items and/or coin? <br><br> <br> No.  The User Agreement and Software License, to which you agreed when you installed the game and to which you agree every time you launch the game, makes it clear that you have no ownership rights in characters, items and coin -- what you have is the right to use them in accordance with the license agreement, the rules of conduct of the game, and SOE's terms of service.  When SOE launches Station Exchange, SOE will permit you to "sell" and "buy" that right to use characters, items and coin.  In "lawyerese," you will be buying and/or selling a limited license right, not an ownership right. <br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wed 20 Apr 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#7002<br>Printed On: Wed Apr 27 0:07:10 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
