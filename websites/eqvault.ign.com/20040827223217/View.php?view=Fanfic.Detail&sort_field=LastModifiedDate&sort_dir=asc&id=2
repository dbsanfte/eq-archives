<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
Taking out his tacks n hammer, this old troll firmly secures a parchment upon the old town hall. Written on this parchment is the darkened story of a fallen knight.
<br>
<br>The Shadowknight walked down an open field in the karana's with a pack slung over his back. It was filled with an assortment of things ranging from rations to this days earnings. Seeming a bit exhausted he sat down on a nearby rock and looked into the bag.
<br>
<br>"Kaeltius, you idiot, you forgot to stock up on rations again." He stated to no one in particular.
<br>
<br>Kaeltius is what some would consider a normal looking dark elf. He wasent particulary tall nor short, and wasent built like a tank, just someone who adventures often. One particular feature others noticed when talking to him or meeting their end by him (whichever the case was) was his gold eyes. They seem to show hatred as all do but a numerous other things, but thats not what others saw or felt.
<br>
<br>Whenever he looked at someone with an intense gaze they could swear he could see right into them, their mind and soul. He always told them it was silly superstition but it did come in handy when he wanted the truth from someone.
<br>
<br>He picked over the various foods within his pack, some bread, fish, water, and of course an assortment of alcohol. He pulled out another small bag, his earnings. Grabbing an ale out from the pack he started to drink while looking into the bag.
<br>
<br>"Gnoll's arte getting cheap lately, barely find any money on them anymore. Wow, it's almost as if they exp-"
<br>
<br>He stopped mid-sentence and looked around. After deciding it was nothing he went back to looking into the bag. His mind drifted off from his task of counting money however. Lately he had began to contemplate his life, if evil was truly the way he should go. Long and hard he had thought about this, his heart wavering on the balance between throwing everything away or not.
<br>
<br>He had always done his duties as a Shadowknight and caused evil and hatred wherever he went, but he also always believed there was more than hatred.
<br>
<br>He suddenly heard a snapping sound behind him, and his ears picked up a whistling. He ducked out of the way just as the arrow was about to reach him. Picking up his sword he now ducked behind the rock.
<br>
<br>"He is close by the sound of that. WHO ATTACKS ME!?" He shouted out.
<br>
<br>"No concern of your's shadowknight! All you need be concerned with now is your life!"
<br>
<br>A dozen arrows whizzed by now, and heavy footfalls with clanky armor comming at him.
<br>
<br>'Paladins by the feel of the aura, and rangers judging by those shots.' Kaeltius thought to himself.
<br>
<br>'I will not make it out...'
<br>
<br>
<br>Kaeeltius jumped out from behind as he heard the footfalls about 5 feet away. He surprised the first paladin and caught him at the side where his chestplate did not go. The sword went right into the heart. The second paladin made an overhead arching slash at Kaeltius. Kaeltius grabed the paladins wrist befoe the knight could bring his sword down.
<br>
<br>Pain shot through the knights body as kaeltius's hand was glowin bright red. The shadowknight brought his sword up and into the throught of his opponent. Three other Paladin's advanced.
<br>
<br>'three left four rangers... gah...huh? These paladins.... Koada'Dal? But why are they out this far?' Kaeltius thought.
<br>
<br>He did not even get a chance to advance on the rest before an arrow struck him dead in the throat. He fell to the ground with a sickening thud.
<br>
<br>
<br>In sometime later Kaeltius woke up, he could feel himself shackled to a wall. Stone walls surounded him and a door with a small barred window was directly ahead of him. His neck hurt badly and he felt as though he could barely speak.
<br>
<br>A Koada'Dal whom was heavily armored walked into his cell.
<br>
<br>"In case you were wondering..." He said peering at Kaeltius.
<br>"The arrow struck to the side, it wasent ment to kill you but did manage to knick you're jugular. Our clerics healed you in time. Our orders were to bring a shadowknight, any at all, back live for questioning. We thought that out in the ope-"
<br>
<br>"What make....*cough*...makes... you think I care."
<br>
<br>Kaeltius strained as hard as he could to talk. He faced his palms at the man before him and tried to muster his dark magic. He found he could not, and when he did so the Koada'Dal laughed.
<br>
<br>"We have runes all around, there is no way to reach your lord or even summon any powers from within. You are now helpless you disgusting filthy peice of scum. Torture is not exactly my favorite way of doing things, but as of late we need to know any and all brewings in Neriak."
<br>
<br>He walked out and a few scraggly looking men walked in with devil like grins.
<br>
<br>
<br>2 Years later.
<br>
<br>Kaeltius now lay within his prison, his arms broken at every bone and his legs the same. He had made his final decision long ago, hate was the only true path he wanted to walk. As he lie there he kept whispering this to himself over and over, his throat and mouth now dry, it made it hard for him to even this much.
<br>
<br>He started to hear something, he could have sworn he saw the very shadows move within his cell.
<br>
<br>"I....I've finally... lost my mind."
<br>
<br>He strained out a small laugh and then coughed a bit. His throat felt like it was set on fire with the cough and he strained to stop.
<br>
<br>The shadows gathered and begin forming into what looked like a heavily cloaked man.
<br>
<br>'ok.... yup... I have now lost it, aren't I the happiest of people"
<br>He thought to himself.
<br>
<br>"No, far from it, you are still quite sane Kaeltius. Even after all these years of pain and torture you still remain quite sane."
<br>
<br>"how..." Kaeltius strained.
<br>
<br>The thing of darkness now was directly in fronmt of him, it had kneeled so it could see directly into his eyes.
<br>
<br>"I can read your mind Kaeltius. Yes I can read it and see what you think, want, and need. Quite odd actually considering that your want is to get out, and your need is revenge. I say it is odd because at this point ones thoughts goes tward needing food and water." It said as it began to walk around him.
<br>
<br>The moss covered floors stopping the sounds of footfalls.
<br>
<br>"I have an option to add to your fate, other than dieing of course. You see I am part of a great entity, one quite known. Why yes I am somewhat pure evil.... no I do not serve Innoruuk...Why yes I do know...no no I do not... well sometimes...look, will you stop asking so many questions and just listen!!"
<br>
<br>The patience of this creature seemed to wear thin with the unlimited questions in Kaeltius's mind.
<br>
<br>"I am here to give you a new power, one to get out of this place of filth and get you're revenge while doing it."
<br>
<br>'Wow... let me guess, all i have to do is serve you, right?'
<br>Kaeltius thought.
<br>
<br>"No, you still serve Innoruuk as you hopefully want... but you will belong to me."
<br>
<br>'Annnnnd you are?'
<br>
<br>"I am the darkness itself Kaeltius... that which encompasses all in the night."
<br>
<br>'Darkness? a living entity? ok i know now, i HAVE gone insane and you are some kind of major delusion.'
<br>
<br>"Oh?"
<br>
<br>The thing just touched his back and Kaeltius felt his breathing become easier, his throat and mouth no longer dry and cracking.
<br>
<br>"Ok... so you are real... how come I have never heard about you?" Kaeltius asked now finding it much easier to talk.
<br>
<br>"You are still young and know little, and in these past two years. In the last two years you have lost all of you're power Kaeltius. I cannot bring it back to you but i can however restore you're body and give you strength. In return you must agree to belong to me alone to kill all that bring light, to become another of mine to help spread despair-"
<br>
<br>"Ya ya ya, I heard it all before you are gonna go on for hours about evil and crap, cut the talk shit and get me out of here so I can get to the action!" Kaeltius yelled impatiently.
<br>
<br>"Very well then."
<br>
<br>The darkness began to gather around Kaeltius, seeping into his body. He began to feel stronger now, his limbs however began to hurt vary painfully. His arms shot out and twisted around cracking loudly, his bones were being set back into place and instantly healed. The same with the rest of his body happened.
<br>
<br>He stood up to see that the thing was no longer in his cell. It didn't matter anymore he felt strong enough to break the door down. To his surprised as he rammed it with his shoulder, it did break down.
<br>
<br>Two guards began running down a spiral of stairs at him.
<br>
<br>"Wait Kaeltius, I shall handle them right now, you get your revenge on the others later." He heard a whisper in his mind.
<br>
<br>As soon as the guards stepped into the shadows, out from the light of the torches, the darkness moved around them quickly and swallowed them whole. Kaeltius understood and began making his exodus. On his way out he picked up the sword from one of the guards.
<br>
<br>"Later, outside"
<br>
<br>Kaeltius now stood looking up at a tall tower. It was night when he finally snuck out and breathed the air. The shadows snaked up the tower and crushed it into pebble.
<br>
<br>Kaeltius then began his journey back to his home.
<br>
<br>"You gonna be with me on my way home?" He asked to no one in particular, he got an answer.
<br>
<br>"You have entered into a pact now, you have put yourself amung us. We are always with you..."
