<B>The Birth of a Gamer</B>
<I>by Duane Covalt</I>

<p>
Before I begin to talk to you about the fun there is to be had in the world of Everquest, let me give you a brief background of my previous gaming history. I first started playing online games when I was about 14-15 years old. I started out with this little MUD that I found one afternoon when I was bored. The title of this little bit of fun for me was known as Phantasia4. I can't really bring much light to this game, as it's been so long, but I'll always remember it because it was my first online game, it was a MUD, and it was my first interaction with a D&D type atmosphere. I would stay up late in to the nights, even school nights, alone on the server, trying to better my last record. At one point, I was -the- #1 man in the game. At this point I began trying to find ways to help better the game, giving my ideas as to what would maybe make some areas easier, and some others harder. This was my first taste of "beta" testing a game, and really my only time that I've actually "beta" tested anything.
<p>
After my fun had been had with this new "phenomena," a friend introduced me to the world of "Ultima Online." I entered the game when Player Killer's, also termed as PK's or "red's," were rampant. Many people found this to be a huge turn off to the game, and went to a new "other" game on the market, also known as Everquest (we'll get to this title later). Running from PK's is what made Ultima Online's environment so fun for me. It was like survival of the fittest in a virtual world. Soon, after learning much about the lands, and common/uncommon routes, I found it was actually very possible to enjoy a peaceful time playing with friends I trusted and knew would not take advantage of me. Some people who left the game so early, didn't take the time to explore the "out of the way" places and were the ones who were taken advantage of by the PK'ing "griefers." Once I learned more about the game, I eventually made my own PK. It was truly a whole new side to the game. Words can't express the adrenaline rush I would get, when I would unleash all sorts of fury on a few peasants, and then a huge mob would be formed to hunt me down. I would spend hours running from mobs, and they would spend just as long chasing me. As redundant as that sounds, sometimes I would still be running, and the mob would have died off without me knowing. So there I would be, running around like a fool thinking this hoard was still after me. I played Ultima Online for several years, trying out different servers, making new friends, and learning new classes and their little tricks they had. Eventually my "curiosity" with this attraction wore off, and I found a new "shiny" to direct my time and attention towards.
<p>
This new curiosity is known as Dark Age of Camelot. This was exactly the type of game I'd been looking for, for so long. Huge realm wars going on with up to 500 people fighting at once. Epic battles that are still talked about, even 2 years after the release of the game. This game honed my "player Vs player" skills as a "gamer." I didn't realize I was a "gamer" until a friend pointed out that I was nuts having 2 computers and more then 1 account for one little game. That is to say, he was like that until I had him play one of my characters and the two of us went out hunting little dwarves and Norse. After that excursion, he went out and bought a new computer and the game. We began playing regularly together, and he is now able to admit himself as well now, that he to is a "gamer." The novelty of huge wars and epic battles soon war of though, as to me the designers of the game didn't live up to the deals they had offered. Don't get me wrong, the game was/is great, but for me it just wasn't the thing any longer.
<p>
At this point I decided to take a break in the gaming industry, that is I'd decided to not play anymore games, until a friend of mine introduced me to the title Everquest. At this point I knew enough about gaming in general, that I needed to do some research on it. So I spent 2 weeks learning about the game, the history, the technical ins and outs of each class. I've been playing the game for about 2 months, and am nearly to the highest attainable level which is currently 65. Another month or so and I should hit it. This game completely captivates me, more so then UO or DAoC or any other game that I've failed to mention has so far. The Player Vs Environment, also known as PvE, depth of this game is insane. There is so, so, so much one could do, and literally never finish doing the things the rest of the game has to offer. It's really a work of art, the game itself, as far as story outlines and quests go. It's really been an eye opener to a whole new gaming world as opposed to the games previously mentioned. Many knock EQ because raids can go for days and days. In all realness, the same goes for raids in DAoC, so I can't really see how the ones raiding day in and day out in one game, can say it's "lame" to raid day in and day out in another game. The methods and reasons are completely different, but the outcomes are really the same. Everyone enjoys themselves in some way or another.
<p>
This really closes out my thoughts on gaming as a whole. People "game" because it is enjoyable. They have fun doing it and continue doing it as new interests arise. Personally, I will be dedicated to Everquest for sometime, as I have made numerous friends; the relationships and story lines that have evolved with some of them, are very real to me. So for those out there who currently game, keep enjoying yourselves and the company of others. To those who are new to the world or curious about stepping your foot into it, I invite you to dive into the world that is Norrath, and undertake all sorts of adventures! To those that are tired of gaming, have been there from the start, open your eyes to what really keeps you playing, and the people that are there beside you.
