(Unless it deals with making up lame rhymes, that’s my job)<br><br>Here are a couple of the more specialized areas that we’re looking for help in:<br><br><b><i>Guide & Strategy Writers</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Write guides to whatever you would like!  If your specialty is the level 25-29 game, write a guide for it!  We will accept anything and everything as long as the info is good.<br><br><b><i>Community News Reporters</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Are you level 65 with a gazillion AA and keep up with all the latest drama on every server?  If so, we want you!  Come report what’s going on each server.  Who killed what first, what guild just advanced to where – you name it!  <br><br><b><i>EverQuest Online Adventures Reporters</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Post the latest and greatest news dealing with SOE’s Playstation 2 EverQuest title.<br><br><b><i>Fan Fiction Writers</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Do you enjoy writing about EverQuest?  Well then let us publish your work!  Only requirement is if you start a story I’d like for you to finish it.  Nothing stinks worse then having a half-finished story sitting around forever.<br><br><b><i>Artists</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Got a flare for the arts?  Show off your skills!  If you enjoy drawing, painting, making CG, or anything else dealing with EQ we would love to put it on our site!<br><br><b><i>Humor columnist</i></b><br><br>Responsibility: Is everyone laughing with you (or at you…)?  Think you can write some funny articles about EverQuest?  Let us know! <br><br><br>We are always open to suggestions for new writers.  If you want to do anything else, such as general news or fan fiction, send me an e-mail as well!<br><br>Please note all positions are purely volunteer, but established staffers get some perks. And please remember we do not cover EverQuest 2.<br><br><b>If you’re interested in any of these positions e-mail <a href="mailto:draknorr@vaultnetwork.com">draknorr@vaultnetwork.com</a> with what you would like to do and if possible, an example of previous work. </b></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thu 12 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#193<br>Printed On: Tue Dec 21 17:13:44 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
