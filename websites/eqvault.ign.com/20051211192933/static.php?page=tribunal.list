  </font></strong>Updated on August 16, 2005




<p>Complied by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! </p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.glass-cube.com/forums/index.php?act=an" target="_blank"><strong>Aurora
Noctum</strong><br>
</a>&quot;So you think you have what it takes to become a member of Aurora Noctum?
Firstly you must read and understand the information provided on our Membership
Requests
forum. You must measure up to our character requirements, before you will
even
be considered for membership. These can be found in our Character Requirements
  thread. You must also understand the information written in the Guild Requirements
  thread. If you are satisfied you understand and meet all listed requirements,
you must then decide a few things.<br>
  <br>
  Are you prepared to make the commitment we require of our members? We are a
  guild that plays hard. We do not tolerate casual attitudes. We are here to
  play as a guild for the guild, and you must be prepared to give your
  Everquest time to us.<br>
  <br>
  Are you able to follow directions quickly and efficently, from raid leaders
  and officers who are often quite harsh, without losing your cool?<br>
  We do not
  mess around on serious raids, you must be prepared to pay attention 100% and
  play to the best of your ability, following the directions of the
  officers and raid leaders.<br>
  <br>
  Are you going to bring drama to this guild?<br>
  We are a no bullshit guild, if you
  thrive on creating problems or tension with other members or the leadership
  or if you are prone to whining, take it
  elsewhere, we don't want it.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, do your goals in Everquest correspond with ours?<br>
  We are here to push
  through the hardest content the game has to offer at any given time. We are
  here to raid, its what we do, what we exist for.<br>
  <br>
  If this is what you want from your Everquest time, and you believe you satisfy
  all listed requirements, then read about our recruitment process, and follow
  the application template in this thread to make an application on our Membership
Requests forum. 
<p>Aurora Noctum is always recruiting. We are always looking to add skilled,
  active players to the guild, people who want to challenge and push their limits
  in Everquest, work as part of a team to beat some of the hardest content the
  game has to offer, and have fun in the process! <br>
  We play during off peak hours, and are primarily Australian (and we hide some
  kiwi&#8217;s here and there), on The Tribunal server.<br>
  As a member you will be subject to some very challenging content, you will
  die, a lot. You must be able to retain your patience, keep a good attitude
  and follow directions efficiently. If you are easily frustrated, distracted,
  prone to whining or creating drama, then this guild is not for you. We cuss,
  swear and mess around a lot. If you are offended by obscene / bad language,
  dirty jokes, or anything else of this nature, look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Guild Requirements and Information<br>
Aurora Noctum is a mandatory raiding guild.
  You must attend any raid that is called while you are online. We raid 3 to
  5 times a week. Our raids fall
  between 7pm and 12:30am, Sunday through Thursday, AEST (Australian Eastern
  Standard Time). Members are expected to be able to attend a majority of these
  raids, from start to finish (around 60%). Friday and Saturday are nights off,
  and raids will only fall on these nights under special circumstances, usually
with very advanced notice. You must be up to standard against the character requirements
listed in the Character Requirements thread.</p>
<p>Things all our members are required to have.<br>
  Enduring Breath Item<br>
  Self Shrink<br>
  Self Invis<br>
  Instant Click Item (usable both indoors and outdoors)<br>
Flag and Key Requirements<br>
Kod&#8217;Taz flag is preferred (this flag is easily
one groupable, if you join without it, you'll be expected to get it).<br>
Qvic flag is a BIG bonus.<br>
However good players don't always come from heavy raiding
backgrounds, so we are semi-flexible on flags, be sure to have a chat with an
officer if you
are unsure.</p>
<p>Class Requirements<br>
  These are the rough class standards we expect applicants
  to have, if you are not close to these it means you will have a hard time contributing
  to raids.
  The AA abilities are an ideal template, but we will discuss your setup with
  you during your application.<br>
  Requirements listed under &quot;Other&quot; are things (mostly spells) necessary
  for you to be able to effectively contribute to our raids, and you will be
expected to get them if you join without them.</p>
<p>All members are required to have an accurate Magelo Profile, including AA&#8217;s.
  If you don&#8217;t have one, go to Magelo and make one before applying. You
  must disband from any previous guild and not be currently applying to another
  guild before you will be considered by us. We are only interested in
  people who are committed to becoming a part of Aurora Noctum. You may not own
  another character in another guild while you are a member of Aurora Noctum.</p>
<p>If you are a server transfer, you should apply and contact us before moving
  servers and if you are approved, we will ask you to transfer and guild you
  on arrival. Don&#8217;t expect a guild invite just by moving to The Tribunal
  on a whim.</p>
<p>The character you join with is the character we expect you to play. We don&#8217;t
  allow switching of &#8220;mains&#8221; except under very special circumstances,
  and we expect members to work on improving their chosen character. &#8220;
  2-boxing&#8221; an &#8220;Alt&#8221; character
  on a raid is subject to officer approval, but we do welcome and reward the
  effort. We use an &#8220;Attendance Points&#8221; and
  bidding system to award loot. This system is run by the guilds leadership and
  is modifiable completely at
  our discretion.<br>

<p><a href="http://bhur.silverwordz.com/" target="_blank">Bhur Gcairde</a><br>
  A roleplay guild. &quot;We are a friend and family orientated guild, that enjoys
    getting together in the spirit of adventure and aiding each other in any
way we can. </p>
<p>We try to have weekly events within the guild, to get things done, and to
  enjoy the company of each other. We are laid back, and interested in promoting
  roleplay when we can. </p>
<p>Our guild name literally means Your Friends, and we strive to keep Norrath
a friendly place in the interest of making sure everyone has a good time. </p>
<p>Bhur Gcairde is a family, not a hardcore group of raiders.
      We get things done for each other though, and get together once a week
  as a guild (mondays), plus random get togethers, guild groups etc.&quot;<br>
  <br>
<a href="http://home.nc.rr.com/bloodline/main.html" target="_blank">Bloodlines</a><br>
&quot;An adult guild. Bloodlines is an Everquest guild on the Tribunal server. We
strive
to
keep
things
fun, while raiding 2-3 times a week.</p>
<p>Guild Focus: <br>
  Newly reformed, we are currently working to expand our roster again. Our plans
    include working through PoP and GoD progression, epic completion, and other
    various targets as we feel the need.</p>
<p>Member Expectations:<br>
  Bloodlines strives to retain a good relationship with those guilds and people
    that we share a server with. We have zero tolerance for open hostility in
public channels. Circumstances dictate the punishment as we see fit. Obvious
    crimes such as ninja looting, intentional training, or acts of equal nonsense
    are
grounds for immediate removel. We like to keep a casual atmosphere here. Joking
    and having fun is encouraged, being a complete asshat is not. Politics and
    Religion are forbidden fruit,
  this is a game played worldwide because of a common interest. Do not let real
world opinions spark heated debates. Everquest aggression... We play this game
    cause we like it. Moaning about the latest reason Sony hates your class is
    something for your class boards.
Keep it off of our boards and out of our guildchat.</p>
<p>We don't outline specific punishments for specific crimes. This leaves room
  for abuse. We want good natured fun here and will deal with situations as we
  feel they should be delt with. We take our friends and guildmates seriously.
Those that spark turmoil will be weeded out, fast.</p>
<p>All recruits will go for 2 weeks or 6 raids, whichever comes first. At the
  end of that time there will be an all guild member vote. If there is more then
  2 no votes, the reasons will be investigated and officers will decide to either
extend probation or reject the recruit.</p>
<p>At the current time level 60 is required for recruitment. Everyone must fill
  out the application, and be sure to add a link for your magelo. Class requirements
  are not available at the moment as we are in the process of rebuilding and
recruitment is open to all classes.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://eq2legacy.com/" target="_blank">Corripe Cervisiam</a><br>
  (formerly Red Legion.) &quot;Hello and welcome to Corripe Cervisiam. We are a small
    and friendly guild comprised of a group of RL friends and online friends
    as well. We are just a group of misfits that love to play the game, chat,
  group together, help out each other and enjoy all that Norrath has to offer.&quot; </p>

An Asian language guild.</p>
<p><a href="http://im.ferrium.org/viewnews.php" target="_blank">Incursio Meretricis</a><br>
  &quot;IM Is currently recruiting all classes level 65+. If you like to have fun,
  love to raid, and want to see yourself advance further into EQ in a friendly
  and non-threatening environment, then IM is the place for you. Please feel
  free to post an app and look for Maclyon, Kess, Muzzey, or one of the other
  officers in game for more information. We look forward to seeing you in guild
chat soon.<br>
<br>
These are the current
  requirements, but the class officer has the final say. If you are a little
  lacking, get in touch with your class leader or myself. We have the final say.
  So remember, don't worry if you don't meet all the requirements, just get with
one of us. </p>
<p>Requirements for All Classes: <br>
  Lvl 65+ <br>
  EB Item <br>
  Insta-click Item <br>
  Self-Invis <br>
  Self-Shrink <br>
  EP Flagged a Major Plus <br>
  Be Unguilded <br>
  Basic knowledge of the game <br>
  Know where zones are and how to get there <br>
Love to raid </p>
<p>Here's the basic outline of our recruitment policy. Can also /join IMRecruits.
  This will be updated at a later date, but for now these are the guildlines
recruits/recruiters must follow: </p>
<p>1.) All recruits MUST be unguilded. We will NOT recruit from other guilds.
  Doing so shows bad karma and lack of respect for other guilds and will not
  be tolerated.<br>
  2.) Recruits usernames for the boards and the EQDKP system MUST
  be the same as their in-game character. This is the only way we will know who
  you are and
  the only way you will be allowed to get DKP since we use a parser.<br>
  3.) IM isn't
  a guild that is all about us. One of our main goals will be to not only advance
  as a guild, but to be friendly and helpful even to those not
  in the guild. Anyone with a ME ME ME attitude should look elsewhere.<br>
  4.) While
  no PU raid will ever be a required attendance, it will be strongly recommended
  that you be willing to participate in them. We will continue to
  run Macsraids, and guildies WILL earn DKP for them. This is just another way
  that we can advance ourselves as a guild and also help out the rest of Norrath.<br>
  5.)
  Negetive Nancies need not apply. Just remember, this is a game, there's no
  reason to drown out someones fun because you feel like constantly being
  in a bad mood. Have a positive outlook and you will go far.<br>
  6.) It is HIGHLY
  ENCOURAGED that new recruits join us on our Ventrilo Server. We'll just continue
  to use the same channel we do on Macsraids, but everyone
is more than welcome to be in there. Info is below.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqlegendary.com/" target="_blank">Legendary Companions</a><br>
  &quot;We are primarily a GMT/Euro guild. We generally raid from 2pmEST/7pmGMT to
  6pmEST/11pmGMT pm weekdays, and noonEST/5pmGMT until 6pmEST/11pmGMT on weekends.
  Currently our raid days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
  If you are unable to play during this time slot, then we are not the guild
  for you. We are currently interested in adding a few more active and dedicated
  raiders to our team, if you are interested in joining please read all of the
following information carefully. </p>
<p>After you have read all of the recruitment information thouroughly, if you
  have any questions about our raid times, our requirements, our recruitment
  process or anything else please do not hesitate to get in touch with one of
  our recruitment officers either in game or via a private message on the board. </p>
<p>Please do not apply if you do not meet the general requirements and those
  from your class (click on class name below to see class specific requirements).<br>

Barons</a> <br>
A French language guild.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lostfires.net/main.html" target="_blank">Lost Fires</a><br>
  &quot;Lost Fires is always looking for new family members that have the same attitudes
  as we do and play their characters in a manner that is above and beyond the
common player. Lost Fires is currently accepting applications
from all classes with the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>-Level 65+<br>
  - Completed following flags: PoS/PoV, BoT, HoH or AD, PoTactics
  or MB, CoD(A) or Grummus, CoD(B) or Caprin, PoN(B) or Hedge run, Terris Thule,
  Tallon Zek,
Vallon Zek, HoH1 - Rydar Dar HoH2 - Villagers HoH3 - Nomads<br>
-Priest classes must
have MGB<br>
Recruitment is permanently closed to the whiney, immature, and selfish
.</p>
<p>To be considered for membership, applicants must be unguilded at the time
  of application up until receiving their tag or denial. Multiple guild applications
  are also frowned upon. We're looking for select, dedicated individuals and
will reject any that have spammed out applications. Qualified candidates will
  exhibit good citizenship to those of Norrath, as well as a good knowledge of
and command of their characters skills.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mithrilheartbrigade.org/" target="_blank">Mithril Heart
Bridgade</a><br>
&quot;The Mithril Hearts are looking for a few good people. We do mean people. We
do
not recruit on class or level. We are concerned mainly with the players behind
the pixels, not the characters, but we do have some basic requirements for the
characters. Although we consider ourselves a &#8220;family raiding&#8221; guild,
and striving for the best of both worlds, basic requirements are necessary so
that our raiding time is used efficiently.</p>
<p>Your main character must be 58+, 60+ preferred. Be aware that most of our
  members are 62+, and we raid in 60+ zones. If you do not have either the level
  or the key required to access that zone, you will be unable to raid with us
  until you work to get either the key or the level. That does not mean we do
  not want you, but you will have to work a bit harder with your class leader
  and with other members of MHB to get to know us. Only your main will be accepted
  into the guild for the probationary period. After the probationary period is
  over, you may enter any and all of your alts into the guild. You must play
  your designated main character at least 5 months after joining the guild as
  a full member.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<a href="http://mh.guildwizard.com/" target="_blank">Mystic Horizon</a>
<br>
&quot;Did you read the requirements and do you meet them?? If no, please come back
at a later date when you have reached them. We are not waiving these requirements
under any circumstances.
<p>2. Are you willing to raid? We are a raiding guild. Its what we do. If you
  dont like to raid, please do not apply. If you want a guild where this doesnt
  matter, there are alot of guilds who would be more than happy to take you into
  their home. Mystic Horizon members wish to progress and see the higher ends
  of the game.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehouseofrequiem.com/" target="_blank">Requiem</a><br>
  &quot;All trials must have: <br>
  120+ unbuffed in all resists <br>
  Insta click junk buff item <br>
  Enduring Breath item <br>
  Extended Casting Range, Shrink, Gate, and Invis items highly recommended <br>
  All expansions - install zone maps! <br>
  A stable internet connection and the ability to commit to extended periods
  of time raiding on a frequent basis. <br>
Flagged for KT highly recommended, or must complete Tipt during trial period.<br>
<br>
  We are no longer raiding PoP regularly, so you should not expect to get lower
    tier flags. However, we regularly do have Flagshare available, and with patience,
you will be able to get alternate flags to Time. </p>
<p>We will consider any application of those meeting the following criteria : <br>
  Level 70 <br>
  150+ AA <br>
  EP quality gear <br>
  KT flagged </p>
<p>Highly needed classes may be accepted with less so check our individual class
requirements.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guildrip.com/" target="_blank">Rest in Peace</a> <br>
&quot;We are currently taking applications from players meeting these requirements:</p>
<p>ACTIVE! Playing during the 8pm-12am EST time slot, at least 4 nights per week. <br>
  Level 70 <br>
  AA requirements vary by class (see below) but in general you should have at
  least 250 AA <br>
  Kod'Taz flagged (Txevu flagged is a major plus) <br>
  Must have all expansions up through Dragons of Norrath <br>
  All caster applicants are expected to have Spell Casting Mastery 3 and MGB
  if applicable. <br>
  All melee applicants are expected to have Natural Durability 3 and Physical
  Enhancement <br>
  All tank applicants are expected to have Innate Defense and Lightning Reflexes
  5 <br>
  All healing applicants are expected to have or be workign on Healing Adept
  and Gift <br>
  The ability to work as part of a team <br>
  While we make efforts to flag recruits, the onus is on the applicant to make
  sure they have the necesary flags to raid with us. If you are not KT flagged
  it is highly unlikely you will make enough guild events to have a chance at
  acceptance. The importance of completing Tipt and Vxed in Discord can not be
  emphasized enough. It's easy to find Rest in Peace members to HELP you with
  your flags, but we will not do them FOR you. While we also raid OoW and DoN
  events, many of our events will be in the restricted-access zones of Discord.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rivervalemafia.net/" target="_blank">The Rivervale Mafia</a><br>
  First, think real hard about joining a guild with a web site titled &#8220;The
Rivervale Mafia&#8221;.</p>
<p>You still want to join? Well heck. Who are we to stand in the way of progress?
  The membership rules are simple: You must first be known by a Group Leader
  or Lieutenants. If you can&#8217;t
  figure out who these people are, well then sadly you are a dork and your membership
  dreams will go unfulfilled.</p>
<p>*You must have a certified http://www.magelo.com/ profile.<br>
  *You must have one
account that has all the expansions.<br>
*You must start working on Alcohol Tolerance.
    Once in the guild you need to be working on this skill until max AT ((Level+1)*5
up to max).<br>
*You must have max Swim ((Level+1)*5 up to max).<br>
You must have a Trade Skill above
100. Brewing is a very easy skill to raise to 100, and helps with your AT!<br>
You
must ask, with respect, a Group Leader or Lieutenants to join the guild.<br>
*And
you must not be a dork.</p>
<p>Items marked with an asterisk (*) must be maintained.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. No, there isn&#8217;t a level limitation, a class limitation,
  or other such silliness. Those types of requirements do not weed out dorks.
  We&#8217;re sure if there are too many of one class or another, it will eventually
  work it self out. These rules are universal and apply to your main guild toon
  and any guilded alt toons. If you have an alt you would like to be in the guild,
  they must meet the same criteria. Now, there is an initiation for all recruits
  that occurs some time after they
join..</p>
<p>1. All recruits go through a very short probation period. This is simply a
  matter of grouping with a guild member(s) for an evening of play. Since we
  know you already, we are just determining that something bad didn&#8217;t happen
  to you and you did not turn into a dork for some reason.<br>
  2. If you are a Beast
  Lord, the Boss will send someone over specifically to personally question and
  possibly group with you. It has been our experience
  there are many dorks who play Beast Lords. If you are a Beast Lord and are
  not a dork, please join our guild, this won&#8217;t be painful, we promise.<br>
  3.
  You must show off your alcohol tolerance by purchasing predetermined types
  and quantity of alcohol, and run a fiendishly designed course in Kelethin after
  consuming said alcohol. While SoWed.<br>
  4. Depending on your level, you may be
  required to play &#8220;Where in Norrath
  is Bouwou?&#8221; Rezs are complimentary.<br>
  5. The Boss must approve you. However,
  you will never meet the Boss.<br>
  8. Our Goal as a Guild.<br>
Have fun. Experience content. Group. Raid. Drink. And not run into dorks.<br>
</p>
<p>The guild
    leadership is based on the West Coast of the USA, PST. The guild has 6 officers.
    All 5 officers plus the guild enforcer play the game on a regular basis either
    at home or in a private game LAN in person. This is why you see a high-degree
    of coordination from the guild leadership. We EQ or D&amp;D face-to-face
    at least once a week.</p>
<p>Q: Can you give me more examples of being a dork?</p>
<p>A: Good question Padawan. A dork is like pornography. Hard to exactly describe,
  but you know it when you see it. Excessive whining, ripping people off, disrespect
  for your fellow gamer, stupid shouts and oocs, farming rockhopper hides when
  another group is trying to XP or obtain Luclin Shards&#8230; these are all
  Dork Maneuvers. </p>
<p>Making honest mistakes, wiping the Raid because the cat jumped on the keyboard
  or other catastrophes is non-dorkiness. As long as you are willing to learn
  from your mistakes, we can laugh and move on, celebrating in the chaotic nature
  of an on-line world.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solinvictus.org/eq/default.asp" target="_blank">Sol Invictus</a><br>
  &quot;Sol Invictus is a family orientated guild and as such will not tolerate excessive
    swearing, racial bias and gender bias in any chat channel associated with
    the guild. Many of our members have children that are often at and/or near
there computers and can read what is said.</p>
<p>*EDIT/NOTE* Beastlords fall under monk recruitment, and Berserkers fall under
  rogue recruitment.</p>
<p>1) Read and Review your classes post of requirements and if you meet or are
  close to meeting them contact your Class Leader listed on that post. </p>
<p>HIGH : Feel free to apply if you meet the posted minimums for the class. We
  are looking for a few good men or women with good reputation, who are looking
for, and will fit well into, a guild like SI! </p>
<p>MEDIUM : We have need of 1, maybe 2 members for this class. Selection will
  be a bit more strict, and gear / AA may be more of an issue. You will be expected
  to have a good amount of high end raiding experience, and to quickly fit into
  the guild.</p>
<p>LOW : We are essentially &quot;closed&quot; for this class, but we are always
  accepting applications from exceptional players who are well geared and have
  an extensive AA set, as well as extensive high end raiding experience. Expect
  a trial membership in this class to be very difficult, and more strict as far
  as attendance and play ability (exact numbers for required attendance will
  be given on a case by case basis to applicants in this category.) If you are
  comfortable with this, and feel you have what it takes, please feel free to
  apply. No server transfers for this recruitment level, please. You must be
  native to The Tribunal and / or Ayonae Ro and have an exceptional reputation
  on the server. Also Read and Review the class wide requirements (see below)
  and understand the attendance requirements (see below). By moving to step two
  you acknowledge
  you have read and reviewed this entire post.</p>
<p>2) Contact guild recruiting officers Fatalclaw, or Dolamar ethier by a /tell,
  Email or ingame Email for general information, for class specific information,
  you MUST contact your class leader, once interest is shown the class leader
  will handle all aspects of your recruitment.<br>
  3) If your class is open and you
  have done the above two steps, you will be asked to post an application.</p>
<p>You will need to finish your signet quest for Asylum of Anguish before your
  application will progress. You can still post your application however as long
  as you have contacted Fatalclaw or Dolamar AND your Class Leader, but in-order
  for it to advance past that point it is required for you to have the signets
  done. Application posting, and time standards for CL are not put into effect
until all requirements are met.</p>
<p>Sol Invictus will not hold your hand in getting Signets done. Not to say that
  you are not welcome to ask for help as needed but do not expect it. Many of
  us spent many hours getting our own and guild-mates signets done,
  but many will help if they are able if you ask nicely.<br>
  <br>
Server Transfers are welcome and the above process applies all the same. The
only difference is that your recruitment process may be a bit slower due to the
fact we will be looking into your background. To make this process smoother do
not lie about your background, list a detailed guild and server history. If you
have something to hide don't bother even applying unless you have a good explanation
and points of contact. Do not expect to get into this guild if you are a drama
king/queen, ninja looted and/or any other undesirable act.<br>
  <br>
  Class Wide Requirements<br>
  *Minimum Level requirement is 70.<br>
  *Have an enduring breath item.<br>
  *Have one instant click buff item, it is highly
  recommended however that you have 2 or more, as ae's tend to take more then
  one.<br>
  *Have a working knowledge of zones and how to travel between most zones.<br>
  *Must
  have all expansions enabled.<br>
  *Acquired the AA ability of Run5<br>
  <br>
  Sol Invictus raids
3 days a week.<br>
Tuesday 7 PM Eastern to ~Midnight Eastern. <br>
  Thursday 7 PM Eastern to ~Midnight Eastern.<br>
Saturday 11 AM Eastern to ~4 or 5 PM Eastern.</p>
<p>The schedule does not vary, except some holidays which we do not raid on.
  By applying to Sol Invictus you are confirming that you understand our raid
  times and can say in good faith that you are able to, and will, make 2 out
of 3 or more of our raids.&quot;</p>

  Application is on line, no posted recruiting information.</p>
<p><a href="http://p086.ezboard.com/bsouthernlegion" target="_blank">Southern
Legion</a><br>
&quot;Southern Legion is a Casual raiding guild, we raid two nights a week, more if
certain mobs are up. Raiding is not compulsory.<br>
<br>
As a matter of interest, Southern Legion welcomes players from all over the world,
but the majority of our members are from Australia &amp; New Zealand. This means
that our raid schedule is planned around AEST. ( Start time is usually 6:30pm
)</p>
<p>The guild leader is Sonnia. We have eight officers that assist her, as well
  as Class leaders that speak for the respective classes&#8217; members. We are
  one of the original guilds that were formed when this server started and have
survived by these simple principles:</p>
<p>We are a social guild that raids &#8211; This is not an oxymoron.
  Many of our players have demands in RL that prohibit any opportunity of extensive
  raiding on a daily basis. This should not and does not mean that satisfying
  content and great challenges still cannot await us. As we grow as a legion
  we want to continue to push the boundaries of what we can accomplish, yet maintain
  a friendly atmosphere that does not impinge on RL commitments. It is a delicate
  balance, but one that we have accomplished.</p>
<p>We are not a feeder guild. If you are here merely to gain exp and loot so
  that other guilds will invite you, this is not the guild for you. Nor is this
  guild for you if loot and experience are an absolute requirement every time
  you participate in guild activities. Our members do get a fair share of both,
  but complaining about someone&#8217;s good fortune instead of celebrating the
  guild becoming stronger in the process is not what we are about. Random is
  not an option. For any other questions please refer to our looting policy for
  full details. </p>
<p>We are a team, and as such, it is discouraged in the strongest sense that
  members only attend raids and events where they have a chance at getting loot.
  Your participation in all aspects of our guild, including helping fellow guild
  members, weighs heavily into loot allocation. Most events scheduled are for
  the 60+ audience. This does not mean we do not have lower level players or
  do not value their commitment to our guild; it&#8217;s simply a fact of our
  composition at this moment.</p>
<p>Overall the guild is at elemental planes lvl. While we do still do occasional
  backflagging, it is no longer our focus. Those wishing to obtain these flags
  at a faster pace, will need to consider pickup raids.</p>
<p>If there is an SL event taking place, your presence is expected but not required.
  It is just our assumption that you joined this guild to play by our side. Please
  keep a bag of whatever resist gear you have on you at all times. If you have
  right click objects, potions or EB items please have them ready as well. If
  there is epic work for you to be done, after the level of 55 is achieved please
  post your needs and full details of what it entails, and the time will be set
  aside to assist you.</p>
<p>Guild members should help each other at every opportunity possible, within
  reasonable limits. Reasonable exceptions to this rule are: members who are
  more than 3 zones away with no teleport abilities, members engaged in a raid
  or engaged in a prolonged camp. This does not include begging from guild members
or demanding to be PL&#8217;d, this will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Everyone shares guild chat, and that means you have to be considerate. Guild
  chat should be reasonably clean, think about whether something may be considered
  offensive before typing it. It takes real effort to type something out, it
  is not as if it slips out of your mouth. As Aussies and Kiwis, we are an easygoing
  guild and enjoy laughter, so please do no see this as a call to cease humour
  or joking. This is addressed to thoughts and opinions whose origins lie in
  hateful or angry sentiment. Overly disagreeable people tend to have a negative
impact on the entire mood of a guild and this behavior will be addressed.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.evguild.org/" target="_blank">The Elitists</a><br>

<p><a href="http://www.eqregulators.net/main/" target="_blank">Regulators of
Norrath</a> <br>
We are a family guild that does some raiding, but it is never required. Basically
we expect if you want help we expect you to help others also. RL always comes
first though. <br>
<br>
This Mission statement defines us. It is the written embodiment of what we represent
  on and off the field off battle. If you cannot abide by these guidelines, then
the Regulators of Norrath are not the Guild for you. To protect and to serve:
These are our watchwords and these are the words that describe our commitment
to the family members of this guild and to friends
  new and old alike. We serve the will of the Greater Good, we seek to make the
  land a better place than in which we found it. We are a family of like-minded
  souls, working together toward a common goal. We believe in this principle
  to the cores of our hearts and our beings. Wear the RON uniform with pride
  and seek to take the spirit of the guild, this sense of family with you wherever
you may travel in Norrath. For WE are the Regulators of Norrath! To be a member
in good standing within the Regulators of Norrath you must familiarize yourself
with the following principles. </p>
<p>Requirements:<br>
  1) To serve and protect you must render aid or assistance to
  others when you can (healing, buffing, directions, advice, etc.). If you can
  help someone,
  so that you both live, do so. And if you choose to sacrifice your life so that
  another may live, then that is an honorable death indeed. However, if your
  assistance will result in 2 deaths, yours and that of the person you are trying
  to assist, it is the wise person that knows their limits and their capabilities.
  There is no honor in creating 2 deaths instead of 1. The word HUA is our battle
  cry. It is used to set us apart and distinguish our actions and words from
others. Use the word proudly in battle and in celebration. </p>
<p>2) Promote family unity: This is done through several steps. If you are a
  solo specialist, if all you wish to do is hunt alone while in Norrath, then
  we are not the guild for you. Participate in the guild and it will make you
  stronger as you in turn make it stronger. Participation is also encouraged
for pick up groups and other raids planned by members.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://royalcrusadersofnorath.homestead.com/" target="_blank">The
Royal Crusaders of Norrath</a> <br>
&quot;Our guild is a famliy guild, a guild for the casualy player who doses not have
the time to dedicate to a larger more demanding guild, but who likes to have
a place to call their own, and friends who are there for you.<br>
<br>
  Member drive! Thats right, we are haveing a member drive, if you know any one
  intrested in joining us direct them to the page and have them email me, or
  in game give
  me a tell and ill log in officer ronjaman and invite them, if they met the
  level 20+ requirment at this time, tho some exeptions will be allowed like

Level Requirement: 10 <br>
Minimum AA: No Requirement <br>
Normal Raid Schedule: Non-Manditory (sat &amp; sun) <br>
Required Raid Attendance: 0 <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.vallisaspectus.org/VA/index.php" target="_blank">Vallus Aspectus</a><br>
&quot;The Vallis Aspectus Culture <br>
Vallis Aspectus is not, and will unlikely ever be, an &#8220;uberguild.&#8221; Although
we are focused on advancing into higher tiers of raiding and game content, we
are not as fast-paced as some other guilds. Integrity and real-life interests
will remain priorities as we pursue our in-game goals. We do, however, kill our
share of large targets. At the moment, those targets lie primarily in Plane of
Time, Gates of Discord and Omens of war. </p>
<p>Current Goals: Vallis Aspectus is currently raiding Plane of Time to gear
  up its members and
for further advancement into Gates of Discord.<br>
Raids: Raids occur just about every night. Many raids are held during EST/PST
prime
hours, (8pmEST/5pmPST starting times most nights)<br>
Loot: Loot is distributed almost entirely by a DKP system. Points are acquired
through raid attendance and members with the highest accumulated amount of points
    are awarded items they express interest in. Probationary members are not
eligible for loot except in special situations. </p>
<p>Who We&#8217;re Looking For: <br>
  Vallis Aspectus supports primarily adult* members in the 65+ range with the
    vast majority of regular members at 67+ with 100+ AA. We are not looking
    for casual players right now. We&#8217;re seeking to fill our roster with
    experienced individuals who want to raid, explore, and group with the guild
    for three or more days a week. <br>
* Persons who are friendly, knowledgeable, and mature.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=19529&TabID=177232" target="_blank">Vengeance
    Through Blood</a><br>
    &quot;If you do not meet these recommendations, please be willing to work on them
  as soon as you are approved for TRIAL. First and Foremost VTB is looking for
Active Raiders, who are willing to learn and work together.. NO DRAMA QUEENS/KINGS.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=16263&TabID=147058" target="_blank">Vis
Veres</a><br>
&quot;Welcome to the home of the Vis Veres guild. We are a Time flagged guild on the
Tribunal Server in the game of Everquest. Outside that realm we are a vast and

Strong!</p>

  may be made by class leaders depending on class desirability. Full EP flags

<p>Items: On any official guild raid, any raiding officer, class leader, guild
  member or trial member is required to have *on their character* when they join
  the raid:</p>

  shrink spell (dwarves, gnomes and halflings are exempt from this requirement)<br>
  2-
