Ken helped get this site to where it is now and we would not have this great new layout without his hard work.  On the behalf of everyone at EQ Vault I would like to thank Ken for all the work he has done on the site.<br><br>I’ll be taking over Ken’s position as Site Manager.  For those that don’t know me, I’m Ryan “Draknorr” Bohmann.  I’ve been with Vault Network for over three years now and been an EverQuest player for even longer.  I’ve had two level 65 characters and multiple level 60s, and I’m just a huge fan of the game in general.<br><br>There will be some changes made to the site.  In the immediate future you can expect more frequent news updates and more features.  If you have any ideas for features shoot <a href="mailto:draknorr@vaultnetwork.com">me an e-mail</a>, I’d love to hear them!<br><br>Thanks to the readers for continuing to support EQ Vault.  Good things are to come.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 06 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#187<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 22 15:18:30 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
