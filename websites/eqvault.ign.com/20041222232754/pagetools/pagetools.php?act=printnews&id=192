So expect areas for pick up groups and more open content.</blockquote><br>You can join in on the discussion <a href=http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Monks&message.id=4262#M4262>Here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Fri 06 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#192<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 22 15:27:47 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
