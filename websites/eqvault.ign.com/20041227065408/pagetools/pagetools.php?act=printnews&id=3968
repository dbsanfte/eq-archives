With the holidays coming around this poll asks "What do you want for Christmas".  Of course we all want to win the lotto, but this is an EQ site, so you have EQ-related choices!<br><br>If you want something specific in-game post it on our forums and let everyone know! Get a discussion going about it, who knows what could happen.<br><br>Our last poll asked "Do you have your Epic 1.5 yet?" Here are the results:<br><br>Yep! [20 votes]<br>No [82 votes]<br>Don't even have my Epic! [117 votes]<br>Not even level 50 [52 votes] <br><br>So looks like the most people that voted don't even have their epic yet.  I guess if you're a fairly new player to EQ, before Epic 2.0s and 1.5s, most Epic Weapons are fairly useless due to how good some of the droppable weapons coming out of recent expansions were.  Interesting results!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Mon 06 Dec 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#3968<br>Printed On: Sun Dec 26 22:54:01 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
