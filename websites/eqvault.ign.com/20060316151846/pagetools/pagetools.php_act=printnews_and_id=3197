Here's a clip:<blockquote>These two are related.<br>* Mounts should no longer be dismissed when zoning<br>* Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through the world.<br><br>These were both due to a pretty straightforward bug that solved all the cases of these problems happening. There was a variable that was being used for the floor elevation that was simply not being updated before the mount check was being done. Once this was changed I haven't seen or heard of these problems happening.</blockquote><br>Most of these changes should be hitting test soon if they have not.
