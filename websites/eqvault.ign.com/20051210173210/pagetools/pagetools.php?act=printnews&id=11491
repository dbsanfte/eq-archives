The theme of this summit was "EverQuest, Past, Present and Future."  Twenty-five members of the EverQuest and the EverQuest II community were invited to come talk to the SOE staff for two days of conferences and panels, as well as some good fun and socializing with the members of the SOE team.<br><br>Invitees including your community correspondents from the EQLive boards and representatives from EQTraders, EQInterface, Stratics, Caster's Realm, Mobhunter, OGaming, class sites and others arrived during the day Thursday. An informal dinner event with many of the development team members and community representatives from the EQLive boards was held for those who had arrived in time and it was clear the event had begun.  I sat next to Rashere, EQ Developer for Depths of Darkhollow, Loral from MobHunter and the EQLive boards, the Wizard class representative, and Merloc, from the Graffe's Wizard site.  A very lively discussion of items and stats ensued, as well as some reminiscing about some old school events in EverQuest. <br><br>On Friday SOE treated us to a trip to the world-famous San Diego zoo for most of the day.  Everyone was completey exahusted getting back on the bus after walking around the huge zoo for 6 hours to see the more than 4,000 animals that live there.   It was much like a live version of walking from Freeport to Qeynos, I think.  My favorite exhibit was the cheetah cubs in the nursery!  Brenlo and the staff had a great time showing us around the zoo and showed us exactly how funny he can be as tour guide. We started getting to know one another although remembering someone's EQ name and their real name was not the easiest thing in the world, at least for me.<br><br>Friday dinner found people getting more comfortable with one another, although the EQ and the EQ2 representatives were at separate tables so I never socialized very much with the EQ2 folks that were there during dinner, which I regret, as I would have liked to get to know them as well.  I had some excellent conversations with EQ people however, including Loral, Zajir, the EQ items developer, Craig Knapp (Zorillius), EverQuest producer, and Samana from the shaman site.  Loral made sure to remind the SOE staffers that he had an evil agenda, although many plans were made on how to get rid of it before Saturday.  I got to know them all a little better and increased my respect for all the people who work to make EverQuest a better game.<br><br>On Saturday it was time to get up early and get some work done.  After a delicious breakfast where we played Canadian twenty questions, which is acually just two questions, and a discussion concerning perky pandas, we finally got serious and boarded the bus for the SOE headquarters.   Brenlo again entertained us as tour guide and stand-up comic, and gave Kytherea a hard time about her birthday, but she's a good sport and took it all in stride -- that's why she's such a great community manager!<br><br>Tour of SOE Headquarters<br>The first order of business was to take a tour of SOE headquarters.  We learned that although they have a huge server room, the servers that run EQ are actually off-site and for the other games, the servers are in Virginia.  They have their own generators making sure no matter what the outside power grid is doing, we can still play.  We also were told by Mike Gaylord, a senior staff member for SOE, that they go through many servers a month, replacing servers that wear out in the normal course of business.  When we were there, there was a pallet load of servers waiting to be placed in the server repair and replacement room.<br><br>The staff cubes are full of interesting art and the walls of the SOE offices are covered in concept art, original cover art, and other displays of game titles and artifacts.  All of the art and box covers are beautfully framed so you can really appreciate how good game art can be.<br><br>No one works less than about 10 hours a day at SOE, so the cubes reflect the fact that they are a "home away from home" for the designers and artists.  Every cube is personalized with artwork from all kinds of games and genres, as well as stuffed animals, action figures, and other interesting things.  The human skeleton in one cube was a little scary until  I realized it was a graphic artist's cube and he needed it for correct anatomy!<br><br>We saw the GMs at work, and were treated to a view of "command headquarters" which is a large room with one entire wall covered with data screens displaying status reports on the live servers for both EQ and EQ2, including bandwidth usage, number of people logged in, and other information that keeps the games stable.   People are keeping an eye on how the game is running at all times and are alerted with ringing bell alarms when anything goes amiss.<br><br>First Roundtable Discussion<br>Chris and Heathcliff from the Marketing Department started us off with a discussion about how EQ is marketed and how they could do it more effectively.  You may not realize it, but there is a department that decides what is written on the back of the retail boxes describing the expansion, how things are packaged, and how EQ is marketed to the general public.  The goal of the marketing department, they told us, was to deliver a comprehensive message about EQ:  it's a fun game.  There was a lively discussion about how much it costs to get back into the game if you haven't been buying the expansions all along, the size of Escape to Norrath (300 megs is a big download) and what the price point should be for an entire set of EQ that includes all the expansions.   One important point made was that when you see an expansion box, it is hard to find a box with the core game if you want to start playing based on seeing the expansion.  Heathcliff explained that they were going to be releasing a new Platinum version with more expansions and it should be more available.<br><br>The marketing department is very interested in bringing people back into the game and making it fun for new players to start playing.  We were asked what we thought an appropriate price point would be for a version with all the expansions, since buying them separately is very expensive.<br><br>Chris also explained to us that they would prefer players to buy the digital download of the game, but they make boxed sets to have a product to display in the stores along side other games.  We had a short discussion about making sure the boxed sets are available to players right when the expansion is released so no one has to wait to play it if they buy it at retail.<br><br>One of the class reps mentioned that it was embarrassing they had referred to Katrina as being in the "midatlantic states" and suggested they spend more time proofreading for accuracy on their printed materials.<br><br>The next four hours were spent in panels with the development team, which I will cover in Part II of this report.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 2 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11491">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11491</a><br>Printed On: Sat Dec 10 9:32:10 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
