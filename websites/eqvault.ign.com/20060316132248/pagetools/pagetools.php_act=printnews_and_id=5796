Here's the full post:<blockquote>Once the servers come up from the update on Thursday, Zek players will be able to begin the process of selecting a new server to have all characters on their account moved to. <br><br>Those Zek players who have already executed the /movelog command will be moved to the server they chose, unless that server was Solusek Ro or Kane Bayle.  Zek players who chose either of these servers will need to execute the command again, choosing a new server. <br><br>If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, the /movelog UI (after Thursdays update) will have a disregard button.  Using the disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and allow you to execute a new movelog request.<br><br>We will begin processing the movelog requests on Friday night (March 4th) and will continue nightly for a period of 30 days.  Any accounts that have executed the movelog request will need to make certain they have no corpses in the world.  If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination server, you will need to empty either shared bank out as only one will be available after the movelog is complete.</blockquote><br>Have fun PvPers!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 1 March, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5796">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5796</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:22:48 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
