This time next week you can earn them for yourself!<blockquote><br><b>Shadowknight:</b><br>Touch of the Cursed - This ability grants the shadowknight a chance to drain the life of his opponent any time he makes a melee attack.<br><br><b>Shaman</b><br>Spiritual Channeling - While this ability is active, all of your spells will be fueled directly by the energy of your body, consuming hit points rather than mana.<br></blockquote><br>The Shadowknight spell sounds like it could be extremely useful if the proc rate is high. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thu 09 Sep 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#1453<br>Printed On: Mon Oct 11 13:21:48 PDT 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
