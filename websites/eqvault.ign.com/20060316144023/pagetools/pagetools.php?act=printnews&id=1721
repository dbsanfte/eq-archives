Our thought was that AA was meant to be a positioning tool, and not a new pulling tool.<br><br>As such, we are reducing the range in our next update. Any AAs spent on this ability will be refunded at that time.  We apologize to anyone who purchased the ability in hopes of using it as a new pulling tool.   A new version of the AA, with the correct range, will be available to anyone who wishes to purchase it.  </BLOCKQUOTE>Easy come, easy go.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 17 September, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1721">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1721</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:40:23 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
