You can also use an address book entry name.<br>- When pressing "Reply All" from the Mail Window, the lists found to match exactly (both name and addresses) with an entry in your address book are compacted to the name only, other entries are written in full.<br>- The Sync button is there to synchronize your TO field with your address book. This is mainly useful when replying to all: it helps you add new entries to your address book or update old ones. In the latter case, you will be notified of the differences: name differs by case, addresses removed, addresses added. The note field is preserved during the update.<br><br>Address Book Window<br><br>- New window to edit your address book.<br>- Fields for name, addresses and note.<br>- Checkbox to make the entry name private, which means that during address expansion, the addresses will be written as if you had selected them individually, not in the mailing list format.<br>- Automatic update of the "Guild" entry.

Use the comma to separate them.<br>- If you need a space, for an example if you are sending to a mailing list that contains a space in its name, then you need to enclose the whole list of recipients between double-quotes.<br>- To make a recipient BCC, precede it with a -.<br>- Addresses written in the command-line are expanded according to the address book rules.<br><br>5/12/05<br><br>- Four new missions are available that take you back to Qeynos, Unrest, Befallen, and Hate's Fury.<br> <br>*** Missions ***<br>----------------------------------<br>- Savil Tranquilsong has made an important breakthrough in his work uncovering the history of Unrest and is looking for adventurers around levels 55 to 70 to assist him.  Seek him out in the Butcherblock Mountains if you are interested in helping.<br>- Rumors have been circulating of increased activity around Hate's Fury and a growing discontent among the merchants of the Broken Skull Clan.
