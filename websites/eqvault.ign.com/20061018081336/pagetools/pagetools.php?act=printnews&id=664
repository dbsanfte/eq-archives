Many new news items came out of SOE this week as well.  Onto the good stuff!<br><br>On Monday we brought you the exclusive Omens AA Ability for the Rogue – “Master of Disguise”.  On Tuesday we had some new <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Fanfic.Detail&id=40&category_select_id=7">Fan Fiction</a> from Avalon.  Wednesday we had a new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=73678144&replies=0">Topic of the Week</a> asking “What class do you think is the best at soloing?”  Thursday we had the first chapter of the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=21&category_select_id=6">EverQuest Online Adventures Developer Diary</a> straight from Alex von Minden.  And to wrap up the week, Friday we had a new <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Guides.Detail&id=6">zone guide for Everfrost</a> and a new Poll.<br><br>This week was not huge on news items, but we got a few.  Monday Shawn Lord posted his <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63132">update on the Developers’ Corner</a>, and Omens of War beta signup started if you could catch it.  Tuesday brought word of a whole huge list of <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&message.id=4483#M4483">PvP changes</a> coming with Wednesday’s patch, and the ability to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/retail/everquest_trio/">buy the full version of EQ Trilogy</a> for $9.99 at FilePlanet.  Wednesday brought a major patch and some news about the <a href="http://www.mmorpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1021">graphics engine upgrade</a>.  Thursday and Friday were fairly dead, but we did get one item on EQ Live about <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63168">Station Launchpad now being on the Test Server</a>.<br><br>As always, if you have any news to submit you can send it <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/siteinfo/mail.php">here</a>.
