Chapter 2:
<br>
<br>Inside a comfortable room of the Traveler’s Home, an inn within the wall of the High Elf city of Felwithe, Bosk sat watch over the sleeping Geraine. Only an hour before he was singing a soft Elven lullaby to calm her anxiety about traveling to strange lands and meeting new people. He chuckled to himself as he realized the full reality of his situation, having become in essence this little Gnomish girl’s nanny. He willingly took the job, wishing to do what he could to help her in anyway she needed, but now in the afterthought of the moment he found humor in it, never envisioning himself as a guardian of a child at this stage of his life. Still, looking on the small child asleep in the large bed, he was glad he was the one and only one. She mumbled in her sleep, about meeting people and seeing places. To Bosk it almost seemed she was convinced that she had her first meeting with a Human all planned out and was now moving on to the Halflings. Her views were extremely limited, due to her sheltered life underground Bosk imagined, but she had the heart of an adventurer. Granted, most of what Bosk knew was by word of mouth or from what he read in the books of the Felwithe libraries, but he was willing to face the unknown for this little girl. He didn’t know why, but he felt like he should. The door quietly opened and shut, letting in a gentle Wood Elf. Bosk looked over and smiled at the warm face and whispered, “Welcome back, dear. How was your day?” The Wood Elf gracefully slid into Bosk’s lap and wrapped her arms around him, staring into his deep blue eyes and, with a slight pout, replied, “Horrible. I joined a group that I thought would help me out, but we were soon defeated horribly by a band of Orcs.” “Where did you meet them at?” asked Bosk, gently caressing her face. “Crushbone,” she meekly let out, knowing his response. Bosk sighed. “You know how dangerous it is there…” “Yes, I know. But I wanted so much to slay a few Orcs and grow in my abilities faster and…” “Cailet,” interrupted Bosk, putting a finger to her lip. “Progress at your own pace. If you get hurt, or even die, I would be devastated. Tunare can revive you, but you will be much weaker than you are now, and I do not want that to happen to you, my dear.” Cailet stared into his eyes again and smiled with a slight tear in her eye then buried her face into his neck. “I love you…” “I love you too,” replied Bosk, holding her close to him. “Oooooo,” said a voice from the bed. Geraine was awake and watching them. “You going to kiss her Bosk?” she asked in her native tongue. Cailet looked at Bosk, confused, and he responded to her unasked question with, “In a moment,” then stood up, sitting Cailet down in the chair he was in, and walked over to sit on the bed to speak to Geraine. “Thought you sleep,” he stated in his awful Gnomish. “I was, until I heard you two talking,” she replied, grinning from ear to ear. Bosk looked at Geraine with a curious grin as well. “You understand what say we?” Geraine giggled and replied, “A little…I know some Common Tongue.” Bosk grinned and assaulted her with a barrage of tickling to her stomach. “You little rat!” he yelled in Common Tongue as they both burst into laughter. “You never said that!” “You never asked!” she squealed back. Bosk stopped and said, “I suppose we should get a room, eh? Oh, wait, I do have a room.” He grinned at her and she grinned back. “Umm,” interjected Cailet, trying to figure out what is going on. Bosk looked at her and grinned. “Sorry. This is Geraine. Geraine, this is Cailet.” “Your girlfriend?” Geraine asked in Common Tongue, giggling even more. Bosk looked to Cailet and smiled, saying “Yea, something like that.” Cailet blushed a little. Bosk looked back to Geraine and in Common Tongue said, “Now get some sleep. We are going to leave tomorrow and traveling while sleepy is very dangerous.” Geraine sighed and replied in Common Tongue, “Ok.” She nestled herself back into the bed and snuggled up with a wad of blanket. Bosk smiled and hummed to her again and Geraine was quickly asleep. He stood up and walked to Cailet, taking her hand, and whispered, “Follow me.” Outside, next to the river that runs through Felwithe, Bosk and Cailet slowly strolled under the setting sun. Cailet held Bosk’s arm as they walked for comfort, fearing if she let go now she might not see him again after tomorrow. “What did you mean about leaving tomorrow?” she asked. Bosk paused and looked into the river. “Her parents are missing.” Cailet gasp. “You mean they are…” “No…we don’t know. The Gnomes have been taking care of her as a community effort, but they could not spare anyone to look for her parents, so we took on the quest to find them.” “Who…is we?” asked Cailet. “Myself, Elventear, and Revea you know. Revea’s sister Andriana and their adopted brother Alfadar are coming as well.” “And I as well,” said Cailet. “Wait a minute,” started Bosk before Cailet put a finger on his lips. “I am coming. You can not protect me every moment of every day. I have to grow in my abilities and I can not do that if I do not expand my horizons. Please.” She looked into his eyes and held his hands up between their chests. “I want to be with you.” Bosk smiled. “I suppose I can not stop you.” He leaned close and gently kissed her, then whispered, “We should get some sleep, if we want to get a good start in the morning.” Cailet’s face lit up and she threw her arms around his neck, hugging him tightly. “Thank you!” Inside the Paladin’s Guild, known as the Defender’s Hall, Andriana was sitting in a room cleaning her sword and sharpening it, keeping it as fine a weapon as she can. The Minotaur axe she procured from the Minotaur in Steamfont was on a side table. She liked it, but her weapon of choice would always be a two-handed sword, or even a halberd. She smiled at the thought, and continued her maintenance ritual. Tomorrow she would start an adventure that could take her all over Norrath, and she wanted to be ready. Andriana hefted the large blade and examined it. “Best I can do with this rusty blade.” She smiled, thinking fondly of it in a nostalgic sense. There was a knock at the door and Tynkale, the paladin guild master, entered the room. Andriana quickly stood up and assumed a pose of attention. Tynkale smiled and nodded to her, signaling that she may relax. “How are your skills progressing, Andriana?” he asked her. “Are you up for some training?” “No, sir,” she replied. “I have spent my last training session with you on my bashing skill.” “I see.” He looked around and saw the Minotaur axe on the table. He walked over to it and picked it up, holding it firmly in his hands. “This is a Minotaur battle axe, correct?” “Yes, sir.” “You received this from your last outing, to Steamfont if I am not mistaken.” Andriana knew he was baiting her for information that he already had. “Yes sir. I was part of an expedition headed to the Minotaur Caves in Steamfont.” “I see,” he said, laying the axe down on the table. “And was the expedition successful in relieving the strain on the Gnomish forces? Did you weaken the power of that horrid little Gnomish necromancer, Meldrath?” Andriana sighed and replied, “No…sir.” “Why not?” “We…were distracted by another mission.” Tynkale nodded and slowly walked over to her, saying, “I see. What is this other mission you speak of? Does it involve the little Gnomish girl that was brought in?” “Yes sir. We offered our services to help find the girls parents. We leave tomorrow to search for them.” “When you say ‘we’ you mean your ranger brother, magician sister, her cleric boyfriend and that bard friend of yours, do you not?” Andriana thought for a moment. Normally traveling companions are of no matter to the guild officials but yet Tynkale is still asking about hers. Why would he want to know? “I…yes sir.” “Very well. I want to assign you another Defender. You are both at the same level of training and experience and I think you will learn a lot from each other.” This puzzled Andriana. It was not normal policy for a guild master to assign “partners” to someone else. Rather each Defender went out on his or her own to gain real world experience and spread the teachings of Tunare by example. To place them together on purpose would defy this principle, but Andriana had faith in Tunare’s power and Tynkale’s wisdom. “Who will it be?” “Saldyar. I have made the arrangements and…” Andriana cut in with a cry of outrage. “Saldyar? That pompous spoiled noble does not deserve the right to hold the title of a Defender!” Tynkale raised a hand to silence her and sternly said, “He has worked hard. His social rank has nothing to do with his current state.” Andriana was dumbfounded as to why she was paired up with a selfish, arrogant person like Saldyar. “He has no respect for the basic principals of which the Defenders were founded on…he…he…” “He is the perfect choice for this assignment.” Andriana was about to argue the point when Tynkale raised his hand again. “You say he has no respect for the ideas of our guild. Your quest is, at heart, a quest based on one our principles, to help those in need. The girl is in need and you are willing to help her. Show him what it means to truly be a Defender.” Andriana nodded, seeing no other alternative. “Yes sir. I will.” Tynkale turned abruptly and walked to the door. He paused for a moment as he reached the exit and said, “Good journeys, young Defender. Bring pride upon our name.” Andriana nodded and watched Tynkale walk out of the doorway. She stood for a moment, still angry at the situation, but able to see the reasoning. “It doesn’t mean I have to like it,” she mumbled. “Like what, Andriana?” asked a voice at the door. Andriana jumped, thinking Tynkale came back to add something and heard what she said. Slowly, she turned around and sighed when she saw her brother Alfadar in the doorway. “You scared me.” Alfadar smiled and said, “Sorry.” “We have another member to our quest. A paladin named Saldyar.” Alfadar raised an eyebrow. “Friend of yours?” Andriana scoffed the idea then plopped down on the bed, saying, “Hardly. He is a spoiled noble that only wishes to better himself and his position.” Alfadar nodded and said, “I see,” as he stepped into the door and walked to the bed. “So why did you invite him to come along?” Andriana gave Alfadar a hard look. “I didn’t. My guild master, Tynkale, assigned him to it.” Alfadar looked at Andriana in a funny way. “Assigned?” he asked. “Can he force this Saldyar on you?” “There is no official rule against it but it is not a normal thing. In fact, this is the first I have ever heard about it being done.” “So if you do not take him along, what will happen?” Andriana sighed and shook her head. “I don’t know.” She thought for a moment and muttered, “If Tunare wishes him to come with us, then we should heed her wish.” “Maybe he will get lost in the woods.” Alfadar cracked a smile when Andriana looked at him sideways. “In the end, it will be all right.” Andriana nodded and took her sword in hand again. “Yes, I suppose it is for the best.” Elsewhere, in southern Felwithe, Revea was in the Hall of Magic attempting to prepare herself for the journey. She has never been very far from Felwithe; Steamfont Mountains being the furthest she has ever been from her home, and going beyond these limits scared her to some extent. The only comfort she had was that Andriana, Alfadar, and most importantly Elventear would be with her. “Honey?” asked a quiet voice from the door. Revea looked up and smiled as Elventear walked in. She was so busy thinking about the future that she did not even hear the stone door slide open. “Hello dear.” She was sitting on the only bed in the room. “Where have you been?” “I was finishing things up at the orphanage, making sure that the other volunteers knew what to do, when the deliveries will arrive, that sort of thing. What are you up to?” Revea sighed. “Just thinking.” Elventear walked over to her and sat down on the behind next to her. “About?” “The future, the past, the present…” trailing off as she fell into the same train of thought she was just in before Elventear entered. “That is a lot to think about,” replied Elventear. “I…I was thinking about what we will be facing out there. We are only searching for a little girl’s parents but…” “But they have been missing for years. They may even be dead, but we can not give up until we are sure.” Elventear wrapped an arm around her and held her tight. A tear came to Revea’s eye. “She is so strong. To be without her parents for this long…” “Shhhh…it’s ok, my dear. Don’t cry.” “I…I just keep thinking about…” Elventear knew what she was talking about before she even said it. “That was years ago.” “To be utterly alone…without anyone. I was not much older than Geraine is. Faydark is such a frightening place when you are young and alone.” Revea remembered every grueling moment. Her and Andriana were playing in the forest while they were just little girls when they became lost and separated from the rest of the Elven civilization and from each other. Andriana was found shortly after by Bosk while he was still young. He was lost as well and when they found each other they held close to each other, helping each other survive the brief time in the wilderness at night. Soon they both found a Wood Elf guard and were escorted to Kelethin. The next day Andriana was taken back to Felwithe, but they were now bound by a deep friendship. Revea, however, was lost for weeks, barely surviving the constant hunger and thirst. She ate what she could find and drank what little surface water there was while narrowly avoiding Orc raiders and hungry wolves. Weeks later she was found by a party of High Elves on their way back from Butcher Block. They brought her back to Felwithe, traumatized from the ordeal, and she was reunited with her family. Later, she volunteered for the orphanage so she may try to help those in s situation similar to what she went through. There, she met Elventear. “I love you,” she whispered. Elventear smiled and kissed her cheek. “I love you too. Lets get some rest before we have to head out tomorrow.” Revea smiled and nodded, slipping into the bed. Elventear tucked her in and watched over her as she slipped into her slumber, then he sat down in a chair across the room and sat down, slowly falling asleep, thinking, “Tomorrow will be the start of a grand adventure.”
