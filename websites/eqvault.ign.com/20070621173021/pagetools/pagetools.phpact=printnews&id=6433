It does not save us money on bandwidth.  What it does do is get healthy populations on the servers that needed a boost.  We set a number that we consider to be a healthy population and merged the servers based on that criteria.  Low population servers are merging with higher population servers, mid population servers are merging together. <br><br>Yes it will be disrupting and we realize that, which is why you will have the option to move, to almost any other server you desire. "<br><br>The higher population servers are merging with the lower ones. <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 29 Mar, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6433">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6433</a><br>Printed On: Thu Jun 21 10:30:21 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
