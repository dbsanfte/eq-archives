Chapter 4:
<br>
<br>Arihel stepped off the boat at the port in Butcher Block. This was neutral territory between the Gnomes, Elves, and Dwarves, even though the location was in Dwarvish territory and, except for the buildings housing the other two Races’ merchants, was generally kept in good condition by the Dwarves. The Goblins, Orcs, and other creatures that might damage or destroy the port were kept at bay by the Dwarvish guards. Standing on the pier and looking inland, the Elvish buildings stood on the left while the Gnomish and Dwarvish stood on the right. Each one had their distinct and unique construction representative of the environment that the Races lived in. Arihel took a deep breath of air and smiled, thinking, “It is good to be back home.” She walked down the pier and onto the sandy shore. Her banded armor caused her boots to sink into the sand a little. Shrugging, Arihel continued until she came to the guards. They looked at her apprehensively, which did not surprise her. High Elves, even though one of the most physically appealing of all the Races, are not liked all that much because of the general attitude shared by their Race that they were superior. She did not necessarily share this view, but she can understand the position and reasoning behind it. On the dirt road, Arihel turned to look back at the docks, watching for the figure that slowly walked past the guards. A dark cloak was draped around the figure, hiding the entire body from view. One of the guards stepped forward, standing between the figure and Arihel. “‘Ello there,” said the guard through his visor. He held a Dwarven battle-axe in his right hand and a short sword in his left. Though short, Arihel figured that this Dwarf was very strong and experienced in battle. This could get dangerous. “Hello, my little friend,” she said to the guard. “I am…” “Move along and you will not be involved in this matter further,” replied the guard without even turning to face Arihel. She was taken aback slightly, but recovered before it was noticed. “Well, I merely wished to ask you where…” “Has the lack of air at your altitude made you stupid? I said move along Elf,” he commanded. The figure shifted a little uneasily with both guards looking it over. “Who are you and why are you covering your whole body head to toe on such a hot day? I am sweating like an Ogre in this armor.” He turned to his partner and asked, “What about you?” His partner nodded and added, “We can only imagine what that black cloak is doing to you in there. Why dontcha take it off an’ give us a look.” Arihel thought quickly to do something and looked directly at the figure as if to ask what she could do. The figure nodded just enough to let Arihel know what to do and she said, “Excuse me again…” Both guards turned to look at her with obvious disgust. The guard that had been talking this entire time, almost yelling, said, “I told you to…YAAAHHH!” A flash of light emanated from Arihel, blinding the two guards for a few moments while a green flash of light shone through the cloak. Within a few moments, the guards regained enough of their eyesight to see that Arihel was holding her sword in a peaceful manner. With an innocent look in her eye, she asked, “Does this sword look like something you might like to use?” The guard looked at the sword as best as he could, thinking that it was the sword’s reflection of the sun that blinded him and his partner for that brief moment. “Is this a bribe?” Arihel feigned being offended. “Of course not! I merely picked it up in Freeport and wondered what a Dwarf, who I am sure would know his swords being in the Stormguard, thought of it. I believe I was cheated some but…” “Knock it off and leave before I show you how good a sword should be,” he replied in an agitated voice, gripping his short sword tightly with the tip angled slightly to Arihel’s stomach. She sheathed the sword and slowly backed away, looking to the figure and hoping it worked. The guards turned back to the figure and the leader asked, “Now what do we have under here,” as he threw the cloak off of it. There stood an attractive looking female Half-Elf, clad in a light robe. The two guards laughed at her, tossing the cloak in her face, and walked back to their posts. She walked to Arihel and sighed, saying, “I told you the cloak would not be enough.” “Still, you are not strong enough yet to do without it, so wrap it around you again, good and tight.” Arihel helped her with the cloak and whispered, “You are free from that place now and I promised you that I would get you to Felwithe. Everything will be ok now.” “Not if those guards are the typical reaction I will get,” the Half-Elf replied with a small amount of hatred. Arihel looked into her eyes and said, “You have to get rid of that hatred in you, especially in Felwithe or it may be worse than…” “No!” exclaimed the Half-Elf in a fierce whisper. “Nothing can be worse than that horrid place.” Her voice and face seemed surreal now and Arihel quickly finished covering her up. They both began to walk down the path, watching for any danger that might befall them. Butcher Block was not a very dangerous place to experienced travelers, but it had been a while since Arihel was last on her native soil and she was not sure what changes in the local distribution of power might have been made. The Goblins were fighting back fiercely when she left so she kept a very close eye on where camps might be. Her companion stayed very close, as if to stay within a protective barrier. Whenever another traveler walked by or they past a guard post, she made sure to keep herself wrapped very tightly. She knew she would not be wanted here, but there was no where else to go. Zarchoomi, an Ogre shaman of the Muddytoes Clan and one of the last of that clan, was walking through Butcher Block looking for any young Dwarves to kill. Her anger at the Stormguard for destroying her clan was great, and her revenge was to kill all the Dwarves she could, even if it meant killing those that are new to adventuring and are much weaker then she is. Zarchoomi did not care; she only wanted vengeance. And vengeance she will have. “Ah, there she is,” whispered Rooks in a rather confident tone as he lay on his stomach looking over a hill to his target. “She has killed to many of my kinsmen and now it is time for retribution.” Rosa lay next to him, watching the towering female Ogre walk by, and sneered slightly. “Not only is she an Ogre she is also an abominable shaman.” Rooks smiled to his Wood Elf companion. “Then shall we have at her?” Rosa smiled back and said, “Yes…I believe we shall,” as she stood up and focused on herself, causing a shielding coat of thorns to sprout around her body which will pierce anything that came within range. Rosa then closed her eyes and stretched her mind out, catching the thoughts of a lowland basilisk. “My friend, we need your assistance.” The basilisk fought for a moment, scared and unsure of what is happening, but Rosa befriended the animal in her thoughts and slipped into its consciousness. She then stretched out one last time to a swarm of bees. Their many minds slammed into unison under her control and she directed their attentions to the large female Ogre called Zarchoomi. “YIAEE!” shouted Zarchoomi as hundreds of bees stung in almost perfect unison all over her body. She turned in every direction as she tried to discover where the attack originated. The Ogre used her limited mystical powers to trace the mental link of the bees to Rosa, and charged her. “Um…Rosa?” asked Rooks, wondering what she was waiting on. Zarchoomi stopped suddenly as a thin layer of solid rock covered her. The basilisk crawled to her and began to attack, biting the ankles of the towering Ogre. Once the thin layer of rock stunning Zarchoomi fell apart she summoned a vaporous cloud in her hand and blew it to the basilisk’s face, which poisoned it severely. Rosa opened her eyes and shouted, “NOW!” Rooks nodded and stared at Zarchoomi, summoning Brell’s power into his hands, and let loose a powerful force that smote her. She fell back for a moment and attempted to run, but found a throbbing pain course through her feet. Zarchoomi looked down and found that grasping roots had taken hold of her feet and were digging into her flesh. Zarchoomi swung her arms feverishly trying to hit the basilisk but she was too weak. As she was about to fall from exhaustion and loss of blood, a blast of fire exploded between Rooks and Rosa, knocking them their separate ways. A Goblin wizard, a shaman, four Goblin warriors, and several regular Goblins and Goblin whelps appeared over a ridge. “Attack me warriors!” shouted the Goblin wizard. “Bring me head of Dwarf and Elf!” “This is bad,” said Rooks, struggling to his feet. “You think so too, huh?” replied Rosa as she stood up. She rose her hands to the sky, evoking the power of Tunare to bring a cascade of hail upon her enemies. The clouds congregated above the Goblins and a chilling wind blew through the area. The basilisk, now free from Rosa’s control, turned and ran from the battle scene, slowly dying from Zarchoomi’s deadly poisonous spell. The hail started to fall in small ice stones at first, then in large ice balls the size of an Ogre’s head. The Goblin wizard saw what was happening and summoned his power to radiate his troops with a shield of fire that could melt the hail before damaging the Goblins. He then took his turn again, summoning his energies to freeze the very air around Rosa and Rooks and creating a column of frost blowing high into the air. By this time the Goblins and their whelps were at Rooks and Rosa. Rosa, weakened from her constant expenditure of mana, cast two more spells of both of them, protecting both from extreme heat and cold. In this way the wizard’s main arsenal of magic was hindered. Rooks summoned all his mana into him and called to Brell to heal them both, succeeding enough to give them both the strength to fight back just a little longer before dying, and they both knew it was only a matter of time before they would fall. Still, it would be a glorious battle. They met the Goblins, bashing and beating them severely with their weapons, hoping and waiting for their mana to regenerate enough to supplement their melee skills. Neither had a chance to, however. A sword and shield came flying through the battle scene, hacking and slashing all the Goblins within its reach. Both Rooks and Rosa felt added protection against the Goblins’ physical attacks as well as an added strength flowing through their veins. After all these factors were changed into their favor, Rooks and Rosa fought on as hard as they could. Then Goblins would start to screech for air as if there were none for them to breathe on their own, and both noticed them getting weaker in health as well as physical strength. As all these things happened, a new face graced the field of battle, a High Elf paladin. She cut through the whelps within moments and helped Rooks and Rosa to finish the rest of the Goblins around them. Breathing deeply from exhaustion, Rooks turned to their new friend and said, “Thank you, kind stranger.” She smiled and replied, “Don’t thank me just yet, we still have six more to deal with.” The four fighters, cleric, druid, paladin, and enchanted sword turned to face the wizard and his guard. The shaman stepped forward and gleamed at them before chanting in his native tongue. Rooks fell to his knees for a moment, coughing horribly as his face turned a death pale. Rosa turned to him and laid a hand on him, saying, “Easy there,” as she sent the last of her regenerating mana into him to ward the encroaching sickness away. Rooks eased up and replied, “Thank you, my dear,” then stared into his attacker’s eyes. The shaman flinched a little, worried at the look of a Dwarf with some experience under his belt, and then became downright frightened as Rooks mystically entered his mind and implanted the seed of fear, which quickly sprouted and took hold. The shaman attempted to run away but the wizard shouted after him, “Return coward! Die if not!” The shaman was to frighten of Rooks now and nothing could change that. The wizard cast an aura around the shaman’s feet, rooting them to the ground until he could be dealt with later. Rooks grinned. “So stranger. What is your name?” “My name is Arihel, Defender of Felwithe. Why do you ask?” “If we die, I wish to express to Brell how valiantly you fought at our side,” replied Rooks. “Always the optimist,” Rosa smirked. Arihel chuckled and asked, “And if we survive?” Rooks chuckled this time and said, “In that case I will toast your name for the next forty nights of hard drinking.” “Deal,” said Arihel as she clutched her two handed sword tightly. “As long as you are paying, of course.” “Of course,” replied Rooks. “Then might I suggest we charge now?” asked Rosa. “For Mithaniel Marr, I strike at thee!” cried Arihel as she led the charge. The sword and shield followed with Rosa and Rooks close behind. The four Goblin warriors, the best of the Goblin fighters, ran to meet them halfway. As the battle began, each warrior felt himself weaken, become lulled, and found that the air around them would fall away. The wizard grimaced. “Me thinks their be another to fight,” he said to himself as he refocused his eyes to see beyond the normal. “There!” he screeched to himself. “Another…but what is it? It be a half-breed? No, no, no…half breeds not able to do this magic…then what it be?” He cast a rift around his body and stepped into the shadow that formed only to reappear behind his foe. The wizard grabbed the hidden opponent, causing her to loose concentration and reappear. “Me thinks me have dinner now!” Arihel’s friend struggled fiercely, shouted out profanities in her native tongue. The Goblin wizard recognized the language and fell back, shocked. “Why you do what you do? You not like others. You traitor!” The figure drew her knife, holding it ready to fight the wizard. “I have betrayed no one. They betrayed me.” “Me get word to them! You die slowly!” the wizard rambled. Arihel saw what was happening, but the warrior she was facing off with was very skilled and it took all she had left to keep up. She looked to the other two and they were not fairing any better. The energy field that held the animated sword and shield together was weakened and falling apart. She had one idea left. “Cover your eyes!” she yelled. Rooks and Rosa looked to her general direction and saw she was beginning to cast a spell then fell to the ground with their eyes closed. Arihel released a bright flash of light, blinding the Goblin attacking her. It was disoriented for a few minutes, giving her time to repeat the process with the remaining through Goblins. “Now finish them!” she yelled again. Rosa and Rooks jumped to their feet and saw the Goblins staggering for sight. They finished their targets quickly and turned on the remaining Goblin, killing it before the animated sword was destroyed. “Help!” shouted Arihel’s companion, trying to flee from the wizard’s attacks. “I’m coming!” shouted Arihel as she ran to help her. Rooks and Rosa followed her to finally end this battle. Arihel knew they could not reach the wizard in time to stop him from killing her companion, so she relied on one last idea, one hope to finish this Goblin once and for all. She stopped dead in her tracks and yelled at the top of her voice, “For the Mithaniel Marr!” and with all her might she tossed her two-handed sword. It flew through the air, spinning with momentum, and cleaved through the torso of the wizard, protruding out his back. The Goblin wizard’s eyes widen with surprise and he sputtered, “Me…get…ugh,” before falling to the ground. Arihel approached the corpse and withdrew her sword, wiping the blood on the scraps of clothing it wore. Turning to Rooks, she smiled weakly and asked, “What about that drink?” Rosa and Rooks burst into laughter and he responded, “Aye! We shall drink heartily for our victory here this day!” Rosa shook her head in a slight sadness though and sighed, “To bad Zarchoomi escaped. I really wanted to relieve that Ogre of her head.” Rooks nodded. “But we have given a blow to the Goblins.” He pointed to the wizard at Arihel’s feet. “By the markings on this Goblin he is the one that has been leading many raids against the outposts.” Arihel grinned. “Really?” She turned to her companion and said, “You hear that? You just helped kill one of the leading Goblins.” Rosa and Rooks turned to the robed figure, causing her to shift in an uneasy manner. “Yes…I suppose I did. A…proud achievement for some I assume.” She turned to walk a small distance away, deep in her own thoughts. “What is with her?” asked Rooks. “She is…depressed about things right now,” replied Arihel. “Best to leave her alone right now.” Rosa looked to the figure and asked, “Are you sure? Maybe I can talk to her and…” “No, I think she should be left alone, especially right now.” “Ok, if you think that is what we should do,” replied Rosa. Arihel nodded and began to rummage through the wizard’s body while thinking to herself, “I hope you will be ok with yourself, Lyrial.” Lyrial stood by herself, as she felt she always did. Even at home she was alone, a single, insignificant face in a crowd of people too busy with their own agendas to care. She survived and fought, her only home her guild’s hall, her only friends the objects she brings to life. Lyrial fought hard to earn enough for three things in life, food, water, and the chance to travel and leave her home. Becoming an enchanter could help her accomplish this, allowing her to walk anywhere without the fear of being killed on sight and hide from her people, if necessary. The wizard was right, though. She was a traitor to her people, but Arihel said that her people betrayed her first. “Could she be right?” she asked herself. “I left them because they never accepted me, but does that mean I am weak? Are my people truly stronger for the conditions they are in?” She pondered these questions time and time again as she traveled with Arihel, but each time left her where she began. Throughout her life, Lyrial was taught that she should be proud to be who she was, and that hr people were far superior to all others. Yet in her travels with Arihel she found that many Races claimed that very same claim. Could what all that was taught to her just have been propaganda designed to create loyalty? She looked to Arihel and sighed. This was the only person who ever cared about her without expecting anything in return, and yet she was a High Elf, a Race of supposed ego-inflated narcissists. Could that have been wrong? Lyrial stared into the sky in the horizon and realized that it would be a long time before she would be able to answer these answers. Rooks walked over to the shaman, who was still rooted to the ground. He squirmed fiercely as Rooks approached, still under the effects of the fear spell. “Why did you attack us?” he asked. “We…ah…we fight to help Ogre. She help us, we help her. We help her, she help us.” The shaman’s knees could barely hold his body up and his eyes held an unnatural fear. Rooks was enjoying himself immensely, remembering failed attempt at Runny Eye when his small band was surrounded by Goblins. His fear then might rival what this Goblin might be feeling. It was not enough. “So you decided to help her out now and kill us, is that correct?” he asked the shaman as he turned to take a few steps in the other direction. “Y…yes…” Rooks turned back to the shaman sharply, swinging his hammer at the Goblin’s head. “Then explain why I should not kill you here and now!” The Goblin screamed at the top of his lungs, his spell-enhanced fear pumping through his veins faster and faster. Rooks’ hammer stopped just inches from the Goblin’s face as Arihel’s sword collided with it. “What are you doing?” she asked calmly. Rooks stared at her. “I am finishing the battle.” “The battle is over. This is murder.” Rooks looked at the shaman straight in the eye for a moment then dropped his hammer to his side. His eyes narrowed and quietly said, “Tell your people that if you continue to help Zarchoomi, you all will face the full force of the Dwarven army.” The shaman nodded quickly and ran as soon as the rooting spell lifted, leaving a yellow trail behind him. Rosa walked over to Rooks and put a hand on his shoulder. “When he looks on this event tomorrow, it will be through the eyes of a scared being. He will spread news of this day to all his people. That will do more damage than just killing him.” Rooks sighed. “I suppose so.” Rosa knelt down and whispered into his ear. “Our fallen friends at Runny Eye would be proud today for our feet.” Rooks nodded and smiled. “Let’s see what we can salvage from these corpses and get somewhere that we can rest in.” Rosa nodded and they separated to rummage through the dead Goblins. Arihel finished taking what she felt was her fair share of the spoils, plus some for Lyrial, and walked over to her. “Are you ok?” Lyrial did not respond. Arihel stepped closer and quietly said, “I can only imagine what is going on inside your head.” “No. No you can’t,” she replied. Arihel was slightly taken aback. “Maybe your right. Maybe I can not imagine what you are going through, but I can see the effects. You are becoming increasingly moody and introverted. Even for your Race.” Lyrial nodded but said nothing. “You will have to trust someone eventually. Everyone needs a friend.” “I…I trust you, Arihel,” she said quietly. Arihel smiled at her. “Thank you. I trust you as well to do what is right in your heart, whether it is stay here or return to your people. That is all that matters, you know. The feeling in you heart.” Lyrial looked up to Arihel from her hooded face and said, “Thank you.” “Hey! Arihel!” shouted Rooks. Arihel and Lyrial turned to face Rosa and Rooks approaching them. “Yes…uh…you know, I don’t think I know your name.” Rooks thought for a moment and laughed hard. “I suppose you don’t! I am Rooks, cleric to the mighty Brell.” “And I am Rosa, druid and child of Tunare,” added Rosa, nodding. “Pleasure to meet you. What is it that you wanted, Rooks?” Rooks smiled and asked, “Where are you headed, M’Lady?” “My companion and I are on our way to Felwithe to rest. We have been traveling in Antonica for a long time.” “Ah, I see. Rosa and I were considering going to Crushbone soon. The Orcs have been making outposts here in Butcher Block and we felt that if we attack them in their home that they may pull out to defend it.” Arihel thought for a moment. Lyrial turned to her and whispered into her ear, “That is where D’Vinn is, isn’t it?” Arihel nodded without saying a word. “Then I wish to go.” Arihel turned to Lyrial with a look of shock. “Are you sure?” Lyrial nodded. “Yes.” Rooks and Rosa looked at each other then at Arihel and Lyrial with a confused look. Arihel stared into the hood that covered Lyrial’s face and could sense the determined look in her eyes and finally said, “If that is your wish.” Arihel turned to Rooks and Rosa and with a smile said, “We shall be honored to join you in.” “Great!” exclaimed Rosa. “Hail! Their ground shall be soaked with Orcish blood just like this ground is soaked with Goblin blood!”
