This is what happens when you update at 3am.<br><br>The slightly more insane than me halfling, Brenlo, has posted a guide to the Barter system written by GM Darcfae.  Here's a clip:<blockquote>On the left hand side of the screen you will see a list of all items you have available to sell or trade to others.  Just select the item you wish to sell and click on Search.  On the right hand side at the top you will see everyone who is willing to purchase your item.  Select one of the buyers at the bottom right it will list everything they are willing to trade and/or any coin they are willing to give you for the item.  Then just select Find Buyer and follow the trail to the merchant player who is offering you the best deal for your item.</blockquote>You can read the full guide <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guides&message.id=200&no_redir=true#M200">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sun 27 Feb 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#5757<br>Printed On: Thu Apr 7 0:35:38 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
