Not as many site features as we have had in the past few weeks though.  Tuesday we had an all new <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Guides.Detail&id=8">Druid Guide</a> and Wednesday the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/image299/EQ_Omen_13.gif">final 8 entries</a> for the contests were posted as polls put up to vote.<br><br>On the news side, Monday a bunch of new Omens previews were posted around the net - check down the page for the list and links.  Tuesday Mobhunter had the <a href="http://mobhunter.com/000032.html">first "review"</a> of Omens of War based on the first week of gameplay.  Thursday a new <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63487">Halfling Hodgepodge</a> was posted.  Finally, on Friday Worthplaying put up a new <a href="http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=20247">Omens review</a>, and <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?category.id=Classes">class issues lists</a> were updated over on the official boards.<br><br>And to close this week off, Allen who was doing the weekly community updates every Sunday has had some RL issues come up and is unable to do them anymore.
