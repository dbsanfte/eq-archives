The shroud is permanent until you rehail the NPC and ask to have it<br>  removed.</p><br><p>Once you have taken on the form, you get the basic attributes of that spirit.</p><br> <p><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/full_res.php?ss=519"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=519"></a>  </p><br> <p>Here is a screenshot of the selection menu. You can choose from any of the<br>    types on the left. I have chosen a fairy trickster, which is an enchanter.<br>    You can<br>  choose any level of this spirit shroud up to your current character's level.<br>  The screen shows you what the attributes of this fairy enchanter are, and the<br>    equipment she has.</p><br> <p>You can see that the first level is unlocked, and you have to get 1% experience<br>   for the second level of fairy  to be unlocked. The more you play<br>   as a fairy, the more experience you get and the more shrouds you can unlock,<br>   giving you more classes with that shroud to play.</p><br> <p>You can play any one of the spirit shards and move up in levels with that line of<br>   spirits.</p><br> <p>The spirit shards are designed to allow higher level player to play with<br>   any lower level player with the classes offered. Although they might work<br>   in a pinch to replace a class on a raid, they are designed to allow players<br>   to experience much of the lower level content they might have missed previously.  They are not powerful at the higher levels as compared to an equivalent level equipped character.</p></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 13 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10954">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10954</a><br>Printed On: Wed Dec 21 0:17:25 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
