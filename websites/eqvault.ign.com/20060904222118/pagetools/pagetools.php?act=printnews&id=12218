Rashere writes:<blockquote>The changes to DoD missions didn't get done in time for this patch.  We are wrapping them up now.  They will be on test in the next couple days and should go out with our next patch.<br> <br>The changes are pretty substational so I encourage anyone to hop on test and check them out once they are in place.</blockquote><br><br>Gordish adds:<blockquote>Yes it's still coming. Unfortunately the amount of items that needed to be adjusted was pretty large and it has taken much longer than expected. Once we started the adjustments we found several other issues with the itemization and risk vs. reward that needed to be taken care of with this. The changes should make it to test early next week and go with the next patch. </blockquote><br><br>No mention of when the next patch is!<br><br>Zorillius, EQ Producer, had this to add:<blockquote>Gordish and Rashere have mentioned these will be going in our next update. I just want to mention that these changes will be going live as soon as we feel we've got it right.  The best thing to push this along is to login to Test and submit your feedback once the changes are up.</blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 27 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12218">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12218</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 4 15:21:18 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
