The article focuses on the weaknesses of Omens of War.  Here's a clip:<blockquote><br>The Omens task system could be the future of quests in Everquest. All of the tools are there to help players accomplish quests and travel across Norrath. While the current quest options are limited, scripted encounters and continuing story lines could take players through exciting quests far different from what we're used to. Add scripted and locked encounters, add an overarching story line, add more rewards than just cash and experience, and you will create a strong new quest system in Everquest for all levels. Include quests for level 68 and above. All players should have the option to perform tasks.</blockquote><br>Good article all around - <a href="http://mobhunter.com/000037.html">check it out</a><br><br>Next up, Stratics posted the HoC chat log from last weeks developer chat.
