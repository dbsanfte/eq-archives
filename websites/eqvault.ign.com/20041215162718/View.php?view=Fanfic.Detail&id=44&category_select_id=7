<hr noshade/></p>
<b>09-07-2004</b> - 
<p>His master had not told him of these monstrous cousins of the Iksars.  His God had failed to teach them anything about them either.  No one he knew, no one he trusted, had made any mention of Trolls before in his life.  This left him in a peculiar position.  Since he had never been prepared to fight them, he considered this a violation of trust.  They knew about these things, but never told me.  They knew I was to fight them, and still never said anything.  Master sent me to fight them, and didn’t even prepare me for them.  Does he want me to die?  Am I a sacrifice?  Cazic-Thule should have at least given me some information regarding them.  After all, Iksars are his divine creation, his chosen ones, and I am the best of my caste by what everyone says.  So I should have been prepared if they are my allies.  No, I cannot trust them now.  They have left me to fend for myself after they send me to my death.
	<p>He thought, I guess I am dead then.  To them at least.  Now I shall become true silence, a ghost.  I shall not hunt them unless they hunt me, but I shall be with only those I can trust.  And right now, the only person I can trust is myself.
	<p>Fortunately, he had no belongings since he was a monk.  He had been trained that the only weapon he needed was his own body.  He could find his own food.  The only thing he needed to find out was where to go.
	<p>He knew that to survive, he would need information on what was going on.  He left his shack of a room and headed to his master one last time.
	<p>His master was squatting in the center of the training arena.  As always there were others around the outside of the arena.  He approached his master.  When he stood before him, he bowed as a matter of courtesy and respect, not out of habit as he usually did.  His master must have sensed something about his pupil that was different.  He sat there for a few seconds studying him, then finally stood and bowed in return.
	<p>“What is it that my pupil seeks?”  His question was more than the obvious.  Silence observed his master carefully.  He did not see him as a teacher anymore.  This was a master of the arts, a very powerful and wise monk.  He knew immediately, the roles had changed, and he must now handle his prior mentor with a great deal of caution.  He sought after what the master had really meant by the question.
	<p>The obvious meaning was to find what Silence wanted to talk to his master about.  This was too plain though.  He thought carefully, and found that probably what he meant was a deeper thing altogether.  He meant, what was it that Silence wanted deep in his corrupted soul.  Such as a paladin might seek divine grace, or a mage might look for supreme enlightenment and knowledge.  What did Silence seek?
	<p>Sensing his pupil’s thoughts and lack of answers, he interrupted, “Perhaps you do not know yet what you seek.  It is a quest, a mission, for a monk of your skills to find what they seek.  It may take you considerable amounts of time.  Instead, I shall ask you what is your purpose for being here?  I know what you are going to do.  I will not stop you… this time.  I will give you some advice before you take your first steps.  Know that the Iksar are a breed created by the infinitely great Cazic-Thule.  Yes, he has made others, we know of them.  You will not find them to be as hospitable as we are to you.  If you leave us, you might not be accepted here if you ever choose to return.  In fact, you will be choosing a long difficult road of solitude.  This road will be filled with races that will attack you on sight.  As my pupil, you will fare well against them.  After a while though, they will come in numbers large enough to bring anyone down.  Have you thought this through?”
	<p>Silence made no movements, no sign with his hands, no emotion was betrayed.  He had been disciplined hard, and he knew how to remain as still as stone.  The master recognized this as a sign of assent.  He had thoroughly thought through everything, and come to the conclusion he would prefer to fend for himself.  
	<p>“This is a road many monks have taken before you, sometimes for better, most for worse.  I must say, I am proud of your skill and learning.  You know now everything that you need.  You do not yet know all that I know, but what you need, you know.  May Cazic-Thule guide your steps, and may you bring great fear into your enemies.”  The master became silent, and squatted again.  His eyes blank as he stared into the infinite void.  Silence knew there would be no more words from him ever again.  If he even entered the arena again, the master would consider it a great offense and defend his position, for the only reason to return would be to attempt to take over as the new master.
	<p>He bowed again, even though he knew the master could not see it.  He left quickly.  He would have to find a place for safety and quiet meditations.  Where in Kunark was there a place like that?  He knew it would have to be somewhere between New Sebilis and the enemy’s city.  He figured on a small set of ruins in the midst of the woods.  He did not know which one yet.  But at least the only things he would have to worry about were goblins and giants.  These were small concerns for him, goblins did not have enough skill or intelligence to be major, and giants were too large and clumsy to be a real threat.
	<p>On the other hand, picking a point between the two cities on the southern shore of the lake was completely out of the question.  The land to the south was so full of skeletons, drolvargs, drachnids, and other more nasty things such as dragons and all, that the land was named the Dreadlands.  It was also known that any person, of any race, which traveled into those lands, usually did not leave them again.  
	<p>He decided that north would have to be the site to stage his hunts from.  The only items he owned were his tunic and the book he had kept from his ex-master.  He started at a walk through the fields one more time; this time he ignored the giant dragon’s skeleton.  He felt somehow disconnected from the Iksar race.  No more patriotism, no more pride in his people.  They were enemies of his, just as the trolls were.  Cazic-Thule had left him, so he turned his back on Cazic-Thule.
	<p>As he repeated these thoughts in his mind, his pace began to increase until he was almost a blur on the sands that soon gave way to grass, then to wooded hills.  Into the woods he ran.  He heard the calls of the goblins alerting his tribe of a newcomer to the woods.  By the time they found the spot where the sound had come from, he was a mile away and deeper into the forest.
	<p>He finally slowed down to a walk again.  Such was his amount of discipline, that his mind had his heart rate back within normal limits within a few seconds.  His breathing was perfect.  He scanned the area and spotted a small ruined building in a tight cluster of trees.  This would make an excellent place to stay.
	<p>Towards the shambled walls he moved, intent on evicting the current tenants.  As he came nearer, he became aware of something watching him.  He examined the ground without stooping.  There were small imprints where a person had walked, although they weren’t deep.  Whoever it was, they were stealthy.  He searched the woods around for whatever was watching him.  They were well hidden so he couldn’t find them.  He continued on his way to the ruins.
	<p>Inside the ruins he found only a few supplies, enough for one medium creature if they were traveling light.  He also found a small bag that had some coins in it, mostly silver.  A small time thief, he thought as he snorted derisively.  He did not even bother trying to pick it up at this time; he knew it most likely had some simple trap attached to it that he would handle later.  First he had to find the owner and take care of them.
	<p>He looked out through a few cracks in the walls, and spotted some movement.  He could not make out the creature itself, but he was right, it was medium size.  So it is not a goblin, but definitely not a giant either.  It could be one of the newcomers to his land, possibly an exile of some sort.
	<p>He moved to one of the entrances and lay flat against the wall.  Looking over his shoulder and out the hole, he saw the movement again.  This one is very sneaky and stealthy.  I wonder how intelligent it is.  He crept back over to the bag of coins.  He shifted the top some, opened the bag and picked up some of the coins.  He watched over his shoulder for the thief.  He slowly let some of the coins drop from his hands and into the bag.  As soon as the first coin clinked into the bag, the movements outside stopped.  Silence had the thief’s attention.  He shuffled through the bags in the ruins, and then left the ruins through the opposite side from where he last heard the thief.
	<p>The thief began moving towards the ruins, and as soon as he cleared the trees, Silence saw him for the first time.  It was an Iksar.  The thief wore a mask of shame marking him a pariah.  So he was right, it is an exile.  He began wondering whether he should team up with the thief since he also was an exile of sorts.
	<p>He wondered too long obviously, because a sharp sound brought him back from his thoughts.  He looked down at the ruins and saw no more movement.  He crept cautiously back to the crumbled building.
	<p>Looking again through the cracks, he saw the Iksar laying flat on its back.  It was dead by the trap it had set itself.  No, I definitely did not need to team up with him, if he did not know to disarm his own traps.
	<p>Having arranged for the vacating of the ruins, and the disarming of the trap, he settled in.  How nice of the last tenant to leave enough food for a week or so, and some other items to look through.  He began sifting through them wondering what his first move would be, and against whom.
