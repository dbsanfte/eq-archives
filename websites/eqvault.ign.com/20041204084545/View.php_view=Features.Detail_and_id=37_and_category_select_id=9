<p class="pageheader">New Orleans 2004 Fan Faire Report
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>11-05-2004</b> - 
<p>
Ah, New Orleans!  Some may say it was the perfect place for a Fan Faire.  Thousands of EQ and EQ2 fans were gathered in one hotel.  By day, they played EQ2 non-stop, attended panels, and watched an all-new Best of the Best Tournament, but by night, the crowds went wild.  Beer in hand, beads around necks, and gaming on the brain, thousands of players hit the New Orleans nightlife to party.  Everyone was as friendly as you can get.  All servers were loved (ok, except Povar), and I heard “The Rathe encounter was…” or “Yeah, that spell is too powerful” so often that it was scary at times.

EQ’s very own Fiona Vie!
<p>
With a launch date just a week away, EQ2 seemed to be the main focus of this Fan Faire.  Everywhere you turned people were playing or talking about EQ2.  But that’s not to say other games did not have coverage.  EQ Live got its fair share of attention, including a few panels dedicated to it exclusively, and the great “Best of the Best” tournament made a return.  Other games that were represented included the upcoming PS2 EQ-themed “Champions of Norrath: Return to Arms” and Planetside.
<p>
I got to New Orleans on Thursday.  The big thing everyone was talking about the moment I got there was the big EQ Parade which would be held later that evening.  It was a sight to behold to be sure – hundreds of EQ players marching almost a mile through the streets of New Orleans, lead by a police escort and a fantastic band.  Everyone got to know one another and see the sights.  It was a fantastic way to kick off the three day-long event.  
<p>
Friday marked the start of the first full day of official events.  The day kicked off with the EQ2 Ultimate Elimination Challenge.  In this event 30 very insane people were chosen to play EQ2 for 24 hours straight – at the end of the 24 hours the player with the most experience won a new Alienware computer.  The winner, announced Saturday morning, made it to level 17 and did so by soloing his whole way there – quite an accomplishment.  Our other network site, <a href="http://eq2vault.ign.com/">EQ2 Vault</a>, has more coverage on this event.  Here are a few of the pictures I took after a long night of bead throwing.

“Best Questern” – playing for 24 hours straight makes even the most hardcore players tired!
<p>
Friday also marked the beginning of Panel Discussions.  Panels Friday included CS Improvements, EQ Dev: Maintaining a Living World, EQ Lore and Expansions: Creating a Compelling Storyline, Art of EQ and the New Graphics Engine, and Character Advancement through Spells and AAs.  Other panels were also held that dealt with EQ2 and Planetside.  I was only able to attend two panels, but I talked with people that attended the others to get the big things.  Most everything I have noted has been posted all over the net as of the time I’m writing this (Wednesday, Nov 4th).  One of the more interesting things I heard was that the task system from Omens will gain over a thousand new tasks fairly soon – including tasks which have more variety then the normal “find X” or “kill 10 X”.
<p>
The biggest EQ1 event also happened on Friday – the return of the Best of the Best tournament.  In this tournament, one person was selected from every server and given a pre-made character of the class of his or her choice.  Then the select players fought in FFA groups (I believe 10 at a time) and the winner moved on through the brackets.  Eventually, the winner was a Beastlord from (of all servers) Povar.  Check out our in-game pictorial taken by the EQ GMs running the event Monday!

On the big screen
<p>
Saturday morning I watched a quick tour of the new Station Players site.  This new system is currently only for EQ2 but I was told it would eventually move to EQ1 as well.  This site is extremely cool.  It not only lists in full detail the stats for your characters, but it also has a ton of fun facts, guild info, item stats, and much more.  You can check out the site now and even view your character if you have an EQ2 Beta account – www.eq2player.com
<p>
Noon marked the start of “Live Quest” – the most fabled Fan Faire event.  This year it moved outside of the hotel into the streets of the New Orleans French Quarter.  Teams were given a list of about 15 items to collect which ranged from 5 different bottle caps to an item from Pat O’Brian’s.  My team decided to start about 10 minutes late, and most likely because I rock so much, we still got second place.  It was loads of fun with everyone running all over to find various items.  I feel sorry for the people at the front desk of the Hilton – when I ran up to get 2 paperclips, one of the list items, I got a pretty nasty look =).
<p>
At 8 PM, the big Masquerade Banquet started.  Every single person at the Fan Faire came together to enjoy the good times over the past 3 days.  After dinner SOE gave away some prizes including GeForce 6800 Ultras, ZBoards, and some really nice Logitech speakers.  Finally, it was time for the costume contest.  You can see my costume contest feature <a href="http://http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=36&category_select_id=9">here</a>.  It was a great time and a fantastic way to end the official events.  The rest of Saturday evening and Sunday morning was filled with parties, playing, and just general fun.
<p>
Overall this Fan Faire was a blast.  Visiting New Orleans is something I’ll remember for the rest of my life. (You see, this is why you should not get too drunk!)  This Fan Faire made me even more hyped for EQ2, but it also was very apparent that EQ1 is still being given the same dedication that it has been for years.  EQ has a long life ahead of it, and this Fan Faire proved it.  I’d like to thank everyone at SOE for the amazing experience and taking the time to put the Fan Faire together.  I can’t wait for the next one!
