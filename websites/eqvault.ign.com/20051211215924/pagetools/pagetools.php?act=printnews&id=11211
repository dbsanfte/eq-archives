In the next week or so we will be contacting everyone who is eligible for a beta reward by email.  If your email address is not correct and you do not receive an email you will not be able to claim your reward and we will not send out emails a second time.<br> <br>Please be aware that playing in the beta does not automatically make you eligible for a reward..  To be eligible you will need to have earned a minimum number of tokens; I do not currently have that number.  <br> <br>As I have more information to share about the Beta Rewards I will let you know so watch for further announcements here.<br> <br>Also, please do not petition in-game about the beta rewards, GMs do not have any information to share with you about the Depths of Darkhollow beta rewards.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 22 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11211">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11211</a><br>Printed On: Sun Dec 11 13:59:23 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
