 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Tunare Guilds</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Tunare Guild List!<br>
  </font></strong>Updated on August 26, 2005




<p>Complied by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! </p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.arete-eci.com/" target="_blank">Arete</a><br>
  &quot;Recruiting is reopened! Please completely read the rules below. Are you looking
  for a solid, stable guild that has been around for 3+ years, with a fair loot
  system that is progressing steadily through the Gates of Discord
  (Currently at the Txevu Zun'Muram encounter, about to enter Tacvi) expansion
  and the Omens of War expansion. If so, you might be one of the few people we
  need to fill out certain key roles in our organization!
<p>Arete Recruitment Procedures - 5-16-05<br>
  First off, let us make it clear that
  this is a raid guild. We're here to kill shit. We're aggressive and we raid
  exceptionally hard. Some days we start in
  the early afternoon and go until well after midnight. If stuff that we need
  to gear or flag up our members is up, we're going to kill it or die trying.
  No one is required to be online for every raid, but if you're online and we're
  raiding, you'd be expected to be there. We expect people who raid about 15
  hours a week at the bare minimum. We are committed to raiding at the highest
  level we can achieve and that's what it takes to get there. Some other facts
about us:</p>
<p>1. We're the only Time guild that raids on North American Central Standard
  Time (Yes, I checked). This is because our primary raid leaders and guild leader
  are on CST. If you can't convert the time in whatever time zone it is you live
  in to Central Standard, then you probably wouldn't be able to understand our
  point system anyway. The advantage is that its a nice middle ground (literally)
  between EST and PST. We have people from all over the world raiding with us,
  some early in the day and some late at night. We accomodate both.</p>
<p>2. Loot system - We're on a hybrid point system that is unique to us. Its
  very fair and spreads loot around. We don't believe in having a single &quot;Main
  Tank&quot; that we feed gear to like a ravenous beast, but rather we have several
  active well equipped warriors who can get the job done. Basically you get points
  for raiding that you use to bid on items you want. No officers get preferences.
  No raid leaders co-opt rare drops for themselves or for friends. You choose
  your upgrades. Read the details in our charter</p>
<p>3. The core of this guild was formed week 1 of Everquest release (as Council
  of Magi) and several of us are still here. We have been formed as Arete for
  over 2 years. Arete is a stable guild that has been progressing steadily toward
  our goals for years, not some risky endeaver that might fold at any minute.</p>
<p>4. Arete is governed much like a professional sports team, as a benevolent
  oligarchy. If you're looking for a California style hyper-democracy, this isn't
  it. Don't expect to vote on every little decision. Our team of officers makes
  the hard decisions with input from the guild as best we can. We are not intractable
  or unapproachable, but final decisions are final.</p>
<p>5. We don't allow guests to raid with us as a general rule. Exceptions may
  be made by a consensus of the Senior Officers online at the time, but this
  is very very rare and just because someone is allowed to guest raid once, they
  shouldn't expect it every time. The notable exception to this are the members
  of guilds we have reciprocal flag agreements with. Those agreements will be
  honored.</p>
<p>I. Recruitment process</p>
<p>1. The first step an interested person should take is to check our current
  requirements (below). These are changed regularly as our attendence and targets
  change by our raid leader staff and Senior Officers. If your class is marked
  as &quot;high,&quot; &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Low&quot; need and you meet
  the requirements for that class, great skip step 2 and proceed to step 3. However,
  if your class is marked &quot;closed&quot; all hope is not lost. We are *always*
  open to truly superior applicants, even in closed classes. But, I must tell
  you up front that it won't be easy.</p>
<p>2. (ONLY required for classed listed below as CLOSED) Closed classes may still
  apply IF they acquire 10 current active guildmembers who will sponsor them
  AND they meet the level/AA and all other requirements of their class. TWO of
  these sponsors MUST be in their class. For example, a Paladin wanting to apply
  could still do it if they have the support of two active member paladins AND
  EIGHT other currently active guild members. This is going to be a rare occurance,
  but I can name people off the top of my head that it WOULD happen for.&quot;</p>

of Honor</a><br>
&quot;Well, first off, we are looking for good people, moreso than good characters.
The thing that makes this game so wonderful is the people you meet, and the shared
adventures you have together.  

<p>When you carry the name Children of Honor, you carry with you the legacy of
  Five years and more with you. You carry with you the pride we felt when Searph
  won the Server Brawl, when Knytul became Elemental. You have with you the comraderie
  of dying together in Western Wastes, and dying again on the corpse run. You
  relive the Hate Raids, item Transfers, Kael raids, the Guild socials. You have
  with you the knowledge of how this game has changed and evolved since the beginning
  of things, some good and some bad. If the words Family, Teamwork, Loyalty,
  Success, Fun, and Memories reverberate in the vaults of your Heart, YOU are
  who we are
  looking for.....&quot;</p>
<p>No posted recruting requirements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolfe-byte.com/erforums/" target="_blank">Eternal Retribution</a><br>
  &quot;Eternal Retribution was formed in July of 2001 as a split off of the guild
  Courageous Few. Our leader is Malisse and our officers are: Gilraven, Balrok,
  Wolfex, Ambero, Nilbus, Xevelyn, and Blazingtide. If you have any questions,
concerns, or information for us please contact one of those seven people. </p>
<p>ER has worked for 4 years to remain what we started out to be, a guild that
  can raid and that does raid, but not one that is a solid raid guild, or one
  in which raid attendance is required daily. We normally raid at least 3 times
  a week these days, sometimes a bit more and sometimes less. We do leave time
  to socialize and get experience as well. We also have two forms of raids, official
  guild raids and those run by members who found something alive that was worthy
  of a kill. You can check in with various members throughout the day to see
  if there is anything upcoming that you might participate in. We are not a guild
  made for families, we are a guild that is a family. </p>
<p>Below is a list of requirements, notes, and general information: </p>
<p>1.) Do not be afraid to put your name out there. It is the best way to get
  known and further your chances to get into ER. <br>
  2.) Advanced Abilities: Ask a member of your class that is in ER for good ideas
  as to what we like to have and use. Clerics - we highly recommend achieving
  SCM and CR as soon as possible. <br>
  3.) Henchclerics: We have some henchclerics... To be happy around ER, you must
  adore and praise them, or you spend a great deal of time naked and in dire
  need of equipment. <br>
  4.) Loot: We do not use a standard point system. We DO use the same system
  for any official raid, it is just a many faceted thing.. not simply set up
  on a number basis. Loot can be determined by such things as: raid attendance,
  loots received, effect/focus, class, best upgrade. Typically, loot is an avg
  charge of 20. Each *Boss* is 1 raid point. <br>
  5.) Flags: Most of ER have the following flags and keys already done. Backflagging
  is NOT high priority as of this time, but can be done. <br>
  --- ER is Completely Time Flagged. --- <br>
  --- ER is Kod Taz flagged and Finished Ikkinz/Uqua now as well --- <br>
  6.) Raiding: To raid with us as a non- member, you need a &quot;host&quot;.
  Find a person willing to vouch for you, they will ask if you can make it to
  that raid. Achieving the level of 65 will help you to be allowed to raid with
us as well.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.godmonkey.com/boards/index.php" target="_blank">Forlorn</a><br>
  We are a raiding guild. We raid upper end content on an almost daily basis.
    However we do not have set raiding schedules. If a mob is available and we
    have the force for it, we go. We are probably a lot more casual than what
    you would expect. And we're certainly more family friendly than most guilds
    at this juncture. Generally we raid from 7pm EST to whenever we run out of
    steam/people. We raid and do pretty much everything with E'ci public, so
if you cant stand them, you might want to look elsewhere. </p>
<p>Enough fluffy crap, tell me about the loots! Loot system is DKP and is
kept on the DKP section of ecipublic.org. </p>
<p>While we pride ourselves on playing with who we like rather that who we need,
  we have open enrollment unless you are an idiot. Nice people who bring a good
    skill set and a positive, mature attitude are always welcome to post their
    interest, regardless their class. We are taking
  all classes at this time.</p>
<p>If you still wish to apply, start a new topic in the Apply Within section.
  Post information about yourself, your flags, your AAs, your goals, your play
  times, and why you want to be here. Please note that we will not accept anyone
  as a potential member if they are still a member of another guild. We will
  move your post to the PM section and talk about you behind your back. Posting
  your
  interest does not automatically mean you are a PM. As long as
  no one says &quot;oh ICK!&quot; about the prospect of having you join us on
  some raids, you will be invited to join our PM channel, where we can chat,
  relay information about raids and other activities, and poke fun at knights
  and rangers. </p>
<p>Officers in charge of misleading and confusing potential members are:Chingho
  and Rezzum.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusioneq.com/" target="_blank">Fusion</a> <br>
  Level Requirement: 70 <br>
  Minimum AA: 150 <br>
  Normal Raid Schedule: Monday, Wednesday, Saturday at 4pm Pacific <br>
  Online application; must log in to see the requirements. High end raiding guild.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galeofdestruction.org/" target="_blank">Gale of Destruction</a><br>
  &quot;We are a Hybrid Guild. By Hybrid we mean that we are a part raiding guild
  and a part family guild. What differentiates Gale from other guilds is that
  we
  have our foundation based on a family culture. There is very little cursing
  and childish behavior when we raid yet we are as capable and competent as some
  of the best raiding guilds. We feel that we have accomplished to retain the
  best of both what a family guild offers and what a full fledged Raiding guild
offers. </p>
<p>We were formed in May of 2003 and in this short time frame, we have managed
  to see the end game of each of the following modules: Velious, Luclin, Planes
  of Power. We are currently taking on, GoD, DoN and soon we'll start OoW. </p>
<p>If Loot, Speed to the end game and the take no prisioner mentality is your
  game, Gale is not for you. If you value long term friendships and a place to
  call home, with the intent of seeing new and challenging content, read on. </p>
<p>Our culture is best defined as follows: <br>
  1. We expect everyone to exhibit team work abilities. <br>
  2. At times, events like back flagging, farming for key components, doing pre-requiste
  events can be tedious but necessary if the guild as a whole is to progress. <br>
  3. We expect that people respect each other and when dishing out criticism,
  we ask that it be constructive. <br>
  4. We have a motto: Leave no one behind. That means we work hard to make sure
  everyone has the right equipment, right flags, right keys, etc. Sometimes this
  requires targeting and event for months. Examples were NToV, Ssra, ST and VT. </p>
<p>We raid 3 to 4 days a week. The times and days vary from as early as 7:00
  p.m. est to as late as 2:00 a.m. est. Most days we raid between 8:00 p.m. est
  and 12:00 a.m. est. As I mentioned the days vary with Friday and Sunday usually
  being raiding days. </p>
<p>Currently we are in Time, farming the zone. We are also starting our progression
  into GoD and we are also doing the DoN progression We just broke into Uqua.
  Everyone will need KT access to apply. You can apply without meeting all the
  requirements but a trial memembership will not be extended full membership
  till all the basic requirements are met. Additional requirements are level
  70 and 150AAs </p>
<p>Certain classes are closed that does not mean we will not consider someone
  who is a high quality person. Yet there are extra requirements. For those classes
  that are closed: Paladins, Mages, Warriors, Shadows, Rangers, we require that
  people have Time Gear or Better, Epic 1.5 perferrable, Passage into Uqua. If
  one of the latter two requirements are missing, we can still have a discussion.
  The key is that we cannot spend time equipping people from classes that are
  not critical needs for us. That will only extend our farming in Time and we
  have set a fixed date to move on. </p>
<p>Raiding is not mandatory but we expect people to raid on raiding days. In
  addition, we expect everyone to maintain a 30% raiding attendence which equates
  to about one raid a week. What is not acceptable is someone raiding with another
  guild or a set of friends while the guild is also raiding. Also, raiding with
  the open system is not allowed, if this is something you wish to experience,
Gale is not for you.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thekeepers-eq.org/" target="_blank">The Keepers</a> <br>
  &quot;The Keepers are usually defined as a family guild, and recently as a family
  guild that raids. Our members are diverse and our requirements are few and
  far between. We attempt to behave with honor while enjoying our play time and
  eachother. A vast majority of the guild is above level 50, with quite a few
  being above 60. That being said, there is no level requirement. It is just
  a warning that if you are below 50 you may find few play partners in the guild,
  but plenty of chat and potential help. If you would like to check out the classes
and levels of the guild, take a look at the Guild Reports or Roster. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that we are not here to pamper new members or twink you,
  but that doesn't mean that items are not handed down or help is not provided.
  If you need help with your epic, some quest or what ever, it never hurts to
  ask. After you ask, it usually isn't a good idea to keep pestering everyone.
  If it is something you can schedule, make an event or raid so that people can
  pre-plan to be there. </p>
<p>We enjoy grouping with each other as well as raiding together. We invite friends
  of the guild along on pretty much any event, raid or romp. There is no requirement
  that you group or raid with your guildmates, but the more you interact with
  your guildmates the more they will interact with you. </p>
<p>It is suggested that you /join keeperfriends to get to know us by chatting
  with us, grouping with us and when possible raiding with us.&quot;</p>
