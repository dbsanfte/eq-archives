So without further ado, here is the Dragorn:<br><blockquote><br><b>Dragorn</b><br><br>The dragorns are noble creatures who believe they were carved from of the heartiest earth and stone by the great dragon, Dranik. The creation of the dragorn was Dranik's final act. He was mortally wounded and unable to move, let alone return to the skies. So as he lay dying, he used the last of his magic to become one with Kuua's coarse surface. As the spell was near completion, Dranik used his great claws to carve his own flesh and bring life to this proud race.<br><br>As a civilization, the dragorns valued courage above all else -- that was, at least, until the influence of Discord drew a shade of darkness over their world of Kuua and opened the door for Mata Muram's legion.<br><br>Throughout their history, the dragorns led simple lives. The serfs kept their city and kinsfolk with full bellies and armored bodies. The warriors and knights often made courageous expeditions and patrols from their great city of Dranik to the regal palace to the northeast, fighting beasts and creatures that threatened to overcome their lands.<br><br>In the palace, a mighty council of nobles ruled until the wars with the Muramites began. When Mata Muram seized control of the dragorn palace, his soldiers marched the nobles to the great wall that surrounded palace's gates. It was there in the remnants of that once great barrier, that the nobles were destroyed. Once this massacre was complete, the lands were turned to chaos.<br><br>The dragorns felt terror for the first time as they watched the unstoppable waves of Muramites that tore their world apart and enslaved many of them. The Legion of Mata Muram also took the best dragorn warriors into their army, threatening to kill their kin should they refuse. Some willingly joined their ranks as well.<br><br>Now, the dragorns' only goal is to survive as they mourn the great city and lands in tatters around them, though some still do have the will and courage to fight. <br></blockquote><br>SOE also sent over a screenshot.
