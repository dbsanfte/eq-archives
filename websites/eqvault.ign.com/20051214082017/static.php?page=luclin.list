 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Luclin Guilds</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Luclin Server Guild List!<br>
  Luclin merged with the Veeshan server.</font></strong><strong><font size="+1"><br>
  </font></strong>Updated on July 29, 2005
<p>Complied, not by a bot, but by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! I would especially like
  guild leader names and recruiting officer names to list for each guild.</p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=1486&TabID=911" target="_blank"><strong>Angels
of the Underworld</strong></a><br>
<em>&quot;If we are mark'd to die, we are enough to do our country loss; and if to
live,
the fewer men, the greater share of honour.</em>
<p><em>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more. By Jove, I am not covetous
  for gold, nor care I who doth feed upon my cost. It yearns me not if men my
  garments wear... such outward things dwell not in my desires...</em></p>
<p><em>But if it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive. --
King Henry V</em><br>
<br>
  Full Members are NOT required to have any of their alternate characters tagged
  as Angels. However, Full Members should have any alternates, that they regularly
  play, tagged so that they can participate in the guild chat and events. All
  guilded alternates must be listed in the roster. Full Member's main character
  (40+) must
  have the following keys: Sebilis. Full Members must be registered on Guild
  Portal and have their EQ Profile up-to-date.</p>
<p>As of 1/9/03, we have instituted a 1 re-invite maximum for all returning candidates.
  If you leave the guild and later wish to rejoin, you will only have one opportunity
  to do so. No second re-invites will be approved. There are exceptions to this
  rule, of course. Real life issues that prevent you from playing the game will
  always allow for a re-invite. Leaving the guild because you were looking for
  a better guild or because you got mad, are not acceptable reasons for a second
  re-invite and in some cases are not good reasons for any re-invite at all.
  Returning candidates can always request an exception to the rule for Guild
Council consideration.
<p>Joining a guild should be a carefully thought out decision. We do not want
  members who join on a whim. Likewise, leaving a guild should only be done after
  careful consideration and after all attempts to fix the problem have been tried.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://bruinsmarauders.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Bruin's Marauders</strong><br>
</a>Our requirements for membership are as given below. If you meet these requirements
and wish to apply for membership in our guild, please use the form found at the
bottom of this page.</p>
<p>If you don't yet have any characters in the guild, you must be at least level
  twenty. <br>
  If you already have a character in the guild, any other character must be at
  least level eight. <br>
  You should have an up to date profile with http://www.magelo.com. <br>
  Read our Guild Charter. You can find it in the &quot;About Us&quot; section. <br>
  Process<br>
  Everyone looking to join Bruin&#8217;s Marauders is required to fill out an
  application.</p>
<p>We also need to group with you a couple times before an invitation can be
  extended. This is used as a feeling-out period, so that you can see what we&#8217;re
  about as a guild, and we can see if you would fit within the dynamics of our
  guild. The easiest way to ensure this is to join our application channel in
  game, (/join BMApp) and introduce yourself. You can also use this as a way
  to get to know members of our guild. Sometimes the channel is quiet, so please,
  make your presence known.</p>
<p>You will be invited to the guild shortly after we receive your applcation.
  You will be invited to the guild as an &quot;Initiate&quot;. After your trial
  peroid is over, a decision will made as to whether or not you are a good fit
  with our guild.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cestusdei.org/news.php" target="_blank"><strong>Cestus Dei</strong></a><br>
&quot;A collective group of bastards&quot; is the slogan; no recruiting information
listed;
recruiting closed.
Anguish level guild. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosjustice.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Chaos Justice</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Chaos Justice has been growing rapidly recently and we have nearly reached
  our guild size goal. We are closing applications to some classes and raising
  the requirements to more closely match the level of our leaders. We are serious
  on the listed requirements. If you don't have the required level, and swear
you are levelling fast, fine, please do so, and then post your application. </p>
<p>Hanging out with CJ: It is important to note that we are a raiding guild so
  you must be ready to leave an experience group anytime a raid is announced.
  Hiding with anonymous
  will not be tolerated. The guild is not responsible for helping you get your
  epic or complete any other quests, although we do this at times if there is
no raid planned. </p>
<p>Please note date and mob of raids you attend, for the rare case you are forgotten
  on the raid logs. If you have friends or rl friends in guild tell us. </p>
<p>Timezone: CJ is a European guild so you need to know most of the guild activity
  will be between 7pm CET (1pm EST) to around midnight CET (6pm EST). Be sure
  your
online times match these times. </p>
<p>Attitude: We ask full loyality from our members as well as from future members.
  So please leave your old guild before you apply to CJ. Also applying to multiple
  guilds
  simultaneously does not seem appropriate. You either want to join us with your
full heart, or you can stay away. </p>
<p>One last general requirement is the ability to listen to criticism and learn
  from it. We will help you learn to play to be an effective member of CJ. </p>
<p>To know more talk to our relationship /recruitment officers : Abisynthe or
  Jatina/Guerison. </p>
<p>Application Requirements<br>
  Gear: This is not a huge issue normally. Having shown
  effort in trying to get better gearwise is a plus though as it shows interest
  in progressing yourself.

<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=1705&TabID=2339" target="_blank"><strong>Circle
of the Greater Wyrm</strong><br>
</a>&quot;<em>The new world of Norath lay in chaos... </em></p>
<p><em>The gods had left their mark on the young planet and planted their seeds of
  beings throughtout the land. Dwarfs, Barbarians, and Elves of many kinds, along
  with others, now wandered the countryside. Cities formed, along with alliances
  and hatred for others. The world was a dangerous place. Guilds began to develop
  during this time. Most of these were warring guilds with the sole purpose of
  loot and plunder. But a small group of people chose a different path, a path
  of friendship, loyalty and brotherhood. Yes, they understood that adventure
  was important, but is not the foundation that builds a strong guild. The desire
  to help and protect each other is a powerful idea, and one that can sustain
  someone through the darkest times. </em></p>
<p><em>The forward thinking founders named the guild &quot;The Circle of the Greater
  Wyrm&quot;. The ideas found fertile ground in Norath. The Circle has grown
  by attracting people that believe in the idea that comradery is more important
than platinum, and that assisting others is itself a great reward...</em></p>
<p>There are three main items that make a Wyrm... Family, Friends and Fun!</p>
<p>Family always comes first with us. We promote respect and good will towards
  all members of our family. Whenever possible we encourage our members to group
  together and help one another. Numerous have been the times that we have left
  what we are doing in order to help a family member in need. Like most families
  we have our differences, but these are expected to be handled with respect
  and regard for the others feelings.</p>
<p>Friends are found in many places. It is most pleasureable when your friends
  are found within your family! Though we have many friends outside the boundaries
  of the Circle and hope to make many more friends in the days to come. Many
  friends have made the transition to family, and we hope to see many more friends
  make that leap.</p>
<p>Fun is a state of mind. We usually have fun because we have decided to have
  fun. And fun can often be found in the most unusual places. We are not a hardcore
  Raid em up and l337 Uber guild. If powerleveling and total twinking is what
  you seek, you had best seek it elsewhere. Most of us like to escape to EQ for
  a little rest and relaxation from the cares of the Real World... not to find
  ourselves in just another high pressure environment. &quot;Fun&quot; is also
  not meant to be had at the expense of others. Good-natured ribbing is acceptable
  and often found among family members. Just have a care that everyone considers
  the ribbing &quot;good-natured&quot;. Most of all... HAVE FUN! If you aren't
  having fun... what the heck are you doing here?</p>
<p>Now the Rules...</p>
<p>NO SWEARING !! Lewdness and rudeness are not acceptable. We wish to keep a
  family environment within the Circle. Please be respectful of that.</p>
<p>NO BEGGING !! Nobody likes a beggar. We all work hard for what we have. It
  is okay to ask for assistance and make requests. But constant badgering for
  items, PL'ing and other things will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>RESPECT and COMMON COURTESY !! They are required among family members and
  others that you come in contact with. If you cannot maintain a decent level
  of respect for those around you... we don't want you.</p>
<p>We do not have any level requirements per se... but be aware that the average
  level in our guild is around 40. Coming in at level 10 may be difficult in
  finding groups among the Wyrms. There are however numerous alts that fall in
  the lower ranges.</p>
<p>Expect to group with Wyrms a few times before an invitation is extended. And
  even after joining us you will have a 45 day probation period that allows us
  to get to know you, and you to get to know us. We are an easy going, laid back
  guild with much to offer those that seek a like environment.&quot;</p>

      Realm</strong></a><br>
  &quot;The battle between good and evil on Norrath has raged for many centuries with
  neither side ever gaining a distinct advantage over the other. The fight of
  the Light against the Dark has become a way of life for all the citizens of
  Norrath and Luclin. This was not always true, however. Long ago the Light ruled
  and this was a peaceful world. The Gods that now reside in the Planes of Power
  came and brought foul and evil creatures to our world. We still fight them
  to this day. <br>
  <br>
  The evil Gods surprised the rulers of our world and defeated them. Several
  of them, however, managed to escape and fled to a Lost Realm, called the Realm
  of Knowledge, the location known only to the Gods themselves and a very select
  few chosen to defend it. They set out to restore control of the world to its
  citizens. They have begun to enlist the aid of many great people to form an
  army to fight against the dark Gods. They are called the Defenders of the Lost
  Realm and their mission is to form an elite group of fighters to go to the
  Planes of Power and defeat the evil Gods that rule each plane. <br>
  <br>
  Each member of the Defenders of the Lost Realm must try to obtain their own
  ultimate weapon, known as an Epic Weapon and raise their skills to the highest
  level possible. The battle is on; the portals to the planes have been provided
  by the Realm of Knowledge. It is the goal of the Defenders to form this army
and defeat evil and restore our world to its proper place in the Light of Knowledge.

<p>Recruitment: Any level is accepted. We now have an Recruiting Officer, Zemizia.
  Send her
a tell or ingame email to discuss joining DLR!&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.deluclin.com/" target="_blank">Descending Essence</a></strong><br>
  &quot;Hi, are you interested in joining a guild of perverted folk? Do you place
  more weight on being with friends than playing with asshole players? Than DE
  is
  the place for you! Make certain to list at a minimum, character name, character
  class, level, regular play times, and if you have grouped with any other DE
  Members. General format for joining the guild is by recommendation of existing
  membership, so please make attempts to group with guildmates before applying.
/join JOINDE to try to get members. Applications will be closed after 60 days.</p>
<p>Inside guild, DE typically goes by RL first name. This enables people to be
  able to become a little more familar with one another and at times helps sort
out alts a little bit. </p>
<p>People then tend to give folks more consideration knowing there is a real
  person behind the other keyboard, not just a random character. To make this
  easier in the initial learning of names, in the guild management tool &lt;alt-g&gt; we
  denote everyone using the following methods. REAL NAME - MAIN CHARACTER NAME &lt;MAIN
  GUILD&gt; (if not DE). This is important due to one of the guilds most important
  rules. Treat people like people, treat others how you would wish to be treated,
  don't abuse your family.</p>
<p>We are a family typically **not** made up of children. Childish behavior is
  nothing that is tolerated very long in guild. However, guildchat does range
  from R to X in guild chat. Nothing that a child should be seeing.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to have a good sense of humor and to not take much
  said in guild to heart. We give one another an immense amount of grief but
  it is almost always being done in jest.</p>
<p>Boobies:<br>
  You must like boobies, either by proxy or be in possession of your own pair.
    You will hear about boobies often enough in guild. Long ago this became a
    standard question and we are gonna keep working with it. Besides, working
    with boobies is fun =). If this offends you. EBPs will probably turn your
    brains to jello.</p>
<p>Raiding:<br>
  Descending Essence is not a &quot;point a gun at you and force you to raid&quot; guild.
  If we did, we would be considered assholes and technically pointing guns at
  folks and making them do things is illegal. When events are called or pre-planned
  the folks that want to go, please go. The folks that do not wish to attend,
  spam about the event in guild is not to make you feel guilty, it is simply
  the easiest way to remind folk who are just logging in that an event is going
on.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.endorean.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Endorean</strong></a><br>
  &quot;Endorean is a guild of friends, formed out of friendship and devoted to it.
    We desired to experience all that Everquest has to offer. Endorean strives
to find the balance between having fun and moving the guild forward. </p>
<p>Guild Direction<br>
  Endorean consists mostly of older and generally
  more mature players. Most are gainfully employed or have real life commitments
  that prevent them from
  devoting excessive amounts of time to the game. Many of Endorean would be considered
to be more casual players than power gamers. </p>
<p>As stated in the mission statement, the guild&#8217;s long-term goals are
  to experience every element of Everquest. Given our more casual approach to
  the game, it will take longer to achieve these goals than the average power
  gaming guild. </p>
<p>Server and Community<br>
  While Endorean will remain an active member of the server&#8217;s community,
  it will refrain from getting involved in server politics and controversy that
doesn&#8217;t directly involve the guild. </p>
<p>Conduct<br>
  Respect &#8211; All players should be treated with respect.
Harassment of other players will not be tolerated. </p>
<p>Attitude - Each Endorean member is expected to maintain an attitude that will
  enhance the playing experience of the people around him or her. </p>
<p>Guild Chat - Guild chat will be a positive environment and is not the place
  to vent or rant. Since the guild has members of various genders, races, ages,
  nationalities and political divisions; discussions that might be offensive
  to these groups is prohibited. </p>
<p>Conflict - It is the duty of each Endorean member to deal with conflict in
  a manner that is calm and conciliatory. Use of global chat channels and name-calling
  is inappropriate in all cases. Petitioning should be a last resort and only
  after all forms of negotiation have failed. </p>
<p>Epics - New members will be on a probation period for 1 month before the guild
  will help them on their epic mobs. </p>
<p>Raiding-Endorean is a RAIDING GUILD, therefore you are expected to be willing
  to raid and help each time you log on. If that is a concern or a problem, then
  Endorean might not be the right Guild for you.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of applicants we have, the officers of Endorean have
  implimented a policy regarding applicants for raids. The policy is as follows: </p>
<p>Sponsored Applicants: We encourage Sponsored Applicants to participate in
  guild raids. It is the Sponsor's responsibility to inform the Applicant when
  the raids are, starting times, porters, etc. All Sponsors should clear their
  Applicant participating in the raid with the raid leader or raid assistant.
  The number of Sponsored Applicants will be limited by the raid leader to allow
  room for guild members in on raids. (i.e. There will NOT be 15 Apps on a POH
  raid and 30 guild members). The number of Apps allowed on the raid will be
  determined by the Raid Leader and will be dependent on guild participation.
  So be sure to discuss any applicant's coming with the raid leader BEFORE the
  start of the raid. </p>
<p>Non-sponsored Applicants: Non-sponsored Applicants will ONLY be invited on
  raids as the EXCEPTION to the norm. Instead, they should concentrate on getting
  in experience groups with guild members and finding a sponsor.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www9.plala.or.jp/ed_web/" target="_blank">Eternal Dreamers</a></strong> <br>
  An Asian guild.<br>
  &quot;The Guild's role in Norrath Guild Eternal Dreamers is the group of the rebellion
  people who struggle jointly exceeding all races and religion. We will adventure
  all the continents and try to prove all mysteries. Our spirit of inquiry also
  reaches gods' world. The goals it will pursue We show strongly the presence
  in Norrath by working as a guild. We always form two or more parties to perform
  many grand quests. We support easier communicating in Japanese for our guild
mates.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.five-rings.net/viewnews.php" target="_blank"><strong>Five Rings</strong></a><br>
Currently Five Rings is taking new applications. We are looking for all classes
with 150-200 AA's and the Anguish Signets preferred, but we will consider all
exceptional applicants. Gear is not important. Number
  of AA's, dedication, willingness to improve, and most importantly, high playtimes
  are most important. <br>
  Please read through our Steps for applying to Five Rings information message
for more information.</p>
<p>1. You must be able to raid during our primary raiding hours of 6pm - 12am
  Eastern Time <br>
  2. We expect you to be lvl 70 before applying. <br>
  3. 50% raid attendance is the standard minimum for guilding. If your plans
  are to show up consistantly, just to complete your app process, then we see
  a steady decline in your playtimes, the possibility of guild removal is probable. <br>
  4. As a raiding guild, we require members to raid with us when they are online.
  Skipping raids while online is not permissible without a plausible excuse.
  We do not allow members to log on and be afk or not participating in raids
  for extended periods of time. <br>
  5. You must respect other players in the game. We don't want loudmouths, drama
  queens or sociopaths. If you can't control yourself in the game or on our message
  boards (or other public message boards) you will be subject to punishment and
  possibly removal from the guild. <br>
  6. Can you handle failure? Sometimes we will fail 3 times before we succeed
  once. Are you the type of person that will be negative or will you add some
  constructive imput to an encounter? Being negative only brings everyone down
  around you. <br>
  7. You MUST minimally have the Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of
  War, and Dragons of Norrath expansions. <br>
  8. Apps should have between 150-200 AA's and will be required to pick up raid
  specific AA's defined by guilded members of that class. Exceptions will be
  made depending on the demand for classes. <br>
  9. Being flagged for Anguish and Tacvi with a 200+ AA's is a plus. <br>
  10. If you are not flagged for Anguish, we expect you to be working on getting
  your 7 signets that can be obtained through experience groups. <br>
  11. Can get at least over 130 in all resistance unbuffed. <br>
  12. Download Maps http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/ . You must be able to get around
  places in the game. Complaining about not knowing how to get to certain places
  is not an excuse. It slows us down. Also
  try communicating in group and find out if anyone has the group leader aa (find
  pc). Chances are a person with this skill knows exactly where to be. The illuminated
  path dirrects you right to anyone in your group. <br>
  13. If you are missing some of these requirements, but consider yourself an
  exceptional player, please feel free to contact me (Laldace), and I will discuss
these possabilities with you. </p>
<p>If you do not have LoY or LDoN, the spells are not required, but applicants
  with those expansions and spells will have higher utility on raids than those
without them.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroesofluclin.com/modules/news/" target="_blank"><strong>Heroes<br>
</strong></a>"Heroes
  is a relaxed raiding guild that raids every other day. Our motto is RL &gt; EQ

  and never ask a Heroes member to sponsor or rec you (members will seek you
  out if they are interested in supporting you as an applicant). </p>

  Find a sponsor who has a compatible schedule, can keep you informed of Heroes
  events and can help you meet other Heroes.</p>
<p>Once you have all of your recs and have been an official app for at least
  two weeks, you face The Interview. Your class officer will grill you and determine
  whether to extend a guildinvite.</p>
<p>If you survive The Interview, you become a probationary member of Heroes.
  Probation lasts three weeks. You won't be able to sponsor or rec any applicants
  and your alts will not be invited into the guild until probation is over. You
  will only be eligible for raid loot that no full member wants. You become a
  full member at the end of probation.</p>
<p>Members are not allowed to change their 'main' (the character that was accepted
  to the guild) until they have been in the guild for at least 6 months.</p>
<p>Heroes members may sponsor only one person at a time and may only have 3 recs
  on the boards. The sponsorship period starts once the application has been
  posted and finishes once the applicant has completed probation. Heroes officers
  cannot be sponsors, nor do they rec the classes they represent.</p>
<p>Family members of current Heroes may be able to have some of the requirements
  waived. This is on a case-by-case basis, please talk to Whirl or your class
  rep.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact Whirl online or email her at applyheroes@yahoo.com.&quot;</p>

  Private board; recruitment status unknown.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.infiniteodyssey.org/" target="_blank">Infinite Oddyssey</a><br>
  </strong>Infinite Odyssey began on the Veeshan server January of 2003. It was founded
  on three principles: trust, honor and respect. IO is a high level, raid-casual
  guild and we generally band together during the middle of the week to fight
  the evil forces of Norrath. In the past year, we have made considerable leaps
  in our progression; becoming a stronger force than ever before. We are skilled
and efficient and are always scouting for new additions to our guild. </p>
<p>We realize that what makes this game so fun is friends. As such, we will never
  turn our backs on a friend who has chosen a different means of satisfying their
  play style. By the same token, we will never take advantage of our friendship.
  We also understand that real life is more important than this game. Whenever
  this game becomes another job, we encourage the member to take a break and
  have fun again. </p>
<p>Having bested Aten Ha Ra and cleansed Luclin, our current goal is to &quot;liberate&quot; the
  Elemental Planes. We appreciate any outside interest in the guild and if you
  wish to raise your sword and fight along our side, please post an application
  and get a hold of the recruitment officers in game.</p>
<p>RECRUITING IS NOW CLOSED, ONLY PENDING APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED! </p>
<p>Application Requirements: Please do not apply if you do not meet these requirements. </p>
<p>1) You are applying to IO with your main character. We do not exist to twink
  or flag people's gimp alts. <br>
  2) You play on the Veeshan(Luclin) server. <br>
  3) You are currently not in a guild. <br>
  4) Your character is level 65 or greater. <br>
  5) You are at least 18 years of age in real life. <br>
  6) Your character has at least 100 AAs. <br>
  7) You must be Time-flagged if you wish to raid with us immediately - otherwise
  you must be willing to wait until such time as we can backflag you for PoTime
  access via the alternate access quest. We have no plans to flag recruits for
  Elemental access - except possibly for PoFire access via kills of Fennin Ro. <br>
  You are registered and signed on to the Forums when you post your application. </p>
<p>9) You are NOT joining IO because you expect that as a new member you will
  be allowed to: ISSUE COMMANDS ON RAIDS, DIRECT OUR STRATEGIES, BOSS LESS EXPERIENCED
  PLAYERS AROUND, TALK SMACK, or otherwise PULL UBER BULLSHIT. We don't care
  what you have done in this game, or what awesome guild you came from, or how
  far ahead of us some of your characters are - if you join IO you will be expected
  to learn your class, play your role, and do as told (while on raids) by officers.
  Infinite Odyssey is not looking for more captains - we are looking for some
  smart soldiers. If there is one thing we have ZERO tolerance for in our guild,
  it is recruits who try to act as though they are unofficial officers. </p>
<p>10) You are willing to come to called raids when you are online and able to
  remain online for the expected duration of our raid. We raid *something* almost
  every night starting as early as we have force to begin and ending by around
  midnight (Eastern US) on weeknights, and somewhat later on weekends. Typical
  members attend 40-50% of our raids, but IO does not have a mandatory attendance
  policy for our members in terms of percentage of raids attended. We do expect
  that members who are online during a raid will be at the raid rather than off
grouping on their own.</p>
<p>A final word <br>
  While we do not require many AAs, and have no formal requirement in terms of
    gear or raid experience, we do use these things as a marker to determine
    how much effort you put into your character. We look especially to see whether
    the time you claim to play per week matches up with your gear and AA level.
    Be prepared to explain to us if your gear and AAs do not match up with your
    claimed playtime and raid experience: otherwise we will be left to assume
    that you are apping us to advance an alternate character, and your application
may not be given the consideration it deserves.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.keepersoftheelements.com/" target="_blank">Keepers of
the Elements</a><br>
</strong>Keepers of the Elements began in the lands of Norrath by a unique group of people.
These fine people adventured forth from a distant land to seek a new world rich
in experiences, opportunities, fun and growth. Rizz Wulfgard bound together these
people in a unit of shared ideals and goals. He formed Keepers of the Elements. </a></p>
<p>Originally, he aspired that each element, earth, wind, water and fire would
  be representative of the various classes in Norrath. Designs have grown but
  yet this concept held true. We now have Armsmasters who preside of these elements
  with class captains who assist members in development, growth, and abilities. </p>
<p>As the guild grew, we needed a recruiting master, a person who is the keeper
  of the very heart of who we are. Our recruiting standards are not measured
  on the class played but on who plays the class, their ability to do well, grow,
  understand our needs, and respect our core values. We care very much about
  each other and want our new members to share our joys and failures as we experience
  this land we call home. </p>
<p>The guild goals are of growth, adventure and enjoyment. We treat each other
  with honor, dignity and respect. We treat other people in our world the same
  yet we hold people and guilds accountable for their actions. We are very prideful
  of our accomplishments. We work very hard to do things alone and without outside
  assistance. We expect more from each member than just someone in attendance.
  We expect a valid contribution. Every member counts. </p>
<p>We are a casual guild. We generally can be found in the lands of Norrath 24/7.
  Our main focus is from 6 p.m. est to 1 p.m. est. We have a member base of over
  100. Yet due to our respect of real life obligations, we generally have 50ish
  members on nightly. We have weekly schedules posted with free days available.
  We have three required raids days per week with two optional raid days that
  can be attended or skipped as you wish. We have goals. We have a generous time
  line to accomplish those goals that allow for the difficulty of finding the
  needed spawns but yet keep us focused on achieving those goals. </p>
<p>We are joined together to have fun. We want to enjoy the multitude of personalities
  entwined in this guild as well as the very game itself. We want to do it honorably
  and with style. We are not a mass zerg force but skilled players working in
  harmony. We often seek unconventional methods since we may not be strong enough
  to accomplish the task in a conventional way. But the goal is the same, work
  together, do our jobs, enjoy the encounter, behave honorably, and have fun. </p>
<p>This is the core of what Keepers of the Elements is. What we were in the very
  beginning and what we are today. This we do not change. Thank you for visiting
  our web page and learning something about who we are. Zelfani Wulfgard, Guild
  Leader, Keepers of the Elements.</p>
<p>KoE is primarily comprised of mature gamers who have RL responsiblities but
  still find the time to log on, kill stuff, and have a great time together.
  We average 2 to 3 raid events per week dependent on circumstances. While most
  of us live in North America, across all time zones, we have players in Europe
and Australia. You can find Keepers on line 24/7. </p>
<p>KoE is over 6 years old, founded on Veeshan. While many of the founding members
  are still with us, new members are essential for the perpetuation of the guild.
  Therefore, we continue to recruit new members. We wear our tag with pride and
  do not grant it lightly. It is not easy to become a Keeper, but the journey
  is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>APPLICANTS MUST NOT BE A CURRENT MEMBER OF ANOTHER LUCLIN GUILD</p>
<p>Dual membership with alternate characters in a guild of significance is not
  allowed. Contact the Recruiting Officer for clarification if necessary</p>
<p>APPLICANTS MUST BE RECOMMENDED BY A KOE GUILD MEMBER AND APPROVED BY THEIR
  CLASS CAPTAINS<br>
  The harmony of the guild is of primary importance. As such, the reputation
  and demeanor of applicants is scrutinized. If you are friends with a Keeper
  then good for you. If not, don't despair. Post your intentions and introduce
  yourself to some Keepers. </p>
<p>The Recruit Team is here to help. For in-game recruiting assisstance please

Assistant Guild Leader; Eendiinea, Recruiting officer.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://kratosguild.org/KratosRLP/viewnews.php" target="_blank"><strong>Kratos</strong></a><br>
  To be considered for full membership you need to finish your Qvic Flag and
    be able to join us for both groups and raids. We normally raid an average
    of 5 days a week. So Casual gamers need not apply. We're looking for the
    right amount of hardcore playing, dedication mixed with loyalty, skills and
a good personality that will allow you to mesh with the rest of the guild. </p>
<p>Since we ARE a hardcore raiding guild, if, for ANY reason, you find yourself
  unable to play for more than a couple days in a row, let the officers know
  your situation. If you miss more than 10 days of raids in a row, and haven't
  gotten approval from an officer, your trial period will end and your application
will be denied. You may reapply when your play time improves. </p>
<p>As an applicant, it's YOUR responsibility to keep up to date with your progress
    and seek us out for raids and groups to get to know us. The channel that
    we have set up for our apps and trial members is very important. Auto join
    this to get help with flags and keep up with what we are doing. If you don&#8217;t
    know what we are doing for the day, ASK in this channel. Raids are not planned
    and can be called anytime ... typically 5pm &#8211; 11:30pm CST. Raid attendance
is required if you are online, unless the raid is full. </p>
<p>Things we immediately look for in applicants are play time, knowledge of class,
  and DESIRE. If you're able to impress us, you will be offered trial membership.
  Obtaining trial membership is done by raiding with us for AT LEAST a week so
  we can feel each other out. Your time spent as a trial member is directly related
  to your effort put into the guild. The more of a contributor and raider you
  are, the faster you will achieve full membership. </p>
<p>Sponsor <br>
  You will need a sponsor from our guild. This person needs to be a full member
    in good standing, and someone who has grouped with you some and will vouch
    for you if needed. This means you should seek out Kratos groups to get to
know our guildies. </p>
<p>Other requirements <br>
  Any serious applicant is also expected to have a minimum of 175 AA; their KT
flag (Qvic is nice too); all expansions; and enough online time to raid too. </p>
<p>SOME THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND TRIAL PERIODS <br>
  -- Applicants need ALL current EQ expansions - we raid DoN, OoW and GoD frequently. <br>
  -- The applicant period usualy lasts for a week, but can last longer at the
    officer's descretion. <br>
  -- The trial period usually lasts for 30 days, but can last longer at the
    officer's descretion. <br>
  -- Full members have priority for loot over trial members. <br>
  -- Full members have rights to space in limited raids over trial members. <br>
  -- Trial members need to obtain their Qvic flag and attend 60% of raids during
    their trial to get full membership. <br>
  -- If you miss more than 10 days of raids in a row without officer approval,
    your trial period will immediately end and your application will be denied. <br>
  -- Trial members shouldn't ask for guild help with personal agendas. <br>
-- Trial members are not to have gimps or alts in the guild.</p>
<p>Gear Requirements <br>
  Do not come to us in crappy gear. There are many options available for fairly
    cheap in the bazaar such that you should have at least elemental/LDON quality
    in each slot. You will get geared with us if you raid heavily, but do not
    expect to vacuum up loot until you've been with us a while and establish
    a heavy raid count ( can take a few months ). Until then we need your gear
at minimum raiding levels to help us win. </p>
<p>&middot; Armor with 60-70hp and mana (if appropriate) in all slots is easily
  obtainable given the level of gear dropping freely in lower PoP/ LDON / GoD
  / DoN / OoW. <br>
  &middot; 
  Pertinent focus items are also required. Many of these are player made or augments
  from LDON. Extended range, healing focus or nuke focus as necessary as well
  as mana preservation. <br>
&middot; 
  Flowing thought. If you are a caster you should have SOME flowing thought.
  slime boots, solstice earring, LDON augs, other minor items are obtainable
  and necessary. Do not come to us without FT if you are a caster. <br>
&middot; 
  Spells. We expect you to have all of your spells up to 65, excluding some of
  the GoD and OoW spells. <br>
&middot; 
  Epics. For most classes these are no longer the top of the line items, however
  for some their raid utility is still relevant. Clerics must have their clicker.
  Bard epics are difficult to replace as well in some cases. <br>
&middot; 
  Melee/Haste. Ensure you have max wearable haste as a melee, and that your weapons
  are not completely gimpy. If your weapons are pathetic your dps is worth less
  than the space your body takes up in the sometimes small and confining battlefield. <br>
&middot; 
  Tanks. Warriors MUST have an aggro weapon, as well as weapons without aggro.
  BoCs have been available for several years now. There are LDON augs, and also
  many lower range aggro items from PoP. New warriors are rarely asked to tank
  bosses, but sometimes when a Main tank drops, you need to step up and do your
  duty. </p>
<p>Additional requirements:<br>
  1. KEY class AA. This is not so much a matter of having
  the additional abilities that AA provide, but rather demonstrates a commitment
  to your class and the
  desire to be the best you can be. Average Kratos member has 300+ AA .. and
  some have 800+ !!! <br>
  2. Attend 60% + of guild raids during trial period (Of course, raid attendance
  is MANDATORY if you are online.) Basically if you want to be a member of Kratos,
  you need to prove it ... by raiding! If you fail to make 60% of the raids during
  your trial period, your trial may be extended for another 30 days, after which
  time your application will be reviewed and most likely denied. <br>
  3. New recruits should visit maps.eq-toolbox.com and download a the complete
  maps package so you can familiarize yourself with new zones <br>
  4. Shrink machines and an self Invising item (potions, invis device) <br>
5. Gate Potions/Necklace for non-gaters </p>
<p>As for any questions, you can contact our primary recruitment officers...Aambrosia
  or Uggums or any other officer- Nneena (Leader), Shakra, Lionkin, Herzog, Xagyg
  or Weawen. Once initial contact is made, you are encouraged to interact and
  ask question from any of our regular members and other applicants or trial
  members. As a raiding guild, most officers are QUITE busy (aka ... &quot;tell
  hell&quot;) during their online time and may not be able to give you the full
  attention you desire. However, we are always willing to talk ... you might
just have to wait for a non-raiding time period.&quot;</p>

  <br>
  The following is a recommended list of items that you should have before you
  apply to PE: </p>
<p>1. You should be able to get all resists to a minimum of 150 UNBUFFED. </p>
<p>2. We ask that you have &quot;decent&quot; gear. We do not wish to spend countless
  time re-equipping new members to Primus Exodus as they join us. </p>
<p>3. Because we are a raiding guild, we ask that you please make sure you have
  a stable connection to the internet. </p>
<p>4. You may not apply to another guild while you are a recruit with Primus
  Exodus. </p>
<p>5. An Enduring Breath item is required. The first time you drown we will laugh

<p>Raiding Requirements </p>
<p>1. You should be aware that we raid often. </p>
<p>2. As a recruit, you will be expected to have a high raid percentage. This

  for at least 6 hours on those days. For your sake, be aware of the time requirements.
  (Some exceptions can be made) </p>
<p>3. While raids are not mandatory, everyone online is expected to attend any
  raid. Given that we raid essentially every day, this means that if <br>
  you are online from the hours of 7 PM to 1 AM EST, you will be raiding. If
  that sort of play style is not attractive, this is not the guild for you. </p>
<p>Flagging Requirements </p>

  prior to achieveing full membership. </p>
<p>Raiding and Attendance of Official Raids </p>
<p>Primus Exodus is a high end raiding guild, thus the reason for our requirements.
  Although raiding is not mandatory for members, recruits and probationary members
  are expected to attend raids they are capable of attending while online. Your
  attendance will provide us with: a) Feedback for a recruit
  in areas that may need improvement as they move through the recruit stage;
  b) A chance to get to know who you are; c) Your dedication
  and focus to Primus Exodus as well as our guild goals towards progression.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.primus-exodus.com/" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://ros.guildwizard.com/" target="_blank">Reign
of Shadowfire</a></strong><br>
&quot;Hello and welcome to Reign of Shadowfire. For those who dont know us a individuals
or as a guild, we are a small group of ppl, whom have banded together to form
a small, close knit guild. Many of
  us have been around for a long time, and some are new to the game, but each
  of us posess special talents and knowledge that makes our playtime interesting,
to say the least =). </p>
<p>Currently, we are working toward getting our VT keys, and will be working
  Planar Progression very soon. We are also looking into getting into GoD and
  possibly DoN as well. As with any guild, we do have our own rules and requirements
  that are to be followed at all times. </p>
<p>1- Minimum level for recruitment: We do require that all ppl to be considered
for membership will be lvl 50, NO EXCEPTIONS</p>
<p>2- Casters: We would like all casters to have a MINIMUM of Mana Regen 5. But
  it is not required. </p>
<p>3- Respect all players: Everyone is expected to respect all players, in the
  guild or not. You WILL NOT disrespect anyone, in /ooc,/shout, or /tell. If
  you do, you can expect to be removed from the guild immediately. We are all
  adults and will conduct ourselves in such a manner. Your behavior reflects
  directly upon the guild, if you choose to behave in such a manner, you will
  be removed.</p>
<p>4- Melee: If you are any melee class, you are expected to have all Combat
  Abilities equivelent to your level. If you DO NOT, don't bother to apply.</p>
<p>5- Clerics: All Clerics should be epic (1.0) or actively working on their
  epic. We WILL NOT do your epic for you. At lvl 50, there is no excuse for not
  working on it.</p>
<p>6- VT keys: Everyone is expected to be working on their VT keys. </p>
<p>7- PoJ Trial: You will need to let us know if you have one of the PoJ Trials
  done, if you don't have it done, we will work on backflaging those that don't
  have it.</p>
<p>8- Quality of Play: We do not expect everyone to know everything about the
  game, however, we DO expect you to know how to play the character you have.
  If you DO NOT, don't bother applying, we do not have time to teach you how
  to do so.</p>
<p>9- Raids: When we raid, we do have rules to follow. If you are disruptive
  or determental to the raid, you will be removed from the raid and placed on
  a probationary period. At that point, your membership will be determined by
  the officers.</p>
<p>10- Membership: In order to gain membership, it is a MUST that you group with
  us a few times, so we may evaluate your play style. After such a point, your
  membership will be considered and voted on by all officers and you will be
  notified with the result. There will be a recruit channel that you will be
  required to join when you log in, that will be where we will announce groups
  and raids. You WILL NOT invite others to join this channel with out the approval
  of an Officer or the Guild Leader, you also WILL NOT invite someone to join
  a raid that we host, without the consent of an Officer or Guild Leader. If
  you do so, your membership WILL NO LONGER be considered.</p>
<p>11- Officers: Officers have the final say in all matters. Officers, to include
  the Guild Leader, will vote on all matters as they come about, if there is
  only 1 officer is online, the matter will be held in suspension until the other
  Officers can be contacted and briefed. The Officers are not here to babysit
  anyone, DO NOT expect them to do so.</p>
<p>12- Gear: DO NOT come to us in worthless gear. We WILL NOT take time to gear
  up new players. It is YOUR responsibility to make sure your gear is up to par.
  If it is not, DO NOT bother to apply.</p>
<p>13- Guild Chat: We will keep Guild Chat (/gu) atleast semi-respectable. We
  do not need every other word profane or otherwise. If something is said in
  /gu that offends anyone, let the person know, we do not want to offend anyone.
  If you are told that something said was offensive, and you do not respect the
  wishes of the person offended, you will be on a probationary status, and if
  you continue with such a behavior, your membership will be terminated.</p>
<p>14- Deaths: Deaths occur at anytime. If you are afraid to die, and tend to &quot;camp
  out&quot; rather than risk being killed, this is probably not the guild for
  you. We try new things all the time, and sometimes death is part of that learning
  experience.</p>
<p>15- Ignorance/stupidity: If you choose to die from ignorance or stupidity
  (ex: pulling agro from the tank, just to see if you can) DO NOT expect a rez
  from any cleric in the guild. You will eat the XP loss and have a CR to do.
  We will not have sympathy for you, nor will assist you. </p>
<p>We do sound dominating in our rules, and we do play hard, but like to have
  fun when we do so. We expect quality from everyone. We expect eveyone on to
  participate actively, either on raids or in groups.</p>
<p>As you can see, we do expect quality from all players. All Members, Officers,
  and new recruits are expected to follow the charter, failure to do so, will
  result in dismissal from the guild, regardless of guild status. There are NO
  exceptions to these rules, and we WILL NOT make any exceptions.&quot;<br>
