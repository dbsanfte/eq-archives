Chapter 6:
<br>
<br>“How do I get caught up in these things?” Malin asked himself as D’Vinn is sent flying back from a large blast of mystical energy from the package Lyrial gave him. With in just a moment of the blast, three figures appeared at the top of Taskmaster Hill. The leader, a male Wood Elf, shouted, “For Kelethin! Attack the miserable blue skinned abominations!” The three Wood Elves began to summon their mana around them, the two female Wood Elves sending a cascade of hail down on the Orcs while the leader sent a dizzying wind and careless lightning blasts down onto them. The Elves on the ground immediately grabbed each other and ran, seeing their immediate escape a good idea. Rosa, Rooks, Arihel, and Lyrial saw the stampede and decided to follow the crowd. Malin and Quintar followed as well, seeing that the situation would not be pretty if the Orcs have a chance regroup. Bosk got to the cave entrance and looked back to the three Wood Elves. “Come on!” he shouted. The leader paid no attention, making sure the ground would be soaked with the blood of the Orcs that were helpless at the moment. Bosk hesitated, not wanting them to die here needlessly, then saw that D’Vinn was approaching his position. “Now you will pay, bard,” he said with extreme anger in his voice. His clothes were ripped and singed from the blast of energy, leaving a slightly scarred chest showing through. In D’Vinn’s right hand was his Dragoon Dirk, held inverted. Geraine held Bosk’s neck tightly, scared to let go. Bosk couldn’t get away from a well-trained warrior from the Indigo Brotherhood, and they both he and D’Vinn knew it. “Anything you would like to say, bard? I have been know to give quick deaths to those who beg sufficiently.” Bosk stood his ground and said, “And give your sorry ink-stained hide the satisfaction? Not a chance.” D’Vinn’s upper lip curled into a snarl as he readied his dirk. “Then I will enjoy this.” He charged Bosk, turning the dirk right side up and calling out a war cry of the Indigo Brotherhood when a voice behind them shouted out, “NO!” Cailet appeared right next to Bosk and deflected D’Vinn’s dirk, but was punched in her gut with a hard left by D’Vinn and kicked aside. The Teir’Dal looked at Bosk with utter disdain and muttered, “Your whole Race is pathetic and weak.” A lightning blast flashed and D’Vinn went flying again, hitting the wall behind Bosk and Cailet. The Wood Elf held his staff in the air and called, “Die D’Vinn!” and cackled with glee. Bosk looked to the Wood Elf and shouted, “Thank you, but lets go! We...” Before Bosk could finish, the three Elves disappeared in a flash. Bosk and Cailet exchanged glances, grabbed hands, and both sang Selo’s Accelerando so they would get out of Crushbone as fast as they could. Geraine buried her neck into Bosk’s neck as blasts of fire appeared o the left and right of them. The Prophet and his oracles had returned in force. Geraine whimpered, “I’m scared!” Bosk didn’t reply. He couldn’t and still keep the song going. They turned the corner and almost ran into the assembled force of the Kelethin guard, behind which was an army of adventures, including of different Races. Bosk and Cailet turned to see the regrouped Orcish army, lead by D’Vinn and the Prophet. Everything was still for what seemed forever, both sides staring at each other in a confined area. A battle here would annihilate both sides almost utterly. The winner would be the one with the most fighters and neither side could afford to take the chance of being outnumbered by even one person. D’Vinn stepped forward and with a ice-cold look, he said, “This day will not be forgotten,” and turned to shove his way through the Orcish wall of centurions and legionaries. The Prophet had been looking at Bosk with almost glowing-red eyes while this was happening. Finally, in a rough growl, he said, “I see death surrounding you…and those around you. Beware your goal…for it may cost more than you are willing to pay.” With that, he turned and followed D’Vinn with the rest of the Orcs following, standing back in fear of the Prophet’s powers of extra sight, some more so than D’Vinn’s temper and fighting skill. Back in Kelethin, in the Heartwood Tavern, the adventurers were resting and drinking to relieve the aches and pains from the day’s events. Some of those pains run deeper than what can be physically seen. Before he ran out, Elventear picked Revea’s body up and ran with it, not caring about anything other than giving his love a proper burial. Now he was sitting in the tavern, having his tenth bottle of honey mead and he could barely speak now. Revea’s body was taken to High Elf clerics to prepare for the burial the following day. He was forbidden to help, to protect his fragile emotional state and to make sure everything was carried out meticulously. Someone emotionally unstable was more likely to make a mistake, and in this case it could send Elventear over the edge. Alfadar was in a corner by himself, thinking and meditating on his adopted sister’s death. He had said nothing since they left Crushbone, and now he just kept to himself. Saldyar was outside. For all his battle experience he had never seen anyone murdered in cold blood like that. In battle, death was expected. If group of Elves and Orcs or Dark Elves meet in the woods, it is a battle, one in an on going war. There is no murder there, just battle and death. D’Vinn murdered Revea. Saldyar felt a pain inside him, and he did not like it. It was like something died in him when that dagger pierced into Revea’s throat. “Hurts, doesn’t it?” asked a quiet voice behind him. Saldyar turned quickly, hand to his sword, and saw Andriana standing there with her hands cupped before her and hanging down. He tried to sniff like usual but it turned into a sniffle instead. Feeling slightly embarrassed at showing this weakness, he asked, “How did you know?” Andriana attempted a smile. “Your whole body is tense, like it is all you can do to keep from bursting…I feel the same way.” Saldyar nodded and relaxed his pose. “It does hurt.” He looked away and mumbled, “I failed.” “You failed?” “Yes. I failed to learn our teachings by letting this pain enter me.” Andriana was almost in shock by that statement. “What are you talking about?” “How can we help those in pain when we are not immune to it?” he asked. Andriana put a hand on his shoulder and quietly said, “How can we help those in pain if we do not understand what they are going through? We fight so others may live without pain, but that does not mean we can not suffer from it.” Saldyar stared at her for a moment. “How did you come to this realization?” Andriana attempted another smile, succeeding only mildly better than before, and said, “Tynkale taught it to me. Now I am teaching it to you. We help those in need but that doesn’t mean we are above them or apart from them.” Saldyar nodded. “I have much to learn still, it seems.” “I will help you learn it, if you will let me.” Saldyar nodded and looked out into the forest again. Andriana turned to leave him alone to think on things, returning to the Heartwood Tavern. Inside, everyone was sprawled about, handling what happened in their own way. Malin assumed a meditative position to focus his mind, trying to bring meaning on what happened in Crushbone. He could find nothing. Every question he answered brought him to two or three more questions. Arihel and Lyrial were in the corner, talking as quietly as possible. Lyrial wore her cloak, as usual, and assumed the Half Elf form when questioned by the guards to get this far into Kelethin. Arihel, against everything screaming inside her, pleaded for everyone to keep Lyrial’s secret. Reluctantly, they promised to not mention anything to the guards, but would not defend her if she was caught. “Arihel?” Lyrial asked quietly. “Are…are you upset?” Arihel took a large drink of her mead and sighed. “I…am confused.” Lyrial nodded. “I was…doing a favor for someone.” Arihel arched an eyebrow. “Dorn, right?” “Yes. Dorn.” Arihel took another large drink. “So you do Dorn a favor by delivering a weapon that he couldn’t deliver himself, eh?” “No,” protested Lyrial. “He wanted redemption and to be allowed back to Neriak…and asked me to deliver the gift to D’Vinn. I must have done something wrong with it though…” “Nay, ye didn’t,” said a voice behind her. Lyrial turned suddenly to see the face of the Dwarf they met in Butcher Block, Rooks, and his Wood Elf friend Rosa. They sat down to join the two Elves. “That was a spirit bomb, a very rare weapon. The knowledge is ancient and known to only a very few select. Apparently, Dorn has some friends with very powerful magic.” “Dorn used you,” said Rosa. Lyrial sat there, unable to say anything more. “A spirit bomb?” asked Arihel. “Aye,” replied Rooks. “There is only a very sketchy mention of it in a rare clerical tome that I happened to find in the deepest alcoves of my guild’s library. Nasty thing…being a blend of an old form or necromancy and enchantment.” “How does it work, Rooks?” asked Rosa. “As I said, I only know a very small bit of it but apparently an object is infused with s spirit, or part of a spirit, and enchanted to release the energy when it nears a certain person. The greater the spirit force inside, the greater the explosion.” “By Mithaniel Marr!” exclaimed Arihel. “You mean a weapon such as this existed?” Rooks nodded. “And Dorn can make another?” asked Rosa. “I don’t know, my dear,” he replied. In another part of the tavern, Toldan, Oscruncher, Cailet, and Bosk sat around the table. Bosk leaned his chair back to rest against the wall while Geraine sat in his lap, laying her head on his chest, scared to let go. He hummed a soothing tune for her to listen to and calm her almost shattered nerves. Cailet stared at the table, going over the events with some unintended creative alterations, making the memories even scarier in her mind. Toldan was on his second honey mead while Oscruncher studied his spell book, scribing a new spell into it. “Toldan? Oscruncher?” asked Bosk gently. “Yeah?” asked Toldan. “Hmm?” inflected Oscruncher, not looking from his scribing. “Thanks for looking after Cailet.” “No problem,” replied Toldan. “Mmmhmm,” responded Oscruncher. He turned to Cailet and leaned close. “And thank you for saving me.” Cailet blinked for the first time since she sat down. “Hmm? Oh…yes. Your welcome dear.” “What’s wrong?” he asked. She looked at him plainly and said, “She’s dead…just…dead.” Bosk nodded. He looked around the room and could tell that everyone in sight is hurting in their own way. He took a second to focus on everyone, ending with Lyrial. “Blasted Teir’Dal.” “What?” asked Toldan after finishing his honey mead. “That blasted, good for nothing,” Bosk stopped for a moment, feeling Geraine’s head reposition as if she was trying to listen better, so he censored his raging thoughts. “Good for nothing Dark Elf.” Toldan looked back to the table where Lyrial, Arihel, Rooks, and Rosa sat at, then sniffed and looked back. “Indeed,” he said as he lifted his now empty honey mead glass in a toast. “Bosk?” asked Cailet. “Yes?” “What do we do now?” He thought for a moment. Their options were dwindling fast. If Geraine’s parents were not in Crushbone then the possibilities of them being on Faydwer were very slim. The Goblins are not known to take prisoners and if they did there was no way to take on their whole nation or those that lived in Butcher Block. The shear numbers against him and his friends would be overwhelming. No, if her parents are still alive then the goblins are out. “Unrest?” mumbled Bosk to himself. Cailet grew pale. “Wha…what?” “Huh? Oh…nothing dear.” He went back to his thoughts when she got her color back and went back to hers. After this many years they would be dead, or undead. Bosk didn’t want to think about that. It was not an option for them to be dead…not now. “Antonica,” he said, more firmly this time. Everyone at the table looked at him with puzzled looks on their faces. “We head to Antonica next.” “Do you realize how big Antonica is?” asked Oscruncher. “Yes, I do. But there is no other place on Faydwer to hide.” Toldan shrugged and asked, “What the heck…you need a ranger?” Bosk smiled, mainly in response to feeling Geraine smile against his chest. “Yes, the more the merrier.” Oscruncher sighed and said, “Then I suppose I should come to and watch your back, Toldan.” Toldan grinned. “Ha! I knew I couldn’t get rid of you.” “What about you, Cailet?” asked Bosk. Cailet looked at him and smiled meekly. “Yes…I think I would like to come to. Revea would’ve wanted to see Geraine reunited with her parents.” Bosk nodded and eased the little Gnomish girl out of his lap and gave her to Cailet, who resumed the tune that Bosk was humming a little while before. He stood and headed to the others to let them know of the plan. Elventear agreed to it and asked to wait until after the funeral. Bosk nodded and put his hand on Elventear’s shoulder before moving on. Malin intercepted him before he got to far. “I wanted to say thank you, for getting me out of the way of that train of Orcs.” Bosk smiled and said, “Anytime. I have a question for you. Would you like to join us? We are…” Malin cut him off. “No, I can’t. What I witnessed in Crushbone cut through to me core. I must go and be alone for a while, meditate on things and ask Quellios for help guide me in the answers I seek. Take care, my friend.” Bosk smiled, understanding his position, then they grasped each other’s arms and parted, Malin leaving the inn slowly as he returned to his thoughts. Bosk moved on to Alfadar, who only nodded. Bosk was about to try and talk more, but then decided to let Alfadar be alone for now. “So what now,” asked Rooks. “Are you two headed to Felwithe now?” Arihel sighed. “I’m not sure. I am eager to see if I can return, but I am afraid.” Rosa arched an eyebrow. “To see if you can return? What happened?” “I…I was disgraced some years ago and I was forced to go to Antonica and travel. I thought I served my sentence, but now I am not sure if this is what Mithaniel Marr wants of me.” “Then why not come with us?” asked Bosk behind them. “What?” asked Arihel. Bosk walked closer to the table, eyeing Lyrial harshly before continuing. “We are on a quest to find the little girl’s parents. We tried to look through the slaves in Crushbone…but you know how that went.” He again gave Lyrial a harsh look. “There are no other likely places for them to be so we are heading to Antonica soon. You three are welcomed to join us if you wish.” “Three?” asked Lyrial. “Yes, three,” replied Bosk. “Look, I know it looks bad,” said Rooks, “but she was being used.” “Teir’Dal don’t get used…they are the ones using others.” Lyrial moved to retort his onslaught of verbal abuse but he was right. Dark Elves were users and she knew it very well. “Your…your right. We are users but that does not mean we do not use ourselves in the process.” “What are you blabbering about, inkie?” asked Bosk. “It was a trap meant for D’Vinn,” she replied. “Set by Dorn, the outcast that camps near Freeport.” “And I am supposed to believe this because?” asked Bosk. “Because it is the truth,” interjected Arihel. “I have been with her a while and I can tell when she tells the truth.” Bosk looked into Arihel’s eyes and saw that she was sincere about what she was saying. “Ok, she can come. But if there is any trouble…” “There…won’t be,” said Arihel. “My oath on the sword of Mithaniel Marr.” Bosk nodded and walked off. He could trust a paladin the oath of a paladin. For some reason, he felt he had no choice. The words of the Prophet loomed in his head, “I see death surrounding you…and those around you.” It was a scary thought. Even though he put no faith in the Orc’s beliefs or even on his word, the power he holds beyond the physical world was something to be considered. Bosk came back to the table to see Cailet smiling while playing a game with Geraine. It eased his heart knowing that she was handling what happened well. He has seen his fair share of death and destruction due to the Orcs, but she was still new to it all. And plain cold-blooded murder was something totally different. “Well…I see the two most beautiful ladies in all of Faydwer are doing well,” he commented as he crept up behind Cailet. She blushed some while Geraine giggled to herself. “We will be leaving in a few days, give everyone to adjust and prepare for the trip. Some people expressed a need to see their guild masters to train in some new techniques they might need while away and gain advice. Others just needed some time to be alone.” Cailet looked to Elventear and quietly mumbled, “Poor dear.” She felt a tear come to her eye as she thought of the pain he was going through. “Then when shall we meet again, Bosk?” asked Oscruncher. “In a few days. I’ll send word to you all when and where to meet.” Oscruncher nodded and stood. “Until then. I, too, must see my guild master. Good day.” He turned and walked out. Andriana stood up and headed to Elventear, helping him up and together they both walked to the door. Alfadar was soon close by, though far enough away to keep to himself. “We’ll be waiting for your message Bosk,” said Andriana. Bosk nodded and all three headed out. Most everyone else did the same, saying good-bye and saying where they will be staying. Soon it was just Bosk, Cailet, and Geraine, who was asleep again in Cailet’s lap. “The funeral is tomorrow,” Bosk finally said. “Do you want to attend?” Cailet nodded. “I didn’t know her very well, though.” “Elventear will appreciate any and everyone that will attend. He needs our support.” “What about Andriana and Alfadar?” asked Cailet. “Don’t they count?” “Alfadar…will keep to himself most likely. His healing will come in time. Andriana has a unique gift of handling a tragedy with graceful calm. She hurts, but in her own way and she can stand a little taller than Elventear at this initial stage. “I see,” she said. “Will this what it will be like? Once we go out farther will we see more of this?” “Hopefully nothing so…barbaric and cruel, but Antonica is home to some of the more colorful Races in Norrath. Anything could happen.”
