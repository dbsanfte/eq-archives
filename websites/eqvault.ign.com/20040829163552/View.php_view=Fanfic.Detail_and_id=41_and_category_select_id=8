<hr noshade/></p>
<b>08-17-2004</b> - 
<p>
Seithenin checked on his dwarf friend before he left, and noticed that he had not healed any.  Surprised by this fact he examined more closely and could not find any sign that he had even attempted to heal his comrade.  In fact, the dwarf’s breathing had become even shallower, and his skin had taken on an entirely new shade of yellow, deeper and more sickening. He knew that he would have to get him to some priests soon or else his friend would sink too far and never come back.
<p>
Looking around the hovel even more closely than the night before, he discovered a rope underneath the cot, it was old, but usable.  Shaking the spiders off of it, he managed to tie it to the cot in a harness fashion, and proceeded to drag the solidly built dwarf on his cot behind him out the door.
<p>
Taking the fork to the right, he slowly trudged his way towards where he knew would be the walls of Kaladim somewhere hours ahead. Cursing the humidity and the hot air, he was tired within a hundred yards, but continued to pull his load.
<p>
“What war was he talking about, and if he has a master, who was it?” Questions flooded his mind and he couldn’t find any answers, no matter how hard he brainstormed for them.  The main question was, “What did you have to do with them good dwarf, why were you even talking to that evil knight?”
<p>
After a few hours, he stopped for a short break, laying the cot down.  He didn’t even have the strength left to try and set the cot up so that his friend would be at least off the ground.  He sat and pulled some of the papers out from his pack.
<p>
There were the typical bandits in the area, goblins, some undead… A few caves were found, and unexplored, but appeared to be just normal bear caves.  There had to be some answers somewhere buried in all of this, he knew there had to be.
<p>
As he sat there studying hard on the information before him, he wasn’t aware of the figure standing behind him awaiting his attention.  The figure belonged to a female elf of the greater Faydark.  Trained in stealth as well as tracking, she had absolutely no problems finding this strange half elf, and sneaking up on him without notice.
<p>
Seithenin felt a strange presence but didn’t know what to make of it.  It was like being watched, but not by anything harmful.  Maybe it was just some animal watching him with curiosity.  He looked around and nearly fell over with shock and surprise when he saw the figure behind him.
<p>
She was nearly five feet tall with dark hair and smooth skin, an elf he knew from the ears and figure, and a ranger from the way she was equipped.  Of course she may know something of him, but he knew nothing about her besides an elven ranger.  Wondering how long she had been sitting there watching him and possibly reading the information on these papers or eavesdropping on him speaking aloud, he had to find out what she knew.
<p>
“Are you lost or in need of some help?” It was she that spoke first, a melodic voice to be sure.
“Nay, I am heading to Kaladim to seek some healing for my friend here.  Why are you here, in the mountains so far from the forest?”
“I am hunting some of the goblins that patrol these roads stealing things from merchants who travel these ways, I can help you carry this load if you would like?”
Knowing that he would have to have some time to ask her more questions, he agreed to let her help.  They could talk on the way to Kaladim.  She reached down and, with surprising strength for a wood elf, picked up the harness for the dwarf’s cot and began pulling it.  He grabbed a piece of the rope and helped her pull it.
<p>
As they traveled in this fashion, they both discussed the normal happenings in the area, and he discovered that she had not been eavesdropping, just merely awaiting his attention to speak with him.  She knew a great deal of the area, and as such he may be able to use her in helping find out what was going on with this strange Knight.
<p>
After some time, he looked up from the road and with a shock saw that they had gone far indeed, the great walls and statues of Kaladim loomed directly before him.  He looked for the sun, and saw that it had to be late in the afternoon already.  Thanking her and telling her which inn he usually stayed in, he bid her farewell, and to find him later that night for more talk.
<p>	
He slowly dragged the cot behind him as he passed the dwarves standing on guard, and headed for the temple.  When he got there the priests all gathered around him helping him with his load.  He nearly fell on his butt as the load was taken from him.  He sat there for quite some time before he regained his strength enough to go inside and check on his friend.
<p>	
Inside, the priests were gathered around the cot chanting various spells, and looking the dwarf all over trying to ascertain what was indeed his sickness.  The high priest came over to Seithenin and they discussed what had happened and what could be done.  After many hours of trying different spells and remedies, they gave up in frustration.
“It seems he has been cursed by some strange malicious evil spirit that even the high priest himself could not alleviate!” one of the acolytes exclaimed as he stormed past Seithenin.
“What manner of evil spirit wears armor as if a knight? And what knight belongs to such an evil God??” He had heard of shadowknights of course, but even they could not do something so harmful that a cleric this powerful could not cure it!  Maybe it was some undead curse of some sort?  He would have to sort this out and discover what was happening, or else his friend would die, at best he would be crippled and comatose if nothing was done.
<p>
He knew that there were always wizards and mages wandering around, and that sometimes they knew of lore more of arcane nature than the divine lore that priests studied.  Maybe this was a curse of arcane nature.  But where would he find a wizard in a dwarven city?  There was also the king he had to talk to and this message to deliver.
<p>
He decided the king was more important than any message he had to deliver.  Especially if the message turned out to be the normal brigands holding up trade routes message.  He walked towards the royal throne room to see the king.  
At the entrance to the throne room stood a few guards who bowed their heads solemnly as he passed instead of saluting.
“I wonder what that was about…” he thought to himself as he continued his way to the king’s throne.
The king was not an overly aged dwarf, but was not young either.  He had been king of Kaladim, like his father before him, and his father’s father before that.  Now it seemed as if his line may be ended, for he had not made an heir to his throne, no matter who he wed.
<p>
“Greetings to you, Sir Seithenin of Kaladim and Kelethin!  We have heard of your situation, and grieve greatly for our brother who has fallen.  What news do you have that we might hear and help out?”
“You must know, your highness, that this guard had been dealing with the knight for some time from what I had heard.  And according to what the dwarf said, he has tried to give you the message for awhile, but no one was listening.”
<p>
“I listen to all of my subjects, but news of brigands and outlaws declaring war on my kingdom or others is not really news, and is small pittance to me, it should be dealt with by the guilds and merchants who use those routes, not by the king and his army.”
<p>
“This knight is no mere brigand, he has laid a curse of some power upon one of your guards that not even your high priest can heal.  That sounds to be more dangerous than a small time outlaw.  I urge you to discover who it is behind this, my liege, before it comes knocking at your door demanding entry.”
<p>
“We will devote what energies we can spare towards finding out who it is and what plots they have conspired to bring about.  But, until I see proof that this is not just an overly powered brigand, or maybe some exiled dark elf leading the rabble, I will not take my armies away from more important duties.  As you know, they are busy deep in the mountains holding back the goblins who are infesting this area, without them being placed there, we would be overrun in a matter of days.”
<p>
Seithenin bowed, knowing he would get nowhere trying to convince the king of the need until some more hardcore proof was found, after all, one dwarf lying in a coma was not that much to worry about when twenty to thirty dwarves were sent back to Kaladim daily due to major injuries from the goblin fights.
<p>
He left and wondered where he could find a wizard, his next possible hope.  He reached the inn and looked inside to find the ranger waiting on him.  She was sitting back drinking a dwarven mug of ale.  He had to stop and admire a wood elf that could stomach the strong poisons the dwarves used.  After, he approached her and sat down ordering the same.
<p>
“Do you happen to know of any arcane lore masters nearby?” he asked more out of frustration than curiosity.
She sat and stared at him for some time before saying, “Actually, I know quite a few.  It would take some travel, but, yes, I know where an entire city is that could fit that description.”
They talked late into the night before retiring to their own rooms.  The ranger had been referring to a city named Ak’Anon, where the gnomes lived.  Gnomes, he had heard of them, supposedly the made machines and such.  Strange creations that whirred and clicked, and more often than not, did not work properly.  Gnomes and Elves, gnomes and elves, he thought, and didn’t think it for the last time.
