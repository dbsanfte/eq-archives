This round they are for the Paladin and Rogue classes:<blockquote><br><b>Paladin</b><br><i>Steadfast Will</i> - This ability grants a chance to endure what would otherwise be a stunning blow, from any angle, without being stunned.<br><br><b>Rogue</b><br><i>Nerves of Steel</i> - Each rank in this ability gives rogues an increasing chance to remain hidden when a spell hits them.  At the highest rank, a resisted spell will never break Hide and there is a good chance that the rogue will remain hidden even when a spell successfully hits them.<br></blockquote><br>Neither are as class-defining as a few of the earlier ones we posted, but both look very useful in some situations.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tue 31 Aug 2004<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#1214<br>Printed On: Wed Dec 15 8:23:34 PST 2004<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
