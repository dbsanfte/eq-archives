The new Launchpad system, which is used for all other SOE games, is now being applied to the Test server for you folks to try out.  Please log into test, using the Testeverquest.exe icon from your EQ directory and download the Launchpad front end.   Expect the login process to be a little slower the first couple of uses as it sets up its caches, but after it is all set, you should be logging in faster than ever.<br><br>Make sure you submit your feedback using the bug command in-game or by using the feedback link, here on the Dev Corner.<br><br>Thanks All!<br><br>Your Community Halflings<br></blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 19 Jul, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=179">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=179</a><br>Printed On: Sun Oct 7 6:08:45 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
