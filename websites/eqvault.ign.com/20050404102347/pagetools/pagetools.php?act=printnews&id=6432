There will be no moves allowed to Firiona Vie at this time.<br><br>If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, the /movelog UI has a disregard button.  Using the disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and allow you to execute a new movelog request.<br><br>Any accounts that have executed the movelog request will need to make certain they have no corpses in the world.  If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination server, you will need to empty either shared bank out as only one will be available after the movelog is complete.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tue 29 Mar 2005<br>Link: http://eqvault.ign.com//index.php#6432<br>Printed On: Mon Apr 4 3:23:53 PDT 2005<br>©2004 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
