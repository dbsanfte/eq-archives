Next week should have a few more, including one biggy.  Monday we had a new poll asking "What do you think of Omens of War?"  Check it out over on the right hand side of the page.  Wednesday we had our third <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=34&category_select_id=6">EQOA Developer Diary</a> - exclusive to EQ Vault.  Be sure to give that a look if you've ever played the PS2 version of EverQuest.<br><br>News this week was about average.  Tuesday came word of <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63626">OoW Access problems</a> and I threw up a list of completed epic 1.5s with links to stats.  Wednesday <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2056">"SOE Worlds Magazine"</a> was announced.  Finally on Thursday a new <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63643">Halfling Hodgepodge</a> came out.<br><br>Tomorrow we should have a pretty cool feature up, so be sure to check back.
