<br>By <a href="mailto:mailto:avalonb@yahoo.com">Avalon</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-28-2004</b> - 
“What a place to be out drinking all night” he thought. Waking up from his “enchanted” slumber, he realized his mind was reeling and pounding worse than a dwarven hammer upon an anvil.  Seithenin was his name, and Tunare called him one of her favorites.  A paladin by calling, but a drunk by choice.  It seemed that one too many failures and hardships un-numbered drove him to sinking into the bottoms of mugs. Fortunately, elven spirits weren’t as strong as others, but drink enough of them, and they hurt just as bad the next morning.
<P>Rising from the cot in the inn, he remembered he had some unfinished business to complete in the forest below.  Seems there was a message he had to deliver to the guild in Kaladim.  The typical message he was sure, something regarding bandits or goblins on the trade routes.  “May as well get started, it’s a long run…” he mumbled.
<P>Outside the air was crisp, clean, and fragrant with the newly come spring weather.  He didn’t manage to enjoy it though, since he was having a few anxiety attacks at seeing the ground far below the wooden planks that made the floor of the tree city.  Yet another reason he was glad to be leaving.  Only half elven, he didn’t see the reasoning behind building a city this far up in the trees.  He had his love for animals and plants alike, but what was this strange love of being over one hundred feet above ground?
<P>“Where is that Lift? The sooner I get down the better!” He secretly added something about elves and gnomes and their strange ideas of how to do things.  He spotted the platform that would allow him access the floor of the great forest Faydark.  Only problem, as he saw, was that the lift was on a lower level, and there were no bridges that he could see leading to it anywhere nearby.  How on earth was he going to get down there?  He, of course, did not know the layout of Kelethin, even though he grew up there.  He spent most of his time growing up in Kaladim, where the dwarves were a bit friendlier to him, where the elves treated him as some sort of half-breed.  Only Tunare managed to keep him in touch with his elven ancestries. 
<P>Spying a few rooftops below, and some branches that hung lower than others, he arranged a way to get to the lift.  He was a paladin, and as such, heroic jumps and twists came second nature to him.  He calculated in his mind about how far a jump it was to each place and what sorts of swings and drops he would need.  He ran forward and picked up speed at a fairly good rate.  About where the planks ended, he put his foot in empty air and attempted to jump. Falling head first into the empty space below him, he spied a rooftop coming up fast, he landed, bounced, and rolled off the top, onto the narrow causeway behind the building, bounced again, heard something snap, and felt himself dropping again.  The piece of wood he held firmly in his grasp hit a branch, flipped him over, struck the tree opposite the platform he had aimed for, and continued to fall.  He noticed he was sliding down the tree, barely missing some of the branches as he sailed past picking up speed.  At this rate, the ground was going to hurt a great deal.  Making a painful decision, he twisted the end of the plank so that he aimed at a very low branch.  He smacked into the branch, nearly breaking it into several pieces, but at least it slowed him down.  The ground managed to stop his descent.
<P>Waking up a few hours later, his head swimming, but strangely sober now, he mentally kicked himself several times.  The first was for getting drunk.  The second was for not taking his time to walk around to the appropriate bridges, and the final for thinking that he could actually succeed at an insane stunt like that, even if he was sober.  
<P>When he realized that the majority of his items were in the bank, he kicked himself even harder, knowing he would either have to go back up, or continue without them.  Looking up the long distance to the lowest platform, his eyes blurred and he felt queasy.  On to Kaladim he decided.  They have items that could replace the ones he left here anyway.
<P>Proudly as he could, he brushed himself off, and strode down the path towards the mountains in the distance.  Surely the roads would be safer now that spring was here.  Traders and Merchants always traveled with warriors that would keep the ways clear of brigands and all that.
<P>He made the mountains by nightfall, and decided he would stop and sleep in some nearby overhang.  As he searched for something fitting, he noticed a fire ahead on the side of the road.  His knightly instincts battled his common sense on whether to investigate, and he eventually continued on down the road to see what was the matter.
<P>As he approached he spotted some forms dancing around what he now saw was no mere fire, but an all out blaze.  He marched forward and called out to them announcing his presence.  The forms turned and started making strange noises in his direction.  The language sounded as familiar to him as his own.  “Goblins!” he spat.  He charged forward, yanking his sword from its sheath.  Well, attempting to sense he had peace bonded it while in Kelethin, and forgot to undo the ties in his drunken stupor.  Since he was convinced of the safety of the routes between Kelethin and Kaladim, he had also forgot his weapon’s harnessing.
<br>He changed his plans a little as he ran, and ran past the first few goblins, surprising them entirely.  They turned and stared at him stupidly wondering what he was thinking.  Raising his hand above his head he began yelling strange syllables at the top of his voice and running straight through the group.  The goblins looked at each other and shrugged.  Then looked where he had come from, and decided whatever it was that drove this stranger from the darkness into a large group of goblins must be worse than the group of goblins.  They ran off to the south of the road, leaving the burning building behind, and figuring for quieter pickings.
<P>After he ran awhile, he turned and saw that none of them had followed, and he went back the blaze.  No one was there.  Whatever they made of the situation, they had left also.  He looked around for any sort of water, spotted some, and spent the rest of the night attempting to put out a blaze by himself.  In the morning the house was smoldering cinders, he was worn out, and the small pond was a few inches lower.  Such is the life of a paladin, fighting a never ending futile battle against hordes of evil and their actions while everyone else was either watching, or conveniently not there at all.
<br>He figured the goblins would come back to search the ruins of the house soon, so he left heading for Kaladim again.  He had not slept, but also could not afford to sleep anytime soon since he knew not where the goblins had gone.
<br>Down the path he went, and small stone buildings became more and more common sights the further he walked.  His steps had become more like dragging his feet as he pushed forward.  The spring air became something almost unbearable to him, hot and muggy this close to the shores of Faydwer.  Ahead the path forked to the right, and there was luckily a guardhouse there.  As he approached, the guard saluted him; here he was well known as an undead hunter, a cleanser of the mountains of the skeletons that plagued the dwarves.
<P>“Good dwarf, would you mind if I were to sleep a few hours in your bed?  I have traveled all day yesterday, and spent all night throwing water on a fire the size of a small dragon.”  He managed to get out before the dwarf interrupted him.
<P>“Sir, it would be a fine welcome to have you sheltered under my watch!  In fact, I ought to be the one asking YOU to grace my humble hovel with your presence!  Why, every dwarf in these mountains is better off for your deeds in helping us put these skellies to rest for eternity. Please, step inside, and make yourself comfortable! Have no fears, I shall watch over you, and see that no harm comes to you.” The dwarf fairly shouted he was so overjoyed.
<P>Inside, the shack looked barren at best, except for the cot against the wall, and a small table with papers strewn about its surface.  He lay down on the cot, and fell into a coma-like sleep.
<P>His dreams were blurred, and he didn’t remember much upon waking up, but he did remember they weren’t particularly good ones, and left him sweating more than the hot humid air should have made him.  The strangest part was that he overheard some words from outside.  He crept to the door feeling disquieted by the feeling in the air.  There was something very wrong here.  He felt the presence of something extremely evil on the other side of the door, so he stayed where he was and listened trying to gain more knowledge of what was happening.
<P>Outside the door, a knight with armor the color of crimson stood facing a dwarf shaking in his boots.  “Have you done as I asked?” the voice from the helmet sounded like it was carried on the wind itself.
<P>“I have tried, really I have!  The king would not listen, and his council would not even take the time to hear me!” The dwarf quickly pleaded.
<P>“Maybe if they found your body hanging from a tree they would listen more?  Nay, I think not.  I shall make an example of you, but you shall live to give them more reason to pay attention. I shall tell you this now while you are not in pain, so you shall remember it clearly: The order is alive again, and it would be in the dwarves’ best interests to stay out of the coming war.” This time, the voice sounded like it came from the ground beneath their feet, like some rumbling earthquake about to shatter the foundations of the hovel.
<P>All that Seithenin heard after that was the dwarf’s cries of anguish and pain.  He knew that his soul ached to run out and challenge this knight who was crippling his friend, but he also knew that to do so would do no good, and likely kill him before he even stepped from the doorway.  He would have to heal his friend all he could, and work to fight the evil some other way.
<P>When the presence of evil had left, he opened the doorway, and slipped outside.  He bent down to the dwarf and examined him trying to see how he could best help him.  The dwarf was still breathing, but barely.  His skin had sunken in to his bones, and had the color of yellow to it.  His eyes still had the reflection of the knight on them as if he were still standing there. What manner of spell had he used to afflict this poor man, he did not know.  He placed his hands upon the dwarf’s head and prayed silently to Tunare.  A soft glow spread outwards from his hands and enveloped the head, then the body, and his legs finally.
<P>He walked back inside carrying the body, and laid it down on the cot.  Afterwards, he looked over the table and gathered up the papers, thinking that maybe there were some clues as to what was going on in them.  He would have to look them over later.  For now, he had a message to deliver and a king to see.
