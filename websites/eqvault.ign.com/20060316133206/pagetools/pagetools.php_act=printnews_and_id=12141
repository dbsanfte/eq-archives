With this change there will be some extensive UI patching however you can reduce this by doing the following.<br> <br>Go to your EverQuest directory <br>[click on My Computer - C: Drive - Program Files - Sony - EverQuest]<br>Go to the uifiles folder<br>[Click on uifiles]<br>Copy the "default" folder and make the copy "default_old".<br>[Right click on the default folder click on copy. Next right and click on paste to copy that folder. Right click once again on the now titled "copy of default" folder and click on rename. Type in "default_old"]<br> <br>You'll be all set to reduce some patching time after accomplishing this. You can also use this older UI at your choosing.  --Regards,<br>Joel "Raijinn ThunderGuard", Community Relations<br><br>Custom UI? Like the old one?<br><br>SOE's Rajinn posts:  "Yes custom UI's will have some problems since the files have been updated, this is for the custom UI guru's out there to hammer out.<br> <br>Yes you will be able to use the old ui (which is why it's being copied to the other folder). I believe the situation was that we were going to have partial support for the old UI but I have yet to confirm this."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 25 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12141">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12141</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:32:06 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
