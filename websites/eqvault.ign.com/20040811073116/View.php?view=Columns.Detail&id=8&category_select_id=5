<b>07-06-2004</b> - 
<I>"Hail traveler. It's good to see you in these parts again. Now what can I get for you?
<p>
Hot food you say, well we have some fresh rabbit stew brewing in the pot above the fire. Let me serve you up a hearty bowl full. Why is it quiet you ask? Well some strange folk have been around the last day or two, upsetting things. They are not liked around these parts, not since they got into some trouble with the local guards and ended up killing a handful of our fine young me.
<p>
They came back here looking for help, but their past actions and indiscretions have come back to haunt them. If you upset people, don't expect them to offer out the hand of friendship. Not unless you are willing to redeem yourselves first".
</I><p>
Factions in EQ can be confusing at best, and for a new player the importance of maintaining the correct factions is not often apparent until it is too late.
<p>
So what are factions? Well factions are the social, religious or political architecture of Norrath's society. Some factions appose some are allied.
<p>
For example. Guards of Qeynos do not get along at all with Karana Bandits. The Kromdek and Kromrif giants are allied.
<p>
When you first start to play your new EQ character, you should be aware of what factions you are allied with and apposed too. The consider command or /c will not only tell you if the mob is easy to kill (green) or is most likely going to give you a quick trip to the grave yard (red) but it will also tell you if the mob likes or dislikes you.
<p>
<B>FACTION STANDINGS</B>
<p>
The breakdown for the faction standing is as follows:
<p>

    * Ally - They love you and trust you.
<p>
    * Warmly - You are high on their social list.
<p>
    * Kindly - They like to see you around.
<p>
    * Amiably - You are a liked citizen.
<p>
    * Indifferent - You are just another face in the crowd.
<p>
    * Apprehensively - They are not too sure of you but will tolerate you.
<p>
    * Dubiously - They are suspicious off you.
<p>
    * Threateningly - If you get to close they will attack.
<p>
    * Ready to attack - They will kill you on site.
<p>

Factions are raised and lowered on a points system. You gain or lose points to give a positive or negative faction number. The number will fall within a high and low bracket and this will determine which faction level you are currently at.
<p>
Zero points will have you set at indifferent. Gaining positive hits will raise it and negative hits will lower it.
<p>
The other factor is the level of the mob you kill and its standing within the faction.
Killing a low level wood elf may raise you faction a little with some dark elf based factions, but killing a dark elf captain will lower it by a considerable amount.
<p>
You will generally find that you will get better prices buying from merchants that you are amiable or better with, and have a hard time talking to anyone who is dubious to you. Also you will be running from or fighting with those that are threatening or ready to attack.
<p>
With this in mind unless you are planning to start a fight you will want to avoid mobs that are in the worst two slots on the scale, especially if they are yellow or red to you.
<p>
When you kill or even participate in killing a mob you may also notice faction messages when it finally bites the dust. This is also a good indication of who you are getting on the wrong or right side off.
<p>
You will usually see a faction list that tells you which factions were adjusted by the kill good or bad. Completing quests also will adjust factions too.
<p>
<B>LOWERING FACTIONS</B>
<p>
Killing mobs that are allied to a certain faction will undoubtedly lower your faction with them.
Completing quests may also lower a faction.
<p>
<B>RAISING FACTIONS</B>
<p>
Some quests are specifically designed to raise factions. For example. If you need to get on better terms with Neriak guards and merchants, then handing a bottle of red wine to a particular dark elf who resides in the third gate library will accomplish this.
<p>

The other way is to kill mobs that oppose the faction you wish to raise. Again, some mobs will give more faction points than others.
<p>
Some classes also have the ability to change factions by illusion or faction raising spells. Enchanters are the master of this, and with racial illusions and spells such as collaboration they can often fool mobs into thinking they are more tolerated than they really are.
<p>
<B>THE BIG CONSEQUENCE</B>
<p>
Some players do not worry about factions. They kill what they want and who they want, but there are consequences. Many quests will require you to have a good standing with some factions. Epic quests are the prime example of this. Although a character will not pursue his or her epic to later levels, if he ruins many of the required factions it will be very difficult for him or her to complete the quest and in order to do so may have to spend a lot of time correcting their previous mistakes.
<p>
It also makes traveling around Norrath that much trickier. You may not be able to enter certain cities due to poor relations with the locals. It can make buying a pain and can even exclude you from being able to go on some raids etc.
<p>
<B>SO WHAT IS A NEWBIE TO DO?</B>
<p>
Well most intelligent mobs have factions, and common sense will often prevail as to what will be good or bad for you to kill. If you kill a mob and take a negative hit that you feel is not to your liking then don't kill anymore of that mob. Some common sense examples would be:
Druids killing nature based mobs such as treents and other druids is a no no. Yes they drop good loot but the faction hits are not worth it.
<p>
Killing your own racial or city guards is not a good plan either. As a general rule of thumb try to avoid killing anything that seems like you should be friends with it, and avoid negative faction hits wherever possible.
<p>
My Dark elf enchanter loved fighting and killing in Karnor Castle, but the consequence for him was that the guards in the evil outpost in the Over there suddenly did not take to kindly to him dropping by.
<p>
<B>TO SUM IT UP</B>
<p>
Try hard to keep your factions on the positive side of the scale. It is not possible to have ALL factions in the positive. Simply being allied to one will mean being KOS to another but as long as you pick the right side it will not be too much of a problem.
<I><p>
"So was the stew good? Well I am glad to hear it. Of course the lack of rabbits in these parts did mean that we had to substitute the meat for another one of nature's creations but you seemed to enjoy it? No believe me you don't want to know what it was, but let's just say it had pointed ears."</I>
