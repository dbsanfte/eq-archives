 <div><br><span class="pageheader">Xegony Guilds</span><BR><HR><p><strong><font size="+1">Welcome to the Xegony Guild List!<br>
  </font></strong>Updated on August 26, 2005




<p>Complied by Kwill (kwill@vaultnetwork.com). Feel free to
  contribute information or corrections to this list! </p>
<p>The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website. For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
if any.
<p><a href="http://www.allianceofhope.com/" target="_blank">Alliance of Hope</a><br>
  Must log in to see the website.
<p>&quot;Level Requirement: 70 <br>
  Minimum AA: 150 <br>
  Normal Raid Schedule: 8pm - 12am EST <br>
  Required Raid Attendance: 28% 
<p>Ready to see more of what Everquest has to offer? Looking to become part of
  a team that cares as much about each other as they do the game? Join the Alliance
of Hope and adventure the world of Norrath with us! </p>
<p>The Alliance of Hope has been a force in the worlds of Everquest since 2002.
  We raid five to six days a week. Our goal is progression in the game and to
  have fun with a group of people we enjoy. It takes commitment, talent and a
  heart for others to become one of us. If you have the burning desire to unlock
  more doors within this digital realm, come raid with us. Let us take you places
  you have never been and together we will conquer even greater feats. </p>
<p>Alliance of Hope is currently pushing Txevu --&gt; Tacvi progression and working
  on trials for Anguish. We still go into PoTime on occassion as well. </p>
<p>No class is closed, and all applications are reviewed! Some have a higher
  need than others (Bards! Enchanters! Monks! Oh my!), but all applications are
  given a chance! If you would like to get a feel for AoH, feel free to talk
  to our leaders and officers (below) or your class rep: Saamite and Feylene,
  Co
Leaders.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clan-mentis.net/" target="_blank">Clan Mentis</a><br>
  Clan Mentis is a Guild made up of LVL 65+ mains. We strive to uncover new game
  content on our own and not jumping into an Elemental Guild or High End GoD
  guild. So if you are looking for the challenge of doing it yourself then Clan
Mentis may be the Guild for you. We are NOT a PG-13 Guild. </p>
<p>Looking for a few. Be 62 plus prefer 65+ with Tactics flag, know how to play
  your class. Post normal play time and timezone. Send me a tell or an officer
  in game if you want to get the recruit Channel. </p>
<p>You will use Teamspeak. We are a guild that improves our effectivness by using
  Teamspeak. At a minimum download Teamspeak so you can hear what is going on.
  95% of all raid directions are given by voice. </p>
<p>Have your Emp Ssra key or be working on it. Having the Ring and Idol from
Com1 and Com2 is a good start. We can work with you after that. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://darkhorizon.angrybunni.org/" target="_blank">Dark Horizon</a><br>
  Dark Horizon is currently only actively recruiting clerics and paladins. Applications
for other classes will be considered, but they must be exceptional. </p>
<p>1: We usually raid 3-5 nights a week, at the following times: <br>
  Weeknights: 6pm est to 10/11pm est, maybe later <br>
  Weekends: 2/4pm est to 10/11pm est, maybe later <br>
  Applicants would be expected to consistantly make at least 80% of raids, in
  addition to exping/questing/camping outside raid times. We want people who
  still enjoy playing EQ. </p>
<p>2: Applicants should have good AA (preferably 400+ or ideally considerably
  more) and all the raid-tailored ones. We don't care if you have tanaan6 if
  you don't have ND3. Anyone at the lower end of the AA limits will be expected
  to be actively pumping out AAs at fast rate outside raid times if they get
  accepted. The higher your AA the better. </p>
<p>3: Applicants should have gear that shows their desire to improve themselves.
  Full anguish gear would be great, but we're realistic. A magelo filled with
  droppable lowstat bazaar gear is going to stand much less chance than someone
  with stuff they've extensively quested/camped/adventured for in an effort to
  impove themselves as far as their means allow. Some classes are more equipment
  dependent to others, so whilst we'll gear people up to some extent, we're looking
  for people able to hold their own quickly, rather that requiring a complete
  makeover. </p>
<p>4: Flags: Already having Anguish signets, and/or Texvu flag is a definite
  plus, but not required. </p>
<p>5: No idiots, drama queens, or xroads postcount whores - we have enough of
  those already. Also, no emotionally fragile china dolls. We're not as bad as
  you might think, but we don't restrict content or language at all. If hearing
  people swear or talk about anally abusing frogs makes you run and lock yourself
  in the closet, weeping uncontrollably, please don't bother applying. We talk
  and joke as if we were a bunch of adults in the real world, so some people
  use more 'colourful' language than others. </p>
<p>6: Must actually enjoy playing EQ. Not looking for people just trying to fill
  the time between now and the next MMORPG with some different scenary. </p>
<p>7: Ebay: Some guilds do, some guilds don't. Generally speaking, we don't.
  You should be the original creator of the account and character you're appling
  with. </p>
<p>8: Cross server: We're willing to consider cross server but only if they are
  highly qualified with huge AA, solid gear, relevent flags and a confirmable
  history. No server rejects with a namechange. Referances (preferably an officer
  of your most recent guild) will be required. Our bullshit dectors are set on
high for interserver applicants.&quot;</p>

&quot;If you like what you see, and enjoy great fellowship with a group of spectacular
people then you should drop us your application and join up with us. Please,
if you see any of us in the game, feel free to send us a /tell and we will answer
any questions you have. <br>
<br>
Guild rules:<br>
&quot;Starting out Discordia Concord will have no minimum Level requirement.
  After the guild fills out and by a Vote of the members we will decide how soon
  the
  level requirement will take place. I would like for the Level requirements
  to be in increments starting at level 30 and progressing up from there. Any
  members
  that are under the required level once it is set will be under a grace period
to make there level and continue to progress with the guild.</p>
<p>Bad, Foul, and inappropriate Language will not be tolerated in the Guild channel
  or Guild Chat channels. All guild related chat channels are to be appropriate
for all age's of players, Please respect this.</p>
<p>I have to be the Bad Guy on this one, No Casino's. It is too easy to end up
  with hurt feelings or unneeded trouble toward you or the guild by running a
  casino.</p>
<p>Kill Stealing, Camp Stealing, Training or any conduct of the like will not
  be tolerated.</p>
<p>Loot rights at all guild Raids, events or Functions will be on a Need Before
Greed basis.&quot;</p>
<p>No posted application.</p>

Huhu Horde is a guild commited to raiding and making it to the top. While we
  plan to be a hard core raiding guild, we think it&#8217;s important to keep
  our environment a fun and drama free atomosphere. We are currently working
  on various ways to make your time on EverQuest enjoyable, and at the same time,
we strive to reach the most end-game content that EverQuest has to offer.</p>
<p>We believe that playing a game shouldn&#8217;t be a chore or job, which is
  why we plan to give you the most possible freedom that a guild could give.
  While we do have strict rules that members should follow, we do not think that
  off raid hours should be dictacted by your guild. Rather, by you!</p>
<p>We also understand that people have jobs, lives, and families to attend to.
  Which is why we do not use the systems most guilds use in making you a full
  member. There are many people out there looking to join a good guild that raids
  or is heading towards raiding end-game content. But your work schedule prevents
  this from being possible. We have set up a raiding system to suit just about
  everyone&#8217;s needs to be off the game and out there in real life!</p>
<p>When a raid is called, and you&#8217;re in-game, you MUST attend. In otherwords,
  tell your group you gotta go! <br>
  No personal raids on targets we have on Progression Status. We are not racing
  each other! <br>
  No Harrassment. Recruits and Members should get along. No Verbally abusing
  each other. If there is an issue between you and anyone in our guild, get an
  officer involved. An applicant who refuses to respect members and officers
  will likely be denied before your recruit period ends. Keep this in mind. <br>
  As of May 5th, 2005 Huhu Horde will observe the rotation agreements on specific
  mobs between the Xegony and Zebuxoruk community. Distrupting this rotation
  will lead to perminant disbandment from the guild. In the recruit forums is
  a list of mobs that will be on this rotation. <br>
  We are enforcing a zero tollerance policy for any in-guild drama. Seriously,
  no one gives a shit that you&#8217;re an attention whore and a new person comes
  along and steals your attention. Keep that shit to yourself or find a guild
  who likes to feed into it. <br>
  Do not instigate drama between other guilds either. While some things can&#8217;t
  be prevented, and some people will always be haters, that does not mean you
  can feed into it. No sending other guilds members tells with harrassing vulgarity.
  We are setting an example for excellency. Let them be childish, and prove we&#8217;re
  mature! <br>
Remember, it&#8217;s just a game. It&#8217;s meant to be fun. </p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT BOTHER APPLYING AS YOU WILL BE
  DENIED!</p>
<p>Generally our normal application proccess is a total of 30 days. However,
  depending on your behavior, skills, and dedication, it could be less or more
  time. After reading all of the Guild Charter, and the items it comes with,
  if you feel you want to be a part of Huhu, you may fill out our application
  form.</p>
<p>Once your application has been mailed to us, the officers will review it and
  vote on whether or not to give you the recruit status. Once we have come to
  our descion, an officer should contact you in-game. This normally takes 1 to
  2 days tops.</p>
<p>Gear:<br>
  When applying you must have an up-to-date magelo. We insist that you
  have decent gear! With the expansions out now, there are many places that you
  can
  get really nice upgrades with single groups. If you apply, and your magelo
  is showing items with only 30 HP/Mana, likely you will be denied. If nothing
  else, go to bazaar, and get some of the Attunable items - you can find some
  items with even 150 HP/Mana +Stats. With the raid events we are currently working
on, without decent gear, you wont last a minute.</p>
<p>Misc. Requirements for all members and applicants:<br>
  -Enduring Breath (Items,
  AA, Spell)<br>
  -Way to Gate (Spell, Item, *Origin Doesn&#8217;t count, even if it is a req.
  for your class.)<br>
  -Instant Buff Clicky (Very helpful, alot of mobs dispell.)<br>

  &quot;Justifiable Cause is a close-knit group of like-minded individuals who find
  ourselves drawn together through our need to make ourselves complete. We were
  born, children of the gods themselves, into this world with an unfailing purpose
  in life. We all have felt the pang of desire to explore, the yearning for increased
  knowledge, the desire to obtain our due divinity. As we have progressed in
  life, we have become aware of one unifying fact: it is our divine right to
  walk among the planes of the gods themselves. We will seize this right through
  the acquiescence of those gods or through force of arms and conquest. Nothing&#8212;neither
  man nor god&#8212;will stop us from obtaining this birthright owed to us. Not
  only is it our divine right, it is our Justifiable Cause. <br>
========================== </p>
<p>Justifiable Cause currently IS RECRUITING OUTSTANDING RAIDERS OF MOST CLASSES!
  (See list on application thread.) <br>
  MUST BE level 68. GoD flags a definite plus! <br>
  MINIMUM 100+ AA - specific desired AAs by class: class AA list </p>
<p>MUST BE A REGULAR RAIDER and own ALL 9 expansions. </p>

<p>Updated 2 August, 2005.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shadus.com/" target="_blank">Legendary Shadow Hunters</a> <br>
  &quot;Legendary Shadow Hunters is one of the oldest guilds on Xegony. We shall carry
our name with pride at all times. </p>
<p>If you know of someone who is currently unhappy with the guild they are in,
  are guildless and searching for a guild or is someone you have grouped with
  and wish to actively recruit bring it to our attention. Currently our recruitment
  policy is flexable. However, they must meet with approval of guild officers
  who must have grouped with them or observed them. ( Or know them) <br>
  <br>
  Legendary Shadow Hunters do not kill steal other players. We understand that
  accidents happen while pulling, particularly in crowded zones. If there is
  a possibility you DID kill steal another player, just apologize and move on.
  Do NOT under any circumstances allow yourself to get involved in a screaming
  match over it. It never helps, and it makes you look like a twit. <br>
  Legendary Shadow Hunters do NOT intentionally train other players. Again, accidents
  happen. We have all pulled our share of rather impressive trains in our time
  I'm sure. However, training someone because they pissed you off, or to get
  them to move is unacceptable. If such a report is made to a guild officer it
  WILL be investigated. If it is found that you trained intentionally, you will
  be guild removed. This is not a practice that we tolerate. <br>
  Legendary Shadow Hunters do not now nor ever will we tolerate Ninja Looting.
  There is nothing in this game that you need so badly as to steal it from a
  dead mob with stealth and subterfuge. If a claim of ninja looting is made,
  guild officers and Verant staffers will see if the charge is true or false.
  If it is false the person accused will be apologized to by the accuser if I
  have to go to their guild leader to get it. If it is true, not only will you
  be guild removed but your name will be passed on to other guilds as a ninja
  looter. Myself and my officers have zero tolerance for ninja looting. <br>
  Legendary Shadow Hunters are a need before greed guild. I don't care if Item
  X is worth 10kpp and that you are broke. If player Z can use the item and its
  an upgrade to what he or she is wearing and they WILL use it, they have the
  option to roll or have it defaulted if they are the only ones of a class that
  can use said item. <br>
  Legendary Shadow Hunters do not use profanity, racial slurs, or other boorish
  behavior in guild chat, shouts or OOC. Harassment of other players falls under
  this category. If you don't like someone, fine avoid them. But do not shout
  what a $&amp;*%@#% they are in zone. <br>
  Respect your guild mates. We all have opinions and they will often differ.
  This is what makes each person unique. They are not stupid for their opinion
if it is different from yours.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.legionofthedead.net/boards/" target="_blank">Legion of
the Dead</a> <br>
&quot;Legion of the Dead is Qvic and Time-flagged guild on the Xegony Server. Currently

with AE's, drop us a line.</p>
<p>Legion of the Dead is now recruiting the following classes of required level/aa: </p>
<p>Please note: You must have all required AA&#8217;s in addition to meeting

  required AA, then you do not meet requirements. All requirements are UNBUFFED
  amounts which should be visible in your Magelo (I.E. No self buffs or item
spells used).</p>
<p>We are currently recruiting the follwing classes: Bard, Enchanter, Cleric,
  Pal/SK, Rogue, Wizard, Mage, Necro, Berserker, Warrior. We are primarily looking
  to fill just a couple of open spots in each class, and are looking for full
  time players for those classes. Please read the requirements below for each
  class, if you wish to apply. If your class is not listed below, we are not
  recruiting that class.</p>
<p>**We are in no way a manditory raiding guild, however applicants are required
  to gain at least 30 DKP in 45 days to move towards their probationary vote.
  Fail to gain 30DKP within the 45 day limit and you will be removed from the

<p>General Information about joining Machin Shin <br>
  The most important things you can have that will help you join MS are the following: <br>
&#8226; 
  LOTS of playtime. This is a flat out requirement. We raid from 5:00pm EST to
  1:00am EST typically, sometimes even earlier on weekends. If you can attend
  most of our raids, and there's no sign that you'll have drastically reduced
  playtime in your future, then your chance of getting into MS is very good.
  You'll have to be able to make about half of our raids at minimum, preferably
  significantly more than that. Generally that would mean you need at least 4
  hours of playtime during our raiding hours on 4-5 days a week. We will make
  efforts to calculate days that you would have been able to attend, but were
  not for flag reasons. Also note, that being a Plane of Time guild, our current
  Time schedule puts our day on Friday. That means if you can't have excellent
  attendance on all Fridays, your chance of getting in is pretty slim. <br>
&#8226; 
  Ability to adapt. You don't need direct raid experience as long as you can
  learn fast and follow directions. We do notice people who improve exceptionally
  during their temp periods. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't know
  how to operate fully in a raid environment! <br>
&#8226; 
  Skill. You must be reasonably skilled at your class. If you don't understand
  the major functions of your class and cannot perform them within our needs,
  you will have no chance of getting into MS. <br>
&#8226; 
  Dedication to raiding. We are a raid guild, if you do not love to raid, this
  is not the guild for you. </p>
<p>If you meet all 4 of these, then your chance of getting into MS is fairly
certain.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mythlords.com/" target="_blank">Myth Lords</a><br>
  To be or not to be a Myth Lord <br>
  Our members are the heart and soul of the guild. &lt;Myth Lords&gt; is filled
  with friendly hard working folks that take a lot of pride in their guild tag.
  Each time we add a new member to our guild, we are changing the makeup of our
  guild. We have matured and advanced as a guild much further than any of us
ever expected or hoped for. </p>
<p>We are not a hardcore raiding guild. If you are looking for a guild that raids
  daily, you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a smaller guild
  that appreciates the strength in its individuals over strength in numbers,
  then you have found Myth Lords. We are a casual raiding guild. We usually have
  2 scheduled raids a week, and we try to throw in a extra raid day from time
  to time. Our raids tend to be on the same days each week, so that we can plan
  our RL schedules accordingly. </p>
<p>In order to preserve the chemistry and solidarity of &lt;Myth Lords&gt;, we
  have adopted a very detailed and stringent membership process. Our goal for
  this this membership policy is to help us find and identify players with play
  styles similar to ours, while at the same time keeping our growth in check. </p>
<p>We want our members to be playing with family, friends and in game friends;
  therefore, our membership process is relationship driven policy. During the
  process, you will demonstrate that you are friendly, self sufficient, and available
  when needed. This will be accomplished by gaining sponsors, completing certain
keys, and by coming to raids. </p>
<p>Flags and keys <br>
  It is recommended that you have your VT key, however it is not required. To
    become a full member, you will be required to have 99% of the flags the guild
has. </p>
<p>Requirements for Guest status: <br>
  Player Time: Applicant must have played on a regular basis for 30 days prior
    to making application. <br>
  Level: Main character must be level 69. <br>
  Sponsors: one permanent sponsor, this will be the main sponsor for the duration
  of the application process. If you lose your main sponsor, a new main sponsor
  must be found. <br>
  Keys and Flags: no requirements <br>
  Time: no time requirements <br>
Additional: Officer approval </p>
<p>Alternative guest pass: Occasionally, old friends will want to raid with us
  with no desire to pursue membership. Raid passes will be available to these
  players. </p>
<p>Tier 2: Friend (applicant part 2 of 3) <br>
  The second rank of the application process. This phase will last as long as
    needed based on play time and availability. The main sponsor will keep the
    Guild leader informed as to the status of the applicant. </p>
<p>Requirements for Friend status: <br>
  Sponsors: 4 Total permanent sponsors <br>
  Attendance: Must have made 50% attendance of our scheduled raids (excluding
VT raids) over the past 30 days. </p>
<p>Tier 3: Ally (applicant part 3 of 3) Temporary guild tag granted. <br>
  This is the last rank of the application process. Once a Friend has demonstrated
    their ability to meet the guild requirements and had the opportunity to play
    with our members with no negative issues, the person can move up to Ally
status. </p>
<p>Once you become an Ally, you will be given a &lt;Myth Lords&gt; guild tag.
  You are not a full member yet, and will not have access to the members sections
  of the message boards. This tier will last 1 month. At the end of that month,
  the membership vote will take place. </p>
<p>Requirements for Ally status: <br>
  Sponsors: 8 Total permanent sponsors <br>
  Keys: Must have 60% of the main flags that the guild has completed. <br>
  Attendance: Must have made 50% attendance of our scheduled raids over the past
  30 days. <br>
  AA Requirements: At this point of the process, you should meet the recommended
  AAs for your class. <br>
Vote: A membership poll will be taken before you enter this tier. &quot;</p>
