<p class="pageheader">EQ vs. EQ2
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>11-08-2004</b> - 
<p>
<b>EQ vs. EQ2</b>
<p>
For over five years, EverQuest has shaped the future of gaming.  Launching in early 1999, the fully-3d graphics and the gigantic world that could be played with friends was something new to gamers and also brought a completely different feel and playstyle from the only other mainstream MMORPG on the market at the time – Ultima Online.  Since then, times have changed.  Over 20 developers have released retail MMORPGs –some successful, some not.  Despite these failures and although developers face an extremely risky market to try to break into, MMORPGs continue to grow.  Tuesday, one of the most anticipated titles ever will launch – the sequel to our very own EverQuest.  But is the game a true sequel or a sequel in name only?  What differences are there between EQ and EQ2?  I’m here to tell you – so keep reading!
<p>
For the past couple months I’ve been playing a lot of EQ2.  While my characters have not reached high levels, I have had the opportunity to learn the basics.  As of the end of beta I had a level 22 Ranger and 14 Warrior.  I’m writing this article mostly due to all the threads I’ve seen on various boards (including our own) comparing EQ to EQ2.  They are very different games – aimed at very different types of players.  While there is a chance you’re like me, and can enjoy both, many people will greatly enjoy one and not the other.
<p>
<b>Graphics</b>
<p>
With Omens of War EQ received a graphics engine upgrade.  Many reviews and previews (including my own) expressed amazement at what the new engine brought to the dated EQ graphics.  When EQ came out 3d acceleration was just beginning to catch on.  Despite this, the game still looks great today for being 5 years old, and runs fairly well on mid-range systems.  EQ2 on the other hand was designed to be top of the line not only now – but a year from now.  Because of this decision, EQ2 looks simply jaw-dropping on current higher end hardware, but the cost of this is that the game has harsh system requirements.  Overall if you have the money to purchase an uber computer, you will be happy with EQ2’s graphics.  If you don’t and are still running EQ on a 1.8ghz, 512 ram, GeForce 4200 machine – EQ2 is going to beat the living daylights out of your machine.
<p>
<i>Winner: EQ2 (for pure graphic quality – not performance)</i>
<p>
<b>Sound</b>
<p>
Voice acting has been one of the most advertised features for EQ2.  With voices of such superstars as Christopher Lee and Heather Graham, SOE is banking on voice acting bringing new subscribers to EQ2.  The music in EQ2 is also quite impressive – featuring what sounds like a full orchestra for many of the tracks.  On the other side, EQ's sound has more or less remained the same over the years.  A few updates occurred here and there – a couple of expansions such as PoP had pretty good soundtracks and some voice acting has been experimented with in the new Tutorial.  While this is a topic not many people are concerned about about, the winner is clear this round.
<p>
<i>Winner: EQ2</i>
<p>
<b>Character creation</b>
<p>
Character creation in EverQuest was one of the key points early on, featuring numerous classes, races, faces, and customizable stats.  EQ2 took a different route, offering more visual options, such as the ability to change individual facial features, but removed all traces of stats and skill customizing.  The only selection outside of race presented to players that affects gameplay in EQ2 is deciding to be Good or Evil.  In my eyes, the only way EQ2 could be better here is if you’re really into the whole customizing your character to be “you”.
<p>
<i>Winner: EQ</i>
<p>
<b>Classes</b>
<p>
Character classes are a staple in role-playing games.  EverQuest classes were legendary.  How many times did people that have never played EQ hear “Ranger down!",, a side-effect of Rangers being brittle and drawing agro? For that matter, who didn't know that if you wanted to solo, you should play a necro or a druid?  For good or for bad, this is all changed in EQ2.  As soon as you hit the newbie zone, Isle of Refuge, your first quest is to decide what class you would like to play.  You’re given a choice between Fighter, Scout, Priest, and Mage.  At level 10 you can split off into one of two or three new classes, then again at level 20 you can choose again.  While this sounds good on paper, coming from EQ, I found that many classes are far too similar.  Overall EQ2 presents more choices, but if you’re hoping for the extreme class disparity that presents itself in EQ, you’ll be disappointed.
<p>
<i>Winner: EQ</i>
<p>
<b>Combat</b>
<p>
EQ Combat is quite simple at first sight – just press a button and let it go.  But any EQ Veteran knows that EQ is a game that takes a long time to master.  For example, the bard class in EQ, when controlled by a skilled player, could take out a horde of mobs by himself.   A bard could also buff a whole group with multiple enhancements or play the role of a monk and pull many mobs.  In EQ2, skills and spells are easier to use because they are better described.  In addition, all melee classes in EQ2 have “Combat Arts," basically spells for melees.  Ultimately from what I saw EQ2 combat is good, and will take a while to master, but it’s not on the level of EQ combat yet.  This is balanced out though because EQ2 has found a way with combat arts to make classes such as Warriors need more thought than, “Stand there and take hits while tapping taunt and kick."
<p>
<i>Winner: Tie</i>
<p>
<b>Raiding</b>
<p>
I really don’t have enough experience here to comment on EQ2.  I’ve watched some people raid in the game, and I’ve read the fact sheets – but nothing first-hand.  EQ raids, as we all know, usually require a large number of players – 50-60 on the norm.  EQ2, on the other hand, will cap raiding at 24 players max.  In my eyes, having come from EQ, this seems insanely bad, but then I think of what DAoC did to raiding: 150 people taking on one monster.  So, I’m glad EQ2 did not go the opposite way at least.  Hopefully the 24-person cap does not destroy guilds moving from EQ to EQ2.
<p>
<i>Winner: Get back to me in 3 months</i>
<p>
<b>The World</b>
<p>
My personal favorite thing about EQ was the amazing world of Norrath.  Every zone was different, some were easy to navigate, and some were insanely confusing and maze-like, but you could count on the countless hidden passageways and secrets in every zone.  Some zones from EQ still today have rumors of where a secret monster rarely spawns, and questions still arise about what zone is really connected to what.  Much to my delight, EQ2 recreates this magical feeling pretty well.  The zone design is brilliant and by far the most creative since Velious-era EQ.  My only complaint is that right now it seems you’re pretty limited when it comes to zones.  The two cities in EQ2 have around 10 zones that make up Qeynos and Freeport, and about 6 or 7 adventure / leveling zones each.  Then outside of the gates Qeynos has Antonica, and Freeport has Commonlands – both are the first “mega” zones you visit, about 3x the size of an average EQ zone.  When you leave Antonica or Commonlands, your character is around level 25, whereas,  by this time in EQ, a character that’s exploring would have been to a good 30+ zones.  I’m giving this to EQ by a hair just because of the time it has had to develop as a game.  Assuming SOE cranks out EQ2 expansions like they are doing with EQ, in two years my opinion will most likely be different.
<p>
<i>Winner: EQ</i>
<p>
<b>Overall</b>
<p>
Even though this is typical review “fluff”, it’s clear EQ and EQ2 are aimed at very different types of players while keeping many of the features that made EQ a smashing success.  Soloing for example, a lost art for most classes in EQ, is very much alive and well in EQ2.   In fact, as I noted in my <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=37&category_select_id=9">fan faire coverage</a>, the winner of the EQ2 Ultimate Elimination Challenge soloed all the way and out-leveled people who grouped non-stop.  Questing is also extremely important in EQ2 – at any given time your quest journal will have over 10 quests waiting to be completed, and quests make up a good chunk of your gained XP.  
<p>
My personal feelings are that if you like EQ now, you should stick with it.  SOE will continue to support the game and make it better with expansions. (I’d bet on the next being announced before New Years.)  If you left EQ because you felt overwhelmed, or you’re a fan of other MMORPGs such as Asheron’s Call or City of Heroes, you’ll love EverQuest 2.  Of course, if you’re crazy like me, you’ll use up ALL your free time playing both.
