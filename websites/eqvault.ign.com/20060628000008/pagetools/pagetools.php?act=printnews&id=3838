The zone will have increased loot drops and over a dozen new items added to its list. <br><br>We will also be changing the zone reset timer from 3 days to 5 days as some of the new items will be a bit more potent than those currently in the zone.<br><br>Go get your flags and be the first to find the new items.</blockquote><br>Should be fun to see what they do!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 30 November, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3838">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3838</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 17:00:08 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
