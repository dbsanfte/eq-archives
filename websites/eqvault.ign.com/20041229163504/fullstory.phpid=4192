During our Community Summit this last summer, and in many subsequent discussions, we have heard the recurring desire to find a way to ease the frustrations associated with this backflagging.<br>While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to), we have looked into ways that we can reduce the frustrations of backflagging and feel that we have arrived at a fair and equitable solution, which is detailed below.<br>- A new implementation of the 85/15 rule has been introduced into Planes of Power zones including the Plane of Time.  This should resolve the outstanding problems that occur from time to time with the current 85/15 implementation.<br>- The new 85/15 has also been introduced for the locked zones in Gates of Discord.<br>- An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone. <br>The implementation varies slightly from zone to zone to fit the story and nature of the zone, but in general will involve killing a raid target within that zone, looting an item, and completing a single group quest to change that item into a zone flag.  This only applies to zones that don't already have a single group task or system to gain access.<br> <br>~ AA Changes ~<br>- Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs.  Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost. *<br>- Changed the monk AA Crippling Strike to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare. <br>- Changed the monk AA Stunning Kick to an activated ability that does a round kick attack as well as a stun.<br>- Changed the monk AA Eye Gouge to an activated ability that does a tiger claw attack as well as reduces the targets offensive ability. <br>- Due to major changes in how these  work, AA points for Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge have been refunded.<br>- Reduced the reuse time of the Ranger AAs Frost Arrow and Flame Arrow to 3 minutes. *<br>- Hobble of Spirits will now stack with the Beastlord's proc buffs. *<br>- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take.<br>- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs.<br>- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. *<br>- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. *<br>- If your character was created before EQ started storing starting location data, when you log into the game you will now be prompted to choose your home city from a list of valid starting locations for your character.  You will only need to do this once and once this has been set, it cannot be changed.  This will correct the problems with the Origin AA not returning some characters to their expected home city.<br> <br>~ Zone and NPC Changes ~<br>- Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): *<br> Shadeweaver’s Thicket 1-30<br> Kurn’s Tower 10-25<br> Unrest 15-30<br> Crystal Caverns 25-35<br> Solusek’s Eye 25-45<br> Katta Castellum 30-60<br> Lower Guk 35-55<br> Nagafen’s Lair 40-55<br> Umbral Plains 50-60<br>- Respawn time for the bosses in Tacvi has been increased from 3 to 5 days.<br>- Some Tacvi loot has been upgraded.  Bosses now drop more items per kill and some all new items have been added to the zone. *<br>- An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun’Muram after they have defeated him at least once.  Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun’Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance. *<br>- Gilipus of Ak`Anon has joined the Beta Neutral Faction.  You will now be able to complete his quest without having to raise Gem Choppers Faction.<br>- The 3 Tormentors in the Jelvan event now share hatelist when idle or aggro.  Anyone that is on one Tormentor's hatelist, but not on the other 2 Tormentor's hatelist will be added.  This should make it difficult (if not impossible) to avoid AOEs.<br>- Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places.<br>- Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable.<br>- Clicking on the door to Anguish while having the Seal: Mastery of All on your person will now prompt red text indicating your flag has been granted.<br>- The respawn of Globes of Discordant Energy are now tracked on the event timer for Anguish.  The method for obtaining the Globes has not changed.<br>- The pile of stones that was used as a secondary zone between dranik and bloodfield has been removed.  There is now an actual zoneline there.<br>- Plane of Justice - previously, you could not click the red teleports to leave the Seventh Hammer's room unless the Seventh Hammer was dead (or not up).  This has been changed so you can leave the room as long as it is not aggro.  If you click on a portal while he is aggro, you should get a message and remain in the room.<br>- Grennet Stormhand in North Qeynos is no longer a task master since he is part of a quest.  His task master job has been taken over by Jorren Boxmover.<br>-  Increased the maximum duration for all Labyrinth Trials from 1 hour to 2 hours.  When an event is successfully completed, the instance will shut down in 30 minutes.  If it is failed, the instance will shut down in 5 minutes.<br>- Changed the reclusive Girplan event in Bloodfields so that each NPC in the sequence stays up for 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes before depopping.<br>- Elemental NPCs are once again Charmable in Bastion of Thunder.<br> <br>~ Epic Alterations ~<br>- Updated some text to clarify what is needed for the bard epic 2.0. *<br>- Part of the rogue epic that could be skipped has been repaired as this was not intended to be possible.<br>- The zonewide shout that occurs when killing base pop NPCs in the special instance of Vxed for the paladin epic has now been removed.<br>- Added another check to the monk epic to make sure that the monk looting the item also has the Mark of Justice needed to access the 7th Hammer's area.<br>- More details regarding the combine for the Beastlord Epic 2.0 have been added to the text. *<br>- Fixed the hand in to Uisima for the Ranger Epic 1.5.<br>- Added a hint to the Druid Epic 2. *<br>- In the Hider Event in Frontier Mountains for the Druid Epic 1.5, the goblins should teleport a bit less frequently. *<br>- Additional lore has been added to the rogue epic 2.0.  *<br>- Moved the Dark Huntress from Mistmoore to the Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br>- Changed a few of Lirprin's dialogues to hint at where the last few steps are that players are missing. *<br>- Arly Golyeck in Paludal caverns will now accept bribes from half-elves, or those that are in half-elven illusion while also wearing a Burnoose of the Halfbreed.<br> <br>~ Tradeskill Changes ~<br>- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 favorites (up from 100). *<br>- The drop rate of spiderling silk has been increased, as there are many new combines that require this item as a component. *<br>- The Rune of Zephyr should now drop off of the appropriate level of NPC’s.<br>- Several Tradeskill recipes have had their missing ingredients added to the game.  These items will now drop off of appropriate NPC’s.<br>- Increased the drop rate of Tae Ew Scales. *<br>- Increased the drop rate of Putrescent Blood. *<br>- Made several quest-related combines "Learnable".<br>- Fixed a few grammatical issues with the "Forge of Icewell Arms" book.<br>- Fixed an issue with one of the Abysmal Sea tradeskill books (The Beauty of a Simple Stone). It should now be able to be read.<br>- Fixed the recipe for the Imbued Northman Kite Shield (Rallos).<br>- Fixed the research recipe for Malosini, it should now combine properly.<br>- Fixed the recipe for Tuna Rice Surprise, it will now return the Wok on success.<br>- Fixed the Large Sandblasted Steel Girth, it is now usable by the appropriate races.<br>- Fixed the Sandblasted Ringmail Bracelet, it is now usable by the appropriate races.<br>- Fixed the multiple-recipes for Vegetable Oil, they will now return the correct yields.<br>- Fixed the disparity in between the cast-times on the various "Greater Elixer of Concentration" potions.<br>- Added the Blood Treated Kaniz Hide to the game.<br>- Added a recipe for players to create a package of vegetables.<br>- Added a "Fully Charged Gnomish Vanishing Device" to the game. *<br>- Added LDoN Foraged items to the Interactive Objects in all LDoN zones (this includes the forged alchemy components).<br>- Removed the lore tag from the Smithing Chisel.<br>- Taught Barbarians how to make Large Leather Gorgets and Pants.<br>- Evaluated the PoP Smithing disparity between plate and chain. This was by far the largest task that took the most time, and I think most of the smiths will be pleased with the results. <br>- One block of ore will now yield two sheets of metal.<br>- Removed the Chain Jointing requirement from the combine. It now requires one Superb Leather Padding instead.<br> <br>~ Item, Spell, Discipline and Skill Changes ~<br>- Auto range attack implemented, no longer will it be necessary to range attack manually - /autofire is a toggle command that will fire your ranged weapon until you run out of ammunition, turn on autoattack to switch to melee combat, or use the /autofire command again. *<br>- /melody ability implemented for bards - To use /melody, type /melody . The numbers are the same numbers you would use for the /cast command. The melody will repeat the songs in the specified order until a note is missed due to an interruption. *<br>- Modified Mirrored Mask, so it is no longer no rent and poof on death, however the click effect only works inside Anguish.<br>- Increased the chance on the Cleave effects to affect DPS as they were originally intended.<br>- Fixed a bug with the Frenzy of Conquest benefit.<br>- No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player. *<br>- Changed the Mark of Justice to take the player's group instead of just the player when attempting to engage The 7th Hammer. *<br>- Cryston, Staff of the Riftnow has the focus of Quickening of the Ikaav.<br>- Dragorn Head Statue Piece and Dragorn Torso Statue Piece are now very large and can fit in bags. <br>- Clear Rock and A Large Rock are now very large and can fit in bags. <br>- Polished Stone of Renewal can now be used by berserkers. *<br>- Increased the number of combat abilities that can be stored. *<br>- Berzerker: Hastenend War Cry has been fixed.<br>- Bards will stop playing songs when feign death effects hit them (some NPC encounters do this).<br>- Reflect spells are no longer reflecting detrimental spells more times than they should (Bounce, Reflect, Dark Echo)<br>- Players are no longer able to have Form of the Great Bear and a mount on at the same time.<br>- Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you have the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge. *<br>- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. *<br>- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have.  It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments.<br>- When combining the aegis of chaotic worship with the soul temper and a flask of water, you will receive the temper and the aegis of chaotic worship back if you don't have the correct flags instead of just the aegis back.<br>- The Monk's feign death success rate has been improved.  It was previously capped at 95% at 100 skill and now it ramps up the success rate for higher skill levels. *<br>- Fixed several inconsistencies with pets affected by focus items.<br>- Increased the mana regen gained by Elemental Simulacrum.<br>- Touch of the Devourer was changed to allow partial damage when it is resisted.  This is an increase in the overall damage of the spell.<br>- New items are available on the PvP point merchants. *<br>- Might of the Wild Spirits and Savage Wildcaller's Blessing should now stack better.<br>- The effect on the Wristband of Secrets no longer works on other players.<br>- Increased the focus % of the following effects:<br> Hastening of the Ikaav<br> Quickening of the Ikaav<br> Alacrity of the Ikaav<br>-  Increased the potency of Pure Spirit.<br>- Nature's Balance should now only remove beneficial spells from the target.<br>- Removed the scaling focus mods from the following spells:<br> Force of Ikkibi<br> Order of Trushar<br> Sylvan Anger<br> Taelosian Geomancy<br> Burning Night<br> Anger of Taelosia<br> Sylvan Kindle<br> Clear Fire<br>- The the class-specific quest chest armors from Omens of War now have a .8 second cast time.<br>- The pre-nerf LDoN armor sets can now be sold back to the merchants, like other LDoN items.  They are the versions with two type 2 slots and one type 3 slot (instead of one each of types 1, 2, and 3).  These items are those with the followiung in the item name:<br> Royal Attendant * of Sand<br> Incorporeal * of the Specter<br> Mucus-Drenched *<br> Immortal's Bloodied *<br><br><span CLASS="newsby">-- <a href="index.php?dir=siteinfo&content=mail&staff=Draknorr">Draknorr</a> @ Wed 15 Dec 2004</span><br><br><br><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com//skins/default/spacer.gif" width="540" height=1></td>           <td           background="http://eqvault.ign.com//skins/default/newsbox_06.jpg" width=17>&nbsp;</td></tr>         <tr>           <td><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com//skins/default/newsbox_07.jpg"></td>           <td           background="http://eqvault.ign.com//skins/default/newsbox_08.jpg"></td>           <td><img         src="http://eqvault.ign.com//skins/default/newsbox_09.jpg"></td></tr></table></p></center></td></tr></table></DIV><center><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript1.1"
