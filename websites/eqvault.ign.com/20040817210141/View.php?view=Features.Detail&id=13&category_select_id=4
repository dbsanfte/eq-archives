<p class="pageheader">EverQuest Community Summit
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-08-2004</b> - 
Sony Online Entertainment held a summit of community and guild leaders on what they and we can do to make EverQuest a more enjoyable experience for both high level and active players, casual gamers, and players new to the game. I was invited to participate in the discussions. This surprised me, since I now only recently have taken over EverQuest Vault, and I am a casual player. The first thing I did upon the invitation is read the many fan sites and class specific sites to find out what players are angry about and what they hope to achieve from the summit. What I found was skepticism among the hardest of the hardcore about the recent expansion, Gates of Discord, and the direction of the game. With that I mind I left Friday morning expecting much bloodshed and shouting. I was surprised.
<P>
Over 60 people hit San Diego on Friday with one thing on their minds, getting their questions answered. I was surprised at the range of people I met and how friendly everyone was. No one shouted down other ideas as they debated if Paladins should receive better tanking abilities or if that would hurt the Warrior class. There was a mix of women and men and a few casual players mixed in to make sure that a wide range of players were represent.
<P>
During the breakfast on Saturday developers were mingling with the players talking about the game and what we would discuss during our roundtable discussions. I enjoyed seeing players talk with so much passion about a game that was released over five years ago, even when they aren't happy they still have so much love for this game. After breakfast we loaded up and headed out to the SOE offices for a day of debate and discussion.
<P>
When we arrived at the SOE head quarters we were greeted by John Smedley and other EverQuest developers. Mr. Smedley apologized for the Gates of Discord expansion and admitted that it wasn't tested and tuned enough when released. When they were testing the game they tested it with level 70 characters in mind, when the game was released the level cap was not raised. This led to the content going beyond challenging to a nuisance. Mr. Smedley also made the point that they didn't invite us here to sell us on EverQuest II and if he had the ability he would never have named it EverQuest II, they are developing each product to coexist with one and other, EverQuest II is not a replacement for EverQuest. After the introductions the floor was opened to questions. What surprised me what how candid the developers were and that Mr. Smedley readily admitted that he didn't have the answers to everything and he didn't try to give the players an answer that they could see through. After the opening discussion we broke off in groups for discussions with developers and the customer service department.
<P>
I was in a group with the famed Alan Crosby and a few other developers. Our first session was on what players wanted fixed in the game and the developers never showed any distain for the players feedback. They were honest on what they could do quickly and what would take time and why it would take time. We were given a list of things that would be immediately addressed:
<LI>Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time
<LI>Raid messages of the day
<LI>Improving how they handle beta and testing
<LI>Increase the buffs on players through AAs
<LI>Note field on raid window
<LI>Improved consent & drag for raid, group and guild
<LI>Improve corpse drag radius
<LI>Make charms not no-drop
<LI>Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing
<P>
Alan Crosby did a fantastic job making sure that everyone's voice was heard and that no one was shouted over. He kept the discussions moving and made it enjoyable to someone who didn't understand the majority of what players wanted. We then broke for a BBQ lunch and again were met with more developers and more discussions. Sony did a good job of making sure we met in informal settings to talk with developers. Many commented on how the summit felt more like a fan faire than a conference.
<P>
We then met with Satao Minami the Customer Service manager to talk about the new system ticketing system they are introducing. This was a shorter discussion than the others but eased many attendees. Other attendants commented on how they would submit a ticket and never hear back from anyone, this is going to be helped with the new system since the customer service department will be able to reply to petitions without having the player online. We received an e-mail from Mr. Minami after the summit detailing some changes that will be made:
<LI>Publicize our advancements in EverQuest Customer Service
A. Some groups knew there was a change (i.e. CS Assist) but did not know what it was.
B. Several people expressed that they had received much improved Customer Service since the new system (CS Assist) went live.
C. Some suggested having a CS game spy chat session on our improvements and past changes to reflect how we are moving towards better servicing our customers.
<LI>Increased functionality of /report tool (more lines, more intuitive, possible integration with Ticket window)
<LI>Ability to see how many issues are currently in the queue that need assistance when submitting a ticket
<LI>Greater ability for our GM's to gather information in raid related issues, and thus be able to assist large amount of customers, even after the issue has passed. (ability for our GM's to see logs pertaining to who triggered events, who entered a zone, flags issued logs, develop some way to determine etc.)
<LI> Have the ability to save ticket response files, so that customer can post or update the information to the guild on specific issues which would prevent other guild members from petitioning on
<LI>Consistency in Service
A. Some groups had noticed inconsistencies in service with our outsource groups and our San Diego GM's, also even between our San Diego GM's. This is obviously resolved through improved communication between the Leads and making sure our GM's are all on the same page. We need to send a clear message to our outsource partners with consistency as well.
B. Training for our GM's - There were concerns related to the Consistency issues that our GM's are not trained enough on new content or have the information regarding it available to them so they can address customer issues properly.
<P>
After our meeting with Customer Service we had our final roundtable discussion on where the game should go in the future. Other attendees gave very interesting responses and surprisingly we talked about both high level and low level content. One of the developers commented on that they might need to do a better job directing new players to the content they already have, I agree completely. A point of mine was that after the new tutorial and the level 1-10 quests the player is left without an idea on where they should go and what they should do.
<P>
At the end of the summit we had a nice dinner with more mingling of attendees with developers. Alan went around to every table and talked with everyone on what they thought and if they had any last concerns. I will give high honours to the development staff and marketing people for the work and effort they put in. They didn't try to sell us on anything and truly valued our feedback. We were never talked down to and always listened to.
<P>
The general consensus was that this summit was a good start and expectations were high and attitudes bright at the end. SOE plans to hold more of these summits as EverQuest continues to grow.
<P>
I have special thanks for Leo and Tom for explaining to me some of the higher end game concepts I have yet to experience. I do not remember Leo's guild but Tom is a member of the Enlightened Dark on Tarrew Marr, give them a high five if you ever see them in game, Leo just send me an e-mail, and I'll update with your guild info. It was good fun and I hope to see you at another summit or faire.
