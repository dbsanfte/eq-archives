This Guide is intended for EVIL PVP WIZARDS level 1-36<br><br>Welcome to EverQuest Young wizard. I am Kyzan Fizzlebane, a Dark elf of the Tallon Zek server. I will help mold you into a fierce and powerful player vs. player wizard. I will advise you on the best creatures to kill by level, and give you helpful hints and tips that will keep you alive during your life as a Wizard, including Pking strats and tips.<br><br>WIZARD BASICS:<br><br>When creating your character, make sure you put as many points into intelligence as you can. Intelligence is the most important attribute of a Wizard.<br><br>In the beginning you will have to learn your new area and knowing your area will keep you alive. Use location to your advantage, (ie. hunting near zones so you can sometimes escape death.) Learn that as a Wizard you will die many, many times, but we make up for it with the ability to bind in any location and are given the ability to Teleport.<br><br>Like most casters you will find that you will spend about 50-60% of your time looking at your Spellbook.<br>During this time I suggest you learn Sense direction. It will take a long time to get it to increase but it is well worth it. Knowing where you are in the land is very important, especially when you're locating your body. Learn to understand the /Loc command.<br><br>When you know you're going to die or get very close to it, do a /loc so you know were your body is in the zone.<br>If you die while you are zoning, your body will be located at 0,0  <br><br><br>CONSIDERING CREATURES:<br><br>You will find all creatures will be blue, white, yellow, and red. This is how you determine what you can or cannot kill.  Blue will be weaker then you, but don't let that fool you, many times a weaker creature has killed a more powerful wizard. White is equal to your level, in most cases. Yellow will be perhaps a level or two higher and red is just plain bad for your health if you solo.  Take into consideration some creatures have the ability to cast, and/or poison you, even though they may con Blue or seems easy. Poison will still kill you after the creature is dead if you are unfortunate enough to have low health after the kill. <br><br>Helpful tip: if you are in danger of death from poison, then gate out of zone, and the poison will leave your body so that you may live.<br><br>GAINING WEALTH:<br><br>I recommend you kill Spiders for their silk because it is probably the best loot you will get from 1-5th level as it sells for about 1.2 gold pieces. Buy a sewing kit as well and combining the silk with the sewing kit will increase your profit when you sell it. As you increase your wealth, buy a backpack so you don't have to make as many trips to the city to sell your new found wears.  Decayed Skeletons offer bone chips as loot as well as money. Save the Bones because there is a market for bone chips (ie. 20 bone chips goes for 1-2pp on auction.) Do this at your low levels 1-8 till they are no longer blue. Work your way up to your next big Loot which should be Willow Wisps. They drop lightstones and Greater lightstones that go for 1-4pp at vendors. When you finish there, make your way to Lavastorm or Oasis for your next Wealth gain taking on Dervishes and Drakes in Lavastorm. Oasis is not very good when it comes to loot but it has no equal for Experience. Basically the way it normally goes, is the worse the loot, usually the better the experience. Perhaps I am wrong with this but in my experience that is how it is.<br><br>When you reach the 16th-20th level, you're going to want to hunt in Lake Rathe. Your target in this zone will be Aviaks. <br><br>Warning: DO NOT KILL AVIAK GUARDS!!<br><br>And this is why... When you're past 20, your going to want to hit South Karana and hit the Treehouse were the aviaks spawn. If you kill the Aviak guards in Lake Rathe you're going to find yourself KOS to all the birds in South karana... not a pretty picture.<br><br>You will also find Gnolls here that you will want to kill at some time. They are located near the South Karana zone line. The Gnoll Embalmer drops the Skull of Jen'tra and Gnoll High shaman drop the Rune Totem staff. This will probably be your first Magical weapon, you can purchase one on the market for about 20pp. <br><br>At the 20th level it is time to pick a last name. Now you're going to leave Lake Rathe for South Karan. There you will find the treehouse filled with Rooks. At this time you will want to get on the Treant List. Yes, that's right, probably the first list you will encounter. You must be put on the list as Treants<br>are a very popular spawn because they offer Excellent Loot and Experience. Concentrate on these two creatures till your 24th level, then think about joining a team to kill Splitpaw Gnolls.<br><br>Gnolls are approximately at the 25-30th level. They offer great experience and some fairly nice items that you can use and sell.<br><br>JOINING A GUILD:<br><br>I recommend you do not join a guild until your 10th level.<br><br>Why, you ask?<br><br>I have many reasons: one is to scout out the guilds and talk to the leaders. Find out what makes that guild tick. What is the Mission of that guild and so forth. I stress this because a guild can make or break you. Joining a well hated guild will possibly get you into trouble down the line or perhaps you join a guild and it is disbanded. I have seen both but, I have luckily never encountered any such problems with The Darklight Brigade.<br><br>GUILDS RECOMMENDED:<br><br>Mercenary of Darkness<br>Darklight Brigade<br>Ministry of Hate<br>The bashing Iggles<br><br>Not listed in order of favorites.<br><br>WIZARDS VS. THE WORLD:<br><br>Things you will want to know about the world. You're going to find that it is hard to be a wizard because you are not welcome in most cities, even in the Dark cities of Grobb and Oggok.<br><br>I highly suggest you stay away from killing Merchants and Gypsies because you may find them to be the only ones that will sell or buy from you. <br><br>Grobb is Friendly to Wizards but you must take great care when nearing the bank. There is a Skeleton there that is agro to wizards. I am not sure if it is depends on the god you worship, or if it is Wizards in general. <br><br>Oggok is unfriendly to wizards and you will not be able to buy or sell in this city. Banking is all you can do here. <br><br>This is a major sore for any Dark elf wizard to be able to only sell or buy in his home city.<br><br>When you get the ability to Leviate your gonna find another pain. You will be dependent on others to buy  Batwings for you in Oggok as it is the only place I know of that sells them.<br><br><br>TRADE SKILLS:<br><br>There are many options open for wizards, probably the best is Tayloring. <br><br>Smithing would be great but you have to take into consideration your strength, which will probably be 60lb limit. <br><br>LEVEL 1-5:<br><br>Alright newbie, you have left the city and you're wondering what to do now? Well, first you need to decide what type of weapon skill do I really want to use. With the outcome of Kurnak and the new Encrusted Diamond staff, making that decision is that much harder. I personally suggest you go with the 1 handed blunt. <br><br>Why you ask? <br><br>Staff of the wheel is your answer. Probably the best staff you will get for a long time. I have heard it is obtainable around the 20th level. Your destination from the city is the Newbie log. From the Neriak entrance you will run straight. To your left you will see a large log. This is the Spawn log that will be where you appear after you die. Continue straight and you will see a road. Follow that road and stay on the Left side of that road. The next log you see on your left is the Newbie log. Your home for the next 3-4 levels. Ok, so you're at level 1, now what should I kill? Well, start with White con creatures. How do I con creatures? First target your creature by left clicking your mouse on him. Then right click on the creature and you should get a color codes message. The color of the message will tell you how tough it is. Go Kill Moss snakes, Decaying skeletons, and Wolves first, until you level up. Stay away from the Spiders and Beetles because they have a habit of helping each other.  Ok, you're nearing 3rd and feel daring so kill some spiders and beetles. Food and water will re-spawn on you after you die, up to the 5t level. After the 5th level you will have to buy food and water. The book you get in the beginning of the game is of no use in PVP so I recommend destroying it. <br><br>When you're at the 4th level you are probably tired of staying so close to the newbie log. You feel like venturing over to the other side of the road and are thinking you can kill Bears and Giant spiders. You're probably right. This is the time to find that it is not easy for you to kill Skeletons. Skeletons will kill you with ease at the 4th level. You get new spells at level 4 and the ability to meditate. You have to spend one point in meditate for it to work. Buy your offensive spells first and then your shield spells. <br><br>You're playing over on the other side of the road in the 5th level. Look for bears and Giant spiders and kill everything you see. Remember when you're out of mana you're resting so find a safe spot to rest. Now you have a good idea where most of the landmarks are around the Newbie log and now you should have a fair idea of where everything is at in Neriak.<br><br>LEVEL 6-10th:<br><br>As a Wizard you might want to find some familiar faces and think about grouping. As a Group you can kill more and have a better chance to kill the tougher creatures like Skeletons and Shadow wolves.  Get a crew and try out your luck with Skeletons and Shadow wolves. A good combo to start with is Shadowknight and yourself. Melee classes are your friends and they are yours. Let your Melee tank kicks some butt while you stand back and cast. Don't go crazy with the casting unless both of you are in trouble. Continue like this for a while if you can. As you gain levels, grouping is going to be more and more important. This game is geared for groups not solo's. When you hit the 8th level you might want to try your luck at Young Kodiac's. You better have a group because you won't be able to fight them solo until about the 10th level. In your 8th level you may want to explore two other zones. One is Lava Storm, not far from Neriak.  Also, there is the commonlands. East commons is a good place to continue your leveling. Be warned it is crawling with lightskins. A Perfect place to begin your Rain of hate. Start working on Lions and Young Kodiacs first in these zones. Stay away from Wisps until you get a Magical weapon. When you hit the 10th level you should begin to hunt wisps <br>there - excellent Experience and loot. Greater light stones go for about 3pp at vendors and Lightstones for 1pp. <br><br>LEVEL 11-15th:<br><br>Now you're getting somewhere. You have hunted the commonlands to death, taken a few Wisps to the grave and made a fair profit.  Time to take yourself to Oasis and kill croc's. It is very good experience but the loot is nil. There you will continue and it is there where you will probably see the most Pking in any Darkie controlled zone. It is where the Lighties come to try to slay us. Find a crew there and begin your fight against them Croc's. Also you could hit Lavastorm and slay drakes, Dervishes<br> and Fire elementals.<br><br>Warning: Watch out for LockJaw, he is at the 22nd level. This croc will kill you on sight.<br><br><br>LEVEL 16-20th:<br><br>Time to go play in Lake Rathe mountains. Here you will become a master swimmer, you will have to do a lot of swimming but it is worth the trouble.  Find out where the 4 Aviaks sites are located and kill them. <br>They have a fair loot and good experience.  Sharks are also fair experience but poor loot.<br><br>Warning: Beware of Murkdweller. He is a 25th level Deepwater goblin that carries the Water Crystal Staff.<br>He is a fast caster and you will need a team to slay him.<br><br>When you get to the 20th level, you will get to specialize.  As a wizard you would be a complete fool if you do not choose Specialization Evocation. Evocation is your direct damage spells. You will find that you fizzle less and hit <br>more often for full damage. By now you have found that soloing is not even worth trying because Root is too unreliable <br>to effectively kill a creature.  Grouping is what it's all about now until you get your Jboots.<br><br>LEVEL 21-30th:<br><br>Now you're in South Karana and probably know of the treants and the Splitpaw gnolls. Here you will fight Rooks, Gnolls, and Treants for most of the 21-30th level. This is were you will level rapidly as the experience here is very, very good. Not unheard of to make a level a day in this zone. Treants are great for Loot and Experience. Also, you will have to place yourself on the list to hunt them. Sometimes the list is long but don't worry, you will get your turn.  Gnolls are good from the 24-35th level for experience. <br><br>Another little place to go when Treant list is full is at the 25th level. Get a full team and head over to East Karana. Once there you can cross the bridge, take a left, and follow the shore. You will see a Cyclops in the water. As you near him, take a 90 degree turn and there you will see a druid ring. There are 3 druids there, all of them are 25th level. Very good experience and Loot including Black Pearls . These Druids are an unbreakable spawn so you will have to fight them all.  <br><br>The Druids have a 4 minute spawn time. When you get to 29 to 30 you can hunt the 2 spawn druids in East Commons. In West Commons they are the same as 3 spawn in loot and experience. Spawn time is 8 min. There is a merchant behind the druids who is perfect for selling heavy FS weapons in West Commons.<br><br>LEVEL 31-36:<br><br>You have a good Idea were to hunt from this point on. I suggest during this time you go to South Ro and camp the Ancient cyclops for the Ring he drops. This is a very time consuming quest.  He is the first part of the Jboots quest. With Jboots you will not need SOW again. You can effectively kite your creatures you fight and are not so dependent on others to get experience. This does not mean no more grouping, but means if you cant find a group, you're not idling.<br><br>Hill giants in Rathe Mountains are now a good option to kill along with Specters in Oasis and feerot zone. Hill giants have great loot anywhere from 1gp to 60pp in money. Specs drop Black pearls and are slow and easy to Kite and kill for good exp. <br><br>LEVEL 37+<br><br>As I am not yet at the 37th level, I can only say use what you learn to help guide you and may your hunt go as well as mine.<br><br><br>PVP SECTION:<br><br>So, you came here to be a player killer. I will do my best to give you helpful hints and tips to be a successful PK.  <br><br>The key to success is Speed. Not only in the speed in which you cast but in the case of how fast you can run. Spirit of the Wolf is a must when actively hunting your prey. To outrun them and over take them, in there feeble attempt to flee your Spells of doom, makes the game all that more exciting. You must exercise patience when Pking or getting Pked.  I have seen this happen many times where you're cast upon as your meditating. The first instinct is to run away. Don't do it. Con him first, then run if you're still in good health. I don't know how many times a blue con has tried to kill me while meditating and it ends up him I am looting.<br><br><br>Things to consider when Pking. There are two main types of Pkers I have found.<br><br>1. The Naked Pker. He/She is the one that will kill you un-clothed and take your precious babbles at no risk to themselves. Typically these are the loud mouthed braggerts you will hear shouting and ooc talking over the zone about there killing of a fully clothed.<br><br>2. The Fully clothed Pkers. Very rare on PVP but there are some out there that take that risk.  Many of these Types I have found to be friendly in tell chat or over ooc chat.<br><br>You will develop your own PK strategy as you progress in game you will learn the spells that work and do not work on other players. One of note is Enstill will not work on a Player. Stick with root for binding them. Also Bonds of force works great on Druids. Cast it on a druid in wolf form and he loses his form, hit him again and he is slow as melting snow. Again be patient, watch your opponents cast. Nuke him, wait as he casts, fire up your Interupts and stuns, and then nail him. Do this and you should do very well. <br><br>Kyzan Fizzlebane<br>36th Wizard of the Darklight Brigade.<br>
