Angelis<br>
</a>&quot;Founded on 13 March 2005, by Diurdulun and Amiellen, Atrum Angelus (Latin
  for Dark Angels) is a guild, based on friendship and respect. We are made up
  of EQ vets, new players, crazy people and funny people! We are proud of our
  guild and our focus is to have fun, make new friends, explore new zones and
  progress in game together. We love nothing more than to have crazy adventures. 
<p>We, on occasion, might be rude, crude and naughty, so if you are the sensitive
  type, prudish or easily offended you best look elsewhere! </p>
<p>We are not a raiding guild, although we will do some casual raids, epic raids
  or even possibly PoP progression. Our playing time can be any time of the day
  or night, as we have members from Australia, USA and Europe. So you never know
  who you may run into. </p>
<p>We are not here to get ourselves, or you, to level 70 as fast as humanly possible,
  so if all you are looking for is a guild who will do this for you, keep looking. </p>
<p>We want to make your guild experience enjoyable, and assist where we can.
  Bear in mind this doesn't mean we exist solely to give you something to do
  in-game. </p>
<p>Atrum Angelus is a member of the NCG [Norrathian Council of Guilds]. This
  allows us the wider player base for groups, to participate in weekly raids,
  events
  etc.
  So
  if you
  cant
  find
  a group within the guild please use the NCG or flags channel and LFG there
  For more information on the NCG please visit http://www.lostfaith.org </p>
<p>If you think we are the guild for you, please send one of us a tell or email. </p>
<p>Level Requirements </p>
<p>We accept all classes and levels. Alts are welcome in our guild, but only
  alts of our own mains. We do not want alts of high level raiders who have little
  time to play and just want a place to park. (We are looking for active members).

    Nature</a><br>
    &quot;Formed on May 5, 2003, Destructive Nature is one of the oldest active guilds
    on Stromm. Our membership includes a solid core of high-level knowledgeable
    and helpful players, along with a good mix of low to mid level mains and
    active alts. We group together, work on epics and quests, and raid on occasion
    in conjuction with the Norrathian Council of Guilds. Participation is never
    required, but for those interested in lower-tier PoP flagging, VT progression,
    or just the occasional boss-mob hit, the option is there. Our main force
of members play in the PST to EST time zones.</p>
<p>Our guild is built on a solid foundation of trust and integrity and the guild
  tag that follows your name makes you a representative of the entire guild.
  Maturity, patience, and honesty are requirements, not only among guild mates,
  but also to fellow adventurers throughout Norrath and beyond. Please read our
Charter for a better idea of what we expect from our members.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=16577&TabID=149812" target="_blank">Fate's
Asylum</a><br>
&quot;Fate's Asylum is a Family guild based out of the Stromm(newbie) server on the
MORPG EverQuest. It was established in Feburary of 2004 with the help of Carodor
and his officers. We are currently focusing on getting all of our members epic
1.0 equipped, and then moving on to raid Luclin content. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=25287&TabID=228036" target="_blank">Divine
    Chronicles</a><br>
    &quot;We are a serious raiding guild that raids 3-4 days a week, Sunday through
    Saturday. Our raids begin at 4:30 pm PST / 7:30 pm EST typically hitting
    targets as they are available in PoP, as well as trips to GoD, and rune farming
in OoW. </p>
<p>You must be level 65 to apply and you must be EP flagged. Only classes we
  might take exception on would be Rogues, Bards and Clerics. Minimum aa and
  spell requirements below are what we expect our apps to strive for. These will
  be very necessary for EP raiding. If you do not currently meet the minimum
  requirements you may still apply and will be looked at by a case to case basis.
  We have currently finished our full back flagging round for EP's including
  Sol Ro, but will still be doing some back flag targets off and on for our current
  will ins. If you are not EP flagged your app will most likely be denied at
this time.&quot;</p>

  &quot;Dragejegerene is not a hard core raiding guild, we like to think of ourselves
  as a raiding guild with room for real life. Our raid hours are during the week
  are normally 5:00PM CST - 12:00AM CST and 12:00PM CST - 12:00AM CST on Weekends,
  all applicants should be able to raid during those hours. We don't have set
  raiding days, but rather call raid rallies on the spur of the moment if/when
  mobs happen to be up. We raid a maximum of 3 - 4 days a week. Depending on
  what mobs are up and what flags/keys we are currently working on. We are NOT
  in a mad rush to get to End Game Content but will make our way there in our
  own time, we prefer to take the scenic route and enjoy the content of all the
expansions.</p>
<p>WE WILL NOT TAG ANYONE BEFORE LEVEL 55 ---Please understand this BEFORE you
  apply to Dragejegerene. You are welcome to apply / hang out in recruit channel
  / raid with us while below the level minimum but don't expect to get guildinvite
until you have reached appropriate level. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etherealkindred.com/" target="_blank">Ethereal Kindred</a><br>
  &quot;Ethereal Kindred is a guild devoted to the balance of raiding and grouping.
We are a higher level guild comprised largely of members level 60 or higher. </p>
<p>With regards to raiding, we have scheduled raids three nights a week (currently
  Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 7pm EST). </p>
<p>We recognize that there are many ways in which members contribute to the guild
  outside of the raiding atmosphere. Such was include helping other members with
  their epics, providing buffs, corpse retrieval, rezzes, etc. We will seek to
find a way of recognizing and rewarding these contributions. </p>
<p>- You must be unguilded when applying <br>
  - You must have downloaded all maps from mapfiend.net <br>
  - You must register to these forums and post an application <br>
- You must make raids when online </p>
<p>We are a raiding guild first and foremost. <br>
  We enjoy challenging encounters, and value progression and skill above all
    else (we are not zerg guild). Because of this we ask that our members have
    the play time available to support our raid activities. <br>
  Please refer to our recruiting requirements below as they continue to change. <br>
  Raid attendance is VERY important to our success. We normally raid three nights
  a week (Wed, Thur, Sat). Raids start around 6-7pm EST/3-4pm PST , and end when
  all targets have found their demise. If you cannot play a significant portion
  of these hours consistently then Ethereal Kindred is not the right guild for
  you. <br>
  We do understand RL comes first and any circumstances can be discussed with
  an officer. <br>
  We are looking for applicants who are dedicated to their class and are willing
  to devote considerable time and effort building their character and improving
  the guild. We want our members to continue to better their characters when
  not raiding. <br>
  If you think that you would be a good fit for Ethereal Kindred post an application
and contact Corlagar in game. </p>
<p>.Flag and Key Requirements: (Focus: Elemental Planes) <br>
  1. Must be EP flagged. We have had an influx of new recruits and any apps will
    need to be fully EP flagged at this time. Recruitment requirements will change
    as we need players. <br>
  2. Must have DoN and OOW expansions or be planning to get them in the near
future.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mazters-fault.com/forum/content.php" target="_blank">Evolutia</a><br>
&quot;REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCEPTED INTO EVOLUTIA: </p>
<p>Lvl 70 <br>
  250 AA minimum required for ALL classes, including Run5 (see below for class
    specific AA's) </p>
<p>Time Flag <br>
  KodTaz Flag <br>
  Full Insignia Case (Anguish AE Blocker quest) COMPLETE </p>
<p>Qvic Flag HIGHLY recommended <br>
  Epic 1.5 HIGHLY recommended </p>
<p>Alcohol Tolerance @ 200 REQUIRED </p>
<p>You may apply prior to meeting these requirements but you will not be formally
  eligible to be voted into Evolutia until the requirements are met. We suggest
  that you actively pursue getting groups for Tipt and Vxed; reflags for Rhondo
  are sometimes done on the weekends in off raid hours as well, but be prepared
to do sewers trials in lieu of this.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.finaldooreq.com/" target="_blank">Final Door</a><br>
  &quot;Final Door is a progressive raiding guild that was established near the beginning
  of the Stromm server. Our focus is on maintaining a fun environment as we progress
  on a light raid schedule. We are currently in Tacvi, still clearing time and
  farming Qvic. Final Door is not in a hurry. We compete only with ourselves
  and the twisted minds of EQ devs. Raiding in FD is voluntary, though, highly
  encouraged. Our loot system is DKP and is based strictly upon attendance. Everyone
  has equal opportunity to develop their character with Final Door. Of course,
  the important stuff is seeing new things with friends and watching the gnomes
implode. </p>
<p>Conduct is very important to our membership. Cheating by use of third party
  software and exploits is grounds for removal and immediate termination of applications.
  If you use this stuff dump it before applying. Some members have used show
  EQ for tracking purposes only since before the guilds creation. This is not
  encouraged among applicants. Most show EQ stuff is cause for stoning, excommunication
  etc. If you have a bad reputation and or don't play well with others Final
  Door is probably not a good choice. </p>
<p>Final Door does not persue Epics as a guild. We have a limited raid schedule
  and prioritize targets that are aimed at guild progression as a whole. Our
  core loot philosophy is about equal opportunity for character development as
  we move through content. Leadership does not schedule raids around a single
  member. An exception in the past to this was cleric clickers which were needed
  for efficient raid recovery. Many of our players have achieved their epics
  through member run raids. However, if your epic is game, or, guildbreaking
  for you then do not apply. </p>
<p>Joining Final Door takes a little time. We are people rather than performance
  driven. However, we are a raiding guild and need folks to carry their weight.
  Final Door is about a happy, team oriented membership. That is the real challenge
  for guilds in EQ imo. All other things come in time. </p>
<p>Our main focus at present is Tacvi, Anguish and DoN. We use a DKP based loot
system, which you will reap the benefit of for the effort you put in.<br>
<br>
  Our current raiding schedule is: <br>
  Wednesday and Friday at 7PM EST <br>
Saturday and Sunday at 4PM EST </p>
<p>Due to the content we're currently raiding, we are subject to 54 man instances.
  With our ever-increasing raid force, it sometimes means applicants will have
to sit out, due to raids being full. </p>
<p>We are NOT actively looking for any applicants at the moment. <br>
  We do, however, a bard, a few clerics, and enchanters would be welcome to play
with us. </p>
<p>Due to the 54-man constraints and our increased raid force, we&#8217;re now
  implementing a wait-list system. This means that applicants of a low need class
  will be screened by the officers to decide whether or not the applicant is
  of a sufficient level to warrant being put into our normal procedure. If an
  applicant of a low need class meets our requirements but does not show any
  exceptional qualities, the officers may decide to &#8220;wait-list&#8221; the
  applicant until the guild has extra room. </p>
<p>An applicant may also be waitlisted if Final Door currently has a strong active
  playing force of that class or class type.<br>
Our application process is NEVER closed to a qualified, exceptional applicant.<br>
  If you are interested in applying, please contact a recruitment officer in
game to have your application considered. </p>
<p>We want our applicants to be a minimum of level 70, with 200 aa's, which include
specific class aa's as shown below. </p>
<p>We seek players with EXTENSIVE raiding experience. </p>
<p>We prefer applicants to be Kod&#8217;Taz, Qvic, and Texvu flagged if at all
  possible. </p>
<p>All applicants will need to obtain the signets in order to enter Anguish. </p>
<p>If you do not have the Kod&#8217;Taz flag or Anguish signets at the time of
  your application, you must have both completed prior to your vote at the end
of your applicant trial period (3 weeks).&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://havensedge.us/" target="_blank">Haven's Edge</a><br>
  &quot;We are currently focusing on High End GoD and OoW content, therefore being
flagged for these zones is a huge plus. </p>
<p>Raids: We are a raiding guild on Eastern Standard time. We raid from approximately
  6pm to midnight or later nightly. We have attendance requirements for both
  applicants and full members. All attendance is recorded in the dkp section
  of our website and all full and trial members should have access to this. Attendance
  requirement for applicants currently is 50% raid attendance, and full members
  40%. Any applicant not meeting the attendance requirements at the end of their
  trial period will be asked to deguild. If you wish to be a part of us you will
  need to re-apply when you can commit more time to raiding. We are looking for
  members that want to log in and raid on a regular basis, therefore please don't
  expect the minimum to impress most of our members. As an applicant you will
  be invited to join raids if you are flagged for the zones we are raiding. You
  are considered a guest and we expect you to conduct yourself as such. All raids
  are required, if you are online you MUST attend. You are expected to drop everything
  you are doing and get to the raid ASAP. No whining about your LDON record that
  no one cares about. Listen to the raid leader at all times. No one should be
chatting in the raid channel, so keep anything non-raid specific to other channels. </p>
<p>Gear: Our gear requirements are pretty simple. You are required to have a
  permanent enduring breath item, a shrink device (or spell), and all characters
  should have a means to self invis and self gate. For server transfer applicants,
  because geared transfers are available, we will not accept naked applicants.
We also require that you have at a minimum 100 to all resists unbuffed. </p>
<p>Flags: We are currently raiding High End GoD and OoW raiding zones. We will
  attempt to flag you for Time however do not expect us to flag you for elementals.
  Two thirds of the KT flag can be gotten with a single group, and the other
  third if you are persistant..therefore do not expect us to hold your hand thru
these events. </p>
<p>Alternate Characters: We do ask to know if you have any &quot;main&quot; alternate
  characters that you play frequently so that contacting you will be easier.
  We currently do not flag alternate characters of applicants or trials and please
do not expect any loot for your bots.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.evilonstromm.com/forum/" target="_blank">Necessary Evil</a><br>
  &quot;We are currently taking anyone who is 60+ and looking for a home. If you would
  like to still be a family guild but like to raid, this is the place for you.We
  are pushing all members to achieve level 70. We also will be running off a
  DKP system. We will be doing a ton of backflagging soon so if you think flags
  are an issue, they are not. Of course, the more flags you have, the better.
  This is not a daycare and drama will not be tolerated, so please leave it at
  home. I know not all of us are adults, but please contend yourself in a mannerable
way. </p>
<p>We do NOT tolerate KSing,training,ninja looting, or abusive play to others
in game. If you are caught doing so, immediate action will be taken.&quot;</p>

    &quot;PoW is a family orientated guild. A guild where its members are willing
    to help each other out when the opportunity arises. A place where you are
    treated
with respect as a person, as well as a player. </p>
<p>PoW is a guild where there are no restrictions on your time, nor are you required
  to participate in any guild functions. This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed,
  and we see your time as your own. </p>
<p>No player is denied membership; we are willing to discover you as you discover
  us. If the &quot;fit&quot; isn't right, we can accept that PoW might not be
  the right guild for you. If you decide to leave, leave knowing that our hopes
  go with you in your quest for the right guild.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://subliminalrealm.net/SR_flash_072705_content.html" target="_blank">Subliminal
Realm</a><br>
&quot;Thank you for your interest in Subliminal Realm! If you haven't figured it out
by now, we like to think that SR is a bit different from other raiding guilds
on Stromm. Instead of viewing this as reason to take a stance like, &quot;OMG
we gotta catch up and quick&quot;, we like to think that it makes us stronger
in the end: members know when we are going to raid, members know they are needed,
members stay pretty fresh, and members are able to make time for the modest raiding
on a consistent basis. This strength has been shown itself in our record so far:
we were tagged as SR on July 17th, 2004, and proceeded to conquer Vex Thal and
reach PoP Elemental Planes within 6 months while raiding only 3 days a week.
June 23, 2005, we reached our next goal: Plane of Time. We've continued our success
with the death of Quarm on July 12, 2005 and we are now preparing for our entrance
into GoD. </p>
<p>And yet, I still don't consider SR a casual raiding guild if we are going
  to be able to continue progressing. We expect the vast majority of our members
  to be consistent players that develop their character to fit the content that
  we have on the horizon. 4 days a week are made available for character development.
  When we recruit for a roster position, we expect that the player will uphold
  his side of this bargain while choosing how to do so. At the same time, we
  do consider RL situations to be important factors in playtime that cannot be
  foreseen. If you make us aware of what is going on, I have not seen a RL situation
  that cannot be endured. If we are forced to recruit a replacement, please be
  aware that you might suddenly find yourself without a guild tag, but feel free
  to re-apply in the future when your situation can support the needs of the
  guild. </p>
<p>From Day 1, I have desired to build a guild that starts from near-scratch
  in raid content and grows on its own toil rather than on the coattails of uber
  toons that have been recycling through the content that EQ has to offer. I
  have desired to work through most, if not all, of the content while enjoying
  the ride with good friends. I attend raids so that I won't miss out on attending
  something that our group has been working for rather than whether I might miss
out on DKP or on a certain piece of loot that might drop. </p>
<p>SR raids Tuesday &amp; Thursday evenings 7pm - midnight EST, and Sundays 4pm
  - midnight EST. There are occasional non-DKP raids throughout the week, but
our official raid times are those listed. </p>
<p>If you are online you are expected to be there. Not attending raids while
  online and able to attend leads to guild removal. Please ask officer permission
if you have a special circumstance, so we are aware of it. </p>
<p>We are a recently Time flagged guild, currently farming Time &amp; OoW &amp; beginning
  to work on GoD content. We raid 3 days a week and exp/quest together on off-days.
We help each other out with epics as well, especially epic 1.5s. </p>
<p>Who we're looking for: </p>
<p>We want players dedicated to our style of play. We keep the guild small, raiding
  only 3 days a week and maximizing our raid time. We are focused when we raid
  and accomplish a lot. We are skilled players with real lives. We put a heavy
  emphasis on attending to real life as well as enjoying our EQ experience. </p>
<p>Our focus is Time, OoW, DoN and GoD. </p>
<p>Maturity and a good sense of humor are required. You need to be able to take
  a beating and keep on ticking. </p>
<p>We also put a high value on those willing to work on their character outside
  of raid times - four days a week are given for character development on your
  own time and terms. Please ask for recommendations regarding which AAs are
  needed by SR for your class on raids. </p>
<p>Raid times: Tues &amp; Thurs 7pm - 12am EST, Sundays 4pm - 12am EST. Being
  on time is rewarded with higher earned DKP. </p>
<p>Please do not apply unless you feel that you can make the majority of our
  raid times. We require 60%+ attendance from applicants at a MINIMUM! (IE Approx.
  2 raid days a week+.) In order to continue to progress &amp; keep our raid
  times low, we require attendance to be high. </p>
<p>Class Requirements<br>
  - Run 3 <br>
- EB, Shrink, Invis, Gate, Insta Clicky </p>
<p>Applicants must be level 70 w/ Minimum 100 AAs. Tipt trial done is a bonus.
No other flags requested at this time. &quot;</p>

Revolution</a><br>
&quot;Welcome, recently Underground Revolution has made some advancements and changes
that have required us to begin an application process. If you meet the criterion
feel free to apply to our guild. Below are a few expectaions of our new family
members and a few of the rules that will apply to you as a new member:</p>
<p>~ You must be Level 62 or higher.<br>
  ~ You must have all expansions<br>
  ~ You must have completed a Plane of Justice trial and the Plane of Storms
  key to the Bastion of Thunder.<br>
~ A hedge run is not required but is prefered.<br>
<br>
  UR is currently flagging in 3 areas and we are on a need before greed system
until all the meberes are on an even playing field as far as gear.</p>
<p>You must be willing to attend our raids. We raid three nights a week; non-mandatory
  Tuesdays will be mostly epic parts, Thursdays are Planes of Power flagging
  events and Sundays are TBA unless a need arises.</p>
<p>You will also need to include a link to your Magelo in your application. This
  will give us an idea of your gear/AA/flag needs and any flags you may possess.</p>
<p>Once a week or depending on need an officer review will address candidates
  and a recruiter will contact you regaurding your application. This may be a
  request for more info, your acceptance, or your rejection. Some people may
  be expidited through the application process based on need and qualifying traits.</p>
<p>All of this may seem complex but I have geared far too many toons in the past
  only to have them wave goodbye after they recieved what they wanted.</p>
<p>Upon your acceptance you will be required to read and reply to the guild and
  raid rules threads in the members forums.</p>
<p>Grouping with our members during the application process can be beneficial
  to you in our final decision making.</p>
<p>If you do not meet the requirements listed above but still have the same vision
  as we do you may also apply to our lower level guild Squires of the Lost Souls.
  This is where veteran players work with new players to help them achieve the
  requirements of the main guild. Players level 55+ move up to UR unless they
  joined the guild at a level higer than 55 in which case there is a two month
probabtion period, or until you meet the regular UR requirements.&quot;</p>
