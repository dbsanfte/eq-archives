<br><span class="pageheader">The Catalyst, Part 4</span>
<br>By <a href="mailto:">Jordan Thomas</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-10-2004</b> - 
Chapter 4:
<br>
<br>“The shadow factor is rarely recorded by the bards and sages of an era. Common folk believe in the grandiose and the straightforward. The legendary events of the past are always sung in the simplest possible terms. What they fail to mention is that heroes and villains are typically prodded to action by forces which cannot be morally classified…” - From Shades of Gray, the Memoirs of Modus Operandi Sundown on Faydwer. The day gave way once more to the birth of an evening. Like the introduction to a dream, the twilight trickled in. The great trees of the Faydark cast seemingly endless shadows across the loam below, and an eerie calm pervaded the area. In the dark corners of the woods, nestled in their branches and burrows, the animals beheld a grim scene. Two High Elven children, far from home. Their skin was like living ivory - pale, but not pallid. They seemed to glow with life. Nervous smiles, and soft steps. A boy and a girl, barely twelve winters old. “Sssh, Iliya,” hissed the boy, with a sly grin. “You know there could be brownies about. They’d roast your bones, as soon as look at you.” “You jump at squirrel patter,” Iliya retorted. She made a face, and tried not to appear afraid. She knew that Kalindel would tease her even more if she shivered. “We’ve got to get home quickly, or Mama Mels will make us sorry.” Kalindel grinned at her again, and the kept walking. They were out far later than was allowed by Mels, their live-in gnomish nursemaid. At night, the Faydark could be quite frightening, even with Elven eyes, which could sense heat. Both children had heard the stories of creatures that didn’t produce heat, and it excited them even as it terrified. Fifty paces behind them, terror followed. The three Teir’dal were living shadows, it seemed. Dark elves were adept at blending their own heat signatures into almost any terrain. Just as one of them stepped forward, his form melted once again into the night. All three wore the fixated stare of predatory intention. Six red eyes, three dark blades. The Elven whelps would never even see their doom. Catalyst was the third in the trio. He had never really been sent on a raid before, and while his skills were certainly up to this ‘challenge’, he wondered silently why the Council would order a surface attack of so few warriors. The only true covert actions he heard about were conducted by an entire battalion. Still, that mattered little. Any High Elves in the wilderness were to die tonight, by order of House Zu’karr. They had been sent by teleportation from Neriak, via Castle Mistmoore, and Catalyst felt somewhat ill. His head hurt, badly. He couldn’t shake free of an odd scraping whine in his brain. He thought he heard - Yes! Rip them apart, for the sake of my kindred! Tear them limb from - Catalyst almost lost pace. Where in the Hells had that come from? He shook his head, and refocused on the prey ahead. Still, it had been an odd thought. Catalyst normally felt nothing, no hate and no love. Recently however, he had been subjected to a bizarre ritual by his holder, the priestess Aniyal. Something had been put inside him, but what? His memory was fading now, and he could not understand why. Tear them limb from - This time Catalyst did fall behind, clutching his head. The voice was so overpowering, so filled with bloodlust. He couldn’t shake the feeling of rage welling inside him, despite his confusion. His compatriots turned and regarded him with annoyance. One of them, a hateful assassin named Mel’kul, scowled at him savagely. Catalyst knew what that look implied. Lag back again, and the surface scum will not be alone in their demise. Something was happening. The Elven children were slowing down. They seemed to be lost. Catalyst and his fellow hunters froze. While his two allies remained fixated on the prey, Catalyst looked around to their flanks and rear. The situation was wrong, somehow. He heard breathing nearby, and it wasn’t the muted inhalation of his band. He peered into the dark knot of trees behind them, and then he saw them. Seven or eight sets of shining Elven eyes, staring back at him. Stalking the stalkers. Catalyst’s throat seized up and his skin prickled, as a single word formed in his mind: Ambush! From the trees all around came the howling of the High Elves. In mere seconds, the soundless woods exploded forth with the fury of the Elven warriors. They were everywhere, it seemed. Between dead stumps. Under some desiccated foliage. From the shadows of a mighty oak. Their cries of alert interleaved with the shriek of steel being drawn. In the blink of an eye, Catalyst and his companions had been utterly surrounded with Elven blades and Elven faces, full of loathing. One of them stood forth, clad in gleaming chainmail. On his chest shone the symbol of Mithaniel Marr, and he radiated a glow of valor, somehow. His pale, handsome face reflected nothing but disgust. “You will not die here,” he offered, matter-of-factly. “You will be interrogated before the Seven Seats, and then you will meet a quick end, though it is far more than you deserve.” For a moment, nobody said anything. Most of the elves appeared revolted even to look upon the Teir’dal child-stalkers. Catalyst’s removed consciousness noted the tranquil noises of the Faydark nightbirds. Presently, the two children in question approached, and looked up to the mail-clad commander in awe. His stern gaze swung down upon them. “You two, get home now. Old Mels will be worried sick about the both of you. I’ll not be surprised if she gives you triple chores on the morrow,” he said. The kids scampered off, murmuring “Yes, Lord Maluril,” and the paladin turned his baleful glare back to his prisoners. Catalyst, for his part, was not afraid. Perhaps death at the hands of these self-righteous people would be more peaceful than that which he would find in Neriak. His two companions apparently did not share his propensity for quiet acceptance. Mel’kul growled, “Innoruuk consume you all,” and tried to bring his jagged blade up for a strike. The other hunter, a minor warrior of some sort, followed his lead and went for his dirk. The High Elf in front of them didn’t even flinch. The sound of bowstrings twanged in the darkness. In terrible synchronicity, the two Teir’dal sank to their knees with arrows in their eyes. Another pregnant silence, and the corpses toppled face-first onto the cold ground. Maluril never took his eyes off Catalyst. When Catalyst’s expression did not change, the High Elf shrugged, and raised one hand. “This one will return to the Council, and by my honor, he’ll answer for their dark intent. Bind him!” Four Elven warriors roughly grasped Catalyst’s limbs, and began to securely truss him with thick leather cord. The pain in his head was intensifying. Then, out of nowhere, he heard it again, No! Let ye not be bound, tear them apart where they stand! Let not a treacherous Highborn live to - The voice stopped just as suddenly, with another pulse of agony between his temples. This time, it was clear. Catalyst knew he wasn’t simply hearing things. Whatever his Teir’dal ‘family’ had done to him, he now had a dark presence inside his psyche. He remembered an image that flashed into his mind during the ritual. No, not an image… a desire. An axe, soaked in blood. A shadowy madman, standing atop a pile of Elven bodies. “Move, scum,” hissed one of Catalyst’s guards, and backhanded him across the face. It stung, distantly, but Catalyst wasn’t interested. He glanced at his escort, who stared back in distaste. None of the other elves were exhibiting any signs of pity, either. Catalyst yawned, rather pointedly. A spear-butt prodded his spine, and he stumbled forward, marching back to Felwithe. * * * She was beautiful, Modus had no doubt of that. Dark Elven nobility. Skin like soft onyx, and eyes like a pair of candle-flames. Aniyal, her seneschal had called her. Aniyal Zu’karr, first daughter of the House Zu’karr. The priestess was stunning, even amongst the often-comely Teir’dal. And yet, she made him uneasy. This meeting was unorthodox, a quiet interlude in such a low chamber of Freeport’s undertunnels. Modus and his Unseen mercenaries were used to strange employers, but even with ten of his finest men for backup, the Teir’dal princess shook his composure. She gave off a sort of aura; a dangerous ambiance that Modus knew his men could feel. It felt somewhat akin to standing physically close to an unpredictable friend, never sure if they’re going to begin shouting angrily or laughing in joy. Modus consciously kept his hands on the hilts of his twin rapiers. He wanted this priestess to know that she’d not find the Unseen to be easy prey, if things went sour. “You are Modus Operandi, “ she stated, smiling. “The mercenary.” “That I am. Why have you summoned us here,” asked Modus. Her grin was not comforting. “It is a strange name indeed. More akin to an action than a title, no? Very unique, yes,” purred the priestess, in her odd accent. She was obviously avoiding the issue at hand, and Modus knew it. “It is merely an adaptation for the sake of anonymity. Now,” Modus growled, “What do you want of the Unseen?” “I am Aniyal Zu’karr,” she announced, formally. “I am a representative of the house who recently attempted to have you removed.” Modus was taken aback. His men snapped into battle stances, ready to shed blood for their silent leader. A single drip of water resounded in the subsequent silence. The half-elven mercenary turned to look at his guards for a moment, then waved his hand. After all, if the priestess meant to attack, she would have already. Blades were sheathed, but his men did not relax. He didn’t blame them. Not two weeks prior, a Teir’dal wizard had attempted to slay Modus in his own den, the hideout called Smoke and Mirrors. The dark elf had been an ally - almost a friend. Someone had paid him well. And that someone was now standing directly in front of him, with several armed guards. Smiling, no less. It occurred to Modus that many males had likely died, looking at that sweet face. “And to what do I owe your present amiability? A change of heart, perhaps,” Modus smirked. “Your wizard was equipped with a small arsenal of usable items, so there are no hard feelings, I assure you.” Aniyal grinned even wider. She looked like a snake, somehow. Even at ease, she seemed to sway hypnotically. Still, Modus persisted in acting the mongoose. “You were made aware of House Zu’karr’s plans by that foolish girl, Syse’chenia. She is an outcast, a fallen priestess. She will not live long, even in the relative sanctity of Rivervale, I assure you.” Modus frowned. “Somehow I doubt you’ll guess the new name she’s taken on. It is even less appropriate, to my mind, than her decision to leave,” he snickered, quietly. “In any event, I was told very little. You sought to eliminate me over that?” “You were a threat,” Aniyal stated, bluntly. “But I think perhaps your group would be more useful working for House Zu’karr. I have a … schedule which must be kept, and I would pay you well to play a part. I’ve no wish to divert my attention to loose ends.” “Flattering,” Modus grunted. “What exactly do you want from me, Kalsa’mer? I am at your service.” Aniyal snorted at his sarcastic use of the old tongue for Supreme Elf, and began to pace about in front of him. She took her time, seemingly examining the rough stone which surrounded them. Modus remained on edge, waiting for this creature to finish her games. As she swept about dramatically, the mercenary’s careful eye caught a strange mark on her exposed back. The rune seemed to shimmer, burning in his brain. And then he remembered what it was. The sigil of Innoruuk, prince of hate. He was reminded of a motto that a superstitious Freeport seaman had told him: To defy the lord of hatred is to die as the object of his wrath. Before he could foolishly comment on the tattoo, Aniyal spun back to face him. Before he knew it, she was whispering in his ear, heedless of his ready blades. She smelled wonderful. Despite the dubious nature of the task she detailed, Modus knew refusal was not an option. * * * Catalyst’s mind swam, and his vision blurred. He sat alone in a small prison cell, awaiting High Elven justice. Every fold in his brain seemed to crackle and char, and he gripped his head in his hands. As he stared at the floor, he thought he saw the moss begin to creep between the cracks in the stone, dancing in arcane patterns. His own silver hair danced and lashed about his neck, and his skin seemed to bubble. Catalyst knew he must be losing his mind. He stared wildly about at the walls, which now seemed to be only inches from each side of his body. They pulsed at him, warping weirdly inward. Something dark was laughing at him - he could hear it, chuckling inside his body. He screamed, long and loud until his larynx gave up, screwing his eyes shut. A few moments later, he opened them again, terrified of what he would see. All was as before. The walls, the bars, the cold. It was a cell, nothing more. The pounding in his temples had not subsided, though. He could feel that dark voice inside him. It was the voice of vengeance… a pure hatred, like nothing he had ever felt personally. At least, not quite. The more Catalyst thought about it, the more he realized that he had begun to hate Aniyal for what she had done to him. She’d made him dance for years as a soulless puppet, a helpless torturer of whomever she wished. But his hate had never been like this. It was as if the bizarre voice was accompanied by something else, another presence. It seemed not to matter now, trapped as he was in the prison of his surface cousins. The caverns of Neriak were always so warm compared to this place, and he shivered at the change. The highborn guards had stripped him of all but his underclothes. He stood, and shook himself to generate a little warmth. His head still hurt, but it was clear enough to observe his surroundings. His breath caught in his lungs as he noticed something new. There was someone in the cell with him. In a darkened corner, a rag-clad figure sat hunched over. The shadows played eerily over him, never quite revealing his face. He looked like a dirty halfling, or a sinister brownie, or even maybe a dark-skinned gnome, at times. Catalyst didn’t know how long he had stood and stared, before his voice finally came to him. “Who are you,” Catalyst rasped, and the figure broke into peals of high-pitched laughter, rocking back and forth. Finally, its cackling came to a stop, and it looked up at him. Catalyst still couldn’t make out the face. “I’m a surprise, sonny,” it said. Even in speaking, the bizarre being seemed to be giggling. “Just like ye are. Ye know you’re the final joke? You’re a-gonna set ‘em all on their ears, and I’ll be one of old Cazicky’s whores if it’s nae gonna be hilarious.” Catalyst simply gaped. He didn’t know what to say. That didn’t seem to bother the odd little creature though, because it kept rambling. “Aye, ye’re nae going to be bound down here long, boy. One of my whelps is on his way ‘ta break ya free…though I did nae send him myself. Funny thing is, he calls himself an atheist. Don’t that just tickle ye? “Anyway, I want ta make sure ya give the whole world a hotfoot before...well, before it begins. Just remember to stay small, like me. Ye’ll never be able to fool the High and Mighties of the world if you’re out in the open. Just look at me! Ye’d never expect who I am, lookin’ at me. Wouldya?” “Er, who exactly are you? You did not answer me,” Catalyst said, still somewhat uncertain. This felt like a dream, somehow unreal. Then again, his life seemed to be a dream, of late. “O-oh, boy, I cannae say my name to ya, when I’m like this! It’s against the rules, doncha know. Just think of me as ‘da one who tricks the rest of ‘em, up there…and laughs at their politics.” The jolly little prisoner turned his gaze skyward for a moment, and then cackled again. “Anyway,” it went on, “I just wanted to see ye for myself, before everything gets ta goin’. And to offer ye this advice. In just a few shakes of a lamb’s tail, I’ve got to go out and pretend I care about the affairs of the world, and take a stand along with the rest of ‘em. But between ye and me, I’d rather none of this had ta happen at all. Kind of like ye, I’m caught in the middle. But bein’ the poor sap who’s in-between things has its advantages, doncha know.” The figure reached into its rags, and pulled free a small wrapped box, like the presents that human families bestowed upon each other during festivals. It handed the package to Catalyst, and then stood up swiftly. “Remember,” the small creature grunted, “The use of this lil’ surprise will become clear when ye need it. Like I said, someone else already took care o’ getting ye outta this mess. Just ye wait. Yer destiny is just so incredibly funny.” With that, the ragman pulled a large stone from the wall of the cell, and slipped through, into the shadows. Its shrill laughter lingered for a moment, then faded. Catalyst stood numbly for a moment, regarding the brightly colored package. It was an excellent exhibit of evidence that his poor mind was intact. He shrugged, and slipped it into his dirty, padded undervest. Resolute now, he strode over to where the creature had disappeared, and confirmed that there was no missing block of stone, nor any cracks in the wall of the cell. He didn’t have long to muse upon that, though. His keen dark Elven ears picked up the clanking of platemail boots in the halls nearby. For elves, these highborn seemed to make a lot of noise. “Teir’dal. Stand and be addressed,” rang a smooth voice from behind him. Catalyst slowly turned around. Standing outside his cell were two of the Tual-thilis, the Felwithe elite guard. They glared at him in open hostility. As Catalyst looked upon them, the pain in his head surged forth. The voice inside him screamed, BETRAYERS! VENGEANCE ON YOU ALL! “Come,” growled the guard. “The Seven Seats have assembled, and you are to be interrogated before them. The Treelords of Kelethin have arrived as guests to see you as well, darkling. I do not imagine you will live much longer, when they are through questioning-“ The guard’s gloating was cut off. Bands of silken cloth had appeared around the necks of both warriors, and the frantic elves were struggling to tear them free. Catalyst watched, impassive, and they sank to their knees and went unconscious, revealing the attackers right behind them. Two black-clad humans stood there, smiling. One male, and one female. They were lithe and dangerous looking, covered in throwing-knife belts and other odd implements. One plucked a key from the taller guard’s belt, and popped open the cell door. From the shadows of the prison block, several more rogues appeared. All had hard faces, professional faces. They looked at Catalyst impartially, totally without compassion or judgment. He was an objective to them. Strangely, he was becoming comfortable with that. From their midst, one man glided forward on light feet, his ears slightly pointed, but not fully. A half-breed. Smirking, he clasped Catalyst by the arm, and patted him on the back in greeting. It was almost a hug of relief, oddly enough. “I am called Modus Operandi,” the rogue stated, his hands returning to the hilts of twin rapiers. “We have been contracted to release you by Aniyal Zu’karr. Apparently, she dislikes the idea of her prize cooped up in this pigeon cage, but she gave no instructions as to where you are to be taken. You are free to go, where ever you…” Modus trailed off, and stepped back. Catalyst had begun to convulse. Something was definitely wrong. The dark elf was shaking from head to toe, his face a mask of pain. His slender black hands were jammed against his eyes, and a terrible noise burst forth from his throat. Soon, Modus and his men started to quaver and groan as well. They had been set up! The Teir’dal bitch meant to have this thing kill them all! The mercenaries were driven to their knees, made to crumple and cower by the force in the air, a dark arrival which each of them could sense. Modus forced his eyes up to look at the dark elf. Catalyst was violently shaking now. The air around everyone seemed to warp and twist, until everything looked distorted, and garish. Perspectives made no sense, as angles blurred into curves, and waves. Modus blinked rapidly, and continued to watch as a liquid-black cloud of something dribbled out of the aether, converging on the Teir’dal. He could see something seeping out and surrounding Catalyst’s body. Another form was there, an intangible being composed of sickly light. It was a dwarven face, a face of utter rage. It overlaid Catalyst’s contorted features, and opened his mouth by sheer power of will. The gibbering noise Catalyst was producing became a shriek, then a scream … then a deep bellow. The sound lost all recognizable pauses, and twisted into an unending call of anger. The dark hybrid looked down on the mercenary with murderous intention, still wailing. Still unable to move much, Modus covered his ears and looked away. He felt strong hands ripping away some of the numerous weapons on his body, and then the patter of feet, rushing off into the darkness. When Modus opened his eyes, his first instinct was to check his own belongings. A few blades were missing, but he still had the small, brightly-wrapped box. Modus was a thief to the core, and could not resist pickpocketing, by instinct. When he had greeted the dark elf, he quickly swiped the intriguing package while checking for anything dangerous. Still lying belly-down on the floor, the mercenary tugged at the flashy ribbon and opened the box.
