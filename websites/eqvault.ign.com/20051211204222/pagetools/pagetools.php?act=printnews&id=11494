Almost every person on the development team was present in the SOE conference room to talk with the EverQuest representatives.<br><br>Craig Knapp, EQ Producer, chaired the sessions.  Much of the first hour was taken up with talking about what progression is in EverQuest, and how different people interpret what is "fun" in the game.  The development team appreciates that a level 70 without Alternate Advancement points is not the same character as a level 70 with alternate advancement points.   It was brought up that some players requested the number of AA's a character has to be part of the LFG tool.  The group had a lively discussion about what the implications of that would be, including the pros and cons of such a system.  It was suggested by Holly, an EQ designer, that this kind of labeling would limit the way people could progress with their characters, making one track of play style required for group play and narrowing focus to one style of character.  On the other hand, player representatives brought up that if someone is 70 with no AA, they may not be capable of being a productive member of a group because they don't have the scope and power of an AA wielding character.  AA does indicate the appropriateness of play up to 70.  It was suggested by the development team that perhaps you should not be able to level to 70 without having some minimum AA, but of course that was not possible to do with the current system.  Requiring AA as well as level progression would slow down overall progression as well.  No conclusion was reached, although the end of the discussion brought out the idea that there might be a label for a minimum number of AA, such as 100, that could show up on a character profile when looking for a group.<br><br>One issue that always comes up when you get a large number of intelligent EQ players in a room is the discussion breaks off into many small discussions when an interesting topic comes up, as everyone turns to his or her neighbor with their take on the whole discussion, and soon the whole room is buzzing with small conversations.  Craig did a good job of keeping people focused on a number of occasions when this happened and on topic so he could take notes for the development team to consider after the summit.  He also tried to make sure that the original questioner, who usually had comments from the class boards, got his comments and questions in.<br><br>The development team spent some time talking about how to progress in EverQuest, specifically how interaction with other players and the formation of friendships and alliances which includes involving new players to the game is of key importance.  They know that interaction with new players through older, more experienced players is what helps new players learn how to play the game more efficiently, so they will continue to faciliate features that allow new players to play together with veteran players.   The tutorial, which they are improving again, has gone a long way to improving the newbie experience, and shrouds are designed to let veteran players interact with players of a lower level.<br><br>The death penalty in the game is also something that the dev team is taking a look at recently.  Nothing concrete was discussed in terms of changes, but they wanted the player opinions on what they thought was a fair death penalty for various levels of play.  <br><br>When the group was asked about how they felt about the current Alternate Advancement abilities, no one had anything much to say, so the team and the players concluded we could move on from that issue.<br><br>A discussion of the progression from level ten to fifty was next on the agenda.  Lost Dungeon of Norrath missions, they feel, are an excellent way to progress along those levels, but there is an issue with the point spread that they feel should be addressed.  Zajeerr said he was going to look into reworking the 20-55 point system in LDoN, although the point allocations are going to remain the same and point accumulations will stay as they are now.  They want the players to experience most of the content, not just one adventure zone or mission.  They dev team hopes to design encounters that make the journey from level 20 -50 interesting even if there aren't the same numbers of new players as in years past.<br><br>The definition of "fun" made for a lively few minutes of conversation among the attendees and the dev team.  Sometimes the development team can't tell what will be fun and what will not, because fun is a very personal and subjective thing.  Sometimes "fun" is being able to get 2.5 AA's per hour in a mission -- and when the mission is fixed to give a smaller and more intended amout of experience, it isn't fun to play it anymore.  Other missions are just fun to play because of the dynamic of the design.  Content versus progression is the key to what is fun in the game.  The developers want you to enjoy the content and the journey along the way.  It is frustrating for them when they design content and only 5% of it is used, so they are working on designing zones and encounters that make it worth while for players to enjoy while working on character progression.   MMO's have no end -- although they have an end game -- and the devs want the players to enjoy the journey rather than striving for the end content so single-mindedly they miss the content in the middle (or even the end) of the game.<br><br>The developers also consider what you are doing when you are playing to be of importance.  If you are watching TV and surfing the net while playing EQ, then clearly the game isn't catching your interest the way they would like it to.  The writers and developers of EQ want you to be looking at the screen when you play, which means they have to make it worth your time to pay attention.  Although most players aren't hard core role players, developers write the lore so that the game makes sense and gives a feeling of continuity and depth to the world of Norrath, in turn helping promote the feeling of interest and immersion during encounters.<br><br>I talked on Saturday evening to a developer who writes the high end raid content.  He writes raid encounters that give a role to every class, and tries to vary it so each person feels important in the group effort because they bring something to the raid.  This idea of getting away from the "holy trinity" of cleric, warrior and crowd controller is something the devs are aware of and are trying to mitigate to some extent with encounter designs.  <br><br>The discussion moved on to giving more melee disciplines to a wider range of levels.  This it turns out is quite difficult and isn't the same as changing spells to be available at a wider range of levels.<br><br>Out of combat regeneration of mana and endurance was a hot topic of conversation.  Rashere explained that EQ doesn't really have an "out of combat" state, so it doesn't work to have mana regen work that way.  They understand that mana regen separates various characters in combat, but they are hesistant to reduce downtime to the extent that it would trivialize six years of combat encounters by making them too easy.  They want you to sit down and regen to some extent, but they are looking into the amount of time it takes to regenerate endurance.<br><br><br>Part Three of this report will concern the new expansion, Depths of Darkhollow and the discussions that came out of that roundtable.<br><br><br><br>  </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 2 October, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11494">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=11494</a><br>Printed On: Sun Dec 11 12:42:22 PST 2005<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
