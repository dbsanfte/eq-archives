<br><span class="pageheader">Silent Agreement Pt 1</span>
<br>By <a href="mailto:avalonb@yahoo.com">Avalon</a>
<hr noshade/></p>
<b>07-21-2004</b> - 
<P>
Silence kept his head bowed.  His mind was as toned as the rest of his body, and as such, he kept his discipline about himself at all times.  His master had not requested that he raise his head yet, so he did not.
<p>Silence’s body was a firm muscular sculpture; his scales had been hardened to an almost rock like quality.  His skills honed to razor sharp deadliness.  He was a monk, a chosen one of Cazic-Thule.  Cazic-Thule had instilled the monk spirit into the Iksar, and given some a purpose.  Silence’s purpose was to be a monk; this was his caste.
<p>The master made a noise, like a grunt, that signaled for the monks to raise their heads.  He could now see all that was going on around him.  The master was explaining how important discipline was, and how Cazic-Thule had given them the ability to crush their enemies and to make them feel pain in new ways.  How they would strike fear into all other races through their God given abilities.
<p>This was all old news to Silence, but he listened attentively anyway, as was his place.  Every word, every syllable, that came from his master’s mouth was considered precious in his mind, so disciplined was he.
<p>The master made another grunting sound, the monks jumped to their feet and bowed to the master, he made another noise, one like a hiss, and they all left.  As Silence was leaving, the master called him over.
<p>“Silence, you are my prized pupil, I see you as I see my own children.  You have given me great pride that there are some worthy of the title and abilities our God has bestowed upon us.  Do not fail me; I have something for you to do.  I need you to go to the enemy’s city and report back to me what you see there.  We have heard of something being brought there.  The dark ones told us, for some reason they think that if they help us, we will make an exception of them when we enslave them.  How foolish.  Will you do this for me?” The master’s voice was a whispering hiss.  He was an old Iksar, but still very powerful.
<p>Silence’s only reply was to nod his head in assent.  He would do this, and he would not fail unless Cazic-Thule had seen it fit for him to fail.  He slipped out of the building and was quickly out of the city.  His strides were fast and long, his stealth was that of crisp morning air that sneaks up on you and sends shivers up your spine.  He was alone in his superior skill and talent; the master was not even as good in his younger years as he was now.  
<p>He knew where his target was, it was the one of the new settlements on the coast, and for a few months they had been bringing in crates and shipments of people to explore the land.  They had yet to know too much of the Iksar, but they would soon learn more than they wished.
<p>He slipped through the fields and into the hills near the forested lands.  A large man-eating plant thrashed towards him, but without looking at it, dodged, and ripped it from its base, and bit it in half.  He threw the pieces on the ground as he advanced further.
<p>Through the forest he ran, and quickly skittering agilely down a cliff face, he came within site of the city.  It was still far off, but his eyes picked out the smoke from chimneys and the smell of the enemies.  Carefully he picked his way through the woods.  He spotted a patrol of brown skinned robed ones approaching.  These were the strange ones.  They had no protections of any sort, yet they walked confidently through these dangerous lands.  They were either very powerful in some alien way, or very stupid.  He would not make the mistake of underestimating them if a battle was joined.
<p>They continued on their way towards a set of ruins nearby.  He watched them as one of the drachnids of the area pounced from the rooftops of the trees down to them, taking one of the robed ones down in surprise.  Silence would not join this battle, but would watch to see what made them so special.
<p>The other three robed ones began moving their hands in strange patterns as a glow quickly built up around them.  The glow seemed to reach an almost blinding radiance as they pointed their hands at the spider creature, and at once shouted the same word, and the radiance shot out from them through their hands and to the creature.  Silence had to dodge or be hit by a leg as the creature exploded.
<p>Eyes wide open in a newly found deep respect for these robed ones; he also had to wonder where they received their powers.  In the entire Iksar race the only casters who resembled, in any way, these masters of magic he just witnessed, were the masters of dark arts, the necromancers.  Yet, even the necromancers did not perform spells such as this!  He would have to learn more of these robed ones, and report their strengths and weaknesses to his master.
<p>For now though, his mission was somewhere else.  He continued towards the city and let the robed ones go on to their ruins.  So far, no one had spotted him, and this was normal.  After all, he was an expert at his caste in the Iksar society.
<p>He was now less than 100 feet from the guards at the entrance to this city, and they still had no idea he was even there.  His job was not to wreak havoc upon this city, so these guards would live for the time being.  He sought for an entrance to the city that was not patrolled.
<p>He found it in the form of a tunnel at the base of the waterway.  It looked as if it was not regularly used, and if it was, someone of dubious qualities used it.  He slipped over the edge and into the water.  Here he was even faster and more silent.  Into the tunnel he swam, looking no more than an alligator or other swamp creature.  
<p>Inside the tunnel it was damp and disgusting.  These creatures cared not for cleanliness or order obviously.  New Sebilis may have the feeling of despair in the air at all times, but at least they were better than this.  He saw refuse and wastes floating down the waterways and gave a disgusted look.  
<p>He decided to continue on his way.  Down the tunnel he heard sounds and he hugged the walls as he came closer.  It appeared to be some of the soft skin creatures that the Iksar referred to as the dark ones.
<p>They were speaking their foreign speech, so he could not understand them, but they gestured in such ways that he gathered they were discussing matters of less than legal description.  He slipped quietly towards them, tossing the idea around in his head of whether to kill them quickly or advance on them and see what they would do.  He knew he could not slip past them, nor could he go back without completing his mission.
<p>He walked away from the wall and confidently stepped towards the two creatures.  They drew daggers in surprise, but held their ground eyeing the strange lizard-like creature suspiciously.  They gibbered something in his direction, but of course he did not understand anything.  He moved as if to just walk past them and they stepped to block his way.  He cocked his head to the side looking confused, and they looked at each other also in confusion.  He had them where he wanted them.  They did not know what to do, he had not made a hostile movement, but he had not replied in any way that showed he comprehended what they said.
<p>They were at a standstill for now.  He blinked at them in an ignorant way, and they made to put up their weapons.  He looked again at their movements and decided that no one would miss these two, they were unskilled ruffians obviously.  Whoever their master was, he would not miss two students who obviously had no care for their caste.
<p>As soon as he saw the blades more than halfway into their sheaths, he kicked the right one in the chin, and punched the other in the throat with an open palm, driving its larynx deep into its spine.  The first held its nose, blinded by the pain and blood.  The other coughed and made sounds like a frog.  He dropped low and kicked swept his foot out in a wide arc underneath both of them.  With a splash they fell into the water.  He walked up to the first one still bleeding profusely from its nose, and arched his leg up near his head, bringing it down on the creatures throat, with a satisfying crunch, he knew this one was dead.
<p>He turned to the other one, and watched calmly as it stood up.  It eyed him in a strange fashion, and drew its dagger.  Silence waited.  When the creature thrust out at him, he grabbed the hand with the dagger, holding it closed, and with his shoulder and side, tossed the creature over so that the dagger buried itself in the other creature’s chest.  Then he brought down his hand sideways onto the others spine, and listened as he heard the snaps.
<p>Two dead enemies, and it appears almost as if they killed each other.  This would do fine.  On to find out what they have that could so worry my master.
<p>The end of the tunnel sloped upwards, and he peered out.  It was near bridges where the enemy’s transports came in.  He noticed a building nearby with a great deal of shadows and no patrols.  With a movement more like a blur, he was standing crouched against the building looking like no more than a mural or design on the wall.
<p>The large transports were halting at the ends of the bridges.  He watched attentively as various races came off of it carrying bags and sacks.  Explorers most likely.  Several servants carrying boxes and chests of goods for trade and vending came next.  After watching for nearly half an hour, he saw them.  Large brutish green skinned creatures.  They wore solidly built metal armor of a type he had never seen before, and wielded weapon of cruel shape and size.
<p>He knew he could most likely kill one of these one on one, but for most Iksars, these creatures could kill dozens or more.  A great threat, especially coupled with the brown skinned casters.  This had to be what the master wanted him to see and report on.  He turned and slipped back to the tunnel. Quickly but silently, he ran back through the tunnel and through the terrain.
<p>Cazic-Thule was with him, no one had spotted him and he had managed to even have a little fun.  Back in New Sebilis, his master awaited his return.
