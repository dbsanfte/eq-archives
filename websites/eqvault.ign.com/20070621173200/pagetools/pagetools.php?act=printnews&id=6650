Due to the complexity and the sheer volume of these changes, we'd rather not push these out too quickly and so we'll be moving the Update to next Tuesday.   The repurcussions of these changes (removal of the fear cap, changes to direct damage spells, new item effects, and others) are widespread and impact many systems. We are not comfortable pushing these changes live without further testing.  We'd like to encourage all of you to please spend time on our Test servers and submit any bugs or feedback as you see appropriate.  The Test Server patch message will contain more details about the changes and what to check out.<br>Thank you for your understanding in this matter. <br><br>Jamey Ryan<br><br>Technical Director - EverQuest <br><br> <br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 6 Apr, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6650">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6650</a><br>Printed On: Thu Jun 21 10:32:00 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
