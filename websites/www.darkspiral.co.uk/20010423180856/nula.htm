        &nbsp;I always knew what I was from the day my father found me practicing
        with one of his swords, he was so proud, he immediately made me a small
        practice sword and began to teach me the skills I would need as a
        warrior in our world. Mother wasn't quite so happy, she had hoped I
        would follow in her footsteps and become a magician, I never saw the
        appeal in all that arm waving, but then, I was always my daddies girl.
        <p>As soon as I was old enough, father took me to the warriors guild, I
        think when I walked out of the guild with my training tunic and sword, was the
        proudest moment of his life. Mother cried.</p>
        <p>Father took me to the entrance to the outside world, gave me some
        food and told me not to come home until I reached my 20th season. I miss
        him so much, but am slowly getting there.</p>
        <p>I met Sarolayn almost straight away, he was a handsome young
        Necromancer, he helped me out and introduced me to his friends, we
        joined &quot;The Servants of the Void&quot; and spent many a happy
        season together, we got engaged.</p>
        <p>I went on holiday for a while, traveled around and finally came home
        to be reunited with my love. When I found out he had changed guilds, I
        immediately left The Servants and applied to Dark Spiral.</td>
