<p>Rules and chaos do not really go well together, but to make the guild
workable and a good place for people to be, some rules have to be in place.</p>
<p>Instead of a list of rules, we will tell you what a member should be able to
get from the guild of their choice.</p>
<p>Help and companionship are the most important reasons for joining a
guild, at the moment we are all fairly low level, ranging from below 10 to mid
40's with only one member in her 50's, so spanking 1000pp kit for newcomers
is obviously out of the question, what we hope will happen is that members will
help out in other useful ways. For example, a Dark Elf Necromancer needs a spell
that is only available in a city where he will be killed if he sets foot in it,
a member who is not KOS there could easily go get it for him. Some people need
certain components to cast spells, someone else may be short a couple of plat
for something they desperately want to buy. Dark Spiral has three treasurers,
one holds mundane items that might be of use to younglings who join us, one has
an array of magical items for slightly older members and the last is used to
hold components for spell research, quests etc. We hope that members will give any extra items, cash,
spell
components etc to them, that they can later distribute to whoever needs them.
Guild officers have free access to the treasurers, as they will be the ones
most often helping other members. Other members should ask an officer if they
need something from the vaults. I would like to stress here that we do not help beggars.</p>
<p>We would like to have members from all races and classes so that the broadest
possible help base is available. We also hope to gain players with a
wide range of trade skills, a lot of trades require components that can be made
by a different trader, it would be good to see these people working together. I
hope that all magical help would be given free of charge, except where the castor
incurs high cost to themselves, for instance an enchanter has to&nbsp; buy the
materials to make the jewelry
they enchant, in this example it would be reasonable for the enchanter to ask
for the costs of the materials used.</p>
<p>If you have good stuff to auction, ask the guild first if anyone is
interested in buying at a slightly reduced value. On the topic of auctioning,
some people are uncomfortable with this aspect of game play, others thrive on
it, work together and share.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power, so they say, share your knowledge with the guild.</p>
<p>Racial intolerance will not be permitted within the guild. We are in this
together and will not stand for abuse between one member and another. We do like
to see members role-playing racial tensions though, listening to a Dwarf and a
Troll discussing why all Dwarves should/should not be eaten is fun as long as it
isn't taken out of character.</p>
<p>Many of the current members are role-players, we would like to see this guild
as a role-players guild, at the very least, stay true to your character, no
trolls discoursing on quantum physics, no warriors running away screaming from a
battle with a bixie. Evil High Elves and good Dark Elves, would be silly, but I
suppose, in keeping with the theme of this guild, just use common sense.</p>
<p>If you are invited to join, please ensure that you fill out the form on the
joining page of this website so that we can keep track of our members, we also
use a guild utility site that we would like you to sign up for, it's free and is
a great way of keeping track of all our members, you will find the link to this
site on the links page.</p>
<p>In keeping with the chaos theme of this guild, it would be nice to see plenty
use of EQ's random number generator.</p>
<p>As role-players, you can expect to discover guild plot, lurking in the
background. We also plan on having many guild events, whether it is a party or a
raid, it WILL be fun.</p>
<p>Any disagreements between members should be brought to the attention of an
officer, personality clashes are inevitable, but with an officer as a mediator,
should not be harmful or make life unpleasant for anyone.</p>
