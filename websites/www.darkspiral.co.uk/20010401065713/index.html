<p align="left">Ok, due to popular demand the guild hunt to the Warrens has been
postponed to allow a better day when more of us are available.&nbsp; Please post
your preferences to the Tale Weavers site under the Warrens discussion.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Monday, 19th March 2001</u></p>
<p align="left"><i>All, it is with great pleasure that I announce a new guild event.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please check out the Tale Weaver's site for details.  Please can you post if you can make it (which char you will be taking) or let me know if you have other commitments.
The time/date for this is Sunday, 25th March 2001 at 21:00hrs GMT.  Although this is subject to change depending on numbers of people available.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Feel free to bring along any friends you have, this event is not limited to only DS menbers.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p align="left"><i>At last, the members page has been updated, those of who are
marked in white are thought as MIA, once your name is on the MIA list you will
have one month to get in touch with a member of the Inner Circle and after that
we will take it you no longer wish to be in the Guild and remove you from the
members page. Now all that remains for me is to get screenshots and a biography
for your characters.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>As the majority of our members seem to be around 15th - 25th
it seems fitting that our next guild event should be based around these
levels.&nbsp; I have a couple of ideas of where we can go... any preferences
from you guys?</i></p>

<p align="left"><u>Friday, 2nd March 2001</u></p>
<p align="left"><i>A guild event will be organised soon, all members please can you
drop me an <a href="mailto:neil.rankin@darkspiral.co.uk">e-mail</a> with your
Character details... I would like Names, Classes, Races and Levels.&nbsp; I also
plan to use this information to update our members page as it is long over
due.&nbsp; Also note that any characters currently on the members page will be
deleted if not included in your e-mails.</i></p>

<p align="left"><i>As things have quietened down a bit I thought I would take a
little time to do a few updates to the site, nothing major though. I have
updated the members pages a little, if anyone has a character not on the site
please drop me a <a href="mailto:webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk">mail</a>. I have
also added a few screenshots of Velious to the screenshots page.</i></p>

<p align="left"><i>I would like to announce a guild gathering this week. Friday
29th September at 11pm GMT we will launch a foray into Permafrost/Everfrost in
search of many Mammoths to slay and any others who should cross our paths. Some
in the guild could benefit from us finding the Ice goblin shaman who is rumoured
to be in this area and holds a totem warriors require for their armour. I would
appreciate and I could say demand all those who can make it to send me
confirmation privately, include alternate times if this does not suit. I will
try to accommodate all of you in this hunt and look forward to many painful
deaths on the part of the residents of this frozen wasteland. Nirissi - Mistress
of Pain</i></p>

2000. A small jaunt to Najena went pretty well with only 2 deaths. In attendance
were: Nirrisi, Sarolayn, Nula, Myrror, Kludgie (who decided to join our ranks)
and Tynstar (honorary member). See a pic of the group having a rest:</i></p>
