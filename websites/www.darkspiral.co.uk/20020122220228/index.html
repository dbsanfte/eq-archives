Nohky is the new guild leader. </p>

<p align="left">Well the site has finally moved to it's new home. We'll have the 
mail services back up and running in the next day or two. Thanks to everyone who 
came on the Runnyeye raid, loads of fun.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Monday, 1st October</u></p>
<p align="left">Well despite a few hiccups, than fan faire event went VERY well. 
Not as high a turnout as we'd hoped but enough to make the games fun. Agreu won 
the Tournament and Fishing Comp, Silvershade's Dwarf won the race. </p>
<p align="left">A log of the Dwarf race can be found in the Events forum of our 
boards (link above) and will eventually be posted here with some screenshots.</p>
<p align="left">A HUGE thanks to everyone who made the effort to attend these 
events, Nohky, Gunserade, Agreu, Ignahir, Fayre, Phelin, Kazadthain, Bunky, 
Sarolayn, Carialle, Josef, Darrq, Silvershade, Jariss and Trystn, all showed 
face to at least one event. A big boo to those who didn't *grin* And a quick 
special thanks to Dstitch, Dsfast, Dsig, Dslongtoes, Dskaladek and Dspeedy, our 
intrepid Dwarves.</p>
<p align="left">During the coming weeks, we have the two postponed events, a 
couple of raids, and a couple of surprises planned, so be prepared to be busy.</p>
<p align="left">All the links to our boards have been fixed, and there are 
plenty of topics underway. Be warned, from now on almost everything will be 
announced through the boards BEFORE going to chat email or the website, so if 
you want to stay in the loop, and be well aware of what is happening in the 
guild, then check the boards regularly.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Sunday, 23rd September</u></p>
<p>A new date has been set for our Fan Faire weekend. </p>
<p>The event will start next weekend on Saturday the 29th at 4pm GMT (5pm CET, 
8am PST). </p>
<p>Everyone who wishes to get involved should meet at The Lake Rathe Arena for 
the first event, please try and get there well in advance of the start 
time.*grin* </p>
<p>Full details of the event can be found <a href="dark_spiral_fan_faire.htm">
here</a>.</p>
<p>Addendum to the details page:</p>
<p>The Casino event (third Saturday event) is still a bit sketchy as I haven't 
managed to get enough volunteers to play test the games. We will just head to 
the casino in High Keep and have some fun with drink and random numbers instead 
of the set games we came up with. My apologies to anyone who is KOS there, there 
just isn't a better location for this. If you want to create a non-kos alt for 
this, we will make sure they get there safely and are guilded. Send a tell to 
any of the officers to arrange this. </p>
<p>The first event on the Sunday is the Language workshop. No decision has been 
reached on where to hold this event, so we will just pick up where we left off 
and meet at the Plague Huts in East Commons and move to somewhere quiet from 
there. </p>
<p>The Role-Play event will follow on from where the Language workshop left off.
</p>
<p>The Storytelling Event was suggested to be held at The Theatre of the 
Tranquil in West Freeport. This may cause problems for anyone who is KOS there. 
Again, we shall just head somewhere quiet after the RP event. </p>
<p>A list of the officers and members can be found

<p>&nbsp;Any members who aren't currently registered on Guild Magic, please do

<p align="left"><u>Wednesday, 12th September</u></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008080">The Dark Spiral Fan Faire event has been 
postponed. We will let you know the new dates sometime over the next few weeks.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008080">Our thoughts are with all our friends and 
members in the US and those who have friends or family who may have been 
affected by the recent horror.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Sunday 19th of August</u></p>
<p align="left">For those of us who can't go to the European Fan Faire, we have 
decided to have our own, in-game, Fan Faire for Dark Spiral.</p>
<p align="left">Details can be found <a href="dark_spiral_fan_faire.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Saturday, 4th August</u></p>
<p align="left">The Dark Spiral shop is now open with a selection of t-shirts, 
mugs etc, featuring our logo.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u>Thursday, 2nd August</u></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to everyone for taking the time to fill in your details 
on Guild Magic, for those who haven't yet, you'll find the link on the members 
page. I've also added a screenshot of Silvershade to the members page. If you 
want a picture of your character featured there, then please send it, in it's 
original .bmp format, to:
<a href="mailto:webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk?subject=Screenshots">
webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk</a> and I'll add it to our growing collection.</p>
<p align="left">For something a little different, I am thinking of adding an 
&quot;Arty Guild&quot; section which will feature artwork, stories, poetry etc, related to 
our Norrathian lives, if you have anything you would like to see featured in 
this section, then again, send it to:
<a href="mailto:webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk?subject=Arty Guild">
webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk</a>. </p>
<p align="left">The European, EQ Fan Faire is scheduled to take place in Paris 
on the 15th September, for those who can't afford to attend, we are planning a 
special DS Fan Faire for that weekend. This will involve a large variety of fun 
things, taking place over the course of the weekend, from the usual drinking and 
duelling to a newbie dwarf race from Kaladim to Odus. If you have any ideas for 
fun things to do, then drop an email to:
<a href="mailto:chat@darkspiral.co.uk?subject=Fan Faire">chat@darkspiral.co.uk</a>. </p>
<p align="left">And finally, as many of you know, we have a Role-Play board on
<a href="http://www.taleweavers.org">www.taleweavers.org</a> , we would like to 
see you making more use of this. Phelin has been set the task of creating some 
plot for us to play along with, and it promises to be VERY good. Please remember 
to check the boards regularly to see what's going on. If you do not yet have an 
account with TaleWeavers, please set one up, it is completely free and lots of 
fun, it will also give you the opportunity to meet other role-play guilds on the 
Cazic Thule server. If you have any questions on how to create your character 
and/or how to use the boards, then please email
<a href="mailto:webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk?subject=Taleweavers">
webmaster@darkspiral.co.uk</a>. </p>

<p align="left"><u>Tuesday, 17th July</u></p>
<p align="left">A change in leadership has prompted a few changes in the look of
our website. We would all like to congratulate Nirissi on her new position as
Guild leader and wish Wrathe well in her new guild, she will be sadly missed.</p>
<p align="left">So, I've been busy, not only a new look, but a change to how the
members page works and a load of new screenshots in the pictures section.</p>
<p align="left">Enjoy,</p>
