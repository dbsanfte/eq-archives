Raaine was born on one of  the darkest and stormiest nights in all of Norrath, his father a proud necromancer thought this was a sign from Innoruuk himself that his only son would follow in his foot steps of death.  His mother was young and beautiful, a great sorceress, looked upon him warmly but she knew his heart would never learn to love the ways of death and disease or that of sorcery.<br>
<br>
As Raaine grew older his father realised that his son should follow his own path, a path that would lead him to have great powers of his own. He encouraged him to follow his heart as this would give him the greatest satisfaction.  His mother tried to encourage him to follow the ways of sorcery but Raaine had a hard time with this and never managed to control his powers fully.  Instead he taught himself the art of illusion and deception.<br>
<br>
Leaving his home town and forest for the first time he found that he was weak by himself if he was attacked, as he was on many occasions, he developed the art of summoning a being to protect him.  As his conjuring abilities were not as great as a true magician the pet was adequate to protect him and
help him win battles; although when the odds were against him it bought him some time to run to safety.<br>
<br>
Raaine sought the companionship of Dark Spiral to help him on his travels and to gain allies.  This has helped him greatly on his journey just as he has helped others on their journey.</td>
