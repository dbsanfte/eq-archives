    <br>
    Maran tickled Fale as they sat by the warmth of the fire sharing warm bread 
    and milk. His childish giggling never failed to delight her. “I must be the 
    luckiest mother in the world.” She smiled, holding him tight. <br>
    He grinned up at her, a circle of jam around his mouth, “Will Daddy be home 
    soon?” he asked with a pleading look in his eyes.<br>
    “The day after tomorrow, Fale.” She ruffled his hair and smiled down at him.<br>
    “Where is he?”<br>
    She laughed, “I told you already, he’s gone to the quarterly market to sell 
    seed and stock.”<br>
    “Oh.” He nodded - deep in thought, “Why he not takes us with him?” he 
    stumbled slightly over the words.<br>
    “You’re still a little too young, my boy, maybe next year. Would you like 
    some more milk before you go to bed?” The child smiled happily and nodded 
    his head. <br>
    <br>
    Maran got up from the fire and went to the cooking area. She picked up the 
    large blue jug that her mother had given her on her wedding day, three years 
    ago, and poured them both some fresh creamy milk. As she picked up the mugs, 
    she heard an odd whispering noise outside. She twitched back the curtains to 
    see if one of the cows had gotten loose. <br>
    <br>
    She frowned as she tried make out the figures in the moonlight. They seemed 
    very tall and wore long dark robes. A pale face caught in the moonlight as 
    it turned towards her, huge eyes ate into her soul. Her stomach lurched and 
    the mugs fell from her hand, smashing on the old stone floor.<br>
    <br>
    She ran across the room, oblivious to the smashed china that ate into her 
    naked feet. She swept Fale off the floor and into her arms, tearing up the 
    stairs and dropping him into his room. He looked up, eyes full of fear and 
    confusion. “Don’t be scared, just some unwanted visitors.” Her heart pounded 
    in her ears as she tried to appear calm. “You stay up here and I’ll come and 
    get you when they’re gone. Not a peep now, nice and quiet until I come to 
    get you.” She smiled at him as she closed and locked his door.<br>
    <br>
    Taking slow deep breaths, she tried to pull herself together and crept back 
    down the stairs. She listened at the front door, her face blanched almost as 
    white as the face in the night. The noises continued outside. “How many?” 
    She wondered. She’d heard that the Elders came in their hundreds. They would 
    steal anything that could be moved and then kill all of the inhabitants. Her 
    shaking grew worse, coherent thought fighting, and losing, against blind 
    panic.<br>
    <br>
    She found herself staring into the fire, hand clasped tightly around an old 
    poker. Hysterical laughter threatened to overwhelm her. “Yes, I’ll see them 
    off with a poker.” Tears rolled un-noticed down her cheeks.<br>
    <br>
    She felt as if she were in a glass bubble and that none of the things she 
    had taken for granted had ever really existed. It was as if the here and now 
    were all she had ever known and the rest was just some vague dream. Her mind 
    froze, unable to comprehend the situation, unable to come up with a way to 
    escape, a way to save her son. <br>
    <br>
    Instinct took over. No thought went into her actions - no reasoning or 
    sense. Her conscious mind had fled her and left a mother whose only thought 
    was to protect her child.<br>
    <br>
    …<br>
    <br>
    A figure crouched in the darkness, watching the council buildings with sharp 
    eyes. The time was almost on him, one more passing of the Guards and he 
    would make his move. He grinned. It would be an interesting challenge.<br>
    <br>
    Now! <br>
    <br>
    He darted over the outer wall and into the shadows of the trees on the other 
    side. Slowly, quietly, he crouched and dashed from tree to tree until the 
    great building loomed before him. Now the part he didn’t like - into the 
    midden heap outside the kitchens and wait once more as the guards completed 
    one circuit and began the next.<br>
    <br>
    The smell was awful, he fought back the urge to retch, now was not the time 
    for that. He watched and waited, trying to avoid breathing through his nose. 
    One guard passed. Holding his breath, he crouched as low as he could as he 
    waited for the next guard to come from the opposite direction. There, safe 
    again - for now. He jumped up onto the roof of the midden and grasped the 
    window ledge above. Quickly and easily he hoisted himself up. Hugging the 
    wall, he peered in and found that the room beyond was blessedly dark. A 
    knife appeared in his hand. It didn’t take long for him to slide open the 
    window. With practised ease he slipped through the tiny gap and jumped down 
    silently. Carefully he pulled the window shut, slipped into the shadows, 
    slowed his breathing and waited. The smells of herbs and fruits were strong, 
    and beneath it, the sickly stench of food gone to waste. The storeroom was 
    dark and quiet, except for the odd scuffling and squeaking of rats. He shook 
    his head and grimaced, dirty creatures, drawn to filth and spreading 
    disease. The council should know better than to allow the conditions that 
    would entice these creatures within its walls. Once satisfied that he was 
    alone, he slipped out of the shadows and over to the door.<br>
    <br>
    As he had expected, the door was barred. He listened for any sounds in the 
    passage beyond. Silence. The blade of his slim knife eased through the tiny 
    space between door and frame, he began to push it up against the latch. He 
    heard the almost inaudible click only a moment later. Quickly, he retreated 
    once more into the shadows, breathing slowly and waiting for any sign that 
    he may have been discovered. A minute passed and he smiled, no one had 
    heard. Returning to the door, he pressed his ear up against it and listened 
    once more, for any sounds of life beyond.<br>
    <br>
    His breathe caught as he heard footsteps moving towards him. Crouching down, 
    he prepared to run if they so much as slowed. He breathed more easily as 
    they continued past. Counting slowly in his head to thirty, he then grabbed 
    the handle and eased opened the door. Peering out into the lit corridor he 
    grinned. He slipped out and pulled the door closed behind him, deftly using 
    his knife to lock it once more. <br>
    <br>
    Clinging to the wall like a shadow, he moved rapidly to the stairs at the 
    end of the hall. His luck was holding good so far, now the fun bit. Silently 
    he dashed up the stairs, watching and listening at each curve, until he 
    reached the top. Picturing the floor plans in his mind, he quickly got his 
    bearings. The main Council chamber should be on the right, and the 
    Chairman’s office on the left.<br>
    <br>
    He crept forward, delighted to hear the sound of raised voices coming from 
    the meeting room. “We must not let this continue!” That sounded like the 
    chairman’s voice. “Something has to be done to eradicate this menace. This 
    is our land and it will remain our land, but only if we …” The voice faded 
    to a mumble as the figure opened, and slipped through, the door to the 
    Chairman’s office.<br>
    <br>
    Shutting the door quietly behind him, he closed his eyes, allowing them 
    enough time to adjust to the dark. His glance took in the whole room and 
    automatically tagged anything of value, but tonight was not about profit, 
    tonight was just for fun. He walked up to the large oak desk and picked up a 
    heavy wooden seal. It was the Chairman’s seal of office. Grinning, he popped 
    it into his pocket and looked around once more. “Hmm, perhaps just one 
    little trinket...” He thought to himself as he eyed a golden statue about 
    the size of his hand. That went in his other pocket. Satisfied, he went back 
    to the door and listened closely. The mumbles were just audible from across 
    the hall, and no other sound could be heard. He slipped out, shut the door 
    and darted back down the stairs, pausing at the bottom to peer into the 
    corridor. Fortunately, it was still empty. He grinned and made his way back 
    to the storeroom door, confident that he was now on his way. Testing the 
    door, he was relieved to find it was still locked. With a flick of his 
    knife, while he watched the corridor behind him, he sprung the lock and 
    darted through… into the brightly lit room.<br>
    <br>
    His heart caught in his throat as he turned slowly, expecting to feel a 
    knife at his neck. A young woman huddled on the ground, eyes wide with fear. 
    Tear tracks ran down her cheeks. He sighed. She opened her mouth to scream, 
    but before a sound could escape her lips, her body lay lifeless on the 
    floor, her long neck twisted at an ugly angle.<br>
    <br>
    “I’m sorry child, but I can’t have you telling anyone you saw me here.” The 
    regret in his voice sounded strangely genuine. Hastily, he doused the lights 
    and throwing the girl’s still body over his shoulder, peered out of the 
    window to the kitchen yard. First one guard, then the other, he lowered the 
    body carefully to the roof below and following, swung himself down to the 
    ground. He buried the girl deep in the midden heap. <br>
    <br>
    With sharp, well trained eyes, he look about and, sure that his retreat was 
    clear, dashed into the trees and back to the outer wall. As a shadow, he 
    climbed up with ease and lay flat on the top, waiting for the outer guard to 
    finish their circuit.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Back in his rooftop den, high above the town, he inspected his prizes. The 
    Seal was of no real use to him, except as proof of his expertise, but the 
    gold figure was maybe worth a bit. It had been a long time since he had 
    needed money - he was probably one of the most successful thieves in the 
    business. His work was now done only for pleasure and challenge, though 
    having more money was hardly a problem. Such a shame tonight had been 
    spoiled. He shook the memory of the girl’s face from his head and studied 
    the figure in his hand, tall and slender - enshrouded in a large cloak, and 
    with extremely large eyes staring out at him from its deep hood. Female, he 
    thought, though it was hard to tell. He liked it and decided to keep it.<br>
    <br>
    Shaking off his regrets, he stripped out of his clothes. The stench was 
    appalling. A bucket of tepid water was emptied over his head and he grimaced 
    as he scrubbed hard with a brush and soap to remove the dreadful smell. 
    Finally convinced he would pass as clean, at least until he was able to 
    bathe properly, he towelled himself dry and dressed from a neat pile of 
    clothing that had been secured under an old crate. Discarding the black of 
    his trade, he gladly replaced it with rich blue velvet. His long chestnut 
    hair fell in damp tangles, past his shoulders. Once he had scrubbed it as 
    dry as he could and wrenched a comb through it, he fastened the silky mass 
    neatly with a gold clasp at the nape of his neck. Elegant leather boots 
    replaced those worn with age, and use, while white lace usurped the black 
    cotton at his neck. He threw his stinking work clothes into an old sack and 
    hid it under a loose floor board - he would replace them on his next outing. 
    His tools went into a carved-out hollow in one of the roof beams, high above 
    prying eyes. Finally, his new acquisitions were put into a fine leather bag, 
    which he slung over his shoulder, followed by a long black hooded cloak. <br>
    <br>
    Three rooftops later, he lifted a hatch and dropped down into the attic of a 
    large house. It was a sumptuous dwelling, obviously belonged to a wealthy 
    merchant. He confidently made his way out of the roof space and down the 
    stairs. <br>
    <br>
    A servant met him at the bottom with a relieved smile. “Sir, Master Brendal 
    has just arrived. He arranged a meeting with you to discuss the new trade 
    route you have been planning. I left him in the lounge.” <br>
    <br>
    Tran Grath smiled at the man, “Thank you. Please bring a bottle of Brandy 
    and something to eat.” Handing over his cloak, he dismissed him with nod and 
    entered the study with a broad smile on his face. “Brendal my man, glad you 
    could make it, hope I haven’t kept you waiting too long?” He placed a 
    leather bag in the top drawer of a finely carved desk and sat down opposite 
    his guest, ready to discuss business.<br>
    <br>
    …<br>
    <br>
    Chairman Tharn left the meeting room, angry and frustrated. No-one seemed to 
    realise what a threat these so called Elders were. Stories of death and 
    theft were coming in quicker with each passing season. The farmers were 
    working themselves into a panic. The land could not afford for them to cease 
    their trade and move to the safety of the cities. If something was not done 
    soon, the food supplies would start to dwindle and chaos would soon follow. 
    He’d already received reports that some families were moving out of the 
    country, to escape the menace from underground.<br>
    <br>
    He sat at the desk in his office, worry creasing his face. He picked up a 
    sheet of paper and began to write.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Salim,<br>
    <br>
    We must meet with The Guardians and discuss the threat from the Elders. A 
    fighting force is needed to protect our people in the outlying areas. Please 
    arrange this immediately.<br>
    <br>
    Chairman Tharn.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    He folded the paper neatly and reached for his wax and seal. He looked up, 
    confused, when he found his seal missing from its usual place. “Damned 
    incompetent servants,” he muttered darkly. Rooting in a drawer he found his 
    spare one.<br>
    <br>
    Once satisfied, he rang a bell and waited for his man-servant to appear.<br>
    <br>
    Moments later, an elderly figure entered and bowed deeply before him. “Sir?”<br>
    <br>
    “Have this letter delivered to General Salim immediately. Once done, find 
    out who last cleaned this room and ask them what has become of my seal! I 
    will not tolerate incompetence.” He glared around the room, eyes stopping at 
    the mantel and turning to steel. He turned back to the man. “It appears we 
    have a thief. Report the theft of my Elder statue to Master Threl and have 
    him conduct an investigation. NOW!”<br>
    <br>
    Containing his anger, he gestured for the man to leave.<br>
    <br>
    …<br>
    <br>
    Two days later, an old cart and horse trudged along a dirt road. The driver 
    looked weary but happy. The cart was empty and the animals that had been 
    with him at the start of his journey were gone.<br>
    <br>
    He could just see his farm in the distance, “I hope Maran has some food 
    cooking.” He smiled as his stomach grumbled.<br>
    <br>
    As he got nearer, he noticed the barn doors standing open, “She must be 
    feeding the young ‘uns.” He picked up the pace, eager to see his family - he 
    hated being away from them.<br>
    <br>
    His heart lurched us he noticed a figure lying in the dirt beside the barn. 
    He leapt off the cart and ran forward, heart hammering in his throat as he 
    saw the pool of dried blood surrounding it.<br>
    <br>
    “MARAN!” the scream tore his throat as he bent down to her still figure. 
    Tears ran unchecked down his dusty cheeks. He felt for a pulse and found 
    nothing. Gently, he lifted her head, his fingers sinking into soft wetness 
    filled with sharp fragments. Bile rising, he lowered her back to the ground 
    and stood up, face grey with shock. He looked into the barn, desperately 
    trying to find some explanation for this horror. The barn was empty, all the 
    stock gone. “Elders.” He cursed through the tears. <br>
    <br>
    He crumpled to the ground and lay there shaking and sobbing with the pain of 
    his loss. Images of what must have happened chased themselves around his 
    head. He retched violently, only bile issuing from his empty stomach. <br>
    <br>
    Unsure of time, he became aware of a strange sobbing sound coming from the 
    house. He jumped up, worry and relief written on his face. “Fale!” He ran to 
    the house and followed the sounds to the boy’s room. The door was locked. He 
    kicked out hard, the door splintering under his foot.<br>
    <br>
    The boy was huddled on the ground, pale and drawn, the dried salt of tears, 
    encrusting his face. The room stank of urine and faeces. He crouched down 
    before the small child and took his hands. The grubby face looked up at him. 
    “Daddy. Where’s Mummy?”<br>
    <br>
    Fendle pulled his son into his arms and held him close.<br>
