Myrror was brought up in the High Elven City of Felwithe, where he excelled at
the Magical Arts. He developed an aptitude to the specific Art of Enchantment.
He rebelled against the staid and dull teachings of Tunare, his peoples Patron
deity, and decided there was more to be done with his life. He befriended a
Young Dwarven Cleric, and learned of the Dwarven peoples beliefs (as well as
picking up some of their language skills.) He spent his formative years in the
vast castle of Crushbone, fighting the evil Orc hordes of Emperor Crush. He soon
got bored with this, and set off to travel the world. He met a Dark Elven Shadow
Knight, and learned much of his peoples Ancestral Enemies. The Shadow Knight, (Valagant)
was infirm, and in an act of kindness unusual for his race, donated his worldly
goods to the Young Enchanter. Myrror then befriended another pair of Tier'Dal, a
Necromancer (Sarolayn) and a Warrior (Nula) who he became good friends with.
Unfortunately, his Fellow High Elves found this friendship distasteful and
offered him a choice. Relinquish his friendship, or be exiled from Felwithe.
Myrror chose exile. He found a new home in the teeming Human city of Freeport
(built on the ruins of the old Elven Capital) where he met up with his old
friend Beardos the Dwarf. Since then, the wonders of the world have drawn Myrror,
and he has spent many seasons traveling and exploring the Lands, from far off
Erudin, across the Karanas , and even into the Cities of his races old enemies
the Ogre and Trolls. He has traveled to every corner of the Three Lands, and has
even ventured briefly into the Lost Lands of Kunark. Myrror is fascinated with
Learning, and has even started collecting together the knowledge he has learned
on his travels. While still young and inexperienced, he has befriended many Old
adventurers who have taught him much of the Lore of Norrath. While he is
somewhat dubious about his Guilds dedication to Chaos, he does believe that the
old order of the races needs changed. His travels have shown him that every race
has its preconceived ideas, that are not always right, and he feels he should
work towards changing that. While he will not commit any acts of wanton evil,
his calling to the Illusionary Art does make him somewhat of a trickster, and
not above breaking the law to further his own agenda, or to aid those he calls
friend. He follows no god, believing the Gods of Norrath to be fickle and cruel.
(After all...what sense does it make for ShadowKnights, the dreaded Warriors of
Innoruuk, to have to slay there own God to gain the Magical Armour that is the
Pinnacle of their Class??)</td>
