      downtime as we have now been moved to a different hosting server.&nbsp; 
      E-mail may be a little screwy for a bit as the site backup did not 
      complete as well as I hoped and alot of it has had to be touched up

      apologies. Next Thursday (17/04/2001) at 20:00hrs GMT we will re-run this 
      event at Befallen.</font></I></P>

      are marked in white are thought as MIA, once your name is on the MIA list 
      you will have one month to get in touch with a member of the Inner Circle 
      and after that we will take it you no longer wish to be in the Guild and 
      remove you from the members page. Now all that remains for me is to get 
      screenshots and a biography for your characters.</font></I></P>
      <P align=left><I><font color="#C0C0C0">As the majority of our members seem to be around 15th - 
      25th it seems fitting that our next guild event should be based around 
      these levels.&nbsp; I have a couple of ideas of where we can go... any 
      preferences from you guys?</font></I></P>

      details... I would like Names, Classes, Races and Levels.&nbsp; I also 
      plan to use this information to update our members page as it is long over

      I have updated the members pages a little, if anyone has a character not 
      on the site please drop me a <A

      Friday 29th September at 11pm GMT we will launch a foray into 
      Permafrost/Everfrost in search of many Mammoths to slay and any others who 
      should cross our paths. Some in the guild could benefit from us finding 
      the Ice goblin shaman who is rumoured to be in this area and holds a totem 
      warriors require for their armour. I would appreciate and I could say 
      demand all those who can make it to send me confirmation privately, 
      include alternate times if this does not suit. I will try to accommodate 
      all of you in this hunt and look forward to many painful deaths on the 
      part of the residents of this frozen wasteland. Nirissi - Mistress of 
      Pain</font></I></P>
