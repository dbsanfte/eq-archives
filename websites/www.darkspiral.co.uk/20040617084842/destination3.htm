    <br>
    The infants’ cries rose above the chorus of bird song, rudely breaking their 
    morning concert. Feathers ruffling, the singers looked down upon the blanket 
    wrapped bundle that dared to disturb their work. The child gazed up at them 
    with large wet eyes, cries replaced with gentle sobs, and finally a small 
    hiccup.<br>
    <br>
    “Here it is,” cried a voice from nearby, the birds flew away and resumed 
    their song elsewhere, “it’s a babe alright.” The child was lifted from her 
    nest, positioned perfectly in the centre of a ring of flowers, and held 
    close as a strange woman pulled back the blanket and looked her over. Blue 
    grey eyes watched the woman closely and a slow small smile spread across the 
    babes face. The woman’s heart warmed as she looked into those eyes, “Let’s 
    get her back to the Vatra, she must be starving.”<br>
    <br>
    The campsite was just on the other side of the clearing, a circle of 
    brightly coloured caravans and in the centre a morning fire burned. Large 
    horses were picketed off to one side and at the other were some dogs, 
    tethered, with enough lead that they could prowl freely outside the circle.<br>
    <br>
    A large man and a woman walked up to the child’s rescuer to see what had 
    been found. “So, Talaitha, what has the morning brought us?” asked the Rom 
    Baro as he eyed the wriggling bundle.<br>
    <br>
    Talaitha smiled as she dropped a small bow to the camp leader, “A girl 
    child, Yishwan, barely six months old.” She handed the baby to the Rom 
    Baro’s wife, who stood with her arms wide and an anxious smile on her round 
    face.<br>
    <br>
    Tshaya took the child in her arms and examined her from head to toe, eyes 
    soft with unshed tears, “She’s perfect,” she turned her gaze to her husband, 
    “please?”<br>
    <br>
    Yishwan looked deeply into his wife’s eyes, looked beyond the pain of 
    endless babes, lost before reaching term, and into her heart and the small 
    spark of hope that burned there. “Yes romni, you can keep her, we shall name 
    her Anis and in one week we shall adopt her and give her our family name, 
    Saray.”<br>
    <br>
    Tears fell freely from Tshaya’s love filled eyes, so long since he had seen 
    her smile it almost filled his heart to bursting. He looked at the baby and 
    silently swore to protect her from all evils, anything or anyone that could 
    make his beloved romni smile once more, deserved that, and more. “Come 
    Tshaya, take young Anis, wash and clothe her, then we can introduce her to 
    her new family.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    I was still very young when I first heard that story, the old Chovexani 
    would tell me it as we collected herbs or as we sat by her fire while she 
    made potions and unguents. It was she who took me under her wing when Tshaya 
    died, three years after I was found. She was lost to us during the labour of 
    the first of her natural children to reach term. Neither she, nor the babe, 
    survived. Yishwan retired soon after and a younger man became Rom Baro of 
    our Vatra.<br>
    <br>
    I did as much as a three year old child can, to help Yishwan deal with his 
    loss, though I barely understood it myself at the time. He took some comfort 
    in my presence, so I would sit with him, quietly, when ever I could. I would 
    occasionally ask questions about our world which seemed to bring him out of 
    himself, just a little, and sometimes he would grace me with his warm and 
    gentle smile.<br>
&nbsp;<p><br>
    <b><font size="4">Part Two</font></b><br>
    <br>
    Mala was not only the tribe’s witch; she was our teller of tales. Anything 
    of event that happened within our Vatra, she would store away in her small 
    grey head and soon later, it would be added to the list of stories she would 
    tell during the quiet times, or while we worked at sitting chores. Much to 
    my discomfort, I was an excellent source of stories to the old woman. I 
    personally believe that this is the true reason she apprenticed me, not for 
    the reasons she would describe, oh so eloquently, around the campfire of an 
    evening.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    Mala struggled long into the night to force life back into the graying form 
    of Tshaya. Anis sat small and frightened at the foot of her adoptive 
    mother’s bed. She held the still form of her brother in her arms, and the 
    tears ran freely down her face.<br>
    <br>
    “Talaitha! Take the babe and see to it, rap it tight and ask Yishwan for his 
    blessing so it may begin its journey to Mithras.”<br>
    <br>
    Tshaya groaned, “Anis?” the three year old girl handed the dead baby boy to 
    Talaitha and crept forward to her mother’s side. Tshaya groped for the 
    girl’s hand and smiled slightly as she found it. Anis tried not to flinch at 
    the touch of ice in hands that had always been soothing and warm. Tshaya 
    whispered, “Anis my love, you have made my life complete. Thank you. I do 
    not know who your parents were, but they will travel with me in my heart to 
    beyond, the gift they gave me was greater than any…” The cold hand went limp 
    in the girl’s warm one.<br>
    <br>
    Mala watched on in silence as the child looked in to the empty eyes of her 
    mother, leaned forward and kissed each cheek gently before squaring her tiny 
    shoulders and walking out of the caravan.<br>
    <br>
    Yishwan watched his daughter walk down the steps and took one look at her 
    face before crumpling to the ground. Anis walked calmly to his huddled form, 
    wrapped her tiny arms around his great shaggy head and held him as tightly 
    as she could, as if she would never let go.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    The next morning, his son and wife’s remains had been placed on the pyre and 
    sent to Mithras while the tribe had said their farewells. The camp leader 
    had left the pyre as the last flame went out and entered his family caravan 
    with Anis. The tribe had watched with deep concern each time the doors 
    opened and young Anis had scuttled out, taken food and drink from the 
    central fire and returned. She would not raise her eyes, and not a word 
    passed her lips.<br>
    <br>
    Exactly one week later, silence fell over the camp as Yishwan strode down 
    his steps and into the centre of the vatra. He looked around him, eyes 
    devoid of emotion, “There will be a divano here tonight, and all must 
    attend.” He returned to the caravan, where Anis awaited him on the steps.<br>
    <br>
    That evening, as the sun sank behind the Brenna peaks, the tribe gathered 
    around the fire, conversation buzzing as they speculated on the reasons for 
    the meeting. Finally Yishwan arrived with the small hand of Anis’ in his own 
    large and calloused one.<br>
    <br>
    “I am getting old and no longer have the heart to lead this Vatra. It is 
    time for me to step down. Most Rom Baro have a son they can hand over the 
    reigns too, I do not have that luxury. Kori, step forward,” Startled, a tall 
    and broad man of around 35 summers stepped into the circle, “I have watched 
    you since the day you were born, I have seen the pride in your parent’s eyes 
    as you met each day and conquered it. You are as strong as a bull, but with 
    the wisdom of the owl to guide you. You have the love and respect of all who 
    have met you.” Yishwan bowed his head to the young man, “From this day, 
    Yishwan’s Vatra is now Kori’s Vatra.” <br>
    <br>
    A muted hum went through the people, happy with the choice, but shocked at 
    the suddenness of the change. Yishwan held up his hands and looked at each 
    of the Romani before him. “I have one request. Anis needs a mother. I love 
    the child dearly but cannot teach her of womanly ways. Are any of you able 
    to take her into your vardo?”<br>
    <br>
    Three of the camps women began to rise, but halted as Mala the Chovexani 
    stepped into the centre of the circle. “I will take the child.”<br>
    <br>
    Surprised, Yishwan turned to her, “Why, Mala? You have no husband to help 
    you, you work from dawn until dusk, surely you do not have time for a 
    child?”<br>
    <br>
    Mala smiled, “The child has something in her that I believe I can bring out. 
    I would not only watch over her as a mother to a daughter, but as a teacher 
    to an apprentice. She will be of great help to me when I go to gather herbs, 
    and her touch is soothing to those in pain. She instinctively seems to know 
    who needs help and is quickly there at their side. She has the potential to 
    one day be a Chovexani, greater even than myself. And you all know how great 
    I am.” Her eyes twinkled with humour as she smiled at the people around her.<br>
    <br>
    Yishwan frowned for a moment, then looked down at Anis. Getting down to his 
    knees beside the child, he took both her hands and looked into her blue grey 
    eyes. “Anis, would you like to help Mala, and learn from her?”<br>
    <br>
    Anis thought for a moment, “Only if I can still help you, Father.”<br>
    <br>
    Yishwan nodded and stood once more. “You and I will raise her, witch, 
    together we can provide her with anything a normal family could, and an 
    independent future besides.”<br>
    <br>
    The old leader and the witch shook hands, Anis watching on from the side.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
    <b><font size="4">Part Three</font></b><br>
    <br>
    “Anis Saray! You will be the death of me!” Mala rubbed furiously at her 
    temples. “If you mix those two herbs together in that manner, you will kill 
    your patient, not clear up their boils.”<br>
    <br>
    I almost dropped the herbs in fright, “I’m sorry Mala,” I sobbed, “I try and 
    try and try, but I just can’t get it to stick.”<br>
    <br>
    I was ten years old when Mala finally gave up on any hope she had harboured 
    for me to become a healer. She kept me as her assistant, and would have me 
    sit and hold the hands of her patients, “The only thing you are good for.” 
    She would mutter fondly. She still insisted that there was some kind of 
    talent in me, but nothing that she could tap; personally, I felt I was as 
    “talented” as one of the rocks surrounding our camp fire.<br>
    <br>
    I may not have understood the use of the herbs I picked, or even remembered 
    the names, but it was still a pleasure to spend long spring days in the 
    woods and fields, filling a satchel with as many plants and flowers as I 
    could find. As the sun began to sink into the west, I would return to the 
    camp, get Yishwan his evening meal, then spend the rest of the night 
    listening to Mala’s tales as we sorted my day’s harvest.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    The camp animals formed a special bond with Anis. Much to the annoyance of 
    the tribe, the dogs would follow her into the caravans where they most 
    certainly were not allowed. The Romani tribes did not keep pets, animals 
    were considered unclean, having them within the vardos was unlucky, but 
    no-one could convince Anis of these things.<br>
    <br>
    Her bond with the dogs alone could have had her banished from any other 
    camp, but not a one from Kori’s Vatra could bring themselves to let her go. 
    Things got worse as she started trying to learn the healers craft, all kinds 
    of creature would be brought back to camp and “treated” by the child.<br>
    <br>
    Many things were considered unclean to the tribes that roamed Teutonia, but 
    of the animals, the fox and the cat were the worst of all, scavengers with 
    no possible useful function. When Anis skipped into camp with a half crushed 
    fox in her arms, the Rom Baro finally decided that enough was enough.<br>
    <br>
    Kori stormed over to the girl, his normally mild and unshakable demeanor 
    blown beyond all recognition. “You dare to bring Prikaza on our camp! You 
    would destroy us all with the filth you bring within us! This creature is 
    mahrime, Anis, how many times do we have to explain this to you? It is 
    unclean and will bring bad luck on our camp!” the child’s eyes began to fill 
    with tears causing Kori’s face to suddenly soften, filled with remorse; he 
    crouched down and held his arms open to her. She laid the fox carefully upon 
    the ground and ran into his embrace, tears now flowing freely. Kori looked 
    over her shoulder at the creature on the ground, and up into the eyes of 
    Yishwan who had come to see what his impossible child had done now. 
    Understanding passed between them, she was still young, she would learn, 
    maybe when she was a little older she would begin to realise that some 
    things were just not done.<br>
    <br>
    Kori handed the sobbing child over to her father and removed the fox from 
    the camp.<br>
    <br>
    Month after month, “Anis Moments” were had, and month after month she was 
    forgiven. <br>
    <br>
    She did try very hard to learn the ways of her adoptive people, but none of 
    it made any sense to her. “Why can’t I have a red dress, father, it is such 
    a beautiful colour?”<br>
    <br>
    Horrified, Yishwan looked up at her, “Red is the colour of blood, Anis, it 
    is mahrime, it is unclean.”<br>
    <br>
    “But at the wedding yesterday, Marona wore the most glorious red dress.” 
    Anis looked at her father, her forehead creased with confusion.<br>
    <br>
    Frustration filled the man’s eyes, how do you explain to a seven year old 
    child, that the red of a wedding dress is to show that the bride is a 
    virgin. He sighed deeply, “Mala will explain that to you when you are older, 
    for now, no red dress, do you understand?”<br>
    <br>
    “Yes father.” she nodded bleakly, no closer to understanding why, and 
    determined to still make a red dress from the collection of scrap red 
    material she had been collecting since she saw her first wedding at the age 
    of five.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    “Red is never worn by an honest gypsy woman, except on her wedding day to 
    symbolize she is still a virgin.” Anis was ten and stood before Mala, 
    shoulders tense as she was made to recite the “rules”, yet again, in the 
    vain hope that they would finally sink in and she would understand.<br>
    <br>
    “Never greet another Romany before washing in the morning.” Mala nodded for 
    the girl to continue.<br>
    <br>
    “The Bucket furthest upstream is for drinking and cooking. Then is the one 
    for washing clothes, then for the horses, then the last one for pregnant or 
    menstruating women.” This one almost made sense to Anis, though she was sure 
    the speed of the river would carry any waste past the drinking water pretty 
    quickly if mistakes were made, and they had been.<br>
    <br>
    “Women are mahrime from the waist down except to their husband or intended 
    husband.” This was in part to prevent rapes and in part to prevent adultery. 
    She still couldn’t grasp the concept of “unclean” but could see why 
    prevention of rape, at least, was a good thing. <br>
    <br>
    “A woman can scare away evil spirits by waving one of her skirts in the air. 
    She can also touch a male she is extremely displeased by with them. This way 
    they are unclean and no male can talk to them until they have been cleansed 
    by the Krisatora, a gathering of judges from different gypsy tribes.” This 
    one was completely beyond her comprehension; her skirt wasn’t in the least 
    bit scary, it was also very clean, she had washed it just two days ago, 
    unfortunately, it had been in the river above the first bucket, and that had 
    caused no end of problems.<br>
    <br>
    “Women cannot pass in front of a man, nor between two men. She must go 
    behind them or say Bolde tut, kako, please turn away.” In her mind she 
    screamed in frustration and confusion, Mala watched the play of emotions on 
    the girls face, determined this once to remain strict and continue.<br>
    <br>
    “What things are mahrime, Anis?”<br>
    <br>
    Anis took a deep breath, “Cats, rats, foxes, and to an extent dogs which are 
    never supposed to enter a vardo or be allowed to lick one's face. Also 
    tainted are blood, especially menstrual blood and water a dog has drank from 
    or a woman has stepped over. Some people are also considered mahrime, 
    especially gaje - non Romani, and any Rom with a lot of Gaje heritage, 
    Pikies - rom who have been expelled from Romani society and hedgecrawlers - 
    travelers without Romani blood. Mulo - ghosts and faeries are also most 
    mahrime.” Anis wondered where she fit into all this; it always seemed to be 
    brushed aside whenever she asked.<br>
    <br>
    “Good,” Said Mala, “now once more from the start.”<br>
    <br>
    And thus began every day for the next two years.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="4">Part Four</font></b><br>
    <br>
    “The time of death - the most terrible time in our tribe’s history is 
    finally past. We few who sit here before this fire are all that is left of 
    us, we once numbered over one hundred, and now less than thirty.”<br>
    <br>
    I sat outside the ring of caravans, watching as Mala spoke to the remnants 
    of my people; the tears flowed freely down my face as I listened to the 
    tale. My tribe’s final straw. I ached to move forward, to go amongst those 
    few remaining and to touch a shoulder or a hand, to offer what comfort I 
    could, but I could not, I was now mahrime, I was now pikie, banished 
    forever. I was 16 years old and dressed in a red skirt.<br>
    <br>
    “We must never forget what has befallen us…”<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    Anis had continued to be a problem to her tribe, each passing year her list 
    of crimes grew. Now a teenager, she was causing Yishwan endless headaches, 
    flouting the traditions they had tried so hard to drum into her, knowing 
    that she could and that no-one would ever punish her. It was a heady time 
    for the young woman as she passed her favour among the young men of her 
    tribe, and those of other tribes they encountered. <br>
    <br>
    Yishwan despaired of ever seeing her settled, endless attempts at arranging 
    a marriage ended in failure for the prospective groom would smile warmly at 
    Anis and shake his head. Anis would grin behind her hand, it was not hard to 
    persuade these men to refuse her, a quiet word whispered in their ear in the 
    dead of night as their bodies lay entwined. Come morning they both would be 
    happy, and surprising himself, the young man would say no, he did not want 
    Anis for his wife. Invariably he would walk away, puzzled as to why he 
    wouldn’t want such a “welcoming” woman for a spouse.<br>
    <br>
    Two days before her 16th birthday, Anis completed “Project Red”, a rich 
    skirt of a gloriously warm shade. It fell to her ankles, with a lift at one 
    side showing white petticoats. Surely once the tribe saw her in this they 
    would realise how silly it had been to ban red from everyday clothing. It 
    far surpassed the beauty of any other skirt in the camp, and was almost a 
    rival for the wedding gowns that were tucked away in the women’s clothing 
    boxes, only to be gazed upon, only to be worn but once.<br>
    <br>
    She wrapped up her skirt and tucked it away, a plan brewing.<br>
    <br>
    Yishwan was busy outside, a birthday was a wonderful excuse for a party, and 
    they had happened upon two other Romani tribes just yesterday, so a patshiv 
    was planned to coincide with his daughters birthday, perhaps he could find 
    someone willing to marry her from Pitivo or Ferka’s Vatra.<br>
    <br>
    A large clearing had been found in a nearby forest, and the three clans had 
    moved their vardo into it and surrounding it. A giant hearth had been built 
    to one side and the young men had all gone hunting for fresh game. The women 
    sat happily in a large group, trading stories and sewing gowns of rich 
    blues, greens and yellows, all colours, except one. Anis sat sewing too, a 
    pretty dress of deep blue and green, which she claimed she would wear at the 
    party.<br>
    <br>
    On the morning of the patshiv, Anis and Yishwan exited their vardo and went 
    to the breakfast fire. Yishwan looked a little grey and Anis was worried. He 
    was getting old and she dreaded the day of his passing. She ran back to the 
    vardo and fetched a blanket which she wrapped around his still broad 
    shoulders, then she fed him hot oats, smothered with honey.<br>
    <br>
    “Thank you, Anis, you are my strength.” Love shone through his eyes as he 
    gazed up at his girl. With breakfast seen to, the women of the tribes 
    prepared the camp for the festivities to come before each scuttling off to 
    change into their patshiv gowns.<br>
    <br>
    Anis dressed quickly and looked into the long mirror that Yishwan had 
    acquired for her some years earlier. The skirt was warm, and heavy with 
    velvets and silks. Her blouse was of pure white cotton and displayed a 
    little cleavage. A brown leather belt wrapped her waist. She smiled at her 
    reflection and then frowned slightly, peering closer, she noticed a strange 
    mark at her temple, a small brownish line. She looked on the rest of her 
    body and found similar tracings on her left arm, hand and shoulder. They 
    were very faint against her slightly olive skin. Sighing, she decided to 
    ignore them for now, today was a party day, Mala could have a look tomorrow 
    once she had finished seeing to all the inevitable hangovers.<br>
    <br>
    She stood at the door and waited until she could hear the voices of the 
    women rejoining the camp, then she opened the door and stepped out.<br>
    <br>
    Silence greeted her. Then a woman from one of the other camps stepped 
    forward, “My child, you look beautiful. Mala, why did you not tell us there 
    was to be a wedding today?”<br>
    <br>
    Face bright red, Mala ran forward and put an arm around Anis. “It was meant 
    to be a surprise,” she smiled through gritted teeth, “Anis, return to your 
    vardo now while I sort this out.” She pinched Anis hard on the arm, spun her 
    around and propelled her back to the caravan. Yishwan, face ashen, followed 
    behind.<br>
    <br>
    He collapsed to the ground as he lifted his foot to the first step of his 
    caravan, a wrenching cough tearing its way out of his throat, bringing blood 
    and spittle with it. Horror stricken, Anis collapsed to the ground at his 
    side, holding his head as she had done as a child, tears streaming down her 
    face. Koti and some others carefully carried him to Mala’s caravan and 
    placed him on her bed, Anis hovered as the witch began to treat him.<br>
    <br>
    “He has a fever, Anis, where has he been recently?”<br>
    <br>
    Anis frowned as she tried to remember, she had been so caught up in her own 
    project that she had been paying very little attention to Yishwan and his 
    movements. “Yesterday was spent hunting for the party. I think he stayed 
    around camp the day before. A couple of days back he and some others helped 
    a village with a blocked dam. When he isn’t hunting, he’s usually spending 
    time with the children, teaching them to make things from wood and telling 
    them stories.” Anis stifled a sob as Yishwan began coughing again.<br>
    <br>
    Anis and Mala forgot the party and forgot the skirt, as they spent all night 
    by Yishwan’s side. By morning, they were both exhausted. <br>
    <br>
    Mala opened the caravan door and looked out over the camp; it looked as if 
    the party had gone ahead as planned. Mala allowed a small smile to cross her 
    lips, “Time to get my hangover cure brewing. Anis, I’ll be back as soon as I 
    can, call me if there is any change.” She reached back into the vardo and 
    grabbed her herb bag.<br>
    <br>
    Soon there was a large cauldron steaming over the breakfast hearth, as one 
    by one, the revellers awoke and made their bleary way to the fire. Mala, and 
    some of the women who were not incapacitated from their nights excesses, fed 
    and watered the suffering with warm smiles and jests aplenty. It had been a 
    fine night, and the incident of Anis and her skirt seemed to have been 
    forgotten. Mala swore to not let the girl set foot out of her vardo until 
    she was properly attired.<br>
    <br>
    “Mala, come quick, Oaste is ill!” Lina shouted from the steps of her vardo, 
    Mala grinned and grabbed a bowl of her cure.<br>
    <br>
    “Here Lina, this should have him right in no time.” The young woman smiled 
    gratefully at the Chovexani and hurried back inside.<br>
    <br>
    As the morning progressed, Mala had to deliver bowls to six of Kori’s Vatra, 
    she muttered darkly under her breath about her tribe being an embarrassment, 
    and not being able to hold their drink. She checked on Yishwan as often as 
    she could, but there was no sign of improvement, despite her ministrations, 
    he seemed to be getting weaker and weaker as the day passed. She didn’t have 
    the heart to berate Anis about her skirt now, the young woman had barely 
    moved from her father’s side, and had yet to get some sleep. Mala brought 
    her a cup of tea as the sun moved past noon, and watched as the girl slipped 
    into a deep and dreamless sleep.<br>
    <br>
    When Anis awoke, the sky outside was the deep red of sunset. She looked down 
    at the old man beside her, took his cold hand in her own, and held it 
    tightly. She closed his eyes and kissed him softly on each cheek as the 
    tears fell once more.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    The cold night bit deep into my blanket when I finally left the camp, left 
    the family I had always known and loved. Nothing seemed real to me then, and 
    not for many of the years to follow. As I rode, as I walked, as I slept, as 
    I worked, Malas’ words would run continually through my head.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    The plague hit swift and hard, first among the vardo of Kori’s vatra, and 
    within a couple of days, the other two tribes. The handful of men who had 
    been unable to get up after the party, were soon found to be suffering from 
    more than the drink. But they were young and strong, they wouldn’t stay down 
    for long. The ox like leader, Kori fell ill on the second day, along with 
    almost all the children.<br>
    <br>
    Over taxed, Mala sent to the nearby village for help, only to find that they 
    too were suffering from this plague. The other two tribes, decided to stay 
    and help, a gift that was rarely offered at times like these. Romani tribes 
    were very insular, only coming together rarely for meetings of judgement or 
    the rare patshiv. Their gift did not go unpaid and what befell the gathering 
    highlighted why a separatist lifestyle was the safest way to live, and why 
    there were so many rules that the people were expected to know, understand 
    and live by. Unfortunately for Anis, this lesson had remained unlearned.<br>
    <br>
    The deaths started three days after Yishwan’s loss, the old being first to 
    fall, soon followed by the babes and young children. Some few survived, the 
    fever would break, and they slowly began to recover, Mala, unexpectedly, was 
    among them. Kori died, leaving a 9 year old son as the new Rom Baro, with so 
    few older men to guide him, he turned to the elders of the other two tribes. 
    By this time, almost half of both camps had died, and the pyres burned long 
    and deep.<br>
    <br>
    Anis did all she could to help, remaining untouched by the plague herself. 
    The weeks went by and slowly but surely the number of new cases decreased 
    and the deaths slowed down. After almost two full moons, the remaining 
    elders held a meeting, the young Rom Baro, Besnic in attendance. They talked 
    long into the night, and half way through the following day. Anis waited for 
    Mala to return, worried for the old woman who was still very tired after the 
    stresses of the plague.<br>
    <br>
    That evening, the elders returned, and gathered the remainder of the three 
    tribes into the centre of the camps. Young Betnic, Pitivo, who had survived 
    and the new Rom Baro of Ferka’s Vatra, a man in his mid twenties named Loiza, 
    all stepped forward and clasped hands. Betnic addressed his people.<br>
    <br>
    “I am young, too young, there are only a handful left of my farthers Vatra. 
    I step down as Rom Baro.<br>
    <br>
    Pitivo then spoke, “I am old and I am weary. I have lost all that I hold 
    dear. I step down as Rom Baro.”<br>
    <br>
    Loiza stepped forward. “I am young, I am healthy, I will lead my people and 
    help them face the hard times ahead. Now, and only now I will offer all here 
    a home within my Vatra. We sit here united in pain and death, you are all my 
    family.” He held out his hand, “Come take my hand if you accept my offer.”<br>
    <br>
    Pitivo took the hand first, followed by Betnic. Loiza spoke once more, “I 
    have no son, nor a wife, no more,” his eyes darkened with pain, “Betnic, 
    would you allow me to adopt you? Despite your youth, you have proven 
    yourself as wise and strong, I would be proud to have you as my heir.”<br>
    <br>
    Betnic’s face lit up, and for the first time in weeks, he looked his age, 
    the people clapped and cheered in approval. Mala watched from the side, 
    sadness etched deeply into every line of her face, but a small touch of 
    pride briefly lit her eyes as she looked on her new leader.<br>
    <br>
    The survivors formed a line, and one by one approached the new leader and 
    intoned, “Please accept me into your Vatra.”<br>
    <br>
    Loiza took each hand, “You are welcome into my camp and as part of my camp.”<br>
    <br>
    Finally it was Anis’ turn, face dirty, clothes smudged, the red of her skirt 
    barely visible under a thick layer of grime, she held out her hand to Loiza. 
    “Please accept me into your Vatra.”<br>
    <br>
    Loiza looked down at the girl, sorrow in his eyes, then turned his back, the 
    old leaders, and the elders followed suit, Mala among them. Loiza spoke, 
    “You have been found to be mahrime, you will leave this camp and never 
    return, your name will be added to the list of pikies and no Rom Baro shall 
    welcome you into his Vatra. You have flaunted our traditions time and time 
    again, and here you stand before me in a red skirt and offer me a dirty 
    hand, you have no pride. Collect your belongings and leave.”<br>
    <br>
    Stricken, Anis ran over to Mala and fell to her knees at the old woman’s 
    feet. “Mala? Mother? Tell him I can stay. Please?”<br>
    <br>
    It took every ounce of determination that Mala owned for her to turn her 
    back on the young woman at her feet, a young woman she had loved as a 
    daughter and a young woman who had suffered as much as anyone else in the 
    camp, but the decision had been made, and judgement called. Anis was unclean 
    and probably responsible for the plague that had decimated the three tribes. 
    Mithras had been tolerant for a long time, the red skirt must have been the 
    final straw and he struck them down for harbouring the mahrime creature in 
    their midst. Mala held back the tears while Anis wailed in hurt, frustration 
    and anger.<br>
    <br>
    The tribe walked away from the weeping young woman and retired to the fire, 
    to talk softly and drink and mourn the dead.<br>
    <br>
    Finally Anis picked herself up from the ground and entered first her father 
    Vatra, gathering together a few clothes, and the pieces of jewellery that 
    had been her mothers. She also picked up a heavy gold ring that had been 
    Yishwan’s. A ring he had stopped wearing the day his wife had died. She then 
    went to Mala’s Vatra, and gathered up the odds and ends that had been left 
    there over the years. A small wooden doll that Yishwan had made her, a herb 
    pouch that Mala had given her the day she had first began her lessons. On 
    Mala’s bed lay the old cloth satchel that Anis had used to gather herbs, she 
    tipped her meagre belongings into it and left.<br>
    <br>
    -<br>
    <br>
    I couldn’t bear to travel too far that night, so I watched from the outside 
    of the camp as Mala told all the stories she had written about me and my 
    life with them. I heard them talking about me after the stories were told, 
    their talk of my strangeness and the marks that had began to show on my 
    body. They speculated about my origins and decided that I had probably 
    always been mahrime, I listened and the tears kept coming. I slept with the 
    dogs that night, and the next, sneaking into the Vatra on the third night, 
    after all had gone to sleep and filling my bag with what food I could carry. 
    I stole a horse, and I left. As unready to begin a new life as anyone could 
    be.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <b><font size="4">Part One</font></b><br>
    <br>
    I was alone for a long time. I spent five years travelling the mountains of 
    Brenna and the lands beyond. Occasionally I would come across a Romani 
    tribe, in shame I would turn my horse and we would run.<br>
    <br>
    I never had to do without, on the fifth day of my exile I discovered the 
    coin and gems that Mala had left in my bag for me. That was my happiest day 
    for a very long time, knowing that despite everything, the old woman still 
    cared. So I survived those first few months surprisingly well, with enough 
    coin for food and accommodation. I worked when I could, in taverns and 
    farms, wherever an extra pair of hands was needed. <br>
    <br>
    Eventually I travelled beyond the mountains I knew so well eventually 
    stopping at a small town just outside Berlyn, there I manage to get a 
    permanent job as a serving girl in a tavern called the Tippling Troll. It 
    was rough, but I did rather well there. The owner was called Gustav, he ran 
    the place with his wife who was an excellent cook. They both took to me 
    quite quickly and accepted me almost as part of the family.<br>
    <br>
    Before I started working there, the place was a den for brawling, but things 
    slowly calmed down until finally Gustav was able to cut down from four 
    bouncers to just one. I loved to do the rounds of tables, laughing with the 
    customers, it was a fine few years. </p>
