<p><font size="6"><b>Chaos </b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHAOS NEVER DIED. Primordial uncarved block, sole worshipful monster, inert
&amp; spontaneous, more ultraviolet than any mythology , the original undifferentiated oneness-of-being still radiates serene
as the black pennants of Assassins, random &amp; perpetually intoxicated. Chaos
comes before all principles of order &amp; entropy, it's neither a god nor a
maggot, its idiotic desires encompass &amp; define every possible choreography,
all meaningless aethers &amp; phlogistons: its masks are crystallizations of its
own facelessness, like clouds.</p>
<p>Everything in nature is perfectly real including consciousness, there's
absolutely nothing to worry about. Not only have the chains of the Law been
broken, they never existed; demons never guarded the stars, the Empire never got
started, Eros never grew a beard.</p>
<p>No, listen, what happened was this: they lied to you, sold you ideas of good
&amp; evil, gave you distrust of your body &amp; shame for your prophethood of
chaos, invented words of disgust for your molecular love, mesmerized you with
inattention, bored you with civilization &amp; all its usurious emotions.</p>
<p>There is no becoming, no revolution, no struggle, no path; already you're the
monarch of your own skin--your inviolable freedom waits to be completed only by
the love of other monarchs: a politics of dream, urgent as the blueness of sky.</p>
<p>To shed all the illusory rights &amp; hesitations of history demands the
economy of some legendary Stone Age--shamans not priests, bards not lords,
hunters not police, gatherers of paleolithic laziness, gentle as blood, going
naked for a sign or painted as birds, poised on the wave of explicit presence,
the clockless nowever.</p>
<p>Agents of chaos cast burning glances at anything or anyone capable of bearing
witness to their condition, their fever of lux et voluptas. I am awake only in
what I love &amp; desire to the point of terror--everything else is just
shrouded furniture, quotidian anaesthesia, shit-for-brains, sub-reptilian ennui
of totalitarian regimes, banal censorship &amp; useless pain.</p>
<p>Avatars of chaos act as spies, saboteurs, criminals of amour fou, neither
selfless nor selfish, accessible as children, mannered as barbarians, chafed
with obsessions, unemployed, sensually deranged, wolfangels, mirrors for
contemplation, eyes like flowers, pirates of all signs &amp; meanings.</p>
