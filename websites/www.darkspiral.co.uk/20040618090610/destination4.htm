    <br>
    I guess I've only got myself to blame, though things could be worse - I'm 
    not dead yet.<p>Hello, my name is Dolores Trent, and I am a failure.<br>
    <br>
    My family was proud of their lineage, Flesh Mechanics and Pharmacists, 
    father to son, mother to daughter, stretching back through time, even before 
    the E.L.E.<br>
    <br>
    We used to travel, helping wherever we could (for a small fee of course). We 
    were proud, we were respected. People used to cheer when they saw us coming.<br>
    <br>
    My first crime was a pathetic thing, I fought to overcome it, I really did, 
    but what use is a Flesh Mechanic who can't stand the sight of blood eh? So I 
    was handed over to Aunt Hilda after some basic theoretical medical training.
    <br>
    <br>
    With Auntie H. I found my niche, I loved finding and testing the new mutated 
    plants for any medicinal values. It was during this time that I invented…<br>

        <p align="center"><i><b><font size="4">DT's Amazing Flocinophilifactor<br>

    <p>At last I had made my family proud, until they discovered my second crime 
    that is. The Flocinophilifactor is a highly dilute compound of three common 
    plants in a liquid base (sorry the recipe is a family secret). Unfortunately 
    the pure version is extremely addictive – oops - DT is now a junkie and once 
    again shames the entire family.<br>
    <br>
    Now this has all been pretty amusing so far, if only to the casual observer, 
    cousin Dook got a real laugh out of it and held book on what I would do next 
    to screw up. <br>
    <br>
    So, life trundled on with all the family happily making rich with my potion, 
    whilst watching me closely for future crimes.<br>
    <br>
    One day we arrived at a settlement with the usual expectations, you know, 
    broken bones, gunshot wounds and the usual variety of crabs, lice and 
    maladies, but things were a little different this time. We weren't greeted 
    with the usual cheers, no, the first thing we see is a blood soaked mound 
    crawling towards us mumbling incoherently. Of course mom, pops and the rest 
    go running over to help. Me? I'm headed off in the other direction, this is 
    way too gruesome. What I don't notice in my panicked flight is this weird 
    looking hill I'm headed towards, at least not until I'm lying face down in a 
    mound of dead, blood-soaked, tongues lolling, eyeballs bulging, ex-people. 
    Of course by the time this sinks in to my drug soaked brain I've blacked 
    out.<br>
    <br>
    I don't know how long I was out for, Auntie H. found me and dumped me in the 
    wagon. When I came to I was fit for nothing ‘cause as luck would have it I 
    was having the worse case of the DT's ever. I started to scream and Auntie H 
    must have heard me and realised what was wrong ‘cause she soon got me fixed 
    up again, good and proper. <br>
    <br>
    The next few days were a bit weird for me. I couldn't bring myself to leave 
    the wagon, I knew what was out there and was having nothing to do with it. 
    Auntie H. kept me informed though. By the time the family had all got to the 
    crawling thing it was too late so they started to search the settlement 
    (finding my dead friends and me in the process). There was not one living 
    human left, plenty animals and birds and the likes, but over 30 dead, men 
    and women, young and old - all bled out with swollen tongues and bulging 
    eyes. So as they are want to do, they took some samples and tried to find 
    out what happened.<br>
    <br>
    Two days later the screaming started. Then the moaning. Then nothing - 
    silence. It took me another day to pluck up the guts to look outside. It 
    took me three minutes to grab my gear and start running.<br>
    <br>
    So finally to the cherry on my particularly juicy cake. </p>
    <p>Two and a half years ago I decided it was time to clean up my act, so I 
    found an old cave and took myself and a supply of food and harmless 
    sedatives in with me, I was determined, I knew I could do it. The DT's 
    started, but I held on, the pain started but I held on, I started sweating 
    blood… Ran outside and dug up my hidden stash and got a fix. The shakes 
    stopped, the pain stopped, the bleeding stopped. My tongue, which had 
    started to swell, came slowly down to its normal size and the pressure 
    behind my eyes eased. <br>
    <br>
    My crowning glory, I'd discovered a cure for the disease that killed my 
    family, years before they needed it and was STILL too late to save them.<br>
    <br>
    Ain't life just grand?<br>
