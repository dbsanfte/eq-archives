    <td width="422" valign="top">She was born into a family that despised her
      due to her innate magical abilities, which were obvious even at an early
      age. They were a simple family with little need for the expense of one
      such as her. Cast out at the age of 6 she wandered the streets, hiding in
      corners and under rubbish to keep from eyes that might hurt her. Until one
      day a kindly dark elven face appeared almost from nowhere, as she was
      accustomed to being aware of her surroundings, and asked her her name. 'Nirissi'
      she hesitantly replied. 'Come with me child, you have a great deal to
      learn and we have lost much time.'
      <p>From that day he taught her all of the arcane art of enchanting. He
      told her her duties in this world and of its dangers. She progressed
      quickly, faltering in some studies but his guiding hand was always there
      to catch her. He listened to her tales of early childhood and fuelled her
      hatred for them. Soon she learned to hate well as all dark elves should,
      but in a strange twist years later he suddenly started to teach her of
      compassion for others. Confused she stuck this out as long as she could
      until the hatred in her erupted. Storming into his inner study her hatred
      overcame her, words filled with venom flowed from her mouth as she
      motioned with arcane gestures, the blast took Garuun by surprise and he
      fell to the ground limp.</p>
      <p>She continued her studies on her own until she came across a woman who
      emanated intrigue and mystery. Nirissi learned this was Rhiannah, The Lady
      Spiral, leader of a small group of like minded people. The belief was
      simple in its raw essence, all is chaos and all will return to chaos.
      Feeling at home with the Dark Spiral, Nirissi soon became The Mistress of
      Pain as her true nature was revealed and the original training of Garuun
      reaffirmed . She knows not if Garuun N'Darr is alive or dead and a small
      part of her cares little either way.</p>
      <p>But that other part of her.....</td>
