    Rhiannah shivered. The dark of the night seemed to seep into every bone, 
    tears glistened in the moonlight. One full day ago she thought she had died, 
    now she wished she had. Naked and hungry she continued crawling into the 
    night, every muscle in her body, screaming its agony. She had covered this 
    patch of ground many times, yet still she hoped for some sign that her love 
    and companion was still alive, even his body would be better than this... 
    nothing.<br>
    <br>
    She huddled in on herself as the winds picked up, then continued searching. 
    Soon, even crawling became impossible, the winds grew stonger and stonger 
    until it felt as if she were trying to break through a solid stone wall. It 
    was time to give in. She lay down on the cold wet grass and let the storm 
    take her.<br>
    <br>
    Oblivion.<br>
    <br>
    She awoke with a start, back in the old, abandoned hut, she and Pliskyn had 
    used for shelter when they first arrived. She stood up and looked around, 
    the sun shone brightly through the broken door. A new feeling began to seep 
    into her soul. Resolution. It was time to move on, she would not die today.<br>
    <br>
    She made her way to the town of Freeport, a busy place full of corruption 
    and greed, she felt drawn to the chaos of it, in a way she could not 
    understand. That night she slept in the eastern part of the town, under on 
    old wrecked caravan. She dreamt of storms, of a great vortex reaching down 
    to her from the black sky.<br>
    <br>
    It didn't take long to esatablish herself in her new home, she took a room 
    at an inn and made money from hunting. She began to meet new people and make 
    new friends, oddly, all of which set off a resonace in her that reminded her 
    of her continuing dreams of the storm.<br>
    <br>
    Inspired by these dreams, she called her friends together and told them her 
    visions, of a great storm, sweeping the lands and casting all into chaos, 
    how she felt that this was how things were meant to be, how all of them had 
    a place in this maelstrom of events...<br>

    Dark Spiral was born.</td>
