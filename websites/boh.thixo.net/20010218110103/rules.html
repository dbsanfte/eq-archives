<blockquote><P>
  <I>
	This calendar represents a player agreement of the lvl 46+ players on the Rathe. No player or guild is
	excluded. Set forth before you is the agreement that was borne of much time, effort and
	discussion. It is ever changing as is the face of Norrath herself.  As new characters come of age to
	venture to the planes they are invited to read the rules ask questions understand the guidelines and
	reserve dates. Then add comments run for admin positions etc.
<P>
  By taking part in this calendar you (your guild/alliance/org etc) are asking all other characters on the
	face of Norrath to yield a plane to you for a set amount of time. In return the rest of Norrath asks
	a few things of you. These things, or rules are stated below along with the intent of each.
<P>
  This endeavor to create peace and prosperity across Norrath was done in a democratic spirit. We think you
	will find nothing but respect and common sense in these rules. We invite comments and criticism. However
	always keep in mind that balancing the needs of the many against the needs of the few is not an easy
	thing to do. Please be kind with your criticism of the system.	Try to show some respect for those who
	have given of themselves time and effort away from the game.  
<P>
  Lastly let me assure you there are consequences for violating this agreement. They may range from being
	banned from posting new raids for any amount of time, to having already posted raids in other planes
	deleted. This is also done in a democratic style. If you think that something you are doing may be in violation
	or may APPEAR to be in violation I recommend giving  a /tell to another raid leader. I leave you with these words,
	courtesy of Edwina Nytengayle:

			<IMG SRC="rainball.gif" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALT="">&nbsp;Minimum number of plane-able characters:<BR>
        <blockquote>To make a reservation your guild/group/alliance must consist of a minimum of 40 characters of 46+.<br></blockquote>
			<P>
			  <I><U>Intent:</U>
				 This number was reached because of the huge number of players above lvl 46 on the Rathe. It is not
				 feasible to reserve with less due the huge amounts of time between reservations, and the unkilled mobs that arose in the past.
				 You do not need to have 40 in the plane, you need to have 40 to reserve. You are free to form alliances
				 with others or with independents, but a minimum of 40 need to have their "turn" in the plane taken care of
				 for each reservation. They are allowed to be multiple accounts but they may NOT be of another "reserving entity*
				 or alts.</I>
			<P>&nbsp;<P>
			<IMG SRC="rainball.gif" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALT="">&nbsp;Guests<BR>
			  <blockquote>You may invite whoever you wish along on your raids, as long as no more than 6 come from the same guild</blockquote>
			<P> 		   
			  <I><U>Intent:</U>
				This was probably the hardest rule to nail down. Please read this intent part very carefully so that
				you understand what the violations are.<BR> Of course you may invite friends on raids. Because you need
				the class, because they are good friends, because you need help, or because you don't want loot to
				rot. What you may NOT do is use your relationship with another posting entity so that you all may
				go twice per round.  If you have another guild you are always teaming with, you need to form an alliance
				and in this way you are only entitled to one day per round, like everyone else. Also in this way one guild
				may not be used as a front for another guild. If you have ANY questions, or need ANY clarifications I
				highly recommend posting them early.  The more serious the violation the more serious the penalty,
				and trust me this will be the rule most closely watched.</I>

			<IMG SRC="rainball.gif" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALT="">&nbsp;Getting a Password<BR>
			  <blockquote>You must submit:<BR>
				Your organization Name<BR>
				All guilds in this organization<BR>
				The raid leaders names<BR>
				One email and/or message board/webpage link<BR>
				</blockquote>
			<P>
			  <I><U>Intent:</U>
				  This goes to communication, you will have these lists available to you, as will all other posting
					entities. You do not need to have a roster on a webpage.  If you do not have a roster available
					on a webpage then you need to submit the names, classes, and levels of the 40 characters, and they
					will be posted here. While no one expects you to keep a roster up-to-the-minute accurate you should make
					sure you have the minimum of 40 always maintained, and yes there are people out there who will
					take the time to check.</I> 
			<P>&nbsp;<P>
			<IMG SRC="rainball.gif" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALT="">&nbsp;Reservations<BR>
			   <blockquote>Each posting entity may hold one and only one reservation to each plane at any time.<BR>
				 Fear and Hate reservations consist of a single day.<BR>
				 Sky raids consist of 2 consecutive days, with the exception of Sat/Sun. <BR>
				 The ownership (for lack of a better word) changes from one entity to another at 2 am Pacific Time. Your guild 
				 and all their guests are expected to be out of the plane by then.
				 (if someone could post the GMT for this so I can add it ... thanks)</blockquote>
			<P>
			  <I><U>Intent:</U> Sky raids can actually be done sharing a Saturday. The coding of the calendar will
				not stop Sat/Sun raids, nor will it allow 2 groups to post for the same Saturday. These kind of arrangements
				are left in the hands of the players, and some sort of notification should be posted on the RTA board. If a
				Sat/Sun raid reservation is made without a post of this sort, it will be deleted without any notice.</I>
			<P>&nbsp;<P>
			<IMG SRC="rainball.gif" WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALT="">&nbsp;Epic Guilds<BR>
			<blockquote>If your group can not clear a plane, the responsibility falls on the reserving entity to get a hold
			of the Epic guilds.<P>To qualify as an Epic guild/alliance, your organization has to have cleared
			island 6 in the plane of sky</blockquote>
			<P>
			  <I><U>Intent:</U> A list of these Epic guilds will be available, as will the links etc of the posting entities.
				It is left to the Epic guilds how they want to take turns, but all the resources needed are here.
				Again, I highly suggest communication, ESPECIALLY If you have a god up. This epic loot is what they
				want and is what this rule is ALL about. DO NOT LEAVE THAT PLANE WITH A GOD UP. Find out which Epic guild's
				turn it is etc etc.  This is another rule where I feel violations will be highly policed. Communication
				is the key.
				<P>
				Clearing isle 6 in the plane of sky includes killing the Bixie queen. It is possible for her to despawn
				and in this way the isle is clear but the idea is you must kill her.
