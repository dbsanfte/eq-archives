Our guild admits all with a thirst for Knowledge.<br><br>We are dedicated to the three virtues of our Guild, which are;<br><br>enlightenment (through the acquisition of lore),<br><br>exploration (to see every nook and cranny of Norrath), and<br><br>entertainment (ahhh the pursuit of happiness).<br><br>Our guild does not exist to simply find friends with which to adventure (although that will certainly happen), but to provide a valuable resource to those that wish it, for we believe that in helping others you help yourself.<br><br>ENLIGHTENMENT: The quest for Lore is at the very heart of our guild. We seek to attain the Lore of our world and to pass that knowledge, in a careful and thoughtful way to others. It is our belief that through the acquisition of Lore, and the dissemination of that Knowledge to members of the guild, we can assist them in becoming renowned Lore givers of the land. All member sof the guild shall be obligated to help explore our world and attain the Lore of which we seek. Similarly, all members of our guild are entitled to receive knowledge, which continues to elude them, despite their best efforts. We do not believe in giving knowledge to one who is not ready, or to one who has not tried to acquire that Lore for themselves, for Knowledge is power. Lore and power achieved through effort rather than simply given teaches respect for that Knowledge and power.<br><br>EXPLORATION: our world is vast. We cannot afford to ignore the potential locked deep within the world in which we live. We believe strongly in the exploration of our world. Exploration leads to enlightenment and also to the education of others. It also contributes to the growth of the individual who has decided to leave home in search of far off lands. It cannot be described how important exploration is to our guild. In addition to exploring our world, we need to explore our our skills and crafts. Our guild grows stronger as our members explore and find new lore, for it is lore, skills and crafts, which define our guild members.<br><br>ENTERTAINMENT: last but certainly not least, let it not be said that the guild members of THE HAND dont know how to have a good time! We are strong hearty folk and our guild embraces these qualities. Let the fun begin!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A Guild of Friends:<br><br>Guild members should at all times attempt to be friendly and co-operative with other members. Also showing respect for other members in the way they wish to play, their personal beliefs and attitudes, and the way they conduct themselves (language or behaviour).<br><br>The Generous Guild:<br><br>Guild members are encouraged to be generous to other members, be this in the form of items, or in time and patience. Generosity promotes co-operation and loyalty, and a feeling of good will that may well be returned at some other time. Any generosity can only improve the guilds position, and the enjoyment of its members. Members should support the concept of &quot;it is better to give than it is to receive&quot;.<br><br>Always Remember:<br><br>ITS A GAME! Although this is sometimes forgotten it remains a fact that 90% of your enjoyment in playing this game comes from others. Be that in the form of showing others your new loot to gain their admiration or praise, be that from simply discussing your adventures or failures, be that screaming at the world because some idiot got you killed. WHO DO YOU CALL! US! When things go wrong it is your fellow guild members who will comisserate with you, when things go right it will be your fellow guild members who will shout for joy with you. The GAME is merely a vehicle via which you enjoy yourself with others, it is the others who make it fun! Thats the whole attraction of multi-player games. It is the people, not the loot! (and if you think differently then you shouldnt be in this guild).<br><br>Ethics and Behaviour.<br><br>Kill stealing, training and any other BANNABLE offence is grounds for immediate removal from the guild, without warning, reveiew can be conducted after the fact.<br><br>Members of a guild are expected to be friendly, co-operative and generous with each other. If you cant manage that then why are you here?<br><br>Bad behaviour, as determined by the guild officers, will result in warning to those offending, and possible removal from the guild.<br><br>Foul language will be tolerated in short bursts, assuming it is related to some event that has provoked you to express yourself in that manner.<br><br>Foul language as a general manner of speech will NOT be tolerated. Members will NOT be required to use FILTER, you will be asked to speak suitably, failure will result in removal.<br><br>Guild Officers.<br><br>Officers: will be appointed by the GL(s) in consultation with the membership. Their continued occupation of the office will be reviewed based on their performance.<br><br>One officers will be changed at the beginning of every season (summer etc), to allow the guild to experience alternative views :-).<br><br>An officer is there to protect &quot;The Hand&quot; from harm, either to its members or to its &quot;whole&quot;. Officers will be required to protect the reputation and integrity of The Hand above that of the individual... the rights of the many outwiegh the rights of the few, or the one. Officers are there to enforce the agreed rules of the guild, and to ensure the harmony of its members. They are there to help organise, to advise, to direct and generally be a point of contact for members and non-members. Officers are to implement and protect agree guild policy. <br><br>Officers are to take names of any member who insults the GLs helmet or bum. Officers are to ensure &quot;PLAN C&quot; is carried out at least once per raid.<br><br>Non-Officer Positions:<br><br>Guild Banker will remain Drudin. ON guild raids all gems and unallocated loot should be pass to Drudin or an officer.<br><br>Guild Point of Contact (Liaison) will be Gelenor, please direct all enquiries to Mr Nice Guy.<br><br>LEAVING THE GUILD.<br><br>If you drop the guild for some reason (other than a game bug) you are on your own. You will require a complete new application. Further all your alts will be removed asap. Simple solution: LOG before you guildremove.<br><br>If you wish to leave the guild for a time then this is allowed, post on the forums and let everyone know before hand and roughly how long. Re-entry will be automatic.<br><br>Rules and Regulations<br><br>When called upon by a guild member for help, those members within reasonable reach will give help. Ie if you can get there quickly and not have to go through areas that will kill you automatically on the way (this excuse will not be abused by the way).<br><br>If a person less than 6th level asks you for information you will give it freely and concisely, or refer that person on to another guild member currently online.<br><br>If a person over 5th level requests information you will give it at a cost commensurate with the time it takes (ie guiding someone somewhere) and the level of the person asking; ie a 6th level, non-tweaked, character should only be asked for a donation. On the other hand a high level character should be able to donate a reasonable amount of money (this amount is left entirely upto the individual guild member, however extortion will not be tolerated).<br><br>Member to members, will make equipment available either free or at a discounted price. Once a member has an item they wish to sell, they should offer it first to other members, allowing four (4) days for replies (unless you are desperate for cash). The item offering system will run through a central email account, which has been created specificially for the guild. Dissemination of this information will happen on a daily basis.<br><br>Help your fellow members at all times. If a young member (newbie) requires small monetary assitance give it freely, its swings and merry-go-rounds folks. Your assistance will be returned ten fold.<br><br>Promote the &quot;Talk to The Hand&quot; motto whenever possible<br><br>NEW MEMBERS<br><br>Probation: none<br><br>Loot restrictions: inherent in the Ace Awards System<br><br>Interview: all applicants will be interviewed by an Officer before being recruited. They will need to know the answers to questions about the guild and its nature (re Charter).<br><br>Service: applicants may be requested to perform services for an officer, this can be in the form of a quest or just a request. Successful services should be recorded against their application by the relevant officer.<br><br>Sponsor: any current member may sponsor a new member.<br><br>Veto: any current member may veto, a single veto stops your entry immediately. Veto's require NO EXPLANATION, someone may just dislike your name. A veto can be reversed however by continued efforts and good work.<br><br>Join requirements: 75% of OFFICERS (only) must support the nominee.<br><br>Needed Class Policy: no<br><br>Needed level policy: no (but as most officers are 50+....)<br><br>LOOT GUIDELINES<br><br>For Guild Events only.<br><br>Are you a member in &quot;good&quot; standing.<br><br>Do you meet announced requirements (Specific raids only)<br><br>Can your class/race use it? <br>Is it better than what you already have? <br>Do you intend to use it? <br><br>Those who qualify roll.<br><br>If NO ONE qualifies:<br><br>The GL/RL, in consultation, will allocate. The item will be held until such time by the Loothoarder or an Officer (exception No Drop items). Such items may be kept by the guild for trade purposes, or they may be assigned to a deserving member.<br><br>Members should consider the intent of the guild charter when receiving items at Events. If you win a nice item and another who rolled against you could use the item you are replacing, it would be nice if you could arrange a swap with them, a Generous Guild.<br><br>Removal from the Guild<br><br>As noted above, members may find themselves removed from the guild. <br><br>I) Before a /guildremoval an officer should turn &quot;/log ON&quot; and issue a warning to offending members. This warning should be done by direct /tell to save loss of &quot;face&quot;. <br><br>II) If the target member is unresponsive then a second warning of &quot;/guildremoval imminent&quot; should be sent. <br><br>III) If still offending then the officer should carry out the action, and should then post the log and comments into the officers forum for discussion with all other officers. <br><br>IV) A guild removal at this level will be an &quot;interim removal&quot;. After the officers have discussed the matter, which will hopefully involve a discussion with the member involved, it will become a &quot;terminal removal&quot;, or the member will be offered a &quot;return to the guild on 30 days probation&quot;, or maybe an immediate return if circumstances mitigate.<br><br>V) It possible discuss your problem with any other officers online at the time, keep them informed.<br><br>I would like it clearly understood that removal will not always be permanent, that members can be removed simply because that is the only method we have available within the game system to control their actions and protect the reputation of the guild as a whole<br><br>Unofficial and Secret Clauses<br><br>All members are required to implement &quot;Plan C&quot; whenever it is appropriate.<br><br><br>Quack.<br><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/userendiptiy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serendiptiy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.austwiz.com/eq/images/handicon.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/30/01 3:34:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#013B3D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/userendiptiy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serendiptiy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.austwiz.com/eq/images/handicon.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/22/01 10:56:55 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.austwiz.com/eq/images/smallseren.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Leaving the Guild and Rejoining.</span><hr size=1> Members may ask for a Leave of Absence from the Guild at anytime. Merely advise and officer (and make sure they confirm you) and post on the forums. LOA will normally be for upto 1 month. Re-admission to the guild will be automatic on request.<br><br>If you drop the guild for any other reason (other than a game bug), you will be required to re-apply in full. Thus you will need a new sponsor and 2 supporting members, and to survive the 7 day period without be blackbanned by anyone. Further, your alts will be removed from the guild as well.  <br><br>Do not remove yourself from the guild rashly!
