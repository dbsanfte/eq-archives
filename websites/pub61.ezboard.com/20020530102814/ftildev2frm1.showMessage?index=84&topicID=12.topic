Your right it was my fault. I'm sorry I'm not real smart. I'm very slow at figuring things out. I now know what you meant by saying &quot;Our unity is what makes us great&quot; or something like that. I've thought it over a hundred times, and I think except for the nonscooting, I was the only unhonarable player yesterday. Thats ok though. Everytime I have ever seen a Tilde fall he had scooted, or I had thought he had. Thats up to you guys.   I do think it will be impossible for a Cleric or Maybe Shaman to join your guild and stay honarable. Unless we somehow just teamed with our own race. But that would take away the raid fun. I also remember that you had never asked me to offensivly oor heal you yesterday. I did it without thinking, so I was the unhonarable one. Anyway I'm very sorry I wasted your time. I'm gonna lay low, and start playing more of my Madden playstation football game and try to get my own conclusion on what is honarable and what is not. I am very slow. Please don't hate me for that. Looking back now this was all in my face, and I never saw it. Ketrick of RR mentioned the oor healing and one of your own mentioned the unity. I'm very stupid. The good of me is that I am as truthful as i can be, and try to be as honarable as I can and have been taught.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/umanaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manaw</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Guild Asshole</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#939393>(5/21/02 7:33:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/ftildev2frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.69megs.com/pages/manawtz/EQ000765.jpg height=180 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's back.   8O</span><hr size=1> Ta Ta. <p>Hmm

On the scooting. I didn't know that the killers were unhonarable people. I understand the eye for an eye thing. RR was considering doing that. Kantrae explained to me that you don't scoot for previusly unhonerable people. That was very nice of Kantrae. Most leaders dont take the time to reach out to people in the game. At this time I don't think I could be honarable in your guild. As a healer. I'm affraid i would hurt your good name. I'm not experienced enough to be able to decide when not to heal my guildees. I would break down and end up imune healing. I heard this is not dishonarable, but isn't to nice anyway. Anyway I didn't mean to slap you in the face. I have been on an insane guild search lately. I wasn't slapped in the face because you guys are indeed honarable. If bored you can read below about how I had thought I had been slapped in the face. I hope you can understand...<br>
<br>
<br>
    Earlier in the day your Rogue was attacked. Forgot his name. I tried to help him kill a pesky bard, but we failed, The Bard got help from a wizzy and another Bard. Your Rogue took out the wizzy in seconds, but I also was owned in seconds. The higher bard cc'd me. For helping Tilde. This Bard was full of lies about how dishonarable Tilde was. I spent a good hour arguing with her in ooc even after I got my corpse back. I have also told people countless times how they were wrong and Tilde was honarable. <br>
    Later that night I take the plunge and Tilde accepts me. In less than four hours, I have seen two Tildes not scoot, and I offensivley invuln healed once. Although I was wrong about the scooting, I thought Tilde was unhonerable. Actually I was the only unhonarable person that night. <br>
    Even though I was wrong, can you imagine how bad it hurts to argue a point, and get CC'd only to join, and think you were wrong? <br>
    All of this probably doesn't make sence, but I hope you can see how I thought I was the one slapped in the face. <br>
     Anyway I apoligise Sir Tildes. I bow before you honarable ones. Take care. Happy hunting. Hope this makes sence.<br>
     BTW. I was rolplaying when I called Ryokie a evil Rogue. Guess to sensitive a time to do that. I have called many people evil and disease spreaders, and other stuff. Did not mean any of this personally. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/ukantraetz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KantraeTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I wish I was a Gnome ;(</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#939393>(5/25/02 7:33:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/ftildev2frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's back.   8O</span><hr size=1> Unless you join a all human guild you will be asked to oor and invuln heal.  The fact is there is no decision wether healing in the situation iss right or wrong, you just defend your guild defend guildmates it's as simple as that.  Not defending guildmates when you are a member of tilde is unacceptable.  Also don't listen to what others say about guild it's 99% of the time a one sided opinion from someone we've probably killed and took their precious exp spot or whatever.  Fact is last night we fought aq few 50+kotwr we killed them and easily could have cc'd them and ruined their evening, but we let their cleric revive them back and scoot.  THis is what pvp is about.  Not training not corpse camping.  In the end invuln healing doesn't matter unless vs a 1 team guild and even then numbers are more powerful than any cleric but that's where unity comes in.  in the end the only thing that matters is did all parties have soem sorta challenge or fun.  Griefing is not something Tilde does regularly, nor do we enjoy it, but sometimes you MUST fight fire with fire.  We've encountered guilds with numbers and levels and gear better than ours, our <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> advantage is unity. 4 teaming has only 2 advantage, class balance, and makes it much more difficult to be invuln healed on.  This won't make a difference vs a lvl 60 cleric or whatever.  It has way more disadvantages than advantages (every guild hating you, nasty rumors being spread about etc), to include that we pvp often and pk guilds(why the word is even used on this server confounds me) are often looked down upon and rumors are spread.  SO simply beleive nothign you here and listen to your guild.  And stop ruining my fvcking thread make a new one! <p>Kantrae Kanttank~Teir`dal Warrior
