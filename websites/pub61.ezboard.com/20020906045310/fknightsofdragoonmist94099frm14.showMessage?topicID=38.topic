Only one problem i'm the only one who post raids when it really shouldn't be like that , yeah granted i'm guild leader but does that mean i do everything ? Not to mention half the raids i post for we never get enough people to show up to them and the funny thing is the people are on /guild chat channel they just dont' feel like they should help any of their guildies i guess /shrugs .. When i created this guild i did not know it was gonna become as difficult as it has . I figured how hard could it be to get a bunch of people to raid dragons .. OMG was i in for a suprise it's very hard to get all of you together at the same time and then i had a few selfish people who only wanted to go to guild raids if it benefited them in a way .. Here's how i would like to think of us WE R ALL LEADERS in this guild don't be affraid to use the webpage to post raids you would like to do, evertime i see a raid posted on guild webpage i show up and if i cant' show up i post there to let everybody know whether or not i'm gonna make it .. So this is not just posted to U seeden this is posted for everybody to read and hopes they will try and be leaders as well .. Also i need to recruit at least two more officers so if anybody reads this and are interested pls let me know, Here are classes that we need to be recruiting a couple clerics , enchanters/bards .. I wanted to make this guild sorta like an ubber guild with less people , like instead of it taken 6 groups of lvl 50+ to raid something ubber i wanted to do it in two groups .. I think the less people the easier it is to keep things undercontrol .. So please post and let me know your thoughts ..

People look up to you even though you may not think you deserve it, they look to you for answers, they ask for advice when you might not have it... They grant successes to your favor, and most importantly tend to point at you in times of failures.<br><br>The important thing to keep in mind is Honor and Dignity.  Respect will get you darn near everything, and almost always demands loyalty.  <br><br>It seems to me you guys have a nicely ran guild with very friendly members.  I for one appreciate the help you guys have provided to us in the past.  Want my opinion on how to make the guild better?  Stick with what you are doing.  Being Uber isn't all it's cracked up to be.  As a matter of fact... 90% of the people who have left OFS to join an &quot;Uber&quot; guild no longer play the game.  Let's get together on some of these raids...

This last thought goes out to all the 50+ peeps we should stay focused even though it gets very boring sometimes but we should push on to lvl 60, Becuase at lvl 60 or even 55+ will open a whole new world for us especially since they r bringing out the new planes of power expansion, well i better cut this off getting to be to much to read sorry hehe last thought really) I would like to thank all of you for being a significant part of my everquest experience love ya all =)<br><br><br><br>Channeler KoDM<br><br><br><br><br>Z  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/utubaguyry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tubaguyry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/31/02 8:48:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fknightsofdragoonmist94099frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/41/41410/folders/22182/128862ryonas2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: YIP</span><hr size=1> Hey all. I haven't been on as much as usual the last few weeks, had a LOT of things going on all at once. Within the next week or two things are going to level off, and I will be back to my former addict self. (As long as I can keep my wife sufficiently bribed) =D. I think some of us need to think whether or not we need to be in a guild. Not just this one, but any. I like having awesome gear as much as (probably even MUCH MORE than) the next guy/gal. But being in a guild means more than just having some people around that you can get to help you get things you want, when you want them. It's about belonging to something. Any schmoe without a guild can round up some people and go kill whatever needs to be killed to get gear, e.g., dragon raids, etc. I'm not trying to sound holier-than-thou or anything, but when you are in a guild, you need to be thinking of your guildies, even before yourself sometimes. Now, that isn't ALWAYS possible. Sometimes you just got that hard to get camp, or are hot on the trail of a rare mob, and it really doesn't make sense to drop that and run to a guildy's rescue (in MINOR emergencies, that is). There have been times I've had to turn down a guild member, because I'm in the middle of something that would be very difficult to resume after giving help. HOWEVER...how often have any of you asked me for something and I didn't help you to the best of my ability, or merely SUGGESTED in guild chat that you needed help and I didn't volunteer to help you? Not very damn often, I assure you. Not to toot my own horn, because I have DEFINITELY had times when I told ya to buzz off, but the general idea is HELP YOUR GUILDIES IF THEY NEED IT, NOT JUST IF THEY ASK YOU DIRECTLY, AND HAVE TO BEG YOU FOR HELP. The Golden Rule, people. Just do unto your guildies as you would like them to do unto you. Just my $.02.

About a year ago, I created my own guild. I thought it would be fun to have a group of adventurers to constantly be in touch with and share in the fellowship of EQ. OMG what a challenge I was in for. Aegis Trinity (my guild) did not survive. I just didn't have the time or resources needed for success.  Allaynna, I sympathize and salute you for what you are going through, guild leadership is one of the hardest challenges I have ever met, IG or RL. I would say this though. You have a extraordinary group here that I have found respite from many a travel with only myself to keep me company. I waited and thought long and hard before I joined with this guild. Mylea and Hyku, to their credit, invited me long before I requested entrance into the guild. Those that do participate have a camaraderie that none can equal, and I long to bring Kitaar to a sufficient level that would allow me to join with you in your trials and tribulations. It is all that I am playing for right now. I can't even tell you how many twinks I have liquidated in order to focus my efforts on leveling Kit. But I digress. The issue at hand is raiding and guild member contribution. I would like to step forward and suggest that not only 50+ individuals be ready to raid, but those of us lower than Uber-Raiding level stand up and heed the call. In that spirit, I plan to post next under the Guild Events section and ask for participation and advice for a 40ish level raid. Contribution to the guild and it's members is not exclusive to those of raiding level only.  If we intend to truly grow as a guild, we all need to come together in the spirit of brotherhood (I use the gender neutral term) in order to help the whole of the Knights of Dragoon Mist. <br><br>Bless you all.<br><br>Kitaar Razorclaw - Warrior of the 38th Pride<br>Jarramax Cloudbrother - 44th level servant of Lord Karana  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub61.ezboard.com/ualicia9183.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alicia9183</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/3/02 1:31:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fknightsofdragoonmist94099frm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: YIP</span><hr size=1> Awwww you guys are gonna make me cry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ryonas , Z-man i love you guys and your posts really touched me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm glad you guys understand that this really isnt as easy as i thought it was gonna be ..
