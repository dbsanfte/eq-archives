We have several people from different places. The biggest problem with non-Australian players is the restrictions on time. The majority of the guild plays during Australian prime time, which is good as server numbers are usually low. For American players this would be early in the morning. However a few play strange hours so.....<br><br><br>Several of the members have more than one character they play with, of a wide variation in levels. This means that new members can be fairly sure of finding someone to play with at just about any level.<br><br><br>Australians are by culture, a cynical, sarcastic and vocal lot. They love abusing others in a fun loving manner. They love taking the mickey out of others. So if you join and you think the language is a bit strange, give it some time for adjustment.<br><br><br>There is a small problem at times getting an officer to new members to sign them up. This is caused by there only being a few officers, and those officers often playing in the same group with each other. So you may have to wait a night or two before we can get to you. It works out better that way anyway, if you persist in asking to join then we know you are serious<br><br><br>Most members are usually involved in something at anytime, but if you really need help with something then just persist. People will generally find a way to help you, although it may not be immediate. Quests are a common request and most are understanding about this.<br><br><br>We do not power level in the guild as a general rule. If a member offers to help you progress a bit quicker than normal then that is a bonus for you. It is not an encouraged or expected.<br><br><br>Many members run at least two characters. Secondary characters are of least importance, especially when it comes to hand downs. In most cases a hand down item will be passed only to your primary characters. If no primary character wants it then others may get lucky. Remember also that hand downs are not free, you may be expected to pay a minimum cost. If it is free then you are not expected to sell it, but to pass it on when you are finished with it.<br><br><br>It was mentioned to me the other night that some guilds actually pay players to join up. Triton for example paid for a cleric to join them (undisclosed amount). I doubt that will ever happen in this guild (we are all too cheap). Most of the people in this guild are there because they like playing with the people who are in the guild! So if you are looking for incentive to join us, then go find another guild. If you dont want us then we dont want you. We are mostly here to have some fun (and poke fun at Gelenor).<br><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub61.ezboard.com/fthehand90785frm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fthehand90785frm10.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fthehand90785frm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fthehand90785frm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub61.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thehand90785frm1">General Matters<option value="thehand90785frm3">Hand Events<option value="thehand90785frm4">Guild Applications<option value="thehand90785frm10">Guild Charter<option value="thehand90785frm2">Guild Members Only<option value="thehand90785frm5">Propose New Members<option value="thehand90785frm6">Guild Bank<option value="thehand90785frm12">Tatics and Strats<option value="thehand90785frm13">Hand Events - Spawn Info<option value="thehand90785frm7">Officer Discussion<option value="thehand90785frm16">Processed Recruits<option value="thehand90785frm17">Int Casters<option value="thehand90785frm19">Wisdom Casters<option value="thehand90785frm20">Hybrids<option value="thehand90785frm21">Melees<option value="thehand90785frm22">Items - Wanted/Available</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/bthehand90785>The Hand</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub61.ezboard.com/fthehand90785frm10>Guild Charter</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.the-hand.net">The Hand</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
