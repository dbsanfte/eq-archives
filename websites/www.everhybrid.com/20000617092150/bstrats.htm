      Strange, it seems everyone has their own way of kiting monsters.  Even
      magicians have their own little technique (but let's not get into that
      now).  It seems only fair that Bards get this too.  I happened to be
      on the tribunal server as my ranger character while watching a bard
      use this technique.  Enjoy :).
      </P>
      <P>
      First thing you have to do is to be able to "juggle" songs.  What I
      mean by this is starting a song, and when it comes into effect, switch
      quickly into another song.  Upon success you'll have two bard song effects
      instead of just one.
      </P>
      <P>
      Second thing you have to do is to find a mob that isn't gonna call for help or
      be assisted by other mobs.  Make sure the mob isn't grossly out of your league (forget about the
      high reds, i heard they can resist this tactic).  You also have to be in a reasonably open area which is
      free (or almost free) of extremely high lvl aggro mobs.  This is to ensure that, while you kite, your
      not going to jump head first into a nasty giant/griffin situation.
      </P>
      <P>
      When you find a mob, target it and use your Bellow song, quickly change to Selo once you hit it.  Now RUN away from
      the monster and juggle Selo and Bellow, this should slowly decrease the monsters health.  Certainly not the quickest method
      of kiting.  But by far, one of the most efficient (no mana, ideally little hp loss).  Use this tactic when there are no groups
      available to group with.  A good group can get you xp faster than this tactic ever could.  Happy gaming!
      </P>

	<P>
	   Comment:  I've personally did this one while roaming the karanas with a bard
	</P><P>
	  So you want to get the best of those griffawns eh?  But your two person group doesn't exactly 
	look strong enough to take one of those underconning beasts.  What is a group to do?  Answer: kite
	the mob into extinction!  Here's how:
	</P><P>
	  The basic blueprint of this strategy is this: The Bard causes DoT damage while the Ranger 
	keeps the monster snared.  The Bard's level 12 bellow song is an ideal tool to use in this
	situation.  It's range allows the bard to get some distance between him and the enemy and 
	still cause some damage.
	</P><P>
	  To get started, have the ranger cast snare on the target.  If the spell doesn't hold, then
	use the bards selo to increase speed.  Run backwards for awhile and repeat your castings 
	until the mob finally becomes snared.  If you were crazy enough to try to pick off a high
	red with this strategy, then most likely the ranger will drain his mana bar and the group
	will have to hightail it out of the zone.  Just to inform you all, this works well only 
	on blues to yellows (greens too.. But who cares? :)).
	</P><P>
	  Ok, you have the mob snared.  This is where the bard comes in.  Get within range, and sing
	a little tune to make the monster's ears bleed.  This will grab the mobs attention big time.  All
	bards know how their songs are "supertaunts", and fortunately it pays off in this situation.
	Keep the damaging song up while staying out of range of the mobs attacks.  Rangers, at this 
	point of the battle you should sit back and keep an eye on the mob.  If it becomes unsnared, 
	then re-snare it immediately.  You don't want the mob to start smacking around your partner's 
	backside.  Bards, if snare wears off and it looks like your ranger friend is too busy making a sandwich with his 
	SSoM, then use Selo's to hightail it out of there.  
	</P><P>
	  If you've been successful thus far, and it appears you've taken off a good chunk of health 
	(50% or above), then the ranger should get in there and engage the monster with normal attacks.
	The beauty of this is that the mob won't attack back!  The mob wants a peice of your bard big
	time.  So the mob will keep pursuing him until he's dead :).  Sometimes the mob will turn to fight 
	the ranger; but it's usually very weak at this point.  The whole group at this point should
	just finish it off in melee.  
	</P><P>
	  There you have it!  Your first ranger and bard kite :).  Rest and recover lost hp and mana. 
	With a bard in the group, this shouldn't take long at all.  When your group gets good at this
	technique, you'll be able to kill 4 or 5 mobs before needing to take a break.  Have fun!
