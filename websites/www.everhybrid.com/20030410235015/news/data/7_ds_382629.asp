							Colo. Blizzard Does Little on Drought

							The Associated Press<br><br><br>DENVER<p class="nitfp">Colorado's worst blizzard in nearly a century fell on the wrong side of the Continental Divide for much of the drought-parched West.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The mountain snowpack that feeds river basins serving eastern Colorado rose to more than 100 percent of average levels after the storm. But the snowpack feeding the Colorado River basin, which provides water to seven Western states, rose only slightly.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Most states plan to keep in place voluntary or mandatory water restrictions and conservation measures, saying it is too early to tell what the summer will bring.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"There's not any meaningful change," said Wayne Cook, executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission, based in Salt Lake City. "Maybe next time you could send (the snow) over in a truck or something, dump it over the top, let it run down this side of the hill."</p>
<p class="nitfp">A 1922 agreement allocates Colorado River water among the states. Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico get water from the upper part of the basin and California, Nevada and Arizona get water from the lower basin.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Water agencies from Las Vegas to Santa Fe, N.M, closely track storms in the Colorado mountains, where snowpack is even more critical in drought years.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"What impacts us is snow in the Colorado Rockies," said Vince Alberta, spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, which serves Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The blizzard dumped up to 8 feet of snow in a 500-mile swath in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming the week of March 17, primarily falling on the east side of the Continental Divide.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In river basins serving eastern Colorado, the storm increased projected snowpack runoff from 61 percent of the historical average to 65 percent this year. That is up from the 14 percent recorded at the end of the spring melt last year.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The blizzard barely registered in the Colorado River's lower basin, where the projected runoff remained at about 62 percent, said Colleen Dwyer, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in Boulder City, Nev.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The snowpack percentage is measured against a 30-year average. Melting snow contributes about 80 percent of the water in rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs, which comprise much of Colorado's water supply.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The blizzard was encouraging but one good season won't wipe out four years of below-average snowpack, Alberta said. His water authority will maintain limits on outdoor watering and types of lawns and water recycling.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In Wyoming, the snow will help parched grasslands in the southeastern region where ranchers have struggled to keep their cattle fed. The rest of the state will benefit little, state climatologist Jan Curtis said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"Having been in a drought for three to four years now, we are probably so far behind so far as moisture deficit that it would probably take seven of these types of storms to get back to normal," she said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In the Denver area, paralyzed for days by hip-deep snow, initial glee about the storm's impact on the drought has turned into measured enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"How wonderful! This is really going to help us out," Peter Binney, utilities chief in the Denver suburb of Aurora, said when heavy snow started March 18. Reservoirs that feed Aurora are so low that there's a ban on new lawns and planting vegetables and new flowers.</p>
<p class="nitfp">A week later, Binney was still optimistic, but cautious. "I'd like to see a couple more of these in the next couple weeks," he said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">More snow and rain were predicted for the mountains and foothills, where spring can be the wettest time of the year. El Nino is credited with breaking the region's dry cycle this year.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Vivienne Fink still plans to tear out her Kentucky bluegrass lawn and replace it with ornamental grasses, boulders and native plants.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"I just really don't want to have to pay for watering a lawn that probably shouldn't be there in the first place," she said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The moisture will allow farmers to delay irrigating for a couple weeks, but "it certainly doesn't end the drought crisis," said Bob Sakata, one of Colorado's largest vegetable producers.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Colorado's blizzard won't do much to relieve the drought in the West, said John Weisheit of the environmental group Living Rivers in Moab, Utah.</p>
<p class="nitfp">He said he is concerned that a wet spring will lead people to ease up on conservation. The Colorado River can't meet the area's growing demand even in good years because the water is overallocated, he said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Wetter-than-normal seasons in the 1980s and 1990s helped mask that fact, Weisheit said.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"We've been lucky, is what we've been," he said. "Now our luck's run out."</p>
