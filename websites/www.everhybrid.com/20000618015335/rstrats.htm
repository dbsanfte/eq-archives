      Ahh the open zone of the karana's.  Full of lions, bears, griffawns, and... bandits!
      Anyone who has previously hunted in this zone knows what i'm referring to.
      These groups of mobs assemble in various parts of the zone and, if anyone of a low level is unlucky enough
      to walk right into them, kill unsuspecting players.  They are ideal experience for groups
      around lvl 12-15 and sport some nifty nodrop sashes.  These sashes can be given to Chesguard Sywden (in Qeynos) for gold, silver, experience
      and a bronze weapon (worth 1pp to 3pp!).  Whats great about these bandits is
      that they won't assist each other if you happen to be of a high level (ie, high enough for these guys
      to con green.).  So you can pick them off one at a time at your leisure.  Using this
      technique I was able to acquire 70pp in a short amount of time.

      Hey, druids can do it, why can't we?  In some senses the ranger is
      better equipped for trying out this technique out in the open areas
      of norrath.  First of all we have some pretty decent DD and DoT spells
      to open up with.  Of course, since we typically don't have extremely
      large pools of mana to mindlessly nuke mobs we're gonna have to rely on other
      methods of attack like archery or melee.  This is how it works.
      </P><P>
      Pick a Mob, ideally yellow, black (white) or blue.  If you select a red your
      gambling with the xp you've already earned.  I personally like yellows
      for the sheer challenge.
      </P><P>
      Snare it.  If it doesn't hold, engage in melee for awhile, and attempt
      to snare it just after each attack round.
      </P><P>
      **(You can choose to use the <I>"Cold Feet"</I> strategy if things aren't looking
      too favorable)
      </P><P>
      Once you have the monster snared you have two options:
      </P>
      <UL>
      <LI>Archery:
      <P>Depending on your bow's range, you may find yourself having to stay pretty close to the
      monster while picking it off with arrows.  Make sure you have your range attack hotkeyed!
      Run backwards and start shooting arrows at the mob. Ideally, you should give yourself enough
      space to resnare the monster.  If not, get ready to engage it in melee for awhile while you
      attempt to resnare.
      </P><P>This is also a very effective method of building up the archery skill.  With practice and
      persistence you can begin to get a reliable amount of damage from your bow.
      Like most things, there is a downside.  It can get expensive depending on the type of arrows
      you use.  Personally, I like to use the cheap arrows since I have other things I need to buy.
      But if you have serious money to burn, you might want to kite using archery only.
      Hey, you never know :).
      </P><LI>Magic:
      <P>
      Another nice technique.  You can choose to use DoTs or DD spells.  DoTs were the favorite of druids
      long ago.  But DoTs have been reprogrammed to do roughly two-thirds of the full damage amount if you flee
      from a monster (or kite it).  Because of this, DD is usually more favorable because it does the damage right
      away at a better mana cost.  There are wrong ways to DD Kite and right ways.  Let me put it this way:  is
      it worth to expend a full bar of mana to solo a blue?  I don't think so.  A good idea is to spend about half your
      mana on the DD spell of your choice and just finish him off with archery or melee.  
      </P>
      </UL>
      <P>
      Once the battle is over, heal yourself up.  Rest and med, and then do it again if you wish.  I don't recommend kiting
      as a main source of xp.  I find alot of avid kiters need to be reminded that there are groups that need their skills :).

      Let's face it, things will get ugly at some time or another.  But the
      difference between a dead and alive player (Other than the OBVIOUS) is
      their strategies in getting away with monsters.
      </P>
      <I>Snare is your friend!</I>
      <P>
      The moment you think your in big trouble, cast snare on your foe.  Make sure
      that you time the castings right.  If you have SoW, run away for a little while, then
      use snare.  You just bought yourself a great deal of time.  There are two things that you
      can do.
      </P>
      <P>
      If your lost in a really open area (or even a closed area that has alot of empty space to cover) then
      run for awhile, not too long though.  I usually run for about a minute or so, maybe a little longer.  After
      you've run your butt off.  Take a break, turn around, sit down and CAMP.  All it takes is thirty seconds worth
      of distance between you and the monster.  If the monster does happen to catch up to you in time, you'll be able to
      see him coming.  This is a good tactic when your fresh out of options.

      If you know where the zone border is, go there! 'Nuff said.

      The Ranger Super Taunt (RST) will work nearly every time, even for a finger
      waggler that chain-nukes.  The simple, but effective formula is Snare+Flame
      Lick+Taunt = RST.  With the Ranger Dual Wielding abilities and those 2
      spells and a taunt, you will always have a monster that wants to get
      friendly with you.

      First off. Snare the sucker. If your plans fail, and you get down to low
      health, he still won't catch you. Then, Root it. I personally like Ensnaring
      Roots for that because it does a little damage too, but it's highly resisted,
      but hey, when on level 15, it's all you got. After it's snared/rooted, stand
      back and shoot it with your bow, and while your Range Attack button (got it
      hotkeyed I hope) is down, hit it with a DD spell. Arrows are best for this
      though, because they don't take the mana you need for rooting. If you don't
      get root off enough, go ahead and run backward and shoot it with your bow
      until you get bored of that, then just stand there and whack away!
      </P><P>
      This strategy works best against green-yellow that don't have good Root
      resistance.
      </P><P>
      You can also use this strategy without Root for you guys still down on level
      9-14. Just Snare it at the farthest range you possibly can cast Snare at,
      then shoot it while it runs (more like crawls) in. When it gets to you,
      finish it with melee. This works exceptionally well against the Aqua Goblins
      in the Ocean of Tears for example, because they'll stand around and try to
      shoot you too.

	<LI>Ranger with snare 
	</UL>
	<P>
	   Comment:  I've personally did this one while roaming the karanas with a bard
	</P><P>
	  So you want to get the best of those griffawns eh?  But your two person group doesn't exactly 
	look strong enough to take one of those underconning beasts.  What is a group to do?  Answer: kite
	the mob into extinction!  Here's how:
	</P><P>
	  The basic blueprint of this strategy is this: The Bard causes DoT damage while the Ranger 
	keeps the monster snared.  The Bard's level 12 bellow song is an ideal tool to use in this
	situation.  It's range allows the bard to get some distance between him and the enemy and 
	still cause some damage.
	</P><P>
	  To get started, have the ranger cast snare on the target.  If the spell doesn't hold, then
	use the bards selo to increase speed.  Run backwards for awhile and repeat your castings 
	until the mob finally becomes snared.  If you were crazy enough to try to pick off a high
	red with this strategy, then most likely the ranger will drain his mana bar and the group
	will have to hightail it out of the zone.  Just to inform you all, this works well only 
	on blues to yellows (greens too.. But who cares? :)).
	</P><P>
	  Ok, you have the mob snared.  This is where the bard comes in.  Get within range, and sing
	a little tune to make the monster's ears bleed.  This will grab the mobs attention big time.  All
	bards know how their songs are "supertaunts", and fortunately it pays off in this situation.
	Keep the damaging song up while staying out of range of the mobs attacks.  Rangers, at this 
	point of the battle you should sit back and keep an eye on the mob.  If it becomes unsnared, 
	then re-snare it immediately.  You don't want the mob to start smacking around your partner's 
	backside.  Bards, if snare wears off and it looks like your ranger friend is too busy making a sandwich with his 
	SSoM, then use Selo's to hightail it out of there.  
	</P><P>
	  If you've been successful thus far, and it appears you've taken off a good chunk of health 
	(50% or above), then the ranger should get in there and engage the monster with normal attacks.
	The beauty of this is that the mob won't attack back!  The mob wants a peice of your bard big
	time.  So the mob will keep pursuing him until he's dead :).  Sometimes the mob will turn to fight 
	the ranger; but it's usually very weak at this point.  The whole group at this point should
	just finish it off in melee.  
	</P><P>
	  There you have it!  Your first ranger and bard kite :).  Rest and recover lost hp and mana. 
	With a bard in the group, this shouldn't take long at all.  When your group gets good at this
	technique, you'll be able to kill 4 or 5 mobs before needing to take a break.  Have fun!
