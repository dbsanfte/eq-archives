							Academy Probe Shows More Cadets Punished

							The Associated Press<br><br><br>DENVER<p class="nitfp">An investigation into sexual assaults at the Air Force Academy has found that twice as many male cadets were punished as previously reported, a spokesman for the investigators said Saturday.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The increase, from 21 to 40, is because the initial number did not count administrative actions as punishment, said Lt. Col. Dewey Ford.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Air Force investigators examined 57 reported incidents, ranging from unwanted touching to rapes, between 1990 and 2003. In their full report, to be available in a few weeks, they do not assign blame for the scandal.</p>
<p class="nitfp">That lack of accountability drew criticism from Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., who called for an investigation after his office began receiving complaints.</p>
<p class="nitfp">"They didn't say anything about who was accountable or responsible for what happened at the academy. They just ignored it and didn't say anything at all," Allard told the Gazette of Colorado Springs.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Ford declined to comment on Allard's remarks.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Of the 57 incidents, Ford confirmed that 28 were found to involve criminal conduct, 15 were inconclusive and nine did not involve criminal conduct. Three victims withdrew their accusations, and two cases are pending.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Five cadets were convicted at court-martial, one was acquitted and one resigned in lieu of a court-martial. Eighteen faced lesser punishment through an Article 15 or administrative discipline, 14 resigned or were expelled, and two may face a court-martial.</p>
<p class="nitfp">In one of the cases still pending, sophomore Douglas Meester may not face a court-martial for allegedly raping a female first-year cadet after a night of drinking but also probably won't return to the academy, Air Force officials said Saturday.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Nonjudicial punishment was recommended last week for Meester, but academy rules prohibit drinking in the dorms and fraternization, or socializing with lower-ranking cadets.</p>
<p class="nitfp">The investigation found 27 incidents occurred in academy dorms, and 20 victims and 15 suspects were drinking.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Allard said he hoped a separate investigation by the Pentagon's Inspector General will assign blame for the scandal.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Some female cadets who contacted Allard's office said they had been punished for reporting the attacks. Dozens sought help at a local civilian rape support center because they feared retribution if they reported the attacks to the academy.</p>
<p class="nitfp">Under pressure from Congress, top commanders at the academy were replaced.</p>
