        <font face=Arial size=4>Bard Tips</font><BR><BR>
        <font face=Arial size=3>By Rebele, 37th Bard (E'ci)</font><BR><BR>
        <P>     <UL><LI>
        If your song gets stuck due to lag clicking the song button very quickly
        over and over will get it unstuck...very useful.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        Some people may have a different opinion, but in a dungeon I NEVER use
        any area effect songs simply b/c the effects go through walls, pulling
        unwanted monsters...not a good idea.
        </UL></P><P>
        <UL><LI> When grouped, I usually twist two songs (i'm lvl 37 currently)...mana
        song and verses of celerity.  Three songs is optimal, but let's face it, who
        wants to do nothing but press buttons over and over the entire session?
        Usually you will be grouped with casters, and hopefully a cleric.  Depending
        on the situation, you can alternate how much you play each one to fit the
        groups needs.  The way I see it, if by playing the mana song the cleric or
        caster can get one or two more casts in, this is the difference in tough
        fights.  Also, celerity does wonders for attack speed and damage avoidance
        in fights.  This is really the first attack song we get that I have noticed
        significant improvement from, although some of the others work ok.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        In emergency situations, or when pulling multiple casters, charm works
        great for taking a mob out of the picture.  However, one should concentrate
        on keeping your mob charmed b/c it will really start wailing on you when it
        becomes uncharmed, usually to the extent that it attacks no one else.
        Therefore, your melee activites will have to be avoided for the most part in
        that fight unless you are some kind of button clicking master, which I am
        not and do not wish to be.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        I have not put the time in to master the charm/kite technique, but I
        hear it works wonders on giants, clops, etc..  I will say that the
        selo/bellow technique works fairly well.  A sow or jboots, however, makes
        this technique excellent for griffins, giants and the like.  Basically, buy
        or get a sow off someone, find a good target, and run circles around it
        bellowing like a fool.  I imagine you could also use the dot songs but they
        tend to draw trash mobs, which are an unnecessary hassle.  Be careful on
        giants, however, because they can attack from much greater distances than
        griffins, so you have to pay attention to how far you are away from the
        mob...basically, you need to be a perfect distance from a giant...not out of
        range, but not up in their face where they can smack you for 90+ double
        attack.  I think the fear/chain combo would really work well also, but
        haven't used it at all as I spend most of my time in dungeons or grouped.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        The damage shield songs are also great for groups, but they tend to draw
        mobs to the bard...not a good idea.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        If you have the means, pump up the dex and get some weapons that proc.
        I use two ykeshas that work wonders, but I know not everyone can afford
        these or get them.  But everyone (for the most part) can afford a staff of
        writhing, obsidian shard, pgt, etc..  A weapon that procs really offsets the
        fact that bards can't kick, bash, or use any of the defensive melee skills.
        </UL></P><P> <UL><LI>
        Keep the three main bard weapons skills (i.e. 1hb,1hs, pierce) maxed,
        and start early on this if you haven't already.  You never know when you'll
        get your hands on a great new weapon only to find that your skill with it is
        terrible.  If this happens, fight as much stuff as you can to get the skill
        up...highkeep is a good place for this as there are plenty of pops and it
        usually doesn't get out of control as far as trains go.
        </UL></P><P> 
        Hope this helps someone...I have found these techniques to work well for my
        style of play...I'm certainly not, and do not want to be, an instrument
        juggler, and, frankly, I feel the songs that affect multiple mobs are just
        bad news for the bard in any situation (looking forward to the lvl 48 song
        though :P).  Let the tanks take the damage because they can and that's their
        job.  After lvl 20 or so the bard is a secondary tank in almost every
        situation, so if you want to really dish out and take damage, make a
        warrior.
