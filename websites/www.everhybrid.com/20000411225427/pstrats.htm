      It isn't fun at all to die to ANYTHING.  You'd think the best melee/healer class in all of norrath
      would be able to best all his battles.  This is not always the case.  But with this strategy, you can
      at least avoid some deaths :). 
      </P>
      <P>
      Let's pick a monster (like a willowisp for example).  These little balls of light love to gang up on the unsuspecting
      person and beat him/her down to a pulp.  If this is the case, keep trying to cast flash of light on one.  If successful, it
      will flee away in terror for a short time.  Repeat these castings for the other monsters.  Pretty soon all of them will be
      running like mad.  Keep in mind though that the spell doesn't have a long duration.  So heal up quickly (zone if you have to) before
      the mobs come back.  This works for more than just willowisps; but it serves as a good example for the technique.
      </P>
      <P>
      Also, as a reminder.  Don't use this tactic in crowded aggro dungeons or areas.  Using this will cause massive trains that will more than
      likely be the downfall many people.  This strategy only works well in very open areas (karana's, commons, etc.).  I'd usually use this tactic only
      as a method for fleeing. :)

      While battleling mighty beasts, sometimes, they gain the upper hand and begin to whittle you down.  As you near one bubble of life left, begin to
      move your fingers into position.  As you continue your attack, guage how much damage the beast has been dealing and decide when to use your
      Lay Hand healing.  I usually wait till I'm down to one bubble of life or less, then toggle my Tab key to select myself, and hit my hot key for Lay
      Hands.  I watch as my life points refill all the way up, then toggle Tab again and continue attacking.  At this point, I hopefully have lowered the 
      creature low enough now, to finish him off.  I like to wait till the last possible second as sometimes the creature will retreat if he is also down low,
      thus you merely have to chase him down and finish him off. But don't wait to long, as sometimes the creature may stun you, thus keeping you from
      using the ability. Becareful to target yourself first, or you will waste it.  I have done this a few times in panic.  Also, you may also want to use your
      Lay Hands on a teammate who is close to death.

      <font color="#8080FF">Requires:</font>
      <UL>
      <LI>Lvl 9 Spells and above
      <LI>Bow and arrows
      <LI>Archery Skill
      </UL>
      <P>
      1st: Learn how to fletch, build that skill to the low 50s and make a carved
      ashwood bow or better and some decent arrows (e.g. class 1 wood arrows with
      a range of 150), use archery for pulling and dealing about 15 or more hits
      per shot while getting the mob mad at you. If you do this running backwards
      (preferrably sowed) in a large open area like the Karanas, you can easily
      get up to 4 or five shots at your target before starting to melee. You
      should have no troubble to keep the mob from attacking your casters since
      it's already mad at you. It is also a very nice skill to finish anoyingly
      fast running monsters like pumas in Oasis or Orcs in Crushbone who like to
      attack when you are medding and then run away, eventually even increasing
      the danger of trains. Great places to train archery are those Areas like
      Dark Cauldron where there are aqua goblins. You will never run out of
      (cheap) arrows when hunting them.
      </P><P>
      2nd: Use Flash of Light on all those mobs you can not reach (e.g. too high
      above you for archery) or when you have a long way to run to your group
      (drakes in Steamfont, Aviaks on aviak lookout towers in South Karana or Lake
      Rathe Tear, Crocs of all kinds in the ocean at Oasis. The Confusion of the
      blinded mob gives you time to run a few seconds towards your group before
      the mob closes in. The mob is very mad at you and will not likely attack
      your casters early in melee.
      It happens in more crowded zones that the blinded mob is attacked by other
      groups before coming back to you. Since they can not know that you already
      started to battle this mob that's just plain bad luck and not kill stealing.
      I have had mobs appear more than a minute after the initial blinding with
      half hit points = easy exp.
      Flash of light is very effective when pulling out of the water (e.g hunting
      crocs in Oasis) since it gives you time to get out. I hated swimming up to a
      deep water caiman then slashing him and slowly getting chewed to bits while
      desperately trying to get back to the shore before continuing melee.
      </P><P>
      3rd: When battling the undead there's nothing like Ward Undead or in some
      cases Spook the dead. Cast at the maximum distance and start running
      immediately towards your group. Be warned that using wards or spook the dead
      tends to bring a lot of undead running towards you (at least in unrest).
      Wether undead are more likely linked than other mobs or if casting a a ward
      is a kind of "noisy" activity wich simply attract undead in a big radius is
      unknown to me.
