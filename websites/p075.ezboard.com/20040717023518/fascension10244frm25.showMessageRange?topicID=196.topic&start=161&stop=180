<br>
So? Does this matter in any way? Unless Moo would say Everas argument is wrong, it doesnt really matter who has what in chemistry.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;You must be smart indeed to be confident enough in your understanding of the mind of a brutal dictator who will gas his own people to be willing to risk the lives of Americans. Do you have a degree in Psychology as well as Chemical Engineering?&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I just saw in TV an ex-CIA guy saying that this is a historical lie. During Iraq-Iran war the people that stood between the frontiers suffered indeed death by chemical substances. But after autopsie they found Iraq didnt use this kind of chemical weapon but Iran had plenty of it. Now if this guy was lieing, I dont know, I thought I share.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Please explain to me why I should believe Saddam over Bush. Even the French believe he has chemical weapons.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
You shouldn't believe none of them. They are both liars and got caught of lieing on many occasations. And ye, so do many other nations, but they dont want to send military to Iraq to kill people because they &quot;believe&quot;.<br>
On this also should be mentioned that the CIA clearly stated they dont &quot;know&quot; if Iraq still has WMDs, yet Bush claims CIA would have prove that there are WMDs. Needless to say that they would have prove they could just give those proves to Blix or France or Russia to change their mind. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kron@ascension10244>Kron</A> at: 3/12/03 5:02:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=endymia>Endymia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 529<br> <font color=#333333>(3/12/03 8:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1441 = No Compliance</span><hr size=1> wtf..

Bush is going to war because he's a weak president.  He's done nothing but trash America.  The 9/11 (TM) fiasco was the best thing that could have happened for Bush.  Imediately after, all concern over who should really be president (yah i won because of a voting botch in the state where my brother is in charge, yah that doesn't sound suspicious).  Since then America has become a scary place(well it was before but bear with me).  The Justice Department has HUGE amounts of power now, the things that they are doing are so Top Secret that congress doesn't even know everything.  The checks and balance system is collapsing.  The fear inspired by this vauge enemy (communists, er i mean terrorists right?) has overwhelmed the country(ala Michael Moore and Thompson).  There is a convienient colour coded terror level and advise for duct tape and plastic (duck and cover?).  The wartime hysteria has made it possible for the government to do as they wish.  INS &quot;registrations&quot; (detentions?) have become required for any young men or arab descent.  The Patriot Act, and super mysterous Patriot Act II, have eroded many civil liberties and given the government serious power to observe every facet of our lives.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I love my country; I am in vehemant disagreance with much of it, but I strongly agree with the principals it was founded upon (except the god bussiness).<br>
<br>
There is no overwhelming danger from Saddam, that is the primary reason this war is ridiculous.  If we go to war for something that &quot;could&quot; happen, what kind of precident are we setting for the world?  For our species to survive and evolve we have to work TOGETHER.  Are we pushing for a Pax Americana?  We're going to fuck up Iraq, then move in and setup our version of what things should be.  I say two years or less and it'll be another Somalia.<br>
<br>
Why do we focus on Iraq?  We have so many weapons of mass destruction.  There is so much horrible shit going on in the world, Saddam isn't jack shit.  We're funding huge wars in the Congo for it's precious natural resources.<br>
<br>
Israel, our good old boy allies, is a shady country.  The ideology there is that the end justifies the means.  They are dropping bombs on civilians, regularly killing innocent people, and running a fascist state.  Do you wonder why these Islamic groups hate us so much?  NO NOBODY FUCKING WONDERS, THEY WANT TO HATE AND DESTROY.  Revenge has become the way of life.  We give Israel so much money for it's military.  The average soldiers' equipment is something around 2,000$.  How much do you think the average Palastinian's military equipment is?  Oh that's right, it's fucking nonexistant.  We took the Palestinians' land and gave it to the Israelies, and I think maybe the original inhabitant want it back.<br>
<br>
North Korea has nuclear capabilites, they are in dire financial crisis.  Who is seriously goign to sell dangerous materials to rogue states?  Is it Iraq (i dunno but Saddam seems awfully cosy in his plethora of palaces)?  But instead we are rather nice to a dangerous country.  Iraq poses no serious threat to us, but we are eager to persecute them.<br>
<br>
In the Congo there is a huge bloody war raging that has gone on for quite awhile.  We are funding all of the factions, and in return we get precious natural resources.  Do we care about the faceless suffering people there?  Do we care about the strife that we're financing?  Nope, the big dog eats first.<br>
<br>
Pakistan and India both have nuclear capabilites, and are basically at eachother's throats.  Are we doing much there?  Nope not our problem.<br>
<br>
That's just the tip of the iceberg, WAR DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING. Now a quick message from 'God'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/god_clarifies_dont_kill.html">www.theonion.com/onion373..._kill.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Thanks 'god', There you have it DONT KILL FUCKERS.<br>
<br>
Saddam is a crazy bastard, something needs to be done with him.  WE DONT NEED ANOTHER WAR.  If nothing else it would be more prudent to look at ourselves first.  America is in dire need of help, more in need than helping eradicate some dictator that could maybe possibly one day attack us.<br>

-Khard<br>
<br>
Absolutely not.<br>
<br>
List of required things to create another Somalia:<br>
#1. (and most important) The worlds most unorganized and indecisive governing body in charge of the operation.<br>
<br>
2. French Foreign Legion (in an instance that a good friend of mine bore witness) raping, murdering and then burying the bodies of the 3 young woman they stole from a village on the road to Baidoa. This wasn't an isolated incident with the FFL, but the only one I know to be fact.<br>
-btw, did some research recently and it looks like the French are at it again <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.islamicvoice.com/september.98/news.htm">www.islamicvoice.com/sept...8/news.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->   (scroll down, second from the bottom)<br>
<br>
<br>
3. French Foreign Legion spraying down a bus load of civilians, because it failed to stop at &quot;exactly&quot; the 15ft required in front of a check point (which finally got them ejected from the operation).<br>
<br>
4. At least two Russian military officers from the fallen Soviet Union, acting &quot;own their own&quot; and in a mercenary capacity, training clansmen in small unit/ platoon infantry tactics.<br>
<br>
5. 10+ CIA agents running around with suitcases of cold hard American cash, collecting intelligence of really no importance.<br>
<br>
6. The Nigerians leaving the UNOSOM complex near midnight each night for routine patrols, driving into town guns blazing, and soon after driving back whooping it up like drunk cowboys.<br>
<br>
7. ROE (Rules of Engagement) requiring that any participants (USMC included) in Restore Hope may not lift his weapon or point it in the direction of another individual, unless the other individual already has his weapon pointed at you and is threatening violence (I need to dig thru some crap, but I'm sure I still have my ROE card/ and btw ever wonder what your options are when someone already has the &quot;drop&quot; on you)<br>
<br>
8. Rangers from 2nd Battallion dying because some council of fuckheads have decided that no large caliber weapons or American armor vehicles are to be allowed in country. And then play a 12+hr game of f' the dog trying to get their own armor in to rescue them.<br>
<br>
9. America leaving the operation because one of the dead Ranger's father (ex Vietnam/ SF himself) starts some serious crap with some senate buddys, who in turn finally get enough support to ask our dipshit president &quot;Hey, what the hell are we doing over there?&quot; (As a civilian I can now finally call the commander in chief a dipshit without fear of doing time in Ft. Leavenworth for insubordination, Article89 or Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice)<br>
<br>
10. U.N. eight mos. later begging for the U.S. to come back to help them get the Pakistanis and the rest of their contingent out (seems they started getting the crap shot out of themselves and had little faith they would make it out alive on their own).<br>
<br>
11. CIA coming back, paying Aidid 100k+ from one of the &quot;secret satchels&quot; and along with the USMC guaranteeing a safe withdrawal.<br>
<br>
<br>
An excellent summation of the results from a perfectly executed U.N. operation is <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.msf.org/countries/page.cfm?articleid=735FDF42-58F0-4A4F-B106884C9CEE6B3F">www.msf.org/countries/pag...4C9CEE6B3F</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

I have little like for bankers, lawyers and especially politicians (spin/ bullsh*t artists) and suggest that the &quot;eloquent opposition&quot; on this board take your arguments to the people that are at &quot;ground zero&quot; ie. those involved in the past U.N. missions of Restore Hope or the coming one in Iraq to see how much water they hold.<br>
<br>
I have little to zero faith in the U.N. (is it obvious yet?) and hope that whatever happens, they are in no way involved in the military planning and execution phase of whats about to occur. <br>
<br>
Sry if I've offended someones sensibilities,  but some of the prattle from this board really hit an old nerve.<br>
<br>
Khard, this isn't hit on you personally bro, I hope life's treatin you well.<br>

You're saying that the fact that a nation tests chemical &amp; biological weapons programmes means they're going to use them?  Of course it doesn't- the US tests nuclear weapons, hasn't signed the CTBT and is the only nation ever to have used nuclear weapons.  Yet I can't forsee the United States ever using nuclear weapons except in retaliation.  Numerous nations test and maintain secret weapons programmes- the fact that these weapons are being developed doesn't mean that they are a threat, nor does it mean they would ever be used.  There is such a thing as the deterrence factor y'know- claiming that the *only* reason a nation would develop a secret WMD programme is to strike first...is more than a little naive.<br>
<br>
My &quot;prove it&quot; statement was directed at anyone proving that either containment or deterrence had failed.  The US and other permanent members with nuclear arsenals, plus the nuclear arsenal Israel possesses- these <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> deter Saddam from ever using any alleged WMD.  Smawty, it's not about understanding &quot;the mind of a brutal dictator&quot;.  It's about tried and tested policy- the deterrence of a nation state.  It doesn't matter how insane or power-hungry a dictator is, unless they're suicidal.  Guess what, Saddam's regime is not suicidal, it's in fact a good deal *less* suicidal than the USSR ever was in the long history of deterrence.  There is no way he'd use any WMD he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have in a useable state because that would guarantee his destruction.  I don't know how much simpler I can make the policy of deterrence- it works, and history shows it works especially well when it's one-sided deterrence as it is with Iraq.  <br>
<br>
Think about it this way- if Iraq actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>had</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> WMD, the US and others would treat it with kid gloves and negotiate, much the same way as the Soviet Union was handled, and North Korea is currently being handled.  The fact that the US/UK are showing such belligerence is all but proof that Saddam poses <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no imminent threat</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the Iraqi government is not in compliance with 1441 and their cooperation has been selective at best. Iraq needs to show STRATEGIC cooperation, which it certainly has not.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Is there a time limit on compliance in 1441 Kad?  No, I didn't think so- explain to me again why time is of the essence?  Unless of course you're looking at war as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fait-accompli</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  There is no ticking clock if Saddam is being contained and deterred, no time pressure.  Disarmament is being achieved via inspections- I fail to see what the rush is.  Inspections are working, there is no time limit set, nor do I see the need for one.  Forces are in the region to help assure compliance as well as to up the containment/deterrence factor.  If results are being accrued now, then where is the need for war?<br>
<br>
&quot;It'll get hot in Iraq&quot; is no argument at all, because its premise is founded on a war taking place.  Remember also, that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>both</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sides will suffer the effects of the heat, the US/UK forces are simply better prepared.  The heat favours us, not them because of equipment, training and resolve- for those reasons and because of the night attack factor.<br>
<br>
Plainly, there still isn't a case for war because the fundamental principles of why the status quo fails have not even been demonstrated at all.  I'll say it again- prove that containment or deterrence have failed.  That's all the first stage of a case for war needs to achieve to be credible- is it really that hard to draw up such a case?  The obvious is being overlooked- containment and deterrence <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> working and there is no imminent threat.  The fact that weapons exist does not equal a threat worth going to war for.  During the Cold war the USSR and United States each sat on enough WMDs to blow the entire planet to bits several thousand times over.  What happened?  Nada, because they mutually deterred one another.  With containment plus <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one-sided</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> deterrence, why is there a threat posed this time- and where is the need for a war?<br>

<br>
The evidence you ask for proving that containment is not working is a moot question.

We need not revisit that question despite your attempts to do so.<br>

<br>
As if the only people able to understand chemical weapons or human nature are psychologists and chem engineers? <br>
<br>
Well, lets start with the chemistry degree. This one's so far off topic that it shouldn't be hard. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/05/japan.cult/index.html">www.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/05...index.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Any further argument regarding my &quot;lunatic with a lab&quot; point? And guess what, it didn't take a degree in chemistry for me to find that bit of info. Though on a side note I have been considering taking up a second major (or third), perhaps I'll add psychology or chem engineering just to throw that in someones face when they come up with a rational argument.<br>
<br>
Second: my degree of confidence that Saddam will not use those weapons on his neighbors or the US. Well, is anyone willing to argue that MOST people do not possess a strong sense of self preservation? Hopefully not. Is anyone willing to argue that should Saddam attack another nation the reprisal would be quick? Again I hope not. And if the people on this board can figure that chain of events out I tend to believe a dictator in Iraq can as well. <br>
<br>
Saddam's never done anything to show he's suicidal. In fact I think (and if I'm wrong on this point correct me) that he surrendered in the first Gulf War soon after he realized we had bombs capable of destroying his underground bunkers. Not exactly the actions of a man willing to die.<br>
<br>
&quot;a brutal dictator who will gas his own people,&quot; you say! Well gosh that is terrible, I mean no sane person kills their own citizens. Unless of course those same people are also members of two different rebel factions bent on overthrowing the Iraqi government. I mean if I were to place myself in Saddam's shoes I might be tempted to call them... oh I don't know maybe... terrorists. But you're right, using gas on them is terrible, especially when our nation's already proven that the best way to eradicate a hostile minority within your own nation is to use bullets and smallpox ridden blankets.<br>

- The Udari Range (frontier between Kuwait and Iraq) will be 132 Farenheit, mid day sun, this August (speaking from xperience).<br>
- You really can't drink water from 11am-1pm because it's temp nearly matches the air. Doing so runs your body core temp above healthy levels. (there is a field trick using a moist t-shirt that can bring water temp down)<br>
- The list goes on about temp. On a side note, we used to get our kicks midday sticking eachother and administering t-shirt cooled Lactated Ringer IV's to shave of a few degrees of personal core temp (now what would drive kids to do that?). We got a steady supply of IV's from our command and bypassed any question of administering them to eachother by simply stating that we were practicing emergency field medicine.<br>
<br>
&quot;The heat favours us, not them because of equipment&quot; <br>
- Spoken by someone who has never gone to MOPP Level 4 in even ambient temperatures. BTW, which side will be required to stand at some MOPP level in the event of crisis, considering which side has potential to use their chem/ bio capabilities? Whether or not they'll be used doesn't mean PFC Shmuck wont be wearing at least MOPP 2, under orders, during any part of this attk (BTW, MOPP 4 would be humanly impossible at any time during the day for longer then ~30min).

<br>
From the perspective of a simple country boy...launching SCUD missiles at a nuclear capable Israel (who has a biblical history of war) while engaged in a war with the United States during Desert Storm suggest to me that maybe he is a bit suicidal amongst other things. <br>
<br>
Deposing the man and his regime probably won't solve much. But it will be a damn good step in the right direction and is a hell of alot better than sitting on ones ass while a jumbo jet comes plowing into a world trade center near you saying &quot;Hi! Time to wake up!&quot;<br>

<br>
no flys on saddam.  it wasnt suicdal at all.  IF isreal had retalited in anykind the strain on the colition would have been so great as to sunder it.  its quite possible some arab nations might have decided to support saddam or attack iseral in their own right thus drawing attention from iraq to a different boarder<br>
<br>
Saddam had NOTHING to lose and everything to gain by launching those SCUDS<br>
<br>
it was also a potential trump card that at anytime things got really bad saddam had demenstrated not only could he reach iseral but he could fill a warhead with somthign other than TnT.<br>
<br>
Saddam is not a total idiot he has done a fairly good job of staying in power and flaunting the us and the un's athourity everytime he succesfully does so it makes him jsut a tad more popular and a tad more powerful<br>
<br>
at this late stage I dont care if we war him or not, in fact id jsut assume withdrawl the 200k troops we have and the 40k or 10k (depending on your source) briton has and jsut call it quits move them to SK or somthing.  next time saddaom does somthing we wont be so quick to send our boys in and the rest of the world will jsut have to suffer the consquenses if any.<br>

<br>
Yes. When Saddam invaded Kuwait and took control of their oil fields we did retaliate with operation Desert Shield and then Operation Desert Storm. I don't believe I mentioned or implied anywhere in my previous post that Saddam was the aggressor towards the U.S. in any way so that must have been an assumption on your part. No problem. We all make assumptions. Some of them are right and some of them aren't. You assumed wrong in this case. It's that simple.<br>
<br>
&quot;When he realized that not only was he going to lose the war, but there was a good chance we were going to bury him in one of his bunkers, he surrendered&quot;<br>
<br>
After one month of pelting the caves that Saddam Hussein's troops were bunkered in by the artillery from our battleships in the Persian Gulf and our fly overs with our bombers one can use some literary license in assuming that the people in the caves were frightened and sick of being trapped in there. <br>
<br>
While this was happening, General Swartzkoff (spelling?) moved the majority of the ground forces from the northeastern part of the Kuwaiti border to the western interior along the border. He then crossed the border moving northeast ransacking the first and subsequent cities in the southwest portion of Iraq. Iraq's famed Red Army did not stand a chance against our forces. Iraqi soldiers were surrendering in droves. <br>
<br>
As a senior in high school in 1991, this is what the news and stories from friends were conveying to me. In summary, he had already lost the physical showdown with the U.S. before it had ever begun. Once his troops were surrendering, he had no choice but to give up. So, again, I think we may agree on that point to a degree.<br>
<br>
&quot;I haven't read too much about him firing scuds into Israel so I won't debate the subject. I'll just simply say that Israel has yet to launch a nuclear weapon at Saddam... so if he's suicidal he's ineffectually so&quot;<br>
<br>
I watched documented video footage of Iraq firing SCUD's into Israel on a daily basis while our Patriot missiles tried to intercept them during 1991 so I'm glad you are not debating that subject. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh... and please tell me you're not one of those nutjobs that somehow got the idea Saddam was behind Sept. 11th.&quot;<br>
<br>
No. I am not. <br>
<br>
&quot;It seems that just because some people heard the two subject mentioned in the same paragraph that there must be a connection. Of course not even Bush's gov has claimed that this is the case. Says something for the state of our citizenship.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes it may seem like some people draw connections from such things but not most people I would hope. Bush's government has not claimed that Iraq was behind the Sept. 11 attack.<br>
<br>
What Bush's government has claimed is that they are fighting a war on terrorism where they feel like Al Quaeda, Saddam Hussein's regime, Momar Khadaffi's regime in Libya and other middle eastern factions are prime suspects of terrorist activities that must be stopped before a synergistic collaboration of like minds manifests itself and causes widespread genocide to a higher order of magnitude than what presently exists.<br>
<br>
With that being said, I have no major issues with the state of our citizenship that are able to look at two separate pieces of information in one paragraph and postulate on how they could possibly be connected. Quite frankly I think it's a wondeful gift of the freedom we have which is ernestly being surpressed in the third world countries where the terrorism we have vowed to war runs rampant. <br>

<br>
Just some random thoughts and responces:<br>
<br>
Cren that was actually one of the smartest things he could have done. If Israel had retaliated ALL of the Arab allies during the gulf war would have pulled out. With no ground bases the US would have had to withdraw, or been severely hampered and SH could have had a chance, not much of one but it would have been there.<br>
<br>
Your right the WTC should have been a call to hey &quot;wake up&quot;, but obviously it didn't work. Instead of trying to learn from mistakes the US is just committing them again. Instead of actually thinking &quot;hey what are we doing that is pissing everyone off so much?&quot; The US is plowing on oblivious to everything the world has been telling it subtilely for years now. Of course it doesn't help to have a monkey at the wheel being trained to drive by inbred retards (k this might be a little harsh but I love the image it conjures up).<br>
<br>
Ousting SH and imposing an American puppet regime will only cause problems. Don't fool yourself it will be seen as a puppet regime and unless its ruthless it will have a very hard time. If the regime is ruthless it's just more &quot;Americans oppressing Muslims let go blow up their Embassies/Battleships/them&quot;. It has all of the ingredients to becoming the next horror story. The only thing stopping it is the oil and all the effort thats going to go into protecting that oil.<br>
<br>
There are some things that need to be understood. The primary driving force behind anything a politician does in a democratic environment is to get re-elected at all costs. They really don't care about anything else. If they do some good while doing something to get re-elected well that is a by product but it was never the original intent (I know this is a very cynical view). <br>
<br>
If you look at how Bush has dragged this out, you will see he has been bending over backwards to get a war going and won very close to the next elections. If Bush really was interested in haveing a peacefull solution he could ahve gone to the UN played the right cards and this whole thing could ahve been resolved at least one month ago. Bush was a one timer, he was only going to get elected once and any chance at a re-election was non existant. Politically speaking, 9/11 was the best thing any President (Yes it is morbid yes it is horrible but its true) could ever hope for, it was a friggin God Send. The only thing that went wrong for Bush is that he f***ed up, he made some shady decisions, and this thing with Iraq (don't kid yourselves its not a crisis) is just a way to get the media and thus the American voting public to not look to far into just exactly what he has done. Also I don't care who you are EVERYONE loves the feeling of righteous revenge especially when your accomplishing something. Bush is just trying to prolong this feeling until the next elections and then he'll strip some more of your rights in the name of national security, so that he can sell them to the marketing firms.<br>
<br>
Another point that I have noticed about this thread. There are two kinds of people, the people who listen to what the media is telling them and taking it at face value. And those with sense enough to look backstage and question the motives behind all the talk. Why the hell does the media want a war? Simply because the ratings for this war will be astronomical. Not as high as the ones for the Afghani one, but Iraq is sure as hell going to last longer than a country that was already in the stone age when we went there to blow $#!+ up. <br>
<br>
To the person referring to the fact that the peacekeepers could not fire unless fired upon, you are right. I belive there was an incident where an entire refugee camp got massacred because the peacekeepers could not do jack $#!+ due to the ROE. I think it was the Belgian peacekeepers that all burned their blue berets in protest.<br>
<br>
Sorry I have just seen to much suffering in my life to put up with someone bent on causing more without thinking. <br>
<br>
As to all the French basing, it's just funny how people think its funny to show just how ignorant they are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Ignorance is bliss!<br>

<br>
Anyways Cren I think you're right. I did misread part of your post regarding Saddam's willingness to engage the US in a war. <br>
<br>
However I think you failed you recognize the heart of the argument. Saddam is not suicidal. And theres little evidence to support a link between his government and terrorist. In fact I imagine if one were to try, it wouldn't be difficult to make a stronger connection between our government and terrorist groups.<br>
<br>
Cheney and a few others within our government had been looking for a reason to reenter Iraq prior to Sept 11th. The terrorist attack just gave them the pretense of an excuse. And its kind of dismaying to see how effective that stratagy's become. Bush goes from Osama, Osama, Osama, to Saddam, Saddam, Saddam, and its as if a good portion of our population hasn't even noticed the switch.<br>
<br>
But I agree with Ebany, something has to be done. And its about time we wake up and realize that sending in the troops is not the best solution. I hate to use a cliche, but violence does beget violence, and this is certainly a case where that will hold true.<br>

<br>

<br>
Go ahead and spin each of those violations if you want to.  Or, even point out some of the human rights violations by the U.S. that occured over 200 years ago.  But, if after reading about his human rights violations you are still confident that he will behave rationally and not want to take vengance on the U.S. for sending him packing back to his hole during the Gulf War, then I will have to assume you can see the future and are all knowing.  Do they offer a degree in all-knowingness too?<br>
<br>
I have to concede your point about the chemicals though.  I mean, if some lunatic can produce enough Saryn to kill 12 people and injure 3500 others, we should just let Saddam keep his toys that include<br>
2600 liters of anthrax,<br>
1200 liters of botulinum toxin,<br>
2200 liters of aflatoxin,<br>
1.5 tons of VX( 140 liters can kill 1 million people)<br>
 and not to mention all the unnaccounted for delivery systems.<br>
OMG!  What was I thinking.  He probably just used a chemistry set from Toys R Us to make all that!<br>

However I do sometimes feel the urge to try to share some wisdom with the less fortunate (read: you).<br>
<br>
Spin human rights violations by the US 200 years ago? Well I admit CITING THE FACTUAL SLAUGHTER of an indigenous people is easier than researching the recent violations and violators we wholeheartedly support. As is the case with most modern nations, ours does its best to hide the ongoing atrocities it sponsors. <br>
<br>
And while it may make me feel abit like a parent who has to inform their child that Santa isn't real... I have to break it to you that we're not invading Iraq over human rights issues. We don't do that unless its convenient, and control over the middle east is very convenient in the eyes of some politicians.<br>
<br>
As much as I'd like to, I don't have time to explain that rational thought does not preclude cruelty. I'm sure he'd love to take a shot at us if he thought he could get away with it. But barring any catastrophic event which renders us incapable of launching an unstoppable retaliatory force... I don't see it happening.<br>
<br>
Oh and if you don't like sarcasm, don't ask for me for it.<br>
