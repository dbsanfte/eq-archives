Obviously something that not allowed according to the EULA is the same as using a service which is completely acceptable with no repercutions (sp?) such as being banned, which would you qualify for if you use 3rd party programs.  What was I thinking? /smack Stanexx<br>

Omg your so right!  Acknowledgement by 3 ex AD and a screenshot of Primadonna using MQ is totally unfounded!  How could I have ever imagined a guild such as AD promoting cheating.<br>
<br>
<br>
My question still stands.  Why do you use illegal 3rd party programs, and why is it supported by your leadership?<br>

<br>
Firstly, Select members from LV, DB and AD have all used cheats in the past.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, No officer of AD has ever condoned or even hinted at the use of hacks, cheats, exploits or bugs in game or on boards, and I've been reading the boards a long damn time, ever since Lelu joined Sabbat.  In the LV and DB cases none of the above was ever openly supported, and Mangar has been adamant against the use of them.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I have seen Stynk get yelled at for a wide variety of behavior, numerous times being guildremoved for doing so.  He was reguilded at times b/c at heart he's a nice guy who means well and it was a value judgement by the officers at every juncture, in the end he could not be reguilded due to these numerous infractions.  Did he ever cheat or use macros in Velks or any other zone, it's possible, but no one but him knows 100%.<br>
<br>
The problem is that everyone wants to say, I know for fact when they've only suspected, and then say since they know for a &quot;fact&quot; it happened once then it must be supported, b/c I said it happened and officers didnt do anything.  But when someone of a rival sect makes accusations w/o solid proof, leadership is never going to believe it.  I would never have expected Mangar to deguild anyone on my word alone, and likewise, no LV, DB or anyone else should expect any kind of consideration from AD officers given the lengthy and ill-mannered confilict between these groups.  <br>
<br>
I think that I have seen numerous individuals use numerous hacks in the last 5 years, but I've never made any drama, or open accusations, about it b/c in every single instance I had no proof to come forward with.  I wish that any individual, pizz in this case especially, would include proof with his first accusation, or atleast wait until he has said proof in his hands to make any kind of post that he wishes for anyone to believe.  <br>
<br>
I have very little taste for drama, and normally I would ignore such threads in their entirety.  In this case, however, there are some very serious accusations being made that could be proven, and would love for someone to please provide such proof.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to say that I hold no blanket opinions or theories about any guild or sect in the history of RZ.  I have known people from every sect who I did not care for, and likewise some from every group I have genuinely liked.  I feel that every group, and their leaders, have tried to be the best they can in their desired style of play.  I just wish others could try give the kind of respect that wish to receive from others and avoid totally obsurd blanket statements from individual facts.   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
Aye, I did miss it, was away for 3 months- I am curious about one thing though Stanex.  How would you or any LV know what MQ looked like in the first place?  I've never used it, or seen it being used, so wouldn't know it if I saw it.  Given Mangar's staunch denials- I wonder how any LV knew what it was they saw so definitely?<br>
<br>
As far as the SS itself, I'll believe it when I see it.  Supposed SS's were bragged about on that linked LV thread but never hosted.  What you claim to have seen in a screenshot is your own business- I'll take the word of a guildmate over yours any day of the week.  Because they have something you don't- credibility.  Someone who trusts pizz has really lost any shred of that commodity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And no, I haven't seen any account ganking or AA exploiting unlike some people<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The ex-PB in your guild, some of whom play, most of whom just post bullshit on messageboards have been guilty of all of the above.  That you can deny pizz and his arsebuddies were involved in all of these scams is beyond belief.  <br>
<br>
Hell, one of your guildmates was even stupid enough to exploit his HT disc. and use it on two guildmates who were online at the same time.  If you're going to be a cheating arsemuppet, then how can you be that fucking stupid to boot Salaiin?  I suppose that's one explanation why your guild is still no threat to any of us- and that's despite all the money you've spent buying accounts (violating EULA) and all the time on $tormhammer.  Despite all that, despite the obvious cheating I've seen from one of your players as recently as a week ago, you're still not even on the scoreboard.  I mean, you're not even fit to lick the dirt off FU's boots- one wonders why you go on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Omg your so right! Acknowledgement by 3 ex AD <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Anecdotes and accusations are a dime a dozen on this server- one of those members is one of your guildmates now ffs.  How stupid do you think the people reading this are Stanex?  People aren't so craven as to take accusations at face value, they'll want incontravertible proof- you don't have any.  No one's going to take your word unless they're idiots.  Your very game experience depends on ruining other peoples'- since you can't even do that to us in game, you chose to try on MBs, and failed, it's as obvious as Salaiin exploiting his HT timer on two members of the same guild, hoping in his tiny little mind that they won't actually talk to each other.<br>
<br>
Again, it comes back to why the hell you care, or think we should care what you say Stanex.  You don't even play more than a few minutes at a time, you're not even FROM rallos, you're a transfer.  You play a pvp class, but privately, you're a joke to our members.  Most have at least grudging respect for the likes of Vasten or Ravendas/Shoon, but you?  Ha.<br>
<br>
  You'll never be a threat to AD's raid schedule, you'll never be more than one of a group of cockroaches pinching crumbs and scuttling away when we turn on the lights.  Is this farcical crusade of yours fueled from moral superiority?  Obviously it can't be, look at the shit you choose to wallow in.  That leaves bitterness- and if that is what chokes your gullet, and drives this drama post then I can't help this smile on my lips <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lol.  That's funny.  Nope, I am from Rallos.. although Stanex isn't on Rallos right now.  <br>
<br>
And why do you keep making referrals of me being in LV?  I'm not in Lucid Vision nor ever was.. although I'm good friends with many.<br>

Its something that they really liked to &quot;kinda  enforce&quot;. In no way shape or form am I here to discredit the guild I helped build. I was just stating a fact that it did happen. Was it publicly announced, or did lohen, awfal, adell know about it?? Prolly not, but things go on within a guild that they would have no controll over. Hell most of the time we spent fighting FU, PB and wondering how the fuck they did some of the shit they did. I was slim shady about some shit ya, never used hacks tho, Vanesslyn, Slivur, Lelu can verify being at my crib for a weekend and such. I played the game straight up and regardless of my &quot; slim shadyness&quot; I helped put AD where they are today..<br>
