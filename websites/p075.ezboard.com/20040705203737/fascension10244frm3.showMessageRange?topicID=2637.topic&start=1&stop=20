potential server move.</span><hr size=1> hi im considering a server move for 4 accounts (3 are mine 1 is my wife) i was told to probably check server boards and see what servers are like when considering what server to move to. Could you guys point me in the direction of a serverboard for Rallos Zek? Posted here because this is a RZ guild i recognized.<br>
<br>
A little more info if you guys care to answer some questions we are currently on Vallon Zek and cant get into a decent guild because of politics on the server (either me or my wife has pissed off to some degree the 4 top guilds). I'd enjoy staying on a pvp server, the wife would like to go to a blue server but thats more due to bad pvp experiences (training+ccing+trash talking) from what i've heard about rallos zek there might be enough pvp (i love good mass pvp and enjoy single pvp on my sk) for me and it might be umm civil enough for her. We both enjoy pve, i love to grind exp sad enough as that is to say hehe. Although since on VZ we are atm in like a epic level guild i cant stand to raid that content that often. Anyways if you guys can help me out and tell me what RZ is like i would appreciate it. <p>Dhantes Edmond &lt;Argent Guard&gt;<br>

i highly doubt that sir.<br>
pretty much all of the &quot;raiding guilds&quot; try to work peacefully during xp grps/rotations of raids.<br>
But every few months or so a small war breaks out. it clears up the bad blood and usually combines small guilds together until ppl spread out and it repeates itself. <p>&quot;We are the middle children of history-no purpose or place.

<br>
To me VZ looks like its all out of options like no guilds me and the wife can join to get upgrades im abit sick of LDON's since after they nerfed them when GoD came out. And my SK has all the aa's i really want on him (really has 243 just lazy to update sig) so grinding on him is kinda boring. So thinking maybe we could move to RZ (when i can afford the 300dollars it will cost to move all 4 accounts) and i can keep doing the occasional pvp and have the occasional guild pvp but we can raid things like i dont know ssra+vt (even though im too lazy to camp shards) hell i would love to see the EP's im not a server transfer just looking either to own people in pvp with my time gear (only have like velious era gear like primal and stuff) nor am i person looking to tag along on my way to time like most red transfers to say SH or other blue servers.<br>
<br>
Oh heh and if you've heard of my wife feppes or know her i guess i'd prefer you keep it to yourself hehe, i know she has her history and knew that before i met her but well...<br>
<br>
Anyways back to my original question RZ have a board i could visit to look into what guilds are like and server is like and stuff? OR could you guys help me out with info? Like say for instance on LDON's people do /ooc in pok for them but like 90% of the ldon adv are guild based and stuff is it like that on RZ for example, or would i have decent luck doing /ooc lvl 65 cleric, wiz, sk (bst can only 2box atm so playing either bst or sk) and form groups in pok reasonably well...see on VZ if i do that like 1/3 tells i get will probably be KOS heh and the other 2/3 i just cant stand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Anyways i do appreciate any info, wife may just want to move to a blue server which is okay but im not sure if its right for me. When i made my first character troll sk i got him to about 5 on vazealle then moved to VZ. <p>Dhantes Edmond &lt;Argent Guard&gt;<br>

Well, from what I've seen/heard from the other Zeks, Rallos isn't quite so gimp-vs-gimp, however, the politics are an ass pain.<br>
<br>
Chances are if you managed to get yourself KOS on one of the other Zeks, it won't take you too long to get KOS here either.<br>
<br>
Crossing the wrong person from the wrong guild, in even the slightest manner seems to be the most common method of earning KOS to someone here.<br>
<br>
There's a few small guilds that prefer to guild war anyone and everyone at the drop of the hat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=feppas>Feppas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rated PG-13</span><br>  Posts: 1054<br> <font color=#333333>(4/8/04 4:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2637.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does RZ have a serverboard? potential server move.</span><hr size=1> Dimento- go eat a dick sir.<br>

Umm anyways checked your guys site checked the liek what 6 guilds links there heh, none really seemed exactly where i wanted to be but /shrug more research i guess. Now i was in a very good dkp family type guild that was doing good progress back in the day on VZ till it turned into something else, so i have alot of love for DKP is there any guilds on this server which run on DKP? <br>
<br>
Still no board to check about the server? The vz board is like pwned.something i've checked it once or twice full of assholes who bitch about post count and shit but heh well thats how the server elite is on VZ, actually what server i would like to move to would be Fironia Vie for the no no drop rule but heh im not good at acquiring money anyways so probably wouldn't help me that much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and i'd still miss the pvp and then again there is the whole no transfering to FV rule hehe.

<br>
I was in a good guild once went from doing tov to ssra took us about 4 months but the guild developed well everyone got gear we were on a dkp system and we pvp'd alot against the two pk guilds at the time and sucked but eventually learned how to work well together and got much much better...well now every guild on the server is a pk guild basically heh always looking to pick on those weaker then them.

AD isn't like that. And, for the most part, neither is the server. <br>

<br>
Most of RZ don't go around picking on people and randomly attacking them.  We're an insanely political server, since you have to answer for your injustices to everyone else on the server.  <br>
<br>
There's little to no GM Intervention on our server as most matters can generally be taken care of on our own.  Always welcome to transfer over and become a PK though, usually they end up doing it for like a month or so, then hate it when people attack them all the time -- transfer somewhere else or player auction their account.<br>
