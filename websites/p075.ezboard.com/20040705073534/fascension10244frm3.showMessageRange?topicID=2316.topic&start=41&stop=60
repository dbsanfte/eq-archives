__________________<br>
<br>
my point is that while other companies may pay min wage (and i am not debating min wages)  no other company systematicly attempts to create slave workers.<br>
<br>
no other company prevents 70% of its work force from having more than 28 hours a week, and prohibits &quot;moonlighting&quot;<br>
<br>
no other company has a public corparate plan that states its intent to drive all other competing companies out of bussness and become a monopoly. and when it has it ( they raise prices)<br>
<br>
no other company relies on goverment subsidies in the terms of welfare etc to help pay its work force<br>
<br>
no other company has the appaling benifit package that wal mart does (assuming the other companies offer one) and strives to ensure that its own empoyees cant benifit from them<br>
<br>
no other company in the history of hte internet has been so demanding of sole ownership of its name in terms of URL's  wal mart will sue you for owner ship of any variation of its name.  such as www.walmartsucks.com  you are not allowed to have critizing url's  check the WIPO.<br>
<br>
NO OTHER COMPANY BLANTENTLY hires illegal workers to reduce labour costs in the numbers and as persentaly as wal mart.<br>
<br>
for a look at what wal mart employees feel about thier company <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Breakers/6420/fstories.htm">www.geocities.com/SouthBe...tories.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Wal-Mart jobs are part-time...so what?  So are McDonalds and any other food chain.  These jobs are designed to be full-time so you shouldn't expect to receive full-time wages from them.  Companies choose to hire a majority of their labor as part-time workers b/c it is the smartest thing to do.  The costs of health care continues to soar year after year and I dont care how profitable a company is, there is a thin line between that and floundering.  <br>
<br>
What is really going on here is that ppl are singling Wal-Mart out b/c it is in so many locations.  You are saying that just b/c Wal-Mart is the only &quot;good&quot; place to work in a certain area that it take up the burden of supplying all employees with the same level of care.  What would those same ppl do if there wasn't a Wal-Mart to work part-time at?  They'd be 10x worse off or they'd have to move to find a job.  I come from a town where is is no Wal-Mart.  There is a Dairy Queen, a Minit Mart, Sav-a-Lot and a Dollar Store.  All of which employ roughly 10 employees each, managers included.  Do you really think that those 40 ppl are being paid so much better b/c there is no Wal-Mart?  If anything I'd say they're probably starting out at less.  Atleast Wal-Mart is paying above minimum, you seem to be missing that fact.  And they don't promise to hire everyone full-time, so why should they have to?  It is not an employers responsibility to ensure that part-time employees can survive on that income alone.  There is no way anyone can survive on part-time employment, and if they're trying to do so then it is their own fault.  I specifically dont want to hear that there is just &quot;nothing esle to do.&quot;  Anyone can move to find better work, americans have been doing it for decades, and if you come out of high school and have absolutely no prospects then there are 4 branches of the military who would be happy to train you and pay you.  <br>
<br>
Wal-Mart can't be blamed for the cycle of poverty.  Anyone can find a way to better themselves, and most anyone who tries to find a way, does.  But the problem is all these ppl your heart is bleeding for are probably saying, &quot;I dont want to move, I dont want to work in a factory, I dont want to work 2 jobs...Why oh why won't Wal-Mart let me go full time?&quot;  <br>
<br>
So go cry me a damn river about people who want to stay in a part-time job and expect to get by based solely on that income.  The bottom line is that Wal-Mart payes better than a lot of places, they just don't let everyone go full-time so they don't have to provide everyone with benefits, what do you think would happen if they fired all the part-time and hired only full-time w/ benefits.  The work force would shrink from over 100 per store maybe 40 people.  How much better of would the community be then?  I bet those 40 would be thrilled to make 20k a year + benefits, but what about all the part-timers who went from 12k to nothing so others could have better jobs? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Here's just one story to show what it does:<br>
<br>
A small day care center had to start paying its caretakers more.  They couldn't afford to do that, since raising rates is out of the question since most of the customers make the &quot;living wage&quot; as well.  They lay off a bunch of workers due to this shortfall in money.  Lots of kids are left without day care and the mothers can't afford to pay the new rates charged by the day care centers, so they have to quit their jobs or do some other drastic measures.  IT DOESN'T work.<br>
<br>
Would you buy a TV at Wal Mart for $200, or would you pay $300 at some store who has better benefits for their employees?  Good for you if you can afford to stand by your principles, but most of us can't.<br>
<br>
Face it, two dimensional thinking is basically all this &quot;living wage&quot; crap is.  SOMEONE has to pay in the end.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I read Nickel and Dimed for shits and giggles last night.  It definately is leftist propoganda.  Gotta love the part at the end about mandatory drug testing not being fair to the lower class.  Sounds to me like someone was upset she couldn't smoke pot while she was doing her little experiment.<br>
<br>
The only people drug testing isnt fair to is DRUG USERS.  BTW, drug labs pay well and provide jobs. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

walmart prevents its employes from working full time<br>
<br>
70% of its work force works 28 hours or less (dept labour look it up)<br>
<br>
28 x 6.25 (min wage?) x 56 = 9800 before taxes  I challenge you to live off that.<br>

wait til walmart comes to town and puts that dollar store and  forces those mini mart and dairy queen etc to close thier doors.  I truely belive that they are being paid better they likly get near 40 hours a week<br>
<br>
walmart dirves other places of potential work out<br>

What they do, for the most part, is legal.  Yes, sometimes people get jobs there who aren't citizens...but they are under false ID.  Wal-Mart is fined for this.  The &quot;national crack down on Wal-Mart&quot; for employing illegael aliens was what...40 people...whats that... .001% of their workforce?<br>
<br>
You elect your town officals.  You can write your town officals if you dont like something.  Most smaller towns put a &quot;yes/no vote on huge stores on the ballot as a town recommendation...the offical can go against it...but its not that wise if the wants to get re-elected&quot;.<br>
<br>
You can say &quot;well Walmart pays these people off&quot;.  First of all, show me proof that one time this has happened.  Second of all, YOU ELECTED THE TOWN OFFICALS WHO ALLOWED WAL-MART IN.  IF THEY ARE TAKING BRIBES, YOU ELECTED A SCUM BAG.  <br>
<br>
Quit whining about Wal-Mart doing this or that.  It doesnt matter WHAT they do as long as WHAT they do is LEGAL.  Blame your town officals if you dont like something...or blame yourself for electing the wrong guy.<br>
<br>
Instead of wasting your time &quot;boycotting&quot; Wal-Mart, encourage more people to get out and vote if they care.  Oh wait...being pro-active is a thing of the past for Americans today...we are only a reactionary society (COUGH COUGH Boycotts, SEC, Opposition to War in Iraq, Hanging Chads, Simone Holcomb (Army Mom), etc etc)<br>

They could work at McDonalds, or work in an entry level factory job.  Or work at Jiffy Lube.  Even in towns with 2 or 3 Wal Marts, and a Kmart and a Target too...there are ALWAYS entry level jobs.  Anyone who works at Wal Mart, is there BY CHOICE.  If they don't make enough, they can go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I just get so tired of this anti business attitude in our country (and probably other countries too) these days.  People don't stop to think about the economics of scale.  I have worked in retail for many years, including at Wal Mart a little over 10 years ago.  There is almost NO profit in retail because of the competition.  That leads to low wages.  But it also means that the jobs are incredibly easy to get and keep as long as you don't steal stuff or do drugs.<br>
<br>
Face it, not everyone has an advanced degree in rocket science or bio-chemistry, or is a corporate lawyer or one of the Hilton sisters.  Someone will always have to be the one ringing the rest of us up at Wal Mart.  Maybe if that person works hard enough they can become full time, or a manager there.  If they don't, they can go do something else.  Drive a truck, join the Army, dig ditches, whatever.  Thats what makes this country great.<br>
<br>
Until then, if you hate Wal mart stay away from them, just means one less person in line when I go to ring up. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

If some dumbass motherfucker is only working 28 hours out of the week at one job - he/she isn't applying himself.    There's 168 hours in the week, if he sits on his ass for 140 of them bitching about EVIL WALMART then I hope his/her ass IS in poverty.  Because the finer things in life are obviously too hard for this person to grasp.<br>

Yes, I have lived in conditions where it was &quot;pay rent, or eat&quot;  I got off my ass, quit working at Sears and found something better.  (evil Sears too!)  I can be done, its not difficult really - merely takes motivation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vegetoee>vegetoee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(11/6/03 5:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2316.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somthing I have always wanted to open a debate on.</span><hr size=1> i agree with derm!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sighkoxblumpkin>Sighkox Blumpkin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ihateaol.co.uk/misc/galleries/show.php/thumbnail//funnypics/thread_direction.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#333333>(11/6/03 4:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2316.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somthing I have always wanted to open a debate on.</span><hr size=1> I actually quit Wal Mart to work at Sears.<br>

Did that make it right?<br>
<br>
All this &quot;well its just the way things are&quot; arguement is a load of crap. Things are the way we make them. Noone made Sam Walton go out of his way to slash salaries and drive every competitor he could out of business. He could've lived quite comfortably with a fraction of what he had. But no, because we encourage it he pushed the absolute limit of what was legal (and what isn't - illegal immigrants working in how many wal-marts now?). And frankly I don't it should be tolerated. Personally I do put my money where my mouth is. I don't shop at wal-mart. <br>
<br>
And hes hardly the only one, but his company is quite argueably the worst. And what the fuck do you know about laziness equating with poverty Ehun? I know plenty of people who work damn fucking hard, work their asses off to try to attend classes and work a dead-end job just to make ends meet. And what the hells going to happen if they get into a crisis? Fire, illness, accident; alot of people can't afford to pay insurance on everything.. especially not on the kind of wages walmart pays.<br>
<br>
But fine, you want to know what I suggest? Well I'd like to start with a few rolling heads, but since I know where that'll go how about this. <br>
<br>
One - far more goverment scrutiny on our largest corporations. Watch how much, and more importantly how they make their money. Alot of it isn't nearly as legal as you seem to think. Our country isn't exactly tough on corporate crime, despite the devestating affects it has on our citizens.<br>
<br>
Two - Instead of sending aid packages overseas, or using our tax dollars to fund military adventures into Iraq that only benefit one class of citizen (the super rich), why don't we use that money to fund... well since the example has already been provided, necessities like day care. Or medical coverage, or tuition. <br>
<br>
I'm sure there are other ways we could improve upon the systems. But for the love of god stop babbling back those bullshit arguements &quot;poor = lazy&quot; to me. I've heard em all before and for awhile I was really stupid enough to believe em. And ya, the solutions aren't always perfect, and they don't always work the first time we try em. But theres gotta be something better than allowing citizens of what is I believe we'll all agree, one of the greatest nations in the world, to suffer down in the gutter while some of us stand on their shoulders to get to a point of such unimaginable wealth that they and their decendants could literally retire on what they have and never work a day of their lives.<br>

<br>
Fact is, the left is the side that benefits most from class warfare.  Constantly telling people that government is the answer to all that ails them, thereby securing themselves power and fortune.<br>
<br>
It just boils my blood every time I see the same arguments brought up over and over again.  Face it, we can't all be rich.  We can't all be smart, good looking, well spoken or athletic either. We take what we have and make the best of it, and try to be happy.  The government shutting down Wal Mart, or Microsoft or god knows whatever company you people will go after next is not the way to happiness.<br>
<br>
And whats wrong with some people being so rich they can wipe their ass with $100 bills.  Someone had to work goddamn hard for that money at one point.  Even Sam Walton.  And his kids have every right to never have to work if thats what he wanted to do with his money when he died.  Just think, if Conrad Hilton hadn't been rich, his daughters would have to work and wouldn't have time to screw everything that moves and put out sex tapes for us to watch.<br>

As for illegal immigrants, better stop eating fruits and veggies if you don't wanna support that. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

Somthor, it is funy that you mentioned illegal workers at Wal-Mart. If I was to look for illegas a large retailer would be the last business I'd go after. Hint: look at the oil companies and large gas-station franchises that they own, look at agricultural producers. Oh wait, those industries are basically untouchable by the current administration due to being pretty high on the compaign contributors lists and such... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derm1>Derm 1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Priest of GOOD GUYS!</span><br>  Posts: 1173<br> <font color=#333333>(11/6/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2316.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> they weren't wal-mart employees actually, they were working for a contracted firm.

wal mart has a policy to prevent you from working that second job.  <br>
<br>
wal mart makes additional profit by taking out life insurance on select employees with them selves as the benificary.<br>
<br>
______________________________________<br>
<br>
just suppose it was you and for whatever reason walmart was the only job available for you at the time.  you look elsewhere but becuse you are so close to broke you cant afford to miss that paycheck when you transfer to that new job.  fear keeps you in place.<br>
<br>
________________________________________<br>
<br>
remebr for the most part we who play everquest espicaly the AD, wudan, mim people are driven to succeed.  we are typicaly more proactive in our choices and more intellegent than the norm.  try to think what you would do if you were in a hick town wioht no job openings or you were un skilled and un educated and lacked the internal self confidence or ability to improve.<br>
<br>
in days of yore.. companies took care of thier workers paid them a decent wage gave them promotions and pay rasies some decent benifits and if you hung around long enough even perhaps a retirement<br>
<br>
wal mart fires people who earn too much money looks for ways to get talented persons to quit or work for less.. activly demotes managers and uses constant job transfers to slow down progress.  sure they allow a few to progress but in general terms they want people to either work at min wage FOREVER with no benifits and be happy  or leave.<br>
<br>
Dermel look it up there are more than jsut one case of wal mart improprities than jsut he sub contractors.<br>
<br>
other companies are also guilty but walmart is the most extreme, if they can sue (and waste millions of tax dollars ) MS why not Wal-mart since they make 2x the revenue are worht 2x as much and are 10x as bad <p>vita non est vivere sed valere vita est<br>
