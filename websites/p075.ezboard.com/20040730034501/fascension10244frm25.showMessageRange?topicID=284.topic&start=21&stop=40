&quot;Hey Joe, you got any rubber bullets on you?  No?  Okay, let me go check the car and see if I have any in the trunk while this psycho slashes up a few more people. I'll be back in a few.&quot;<br>
<br>
Give me a break.  Rubber bullets, sand bags, and stun guns are NOT standard issue for the LAPD.  They are considered &quot;Riot Gear&quot; and only used in certain situations.  LAPD are not trained to use rubber bullets to stop people wielding fucking swords. I've been shot with a rubber bullet in the chest before.  I can almost guarantee you by looking at that guy's photo a rubber bullet wouldn't have done jack. And it's moot anyway since they don't carry rubber bullets or stun guns on them.  <br>
<br>
You arrive at a scene and see a suspect wielding a deadly weapon, and not responding to your orders to stop. He advances on you and you're going to drop him.  As has been said, your first concern is for your safety and the people around you, not his.<br>
<br>
&quot;like i said i dont know all the details but at the moment i feel that those officers failed to use reasonable force.&quot;<br>
<br>
What do you consider reasonable force against someone who's wielding a sword that has killed 3 people?  Please describe specifically how you would have handled the situation differently without ensuring more people got hurt.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's likly only me&quot;<br>
<br>
Definately <br>
<br>
&quot;but i fail to comperhend how a lone man in a contained situation was a imeadiate thret to 3 &quot;well&quot; trained officers wearing body armour.&quot;<br>
<br>
Um, where di the article say they were wearing body armor or that the situation was &quot;well contained?&quot;  Also, most vests do not protect from fucking samurai swords.  The area or protection a vest offers is very minimal. I would feel safer wearing a vest against a guy with a gun than a guy with a 3 foot long sword.  <br>
<br>
And just because someone is wearing a vest that covers their chest, does not mean you can afford to take additional risks.  This isn't Quake where you know your body armor is going to take a certain amount of dmg before you get hurt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333333>(7/2/03 1:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=284.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> no</span><hr size=1> &quot;and please most body armour today will defintly slow or stop a knife its desinged to to that as well sure it might not help with a needle object but these guys went in knowing the were about to face a man with mental problems armed with a large sword. plastic or ceramic inserts further woudl help in this situation&quot;<br>
<br>
Most body armor today will definately not stop an edged object. Body armor for law enforcement use is designed to stop bullets, not knives.  I have never known a cop who felt protection from an edged weapon because they were wearing body armor.  I would feel safer letting someone shoot me in the chest with a 9mm wearing armor than I would even &quot;trying&quot; to subdue someone wielding a sword with my fucking hands and body armor.  <br>

Damn straight, let one of those three get stabbed so that his sword will be embeded deep in someone's chest long enough that the other officers can subdue him.<br>
<br>
Somthor, your views are so vastly different from mine on this that I'm just boggled how you can raise the value of life above someone elses.  In this situation, you're broken down to right and wrong.   The person has mental problems and killed two people, many eye witnesses, so it's not as if there's a question of guilt.  If it comes to deciding between which one has to go, self preservation prevales and the person with the gun lives and the crazy SoB that chose a sword dies.  I agree with the force the police used.  Don't blind yourself to this guy being a criminal.  Bleeding heart people really do bother me when they value a criminal's life over someone who puts their life on the line every day to save my ass if it's ever needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#333333>(7/2/03 3:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=284.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> d</span><hr size=1> &quot;small town... he was well known to be a odd duck.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're either reading a different article or making things up.  143000 people in Irvine.  That might be small by some standards, but not small enough where everyone knows everyone.  It said nothing about him being &quot;well known&quot; as odd.  Only that a few of his co-workers thought so.   And where in the article did it state the officers knew who the person was?  Or that they were aware he had a mental condition?  Even if they did know that, it wouldn't have changed anything.  He had killed people and wounded others. Officers are not trained to use less force on a lunatic killing people with a sword than a &quot;normal&quot; guy killing people with a sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;by your reasoning they should have shot him on sight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure where you came up with that deduction. I said no such thing.  I would have shot him the minute he came at me with a sword.  I would have approached, identified myself, and ordered him to put down the sword.   As soon as he took a step toward me and I thought my life was in danger I would have fired.  And any other officer would have done the same.  <br>
<br>
The article states the that he &quot;confronted an officer before fellow officers shot him.&quot;  That sounds to me like he went after one officer with a sword, and another officer shot him. Based solely on the article, I don't see even a hint of innaprorpiate conduct on the officers' parts, and I doubt anything will come of it.  The facts as we know them are that he was armed, and he went after an officer.  That right there is enough for justifiable cause to discharge their weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;several store shoopers managed to deal with him without injury useing the various itmes in the store to keep him at bay while the otehr patrons left the store&quot;<br>
<br>
Without injury?  You mean beside the 2 dead and 3 wounded?  <br>
<br>
&quot;you had at the time the officers entered a empty store which they entered after being advised of the situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where is this coming from?  Where does it say the store was empty?  Where does it say they were &quot;advised of the situation?&quot;  The article states that the shoppers were fleeing the store AS the officers were entering it.  You're making it out as if he killed people, everyone ran out, and then sat in there and chilled for awhile while officers formed a plan outside and then went in after him.<br>
<br>
&quot;i dont know any officer who doesnt carry a collapable baton that would be very effective in disarming and suubuing a person carring a sword.&quot;<br>
<br>
A collapsable baton against a samurai sword?  No thanks, I'd use my gun.  I would use a baton against a knife, but definately not against a sword.  CJA doesn't teach how to swordfight or deflect incoming jabs with a collapsable baton.  When I think of &quot;sword&quot; I think of something that's 3-4 feet long.  I'm not stupid enough to risk my life by trying to counter his thrusts with a baton.  He has distance and a cutting edge on you.  No other officer I know would do that either.  That;s as ridiculous as the idea of trying to use a stun gun on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;but THINK this guy was contained they could have taken him down without trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
They &quot;could&quot; have.  Without one of them getting killed or wounded?  Possibly not.  The article doesn't giev enough information to make that judgement.  For all you know the guy was still swinging at people when the officers got there.<br>
<br>
&quot; they could have jsut plain tackeld the guy 3 vs one give me a break.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol.  Yeah, he's got a damned sword and you're going to rush him and try to tackle him?  That is absurd.  Give me a samurai sword and try to tackle me.   You can have 15 people. I guarantee I'll stab at least one of them.  <br>
<br>
&quot;if they felt unsure they could have waited for back up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agian, as the article stated, he confronted one of the officers with the sword.  His fellow officers shot the man before he was able to complete it.  What would you do if a guy came at you with a sword?  Turn and run until you can get backup?<br>
<br>
&quot;dont get hostile with me for having a different veiw point than yours &quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not hostile. I just think your opinions are looney.  Based on what you read in the article and a few things you made up, you act as if it was the officer's fault that he's dead.  It's just insane because their actions are so textbook and reasonable, and there's not even a hint that they did anything wrong. The article doesn't state the sword turned out to be a broom or a cell phone.  It states he had already killed 2 people and came after the police with a sword! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A> at: 7/2/03 3:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goltanarallos>GoltanaRallos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(7/2/03 4:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=284.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: g</span><hr size=1> I think Tavil basically summed it up.<br>

Just because he's in a corner doesn't mean he's easy to subdue. People can even react worse 'backed into a corner' then they would in other situations. I don't think there is any problem with the officers reactions, I'm sure if it's questioned it will be dismissed. I understand sympathy for the obviously disturbed man, any [b]MAYBE[/b] that armor can protect against knives, but it's not going to protect against some samurai sword, no way. Even if it &quot;snares&quot; the weapon down, you know how much of that you need to snare and the efficiency of it? It's not a 2 inch point that can just be deflected. Anyway, hopefully we won't see more of these incidents in the future <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Goltana</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->[/center]<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/godfather/378/kenshingallery/kencute.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I'm not even going to imply the officers in question were excessive in the force they used, but I very much do hope that our legal system looks into it as they should when anyone is killed by an officer, (which is really NOT very common). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#333333>(7/2/03 4:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=284.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: g</span><hr size=1> &quot;there is a QUESTION as to IF the police on the scene COULD have used less force.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anytime there is an officer-related shooting there will ALWAYS be that question.  But from what I've read in the article, it apperas as if the guy with the sword came after the officer, and the other officers shot him before he could make it to him in time to kill him.  That's just the mental image I cam eup with when I read the article. Perhaps it didn't happen that way. However any officer that sees someone wielding a sword who has just killed people with it, will draw their weapon.  Officers only draw their weapons on someone if they are prepared to kill them.  The fact that he was running around with a sword he had just kiled two people with meant he was dangerous enough to warrant that kind of action.  <br>
<br>
&quot;For those of you who cant see his point its kinda sad&quot;... I've never seen so many people so quick to exhonorate all police activities as if they've never used unreasonable or excessive force.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're grouping all police into one category.  You can't say that because some police use excessive force, these officers did.  Innocent until proven guilty?  If the specifi officers in question have used excessive force before, I'll take back that statement.  <br>
<br>
&quot;but I very much do hope that our legal system looks into it as they should when anyone is killed by an officer&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost all departments in the US put officers on paid suspension, pending an investigation, anytime there is an officer-involved shooting.  <br>
<br>
I understand his point, but he makes it out as if the officers were &quot;trigger-happy&quot; and shot this guy when they could have easily just tackled him.  Just because he was killing someone with a sword instead of an automatic weapon does not make him any less dangerous.  If a guy is running around with a sword and is intent on keeping it, you do not have many options other than drawing your weapon. From the article, it sounded like a clean shoot. I just don't understand how anyone can suspect otherwise given the information solely in the CNN article. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=somthor>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 683<br> <font color=#333333>(7/2/03 5:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=284.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iofthestorm.org/images/mok.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: g</span><hr size=1> actualy i read two articals once is in the orange county paper.

not sure if its still current<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway i suggest we gimp the thread, doesnt see possible to debate a event without more information on it.<br>
<br>
I still think that the officer in question panicked and did not deal with the situation as well as it could have been.  But i'll also grant that it entrily possible it was a text book shooting and every option was exhusted (doubtful)<br>
<br>
130k is small to me youd be amazed how well informed a police dept can be in a city that size.<br>
