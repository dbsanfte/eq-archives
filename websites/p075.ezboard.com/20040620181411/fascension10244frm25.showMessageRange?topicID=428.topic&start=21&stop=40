Well Cerien, if due process is too expensive it can always be trashed right?  Hey, if death saves money Somthor- why don't we just shoot criminals in situ at the site of their crime?  Thieves, jaywalkers, panhandlers- why even bother with all that cumbersome police paperwork- just KILL EM ALL!!!!~£$@~<br>
<br>
Whatever the arguments for or against state-sponsored murder of citizens, if you're going to bring cost into it then as well to ask why we even have judicial process.  No need to dig through the archives either, in the last 3 years alone there have been over 450 miscarriages of justice wiped off the books in Britain, 80 of which are capital crimes in many US states.  Pretty shocking when you consider the UK has the third lowest rate of miscarriage per head of population in the developed world.  80 less people, hundreds in the US if you consider the differing crime rates- how many innocents die before the &quot;savings&quot; are no longer worth the price?<br>
<br>
I say one, others may try and juggle the numbers, good luck to them.  The Marquis de Sade understood the nature of execution 200 years ago, remarking: <br>

Not sure who it is who's taking this to extremes Somthor- to me, a government willing to murder its citizens and call it justice- that is extreme.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i was mearly pointing out that the death pentatly saves the taxpayer money<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, and torturing information out of petty criminals might help prevent crime, shooting criminals on sight might well reduce crime, both of which save a lot of tax dollars too.<br>
<br>
My point stands- saying a means of sentence &quot;saves the taxpayer money&quot; is no argument at all.  You have to argue on the ethical and practical rehabilitative effects of punishment, or not at all.  The effects on society and the individual fine- but cost as an argument by itself means nothing.<br>

Death penalty trials are very costly relative to county budgets. Capital cases burden county budgets with large unexpected costs, according to a report released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, &quot;The Budgetary Repercussions of Capital Convictions,&quot; by Katherine Baicker. Counties manage these high costs by decreasing funding for highways and police and by increasing taxes. The report estimates that between 1982-1997 the extra cost of capital trials was $1.6 billion. (NBER Working Paper No. w8382, Issued in July 2001) Read the abstract. <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Total cost of death penalty 38% greater than total cost of life without parole sentences.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A study by Indiana's Criminal Law Study Commission found this to be true, assuming that 20% of death sentences are overturned and resentenced to life. (Indiana Criminal Law Study Commission, January 10, 2002) <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>North Carolina spends $2.16 million more per execution than on a non-death penalty murder case.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The most comprehensive death penalty study in the country found that the death penalty costs North Carolina $2.16 million more per execution than the a non-death penalty murder case with a sentence of life imprisonment (Duke University, May 1993). On a national basis, these figures translate to an extra cost of over $1 billion spent since 1976 on the death penalty.  The study,&quot;The Costs of Processing Murder Cases in North Carolina&quot; is available on line at www-pps.aas.duke.edu/people/faculty/cook/comnc.pdf. <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Florida spends $51 million extra per year on death penalty.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Florida would save $51 million each year by punishing all first-degree murderers with life in prison without parole, according to estimates by the Palm Beach Post. Based on the 44 executions Florida has carried out since 1976, that amounts to an approximate cost of $24 million for each execution.  This finding takes into account the relatively few inmates who are actually executed, as well as the time and effort expended on capital defendants who are tried but convicted of a lesser murder charge, and those whose death sentences are overturned on appeal. (Palm Beach Post, January 4, 2000) <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>California spends $90 million annually beyond ordinary costs of justice system.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> $78 million of that total is incurred at the trial level (Sacramento Bee, March 18, 198<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . In January 2003, despite a budge deficit, California Governor Gray Davis proposed building a new $220 million state of the art death row. (New York Times, January 14, 2003) <br>
Florida spent average of $3.2 million per execution from 1973 to 1988. During that time period, Florida spent an estimated <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>$57 million on the death penalty to achieve 18 executions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I think this statistic is key.  What did you site, something around $1.5 million for three appeals?  Obviously, the cost exceeds that greatly.  (Miami Herald, July 10, 198<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Each death penalty case costs Texas average of $2.3 million. That is about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Dallas Morning News, March 8, 1992) <br>
<br>
Most maximum security prisons in this country cost between $20,000 to $40,000 per year to hold an inmate.  Even at 40 years in the some of most costly institutions in the country, the total is only $1.6 million dollars.  And I think most of you would agree, that given the choice between living the last 40 years of your life seeing the light of day once per two weeks or just having the lights turned out, you'd choose the latter.  Simultaneously, it preserves the sanctity of true and fair justice in this land of eroding democracy. <br>

Your argument does have some pragmatic benefits, it would be cheaper to execute than to keep people in prison for long periods.  One follow somthors argument and disagree wtih cephus and point out that death penalty is so expensive because we have far too many appeals.  However, from a moral perspective the argument that &quot;it is cheaper to kill than to keep alive in prison&quot; has serious flaws.  By the same token, it is cheaper to let old people die than to provide them with health benefits, or those with disabilties will drain our resources, or that the poor don't deserve social security as they are net 'takers' from the system.  I don't think you can place a fiscal value like this on human life.

<br>
So you would support torture, indefinate sensory deprivation, mutilation, amputation and pretty much any other form of degradation because you think crime negates all rights?<br>
<br>
With that sort of attitude you'll forever be focused on reacting to crime rather than preventing it.  And that after all is the ultimate goal here- our justice system shouldn't be, as Jeremy Bentham once put it:  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Akin to a master watching his dog with a rolled up parchment, waiting for it to err that he may strike it upon the nose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
We should prevent crime- and that's very difficult to do if criminals are deprived of the basic right to life.  A merciless consequence like that, quite apart from the fact you might be wrong...sends completely the opposite signal to criminals.  <br>
<br>
The death penalty does not deter, look at any study you like, compare places without the death penalty to places with it- you'll in fact find that in the majority of cases, states in America with the death penalty actually saw an *increase* in crime since they introduced it.<br>
<br>
It is as I say- extremely difficult to discourage first time offenders, to reach out to young people thinking about crime- extremely difficult for them to look upon us as a way out- if the ultimate consequence is death.  The impression created is that criminals have no way out, no way back- and if falsely convicted, the gravest possible injustice is done without the possibility of restitution.  That makes potential future criminals wary of listening to crime prevention programmes, wary of the police, wary in fact of anything to do with the government.  These are people that have as yet committed no crime, and only need a gentle shove in the right direction- the presence of a death sentence can often make that difficult.<br>
<br>
This is why crime is far more effectively prevented through persuasion rather than coercion- for the same reason segregation didn't work and for the same reason colonisation ultimately failed:  the state should be limited in the extent of rights it can revoke.  If not, injustice is the result Sighkox- as you typed your post btw, did it even cross your mind how many hundreds of *innocent* people have and may have been executed?  Think about that happening to you or someone you know, and perhaps you'll think again.<br>

<br>
if you let the guy sit on death row for 20 years no you dont save money.<br>
<br>
anyway the good thing about the death penalty is that it hopefuly prevents violent criminal acts.  such that if you are commiting armed robbery and know you will get life in prison you may jsut kill all the witnesses to prevent that BUT you may hesitate to do so if the death pentalty is in place.<br>
<br>
by hte same token the death pentalty is limited so only in the most extreme cases is it warented so criminals dont think they have nothing to lose.<br>
<br>
primarly I like to see a death sentance handed down when the case is apparently solid and it involves Killing of a policeman or serviceman or the premeditated death of more than 3 people...<br>
<br>
if the murder is done in the heat of the moment i feel nothing more than life should be warneted unless extreme midgateing circmstances are present.<br>
<br>
what is life? how about the better part of a person useful years... let them out of prison and they can enter a nursing home.....<br>
<br>
taranna is oposed to capital punishment im for it but I understand his view point and respect it.... so many abuses and injustices...still i feel we need to reserve it for those who are so rightly deserving<br>

<br>
With that said, Taranna, you asked Somthor to consider a situation where one of his relatives might be put on death row thought innocent.<br>
<br>
I ask you to consider a situation where a family member of yours is raped and murdered, and the criminal who did so spends 10... maybe 15 years in a state prison watching cable TV, enjoying internet access and earning his college equivalency degree on your dime.<br>
<br>
Crimes don't just fall down on their criminals like they do their victims. People aren't raped according to stastics. Others aren't murdered by thin air. There is a criminal who chooses to act in the way he does, and we must hold them accountable for such action. If our government cannot protect us from the use of force, be it from at home or abroad, it must change to do so - or be invalid. <br>
<br>
&quot;Criminal rights&quot; is a contradiction of terms. A criminal is someone who has actively sought to destroy the society which would otherwise act to protect them. A true criminal forfeits their rights by their actions; they impose physical force upon someone else, and in doing so show their disrespect for rights. Everything they are granted afterwards is on our good graces as the violated party.<br>
<br>
Do not paint these people out to be violated saints.<br>
<br>
Now for obvious reasons, it benefits society to have a justice system that is driven by reason without malice. It benefits society to be just and fair, and for our system to engage in due process to apply justice accurately. This is as much for the innocent as it is for the guilty.<br>

Essentially though, to me, death penalty is wrong. It's the eye for an eye filosophy that I find unnaceptable. Someone kills someone, so you kill him. Are you not stooping to his level? Shouldn't someone then kill you? And someone kill him because he killed you?<br>

Read what I wrote carefully- I never said &quot;thought innocent&quot;, I said innocent.  As in, they did not commit the crime, yet were executed for it.  Recent history in certain US states is littered with examples of this- no one's rights are served by the execution of an innocent individual.<br>

<br>
Now we're getting down to brass tacks, and a good thing too.  Is the only goal of justice to punish, or is there a rehabilitative aim?  In other words, is our prison system in place simply to confine, or to release a productive citizen that has paid their debt to society.  <br>
<br>
I certainly don't think cable TV and internet access should be a part of any prison system (it certainly isn't here in the UK, forget TV full-stop, never mind cable or internet).  They're not their to be entertained, they're there to pay a debt and hopefully to be reformed into something other than a criminal.  I fail to see why you object to education however- not college equivalency certainly- but a basic course of education, if requested, could well help people to see the errors of their ways and turn them into citizens rather than disenfranchised and hardened criminals.  <br>
<br>
Justice should not be only about punishment- punishment alone does nothing for the victims except sate a brutal desire for revenge- something any of us should be ashamed of.  There is no point in justice officially disapproving of vigilantism and the concept of revenge, whilst actively encouraging such behaviour through a legitimate process- eg, cheering crowds waving placards at an execution.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A true criminal forfeits their rights by their actions<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, do I understand then that you support the torture of prisoners, dismemberment, public humiliation, brainwashing, medical experimentation a la Holocaust, and pretty much any similar dehumanizing treatment?  Or do you concede that criminals are human beings and do have rights.  If you deny the notion of even basic humane treatment rights, then you support torture- if not, then you concede they do have some rights.  Can't have it both ways friend.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Do not paint these people out to be violated saints.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I never said they were, don't put words in my mouth.  Yes they are criminals and they have offended, perhaps seriously- but what do we or the victims' families gain simply by punishing them?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  No amount of physically harming the criminal will bring back a murdered friend, or undo the offence.  A debt to society must be paid, absolutely agree with that- but execution?  The chance that the person executed is innocent places a horrible risk in the path of justice, precisely the sort of risk we should actively avoid.<br>
<br>
  I'm just pointing out that no matter their crimes, they're still human beings and are entitled to basic rights.  I personally believe that we shouldn't simply lock criminals away only for the sake of punishment- that's a horrible waste of a person, a waste of money and an admission of defeat.  I think that where prison can reform people, it should be allowed to, and we could all benefit from it.  <br>
<br>
After all, if someone is rehabilitated, will not offend again, and can make a positive and hardworking contribution to society- why should we not welcome that?  Must it be the case that your life in prison is 100% negative?  If so, then all prison is likely to achieve is to turn first time offenders into hardened criminals and excaerbate the problem.  Unless of course you propose all jail sentences are extended to life.  <br>
<br>
Here's an analogy- there was a time when people genuinely thought all drug use could be deterred or prevented.  There was no concept of rehabilitation, users were simply locked away from the public, even executed in the early years, no attempt was made to help or rehabilitate them.  Western society has since accepted that treating and rehabilitating drug addicts goes hand in hand with deterring further use.  <br>
<br>
Moreover, it helps prevent future crime for the sake of addiction, and brings us productive citizens again.  There are many victims of drug addiction besides the user- although it's not a crime to cause people close to you emotional distress, that is certainly arguably as undesirable as being the victim of a crime.  The rights of the victims were balanced here because of the understanding that rehabilitation benefitted society, whereas revenge has nothing on the positive balancesheet.<br>

Well I'm glad we agree on something.  Where we differ fundamentally it seems, are what constitute acceptable risk when condemning an individual to die.  I think you'll accept that it is impossible for any justice system to apply itself accurately to all cases, particularly where juries and high profile crimes are concerned.  As such, in applying the death penalty, you seem willing to accept the possibility that people no guiltier than the victims of a crime will be executed unjustly.  <br>
<br>
In accepting that innocent people have and will continue to be executed, I cannot help but feel you are abandoning the moral high ground.  It's one thing to talk about accurate justice, quite another to blindly accept the execution of innocent people to sate the revenge of a victim and the bloodlust of the public.  <br>

A quote like this is saturated with appeals to emotion and assumptions. Are you actually conversing with me, or looking for acceptance and help from others in discussing your convictions? There's no need for that. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, it's not about a moral high ground to preach from. It's about making the right choice for the most.

<br>
So far, the best argument I've seen you present concerning the death penalty has to do with it's validity in a justice system that makes mistakes. Can capital punishment, a solution that is final, be reconciled with a system that has several layers of appeals?<br>
<br>
I believe it can. Part of having a justice system that can act with authority is the assumption that the rulings it makes are correct and fair. If we undermine ourselves by assuming we imprison innocent people, there's a whole realm of problems.<br>
<br>
I'm just going to ignore the paragraph about torture and mutilation (because it's utterly ridiculous), but I will address the point. Yes, they forfeit their right to be treated like equal members of our society. They lose their freedom, felons lose their right to vote, etc etc. That does not give us a free ticket to violate, mutilate and humiliate them. We very well could because we are in the right, but we do not because we are not a malevolent society. We recognize that it would do more harm then good.<br>

Ideally we'd hope to prevent as many crimes as possible. Failing that, we'd hope to be able to rehabilitate offenders so that their first offense was their last. After thousands of years of locking people up, you think we'd know how to do just that, right? Nah... the nature of criminal activity is still very vague for us. It's a very heated topic in sociology. <br>
<br>
Assuming we knew exactly what to do for each person that entered our prisons, would we have the resources to do what was necessary? It will be a long time before that's possible in the U.S., where we're still warming up to the idea of social welfare. The idea of having to pay taxes to feed, educate and entertain the guy who robbed/killed your family still isn't quite 'okay' with us yet, on a large level. <br>

No it's not- I'm not appealing to either- just giving you my opinion.  *I feel* you're abandoning the moral high ground, that is *my* perception.  Read carefully, I need no help from others to justify my convictions...the fact that I'm posting on an American forum where a large majority support the death penalty should surely suggest to you that I require nothing of the kind.<br>
<br>
I'll ignore the characterisation of me as a fanatic- I'm nothing of the kind.  I'm posting on this board in the full realisation that a majority of people will oppose the right to life of some criminals.  I've assumed that the majority of posters here believe in a moral code of jurisprudence as simplistic as &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;.  I've also assumed (correctly in this case I'm sure), that none of the posters here have read Bentham, HLA Hart, or Ronald Dworkin.  Given these assumptions, I'm trying to argue to an audience that is unable to grasp the basics of an inclusive social structure- so I beg your indulgence for how it seems to come across- it isn't easy to argue within such restrictions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If we undermine ourselves by assuming we imprison innocent people, there's a whole realm of problems.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Another totally misleading statement- I never said we *assume* that we imprison innocent people, I merely said that it happens.  That is a fact, not an assumption- actually it's a fact that reccurs with alarming regularity.  <br>
<br>
I don't think we should assume those convicted are innocent- but at the same time I believe it's our duty to acknowledge that it does happen, and not that rarely.  A layered appeals process is meaningless for example, if a jury is the main convicting authority- for reasons I've explained in earlier posts.  If an appeals judge has no access to the reasoning behind a conviction (juries are not required to provide this)- then how can the judge overturn a decision based on rationale + the facts?  The case has to be judged exclusively based on what is presented by counsel, rather than what the convicting authority made of said material.  <br>
<br>
So, if you think it through- it isn't an appeal at all- the first appeal is simply an appeals process hearing the same evidence the jury did in a slightly different timeframe.  An appeal is supposed to be a process of judicial review, not judicial groundhog day.  Fact is, with a jury conviction heard by politically appointed judges- one can be even less certain about the integrity of an appeals process.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it doesn't work- but what I am saying is that if we're still executing innocent people- then it doesn't work <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>well enough</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to cope with a fundamentally irrevocable sentence.  <br>

I don't see that it is ridiculous at all.  You don't have to look any further than Camp Delta to see that the &quot;spread of freedom across the world&quot; doesn't apply if you're randomly labelled an &quot;unlawful combatant/enemy combatant&quot;.  A status incidentally that has no place in international law or US law.  Either they are POWs and are repatriated under terms of the Geneva Convention's Article V- or they are charged and tried in a court of law with recourse to appeal.  <br>
<br>
There isn't any way you can tell me that solitary confinement for 23 hours, sensory deprivation, white noise, blinding luminar lamps, and the evidence of 3 men beaten to death in military custody (one at Bagram Airbase, two at bases within the US)- there's no way you can tell me those don't amount to torture- or at least criminal behaviour.<br>

This is beginning to look less and less ridiculous of an argument isn't it.  I think it can be convincingly argued that a society that murders its citizens as a part of &quot;due process of law&quot;, locks up hundreds of people without trial, abridges rights of counsel, client privelage, tortures prisoners selectively, and beats some to death without transparent consequence- I think such a society could quite easily be described as malevolent.  <br>
<br>
A society with a greater number of prisoners per head of population, one that imprisons more people than it provides healthcare for.  I think it's very much an open question whether the fabric of that particular society is or isn't malevolent.<br>

You know, I recall an ethical debate that was studied by us in my first year as a medical student.  It argued that even though we'd been attempting cures for certain STDs and various forms of lung cancer and heart disease for thousands of years, we should stop.  Because after all, STDs are only really spread through &quot;immoral&quot; behaviour, lung cancer is 95% caused by cigarette smoking and heart disease is 97% caused by lifestyle choices.  Plus, the psychology of why people knowingly inflict long-term harm on themselves by smoking, eating fatty foods or drinking their livers into a white pulpy mess- that psychology and reasoning is still vague.  Doesn't mean we should give up.<br>
<br>
Now why don't we just add- 95% of executions that we know of, were executions of guilty individuals.  That last 5% doesn't matter, casualties of the system.  Thank goodness we didn't come to that conclusion at the debate, on the right to treatment or right to life.  Again, it simply comes down to how much you value (or don't value) human life.  If you can accept that 5% at least will be innocent murder victims of the judicial process then you might as well apply the same moral logic across the spectrum of society.  <br>
<br>
I don't accept that you can argue for treating self-inflicted illness with compassion while refusing to treat criminal offenders with that same compassion.  The reasoning is simple- 3%, or 5%, probably even more than 5% don't fit the bill, and I don't accept that their fate must be inevitable.  Because without the death penalty, we may keep alive criminals whose blood the public bay for- but we'll also save hundreds of lives.  Everything from my professional calling to my conscience leads me to that choice.  If it doesn't suit others, then I feel sorry for them.<br>

Well, spending a little less than 20% of your total budget on defence would help.  None of that figure contributes to Homeland security incidentally- all of it goes to the Pentagon.  Spending perhaps not as little as 5%...but 9-10%?  With the size of the US economy that's more than enough.  And it'd free enough money to cover every citizen with healthcare and near-free tertiary education.  Raise taxes on the rich by a single percentage point and...well, you get the idea.  Making the initial sacrifice of social welfare isn't easy- but the results pay off.  <br>
<br>
Preventing crime is made a lot easier by a prison system that is willing to work with offenders rather than against them.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why should we afford criminals in prison things we can't give to our productive, useful citizens? Also, why should the prison experience be a positive one?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Dealing with your second point- why should it be entirely negative?  That doesn't solve anything- in fact, you'll likely create a far bigger problem when prisoners are released.  They are often disenfranchised and recidivism is the inevitable consequence of hardening criminals with purely punitive measures.  Working *with* offenders is far more likely to yield results, not just in prison but outside- people will listen far more easily if you show them there's a way out.  With no way out of the prison system, there is little incentive to avoid the risk of crime.<br>
<br>
As far as your first point goes, if you nationalized tertiary education funding and provided universal health cover, that issue wouldn't ever arise.  It doesn't in Britain, nor does it arise in Europe- because everyone- prince or pauper, chemist or criminal have universal access to health care.  Tertiary education is cut off to criminals here...but they can still better themselves.<br>
<br>
Am I saying prison should be a positive experience?  No, it shouldn't- but neither should it be 100% negative.  The emphasis should be on confinement, 0 entertainment but with the opportunity for prisoners to better themselves.  Assuming all citizens have equal access to that- it doesn't create the conundrum you pose.  Plus, you are improving society as a whole.  Here's an example- one of my friend's former colleagues served 5 years in prison for GBH.  He became interested in the sciences while inside, the prison consular officer introduced him to some reading material, and 6 years later he ended up saving the life of the man he committed GBH against 11 years previously.  <br>
<br>
OK, 99% of rehabilitated and bettered criminals will never directly benefit the people they harmed- but they will benefit society as a whole, that is not arguable.  Incidentally, I talked to my friend's work colleage a year ago- and he's a changed person, the experience of prison changed him- not through fear, but through understanding of wrongdoing.  One prisoner given that chance is a far greater achievement than a hundred executions.  The greater the depravity of a criminal, in all but the most extreme cases- the greater the potential for rehabilitation.  That's what I believe profoundly, and it is not a view that requires assent or consensus- it's simply a paradigm of jurisprudence I hold to be right.<br>

I don't think Somther ever intended this poll to end up like it did.  I think he really wanted to find out what people thought of the death penalty, thus the poll.  <br>
<br>
     I don't think that this poll is going to change the thought of anyone regarding the death penalty.  There is no substitute for experience, and lets hope that no one ever has to go through the experience of having a crime relevent to the death penalty be committed against them or a loved one.<br>
<br>
     Personally I don't know how I would react if something like that ever happened to someone I love.  But I know I would not be happy to see someone get out of prison 15 years later, when I will never be able to see that loved one for the remainder of my life.  God I know see how people can sit here and write books on this subject.<br>
<br>
     I think I would have to agree with Vorge on this, but with one change.  Shouldn't it be a Marine sniper and not an Army sniper? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smawty>smawty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(11/21/03 2:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=428.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Criticism of judicial decisions fall into two categories: A judge's interpretation of law and their interpretation of fact.

<br>
That is a good point but Judges don't always simply interpret the facts or the law.  Recently the Massachusetts Supreme Court <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>commanded</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the legislature to enact a law allowing gay marriage within 6 months.  This is hardly interpreting the law, in fact it is the judicial system creating new laws.  A job that is supposed to be reserved for the legislature.  Obviously there was no outcry from liberal anti death penalty advocates when these judges let their ideology influence their decision.<br>
<br>
In 2002 anti death penalty lawyers fought hard to take power away from the judges in determining if someone should be put to death.  They succeeded and the Supreme Court ruled that judges could only decide whether or not to put someone to death if the jury had concluded that the crime warranted it.<br>
<br>
Therefore, supporting to limit a judges power in capital crime cases but not minding when a judge oversteps their authority and imposes their ideology on society is being a hyppocrite. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taranna>Taranna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>HiElf Snob</span><br>  Posts: 985<br> <font color=#333333>(11/21/03 6:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=428.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That is a good point but Judges don't always simply interpret the facts or the law.

<br>
From the news reports I've read and from what my dad's told me (he's a judge)- the decision has allowed the Massachusetts legislature 180 days to react to the ruling.  It's important to remember that the job of ensuring a lack of conflict in legislation(one law contradicting or contraindicating another)- is up to judges.  As such, judges do make law- that is the essence of what common law means!<br>
<br>
If judges had no role in making law, then Brown vs. Board of Education wouldn't have forced the end of segregation- state legislatures could have ignored the ruling.  In any common law system where the rule of precedent applies (US included)- judges have the power to make law.  <br>
<br>
Now in a civil law system like France, Germany, Italy- or a Roman-Dutch system like Spain, there is not the rule of precedent- each new case is considered on its merits.  Many people think this is how *all* court systems operate, but they are wrong.  Precedent and the power to streamline output from the legislature is enshrined within an independent judiciary.  <br>
<br>
However, there is one extremely valid and relevant complaint you could make if you happened to oppose same-sex marriage.  That objection is that the judgement makes reference to only a single point of law- one in the state's constitution.  For a test case with no ruling of state precedent to directly alter the meaning of what my dad tells me, is the oldest state constitution in America- that is not exceeding your brief, but it's sure as bloody hell pushing the envelope a bit fast.  A test case or two, a chance for the state legislature to be apprised of a decision like this- the opinion writing judge was in a hurry, according to my dad.<br>
<br>
But then, should we be suprised smawty?  Judges are politically appointed- it's not only &quot;liberal&quot; judges that have a stake- &quot;conservative&quot; judges selected the current president.  Given that two of the judges hearing the case were appointed by his father (both voted for him)- one could argue a gross conflict of political, personal and judicial interests.  Just as whatever political affiliations liberal judges possess have driven them to some of their decisions.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong- I support the Massachusetts ruling- I just think it was hastily done, with little time for other arms of government to have a say.  I also supported the striking down of those ridiculous anti-sodomy laws.  However, I didn't support the upholding of affirmative action in education, I find that a disgrace.  But see- those are political opinions.  If judges were selected not by politicians or campaign lobbies- but by their peers and by the bar councils + an independent constitutional figure, these problems would be considerably less.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They succeeded and the Supreme Court ruled that judges could only decide whether or not to put someone to death if the jury had concluded that the crime warranted it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Read that carefully- the jury has the power to save a criminal's life, not the judge.  If you read criminology studies, you'll find that juries are far less restrained about such things than judges.  Probably because their understanding of jurisprudence ranks somewhere with my understanding of Mongolian onion-curling.  <br>
<br>
Judges are far more likely to consider the facts of the case rather than how horrible the crim is.  I think if you're going to have something as murderously unfair as a death penalty- it *SHOULD* be in the hands of a panel of 3 judges, NO jury.  That would make the appeal process more transparent and the decision would have to mean something.<br>
<br>
Last point on all of this smawty- if you read through Massachusett's law books, particularly the law of union &amp; marriage- you'll find that gay couples already possess nearly all of the rights of heterosexual couples.  In fact, gay unmarried couples in some cases have more rights than heterosexual unmarried couples.  This is plainly unfair- so to streamline contradictions in the legislation- you legalize gay marriage, and then provide heterosexual unmarried couples with the same rights as unmarried gays had previously.  <br>
<br>
That is the sensible thing to do- if all the trappings of marriage are allowed, but a few key rights (inheritance, family tax, relations binding in law) are absent, surely it makes sense to enfranchise those rights and be done with it.  Otherwise the legislation is just comical, and smacks of state interference to prevent legitimate rights simply because of sexual orientation.<br>
