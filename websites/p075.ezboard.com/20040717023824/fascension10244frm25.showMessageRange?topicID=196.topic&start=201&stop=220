<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Again Kad- if the inspectors don't feel further inspections are practicable, then they will tell the UNSC and a second (termed) resolution would follow. Currently inspectors feel that results can be accrued (and the facts support this). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Understood, and agreed.  However, if the inspectors report that they no longer can accrue results, then their mission has failed.  But a strong dilemma exists within this lack of an exit strategy.  If they return with no results, the UN would be deemed to have failed.  This would be yet another crushing blow for the UN and it would further erode its relevancy in international and regional conflicts.  As everyone surely knows, and as was stated above, there are several hundred inspectors scouring a country the size of California.  I do not believe people understand the size and scope of the inspection job.  For me to drive from the middle of California where I live (Sacramento), to Los Angeles, it takes five hours.  That's just driving.  One can only guess the number of small cities between me and LA.  Now, can any one truly imagine inspecting every single facility between me and LA? And that is, maybe, one half the actual size!  Granted there are more people here than in Iraq (CA ~35 Million people and Iraq = ~24 million).  My point is, with a force of several hundred in the field, the size of the job really is nearly infinite.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the inspectors will always feel the potential to accrue more results merely based on the size of the job.  (For clarity purposes, I have not including extra-circumstances that add to the difficulty of inpections such as hidden bunkers, roaming mobile facilities, weapons stored in homes, etc.)<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
Kad<br>
<br>
Cliff Notes Version:  The weapons inspectors, facing extreme pressure from the UN to not fail because doing so will result in a serious hit on UN relevance, will never ask the UNSC for a 2nd resolution because the size of their job is nearly infinite.  The inspectors will always feel there is more to inspect (based merely on the size of Iraq) and therefore they believe inspections should continue.  They lack a viable exit strategy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kwaij>kwaij</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Baby clubber!!</span><br>  Posts: 396<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/03 12:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Moordred</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons, the very weapons the dictator tells the world he does not have,&quot; Bush said<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You state this as true. How can you say its true? Im curious since i know from my own army background that Chemical weapons isnt something you use on the battlefield in your own homeland. It tends to pollute just as bad or even worse in some cases as nuclear weapons. And clearly Saddam aint gonna attack first and loose whatever international support/symphaty he has.<br>

Of course we could launch a preemptive strike against Saddam. Our ability to do that has never been a question. The question is whether or not such a strike is neccessary and whether or not it'll really create any kind of lasting stability. I've seen little evidence to support that course of action.<br>
<br>
If simply possessing those weapons is enough to justify a preemptive strike, then why stop with Saddam. I'm sure we can cook up an argument to invade virtually every other nation on earth.<br>
<br>
This isn't the right course. We've tried these tactics before and their effectiveness is questionable at best.<br>

<br>
*He has already used VX/nerve agent in his own homeland. <br>
*Looking at the nuclear half life of radiated material and contamination, coupled with nuclear fall out that will travel the globe, I don't see how anything could be worse then nuke. One exception would be smallpox, which has the high probability of exterminating a large portion of the planets  population.<br>
*Something to be considered is that for chem/ bio to be effective it's &quot;persistancy&quot; must be considered. In most cases, vectors for bio (rats, insects etc). Blister, blood, choking and nerve agents depend heavily on weather and terrain. <br>
<br>
 It's interesting that Iraq is probably the worst enviornment to attempt to use these to the maximum of success. Perhaps not known to all is the fact that Iraq is not entirely open desert (not the likes of Saudi/ Kuwait). However, with the lack of abundant vectors and the possibility of world wide epidemic/ outbreak, to include his own population and more importantly his army, I don't think he would use bio. <br>
<br>
 Considering the intense direct sunlight, high winds and loose/ migrant topsoil chem weapons would have a minimum long term impact. This would work in his favor to reduce an immediate military threat, while lessening the chance of permantly polluting his country. I believe he's more likely to go with VX/ nerve, through artillery shells/ rockets whatever (which he's pretty much got down to a science).<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;And clearly Saddam aint gonna attack first and loose whatever international support/symphaty he has.&quot; - Kwaij<br>
<br>
 I must entirely agree with you here. The concern that I and many of my countrymen have is that these weapons will be distributed intentionally or unintenionally to people that would use them against us without hesitation. <br>
<br>
 Crossing the border and smuggling these out would be no difficult accomplishment in Iraq. The bedouin don't recognize borders in the Mid-east and this region, crossing them daily without inspection (among others).<br>
<br>
 If Saddam wasn't playing a game of three card monty with his WMD/ &quot;now you see them, now you dont&quot;, our country wouldn't have issue. No one can deny that he's hiding them, and I really can't understand why this doesn't alarm the international community. <br>
<br>
 I can say with almost 100% surety that these WMD will not turn up among the French population. I'm not banging the French persay, just pointing out the fact there's really only one country I feel at risk atm. <br>

first of all 'd00d', try going back and actually reading what i wrote with critical thinking skills<br>
<br>
1.  i never said iraq wasn't a threat to world peace.  if you would have actually read what i wrote you would see that i think he needs to be dealt with, just not by a minority of vigilante nations<br>
<br>
2.  i never once said that allies couldn't reverse their stance and become enemies<br>
<br>
here's a debate tip:  when attempting to express your point of view, insulting the other person generally doesn't make them change their minds.  honestly, did you even read anything i had to say?<br>
<br>
i don't see why you have to attempt to belittle me; you took two sentances i wrote completely out of context and totally avoided the points i was trying to establish.<br>
<br>
i guess maybe i put you on the edge when i was commenting about the us training terrorists, i guess you just can't accept that i have anything valid to say after that.  i was hoping for some kind of intellectual arguement rather than you calling me stupid; i don't even know how you came up with the abstract idea that i said allies can't ever change their positions.  i don't think i did.  i'm simply trying to imply that the good old USA isn't the worlds' most innocent country.<br>

1)  Saddaem doesn't need anyone's permission to do whatever he wants to his subjects.  If he wants to gas, torture, kill his own population, he doesn't need the US/UK approval.  Even if the US/UK disapproves, he doesn't care.  He'll do what he wants and say stfu to the UN and anyone else.  <br>
<br>
2)  You Saddaem defenders seem to know what Saddem thinks, feels, and what actions he'll take in the future.  Well let me be blunt and say you don't know jack about what Saddaem will do.<br>
<br>
You know what Saddeam thought about the Gulf War?  He didn't lose.  It was a draw.  As the Dan Rather interview with Saddaem proves.<br>
<br>

<br>
Translator Foraddam Hussein: Might be important to you and the American people. In 1991 Iraq was not defeated. In fact, our Army withdrew from Kuwait according to a decision taken by us. Yes, it withdrew and -But when we were back within our boundaries, the boundaries of Iraq, the Iraqi Army was not defeated. Nor was the people of Iraq. <br>
<br>
Rather: Mr. President, respectfully, a lot of Americans are going to hear that and say, what is this man talking about, as all of those Iraqi tanks coming out of Kuwait with the turrets knocked out indicated a beaten army on the battlefield. There's no joy in my saying that. But the point is I'm asking you to explain what you mean that you were not defeated in the - war, because I can report to you with accuracy that, overwhelmingly, the American people believe that that was a resounding defeat for you and for Iraq. <br>
<br>
Translator For Saddam Hussein: Without pre-conditions. Without pre-conditions. So we have not lost the war. And we were not defeated. <br>
<br>
So let's just establish the fact that Saddaem writes his own history.<br>
<br>
3)  The Saddaem defenders say the US is hyprotical for going to war against such a bad country when there are countless bad countries that the US ignores.  Let's take this argument out of the war debate, cause it's  silly. A bad country, is a bad country. A sin is a sin.  <br>
<br>
There is a mentality out there that if I can do one good thing in the world, then the world will be a better place.  If one more criminal gets put behind bars, that's one less criminal on the streets.  The Saddaem defenders would have you think bad guys like Saddaem deserve to remain in power because of countless others like him.  Well they don't.<br>
<br>
4)  If Saddaem had nukes:  I'll play the game.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If Saddaem had nukes, it would be his trump card for no country to ever ever invade Iraq again.  Cause he'll use those nukes before he steps down from power.  How do I know?  Same way as those who say he won't.  And as mentioned, it only takes a couple nukes to destroy the world.  The US's thousand vs Iraq's 10, is advantage Saddaem.  There is no way in hell I want Saddaem or any other nation besides the US having nukes.  Because it's a leverage on diplomacy, and I want the US holding all the cards.  <br>
<br>
Secrect nuclear testing today, is tomorrow's leverage for power and respect in the world community.  Nuclear proliferation must stop.<br>
<br>
btw:  I liken Saddaem to a convict who just got out of prison for armed robbery.  As common sense and laws dictates, ex-convicts are not allowed to own weapons.<br>
<br>
And finally some people mention how big Iraq is and how difficult it would be to find some WMD if they were hidden.  Couple UN inspectors driving around the country like lost mice.  Even with all their neat new go-go gadgets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=everas>Everas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AD's Iksar Monk_0354</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#333333>(3/14/03 4:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll on US Presidents speech is closed</span><hr size=1> Just when I was hoping lurker'd figured out that he was an idiot, and noone cared about his infantile little analogies. Oh well...<br>
<br>
K, you're first point doesnt seem to have any relevance at all. <br>
<br>
Second you half wit, I doubt anyone here is a big fan of Saddam. There's a difference between supporting him and opposing a policy Bush's come up with that we believe is wrong. I know the difference is probably too subtle for you so try to take my word on it.<br>
<br>
Saddam can believe whatever he wants regarding the Gulf War. The rest of the world, I imagine, believes he surrendered to a vastly superior force.<br>
<br>
Who're we to say what is or is not an appropriate way to deal with terrorists within your own nation? When we find them we put them on trial and then execute them (or at least we used to before Sept 11th, now we just accuse people of it and lock them away for the rest of their lives - trial by jury's so outdated anyways eh?). You know, alot of countries believe our death penalty is a sin, do you believe it'd be alright if they invaded us and overthrow our government? No of course not, so why the double standard with Iraq.<br>
<br>
You can play whatever fantasy game you want about Iraq and nuclear weapons. Or hell why not stop their, lets just compare him to doctor evil and assume hes got a giant &quot;laser&quot; on the moon ready to annihilate us all. Anyways I think the rest of us will stick with a reality where he doesn't possess either weapon.<br>
<br>
The analogy you end with is pretty weak. If a convict gets out of prison, buys a gun, and then hides in the state of california, do we start bombing california? Now are you really dense enough to believe using a simple analogy like that for a complex problem like Iraq is a good idea?<br>
<br>
Iraq may be a big country, and it may be hard for the inspectors to search every inch of it. However thus far they've been more successful in destroying Saddam's weapon stockpiles than we were in the first war. <br>
<br>
Furthermore they're able to destroy those weapons without destabilizing the Iraqi government. And once again I think I'm going into a concept you may have difficulty with, so I will try to provide an example of what happens to a country's weapons when the government collapses. Do you recall what happened when the USSR collapsed? Disenfranchised members of the Soviet military scattered throughout the continent, but many times not before they helped themselves to their former nation's armories. While we can hope the situation won't be quite so bad if this ill-conceived war actually occurs, I can't help but worry that a number of ex-Iraqi military will escape and take some of Saddam's weapons with them. And that is when those weapons fall into the hands of extremists who have little fear of using them against us, and other nations.<br>
<br>
Lurker... please spare us anymore of your idiocy and at least leave the pro-war argument up to those better able to make it. In other words, anyone but you.<br>

<br>
how we deal with terrorists is far diffrent then how we deal with the average rapist / murderer / felon etc...<br>
<br>
With terrorists we cant afford many times to allow the enemy to know who we are holding or what they have told us. If you recall when we captured that mohammed guy last week the US was pissed cause we didnt get to extract information from him before news went out publicly that we had him in custody. In the war on terror information is power and in this war speed is key, you may have only hours from when you capture someone to act on any info you get from them.  <br>
<br>
If the average day to day criminal was getting the same treatment then i would agree with you that things need to change, however i  see no problem with the way we are quarantining the terror suspects at guantanomo (cuba). For the record many who have been accused and found innocent have been released.  I hate the idea of giving up personal freedoms, but these people being held are criminals (in most cases) of a war thats being fought.  I think once many of the suspects no longer have any information to give us then you will see trials start happening publicly but not until we are sure that we have acted upon all information we have and it wont jeopardize our operations by letting the enemy know we have them. In a sense they are prisoners of war and are being treated as such.<br>
<br>
<br>
The whole bombing california thing was so outlandish i am not gonna bother responding to it cause you and i both know thats not even realistic.<br>
<br>
Why do you think inspections are just now starting to show some success?  Could it be that saddam has 310,00 american troops 40,000 UK troops and some aussies on his doorstep?  <br>
<br>
Do you really think saddam gonna continue to be so compliant should the coalition of the willing pull out?<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyhow your are correct however of the danger of weapons being spread out should iraq crumble.  We can only hope that the military has considered such a dillema and is prepared to deal with it.  I have confidence that they have.<br>

Its the same again, when Bush was saying, Saddam could pass WMDs to terrorists, he lied. The CIA report just 2hours ago before he spread that lie stated that there was NO connection between ANY terrorist groups and the Iraqi government. Just read 50% of the americans believe there is a connection between 11/9 and Saddam. It really doesnt seem to be hard to convince the public of some madeup bullshit.

<br>
Rubbish.  If inspectors can't accrue results it'll be because they feel that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Saddam</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is not complying sufficiently for inspections to continue.  I doubt anyone in the international community would be so idiotic as to blame the UN for a lack of compliance from the Iraqi side severe enough to warrant the closure of inspections.  <br>
<br>
Rather, the UN will be seriously damaged if permanent members decide not to seek a resolution explicitly authorising force.  Unless the United States and Britain (+allies) can convince 9 members of the UNSC including themselves of the validity of military action absenting vetoes, then it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>they</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> who will undermine the UN's authority by seeking to act outside its auspices.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As everyone surely knows, and as was stated above, there are several hundred inspectors scouring a country the size of California. I do not believe people understand the size and scope of the inspection job.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Which is why inspections are intelligence-driven.  Using that analogy, it would be theoretically impossible to disarm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> country larger than Liechtenstein.  With ELINT combing Iraq in numerous forms, and hard HUMINT (from MI-6/SIS, CIA, Mossad et al) coming in on a daily basis feeding inspectors with the information they need, I see no reason why inspections here don't work as effectively as they did in, say, the Ukraine- a larger country.  Although, as you rightly point out, applying intelligence to a large number of targets does take time- those who I've spoken to in the intelligence field assure me that simply analyzing the plausibility(never mind the veracity) of information can take days, sometimes weeks depending on the source.  Thus, the Bush and Blair administrations' collective impatience on the matter is wholly unreasonable given the practical difficulties of data that need to be overcome.<br>
<br>
The other compelling argument that's often overlooked is track record &amp; field position.  UN inspection teams have a nearly flawless track record in disarming nation states, numerous inspections have taken place in a satisfactory manner, taking anywhere from months (South Africa) to 6 years (Ukraine/Tajikistan).  Fact is, no single nation state even approaches the success rate or experience level of UN inspection teams in this regard.  Therefore I am extremely skeptical of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> government's position regarding the success of inspections- they are the best judge, and none of us are listening to them, the experts on the ground enough.  I certainly do acknowledge however, that the Franco-Russian position represents the accuracy of inspection success far more accurately and honestly than the Anglo-American position.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I referenced (as much as I despise doing so) the intent portion of the resolution merely to bring to light of the fact that the world, through its UN representatives and their unanimous approval, has declared Iraq a threat to world peace<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Declaring Iraq a threat to world peace is a statement of a theoretical threat, not an imminent one.  Note that nowhere in the resolution (OCs or pre-am's) was it stated that military action was necessary or called for in dealing with this &quot;threat to world peace&quot;.  Granted a theoretical threat is posed by the existence of any weapons, particularly nuclear ones.  If for example, a resolution was passed stating that Britain's nuclear weapons posed a threat to world peace- that is a perfectly true statement in isolation.  I could however Kad, like you did just there, hijack it out of context of the scenario to paint Britain as an imminent threat to world peace that needed to be dealt with by force.  In the context of world affairs &amp; geopolitics, such an argument is patently absurd  That is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the context of the statement with respect to the Iraq situation, nor does it reflect the intent of member-states who voted for it- certainly not in the manner which you've spun it there.  If it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then I ask you why two superpowers, the United States &amp; UK are unable to convince even a single one of the six undecided nations, two of which are small impoverished African nations.  No amount of arm-twisting or bribing seems to be yielding results- if they truly did perceive Iraq as an imminent threat to world peace in the manner that you describe, surely they'd be queuing up to vote for it!  The fact that so many nations oppose it shows that they neither think military action is called for in 1441, nor justified at the current time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not disarming &quot;threatens his grip on power&quot;.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hardly smawty- and most important of all, he doesn't believe that it does.  Saddam is a surviver first and foremost- with the backing of Arab neighbours and those nations who feel that military action would be precipitate- he has every chance of holding on to power.  Anything that would lose him that support (launching WMD attacks etc) is something that he would never contemplate.  One thing that's interesting to consider is that if the US/UK had taken a more tolerant stance towards inspections and given the process time whilst maintaining forces in the region- that position would force Saddam to comply <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Currently he can pass off repeated requests to &quot;immediatly disarm&quot; as bullying.  Such a stance increases his grip on power- and it's important to note that despite this, inspections are yielding results.  Remember that 95% of weapons destroyed so far were destroyed through inspections- military action is notoriously unsuccessful in achieving the fundamental goals of disarmament- just look at the action in Yugoslavia for example- disarmament wasn't even on the priority list until late in the conflict- and soldiers are not trained expert inspectors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why chance it? Especially when 1441 says we don't need to. It's up to Saddam to prove he would not take revenge by disarming<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Why chance it?  Because all the evidence plus the geopolitical situation in the region points to the glaringly obvious- there is no chance being taken in allowing inspections to continue.  Do you seriously believe that putting the lives of so many people, innocent civilian and soldiers alike- do you honestly believe that decision should rest on the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>remote chance</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of a miscalculation by Saddam?  I don't, nor do most people with a grain of sense.  Unless the threat is proven, or is shown to be imminent, then troops should not be committed.  Just as someone shouldn't be arrested simply because(independent of evidence) we &quot;suspect&quot; they're a criminal/terrorist/communist, so should we refuse to commit forces in the absence of a proven and recognised threat.  I put this to you smawty- if all Saddam's neighbours (including <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Israel</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) do not consider him a serious or imminent threat at this time, then why is force necessary?  Containment is working, deterrence is there as insurance, and inspections are achieving results.  If disarmament is indeed our goal- where's the problem?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why do you think inspections are just now starting to show some success? Could it be that saddam has 310,00 american troops 40,000 UK troops and some aussies on his doorstep? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If the threat of force is gaining us the results we seek, then where is the need to actually use it Gsam?  Our goal, lest we forget- is disarmament, not regime change.  If enforcing 1441 is indeed our goal, then Iraq's government structure is an irrelevant question- all that matters is disarmament.  Yet regime change has been mentioned time and again- can anyone on this thread point to a single <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>successful</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> regime change in the Middle East in modern history?  And don't even dare say Afghanistan- every report being broadcast from there points to the crumbling of institutions, not the construction of them- promised and non-existent aid seems to be the story of the week <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> week in the Loya Jirga.<br>
<br>
On a side note- anyone else find it funny that Bush and Blair, both committed Christians with strong fundamental Christian values support a war opposed by every single major Christian denomination?  I find it difficult to reconcile and quite amusing myself- particularly when Dr. Rowan Williams (ArchBishop of Canterbury) deemed unsanctioned military action &quot;morally unsupportable in all good Christian conscience&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i fell sorry for blair hes trying to live up to his promises to the US and his own people are gonna cruicfy him for it.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
They certainly will, myself included- you can be sure that if the government go to war without a second UN resolution in this session of the UNSC, I and many others in the UK will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vote Labour at the next election.  Without international backing any military action has no legitimacy in my eyes.  Especially not along the ridiculous lines of &quot;a war of aggression fought in self-defence&quot;- I've rarely heard such poppycock out of cabinet ministers from a party I've always supported.  If our forces are committed without a second UN resolution you may be sure that the PM will have to rely on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tory</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> votes for a majority in favour of military action.  That, plus the resignation of Claire Short, Robin Cook and the Attorney-General who have all promised to resign in the event of unsanctioned military force- I suspect that will spell the beginning of the end for Labour under Tony Blair.  <br>
<br>
Although at one time I would have burned my tongue with these words- I would rather see Charles Kennedy leading this country right now than our current PM.  Foundation hospitals, top-up fees and this precipitate, reckless and completely illogical policy of war in Iraq- all add to an incomprehensible cocktail of measures I utterly abhor.  In the words of Tony Benn:  &quot;If the Prime Minister takes Labour any further to the right, Ian Duncan Smith might well be out of a job far sooner, because of a smiling Tony Blair cutting Conservative policies away from the heart of Labour's core values.&quot;  Perceptive words, and a statement that furthers my convictions about the war policy- it signals a deep split between executive and legislature that has long been brewing, I just pray it won't destroy the function of our democracy before the electorate have a chance to rectify matters.<br>

Hence the root of the problem.  The UN and the anti-Bush (err I mean anti-war) crowd have placed a lot of trust with Saddam.  Trust that he will cooperate, trust that he will be honest, trust that he will not deceive and so and so forth.  While we certainly have seen some cooperation, 10,000 page report, destruction of Al Sammoud 2 missiles, disclosure of UAV research, we have not seen a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*strategy*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of cooperation.  On the contrary, I believe <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">we have seen a modicum of cooperation designed to be superficial but nonetheless enough cooperation to keep the anti-Bush (damn anti-war is what I meant) crowd arguing that the inspections are actually working!</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Listen people, Saddam is trying to deceive you.  Don't let him do it.  What has he down recently that he couldn't have done 4 months ago when this inspection deal began?  What else is he hiding?<br>
<br>
And if he truly is not strategically cooperating, then I still hold, Taranna, that the inspectors job is doomed.  Straight up.  There is no way they can do it without valuable G2 (which I believe they have) and cooperation.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake about it, the UN is fighting for its life here meaning there are strong political forces at work to preserve its life.  If inspections fail, for any reason, even in Taranna's scenarion claiming the US/UK caused the failure by acting multilaterally, it will be a devastating blow to UN legitimacy.  If it can't create a solution that makes everyone happy, what good is it?  It's only good for small, regional, nation level, disputes.<br>

PS.  It really is obvious to me, when people say President Bush is a liar, that he is an illegitimate President, that he gained less popular votes than Gore, etc etc ad nauseum, that you are more interested in nailing President Bush more than you are Saddam.  In reality, it's sickening and it's political opportunism at its absoute WORST. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kadandrumtally>Kadandrum Tally</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 3/15/03 3:03:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smawty>smawty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(3/15/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll on US Presidents speech is closed</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Hardly smawty- and most important of all, he doesn't believe that it does. Saddam is a surviver first and foremost- with the backing of Arab neighbours and those nations who feel that military action would be precipitate- he has every chance of holding on to power. Anything that would lose him that support (launching WMD attacks etc) is something that he would never contemplate. One thing that's interesting to consider is that if the US/UK had taken a more tolerant stance towards inspections and given the process time whilst maintaining forces in the region- that position would force Saddam to comply more. Currently he can pass off repeated requests to &quot;immediatly disarm&quot; as bullying. Such a stance increases his grip on power- and it's important to note that despite this, inspections are yielding results. Remember that 95% of weapons destroyed so far were destroyed through inspections- military action is notoriously unsuccessful in achieving the fundamental goals of disarmament- just look at the action in Yugoslavia for example- disarmament wasn't even on the priority list until late in the conflict- and soldiers are not trained expert inspectors.<br>

No offense but this is a bunch of poppy-cock.<br>
<br>
Not disarming = Bush+Blair very pissed off = a very serious threat to his grip on power.<br>
And if Saddam truly believes that the U.S. and British military do not threaten his grip on power....well, then that is the most convincing proof of insanity yet.<br>

*That* is the strength of deterrence- no matter how mad, impulsive, or hungry for revenge Khuruschev was, he still couldn't bring himself to push that nuclear button. Even during the Cuban missile crisis, the biggest watershed of brinkmanship since the 2nd World War- even then, one of the most mentally unstable and impulsive Soviet premiers with many hundreds of times the destructive power of Iraq- was deterred successfully.<br>

I have been doing a little research on Khruschev and for the life of me I can not figure out how my comparison of Iraq to the Taliban is anymore ridiculous than your comparison of Khruschev to Saddam.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smawty>smawty</A> at: 3/15/03 3:06:24 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a> <b>11</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=221&stop=234>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=196.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=196.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private -
