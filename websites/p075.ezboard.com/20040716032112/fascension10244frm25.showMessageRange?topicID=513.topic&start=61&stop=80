<br>
and that message said most people in wudan like pyro, and that neckros, sird, and morb were the gimps.  yes, we do know you applied to wudan sirdario, and were turned the fuck down.  why do you think your such a fucking joke to us?<br>
<br>
wow, you guys post pictures of our corpses in a circle. i could post the same shit.  you trying to say you won that war?<br>
<br>
continue to talk shit all you want, and well continue to do the same. both guilds have their share of assholes, but id have to say yours are definitly the more prominent. indal zoned in to do some stuff, not knowing you were there, and you assholes attacked before he could even ask for a tl out? go fuck yourselves. no, i'm not talking to ad as a whole, im talking to the 20% of the guild that are complete pricks, as opposed to maybe 5% of Wudan.<br>

I'll try not to waffle.<br>
<br>
When you lead a guild you will soon discover the enormous hassle/burden of organising <br>
your raids so that those who need to be on them, can be on them.<br>
<br>
It is a PAIN IN THE ASS.<br>
<br>
Recently, we have had to pull out of the rotations that have been on this server<br>
for a LONG time (cursed/emp) because lower guilds do not respect them.<br>
<br>
This,.. I can deal with, becase we dont NEED to kill cursed/emp. They are a bonus.<br>
<br>
With POP comes flags. With FLAGS comes reflagging.<br>
<br>
It is NOT enough to kill flag mobs. Not even close. You must plan the mob in ADVANCE<br>
and make sure _every_ single recuit knows. Now days, this is even worse, as I must<br>
also make sure every SoD recuit knows about the raid, when it is and how it will work.<br>
<br>
Hence, when another guild REFUSES to ensure they dont step on our plans, I must<br>
draw the line. There has only been ONE ther guild on RZ that ever refused to work<br>
with other guilds plans. <br>
<br>
This is the fourth time cotw/fusion have fuxed over another guilds flagging plans.<br>
<br>
Sod/MiM/CE/Wudan have all had problems.<br>
<br>
The first time it happened, I posted on the multiguild board I would be taking PVP action<br>
if this happened to us.<br>
<br>
The second time it happened MiM were furious, so I sent Ealill to talk to fusion<br>
and give them a VERY VERY serious warning, that if this happened to us there<br>
would be a war. It was a very very serious warning. Ealill can verify.<br>
<br>
The THIRD time it happend, they fuxed CE. Bolllix was also furious and he<br>
talked to fusion and warned them, that CE wouldnt take action this time, but<br>
if they did the same to Wudan he was sure they would take action.<br>
<br>
A few days later, Raveena informs fusion that we have POSTED our TT<br>
raid on the multi guild board.<br>
<br>
A day after that they kill the TT we had planned.<br>
<br>
It is quite clear cotw/fusion would not ever have respected our flag plans, <br>
and would make the (unfortunatly neccessary) process of flagging a total<br>
nightmare for the guild.<br>
<br>
A different guild leader would have destroyed guilds for these actions.<br>
<br>
We voted to fight for a short period only, without corpse camping to demonstrate<br>
that in a guild where people and their allies must plan their RL commitments<br>
to hit those raids that are important to them, we are serious about RZ guilds<br>
respecting each others schedule.<br>
<br>

I forgot to add.<br>
<br>
1. No MB posts relating to war. None.<br>
<br>
2. No shittalk in ooc/shout. A warrior does not need to shout about his deeds. Nor, defend<br>
his actions. His sword can talk for him, or failing that, the swords of his allies.<br>
<br>
3. No corpse camping, even if they do it to you. For now.<br>
<br>
4. Please keep a good tone around the fighting. This is a brief skirmish to send <br>
a message to these guilds only. Not an attempt to hurt them on a permenat basis.<br>

 I would like to add that what you have posted here I agree with... however I do think 3 posts obove this one should be put on the public board to counter any propaganda to make us look bad. To many silence equates guilt. Think of how it looks during trials for example when people refuse to take the stand in thier own defense... makes them look very bad. Secondly Id like to say untill reading this post I was somewhat dubious about reasons for war... but them being informed the day before about doing TT... and them purposfully doing it ... to me was like screaming &quot;FUCK YOU WUDAN&quot;. On looking at what needra posted... I doubt I would have been as merciful. Plus now my signature form hagakure owns   <br>

I'll just clarify.<br>
<br>
I dont think they did it on purpose.<br>
<br>
They just do not stop to pause for thought and consider the plans of other guilds.<br>
<br>
I really think, this will send a sharp message, and avoid a LOT of fustration in the future.<br>

 Wow, four times? Thats is indeed alot of patience Needra and I must commend you for it. I see how hard your job is on a day to day basis, and dealing with people not respecting mobs plans must make it hard. My fusion friend monalin is in for a suprise next time i see him. =)  <br>

 I would like to add that when I was in Reverant we also had to war COTW because they wouldn't honor any kind of spawn rotation.  <br>

 I had to deal with Raveena stealing the spawn for cleric epic when I was leading SG. Like Indy said, this stuff is certainly not new for CoTW. While taking TT may not have been deliberate as in your face Wudan, it was deliberately obtuse. They just choose to ignore convention. <br>
<br>
This will be especially sweet for me!  <br>

 Don't get me started on Zebis and Ruulzu. I've never been angry in my life but these two...... I can feel my blood starting to simmer. I abhor traitors and if these two are invited back I will severely disappointed.  <br>

 A war of respect. Even though I was guilded in Fusion for a long time, I can see and understand the reasons for a brief skirmish to teach these two guilds a lesson. War looms, my interest is peaked  <br>
<br>
See you on the battle field  <br>

Several Fusion and CoTW had told me there were wudan twinks or inits or something at the TT raid, had wudan tag hidden. Who were these people?  <br>

I've always had the image that CoTW was a very respectable guild, but perhaps the members are, and the raid leaders are not so much... *shrug*<br>

 before you dump all over ruulzu or zebis I remeber when we had a REAL war yeah you remeber the AD war<br>
<br>
zebis was always pvping and ruulzu as well so it has nothing to do with them running away or anything, yeah maybe they had other issues and were leaving anyways but that is another discussion entirely.<br>

 Not everyone hates us: <br>
<br>
Jeboda CoTW Monk posted this on their public forum:<br>
QUOTE  <br>
<br>
I for one applaud how Wudan is handling this.<br>
<br>
It was only a matter of time before our highest aspirations start overlapping the lower aspirations of more powerful organizations.<br>
<br>
We started off by killing a low priority mob that Wudan had been planning to kill.<br>
<br>
The response was basically, &quot;It is a lot of trouble to schedule this sort of thing, so please pay attention to our announced plans, so we do not have to reschedule for later.&quot;<br>
<br>
What better way to draw attention to this polite request than a brief war? Gets the attention of everyone, gets everyone in our guild to read the message boards to find out what is going on.<br>
<br>
Some may fault them for saying this was the 4th warning. Some may fault us for not paying close enough attention to message boards that we did not fully appreciate the purpose of.<br>
Some may assume it is the big bullying the small, and other such conclusions founded on negative feelings more than any fact.<br>
<br>
I know Raveena got assurances that we were clear to proceed. But that was mistaken second hand info. We just need to get more in tune with the more direct ways that exist to double check the schedules of any organization who may be inconvenienced.<br>
<br>
Single unguilded wizards can smoke me in about 20 seconds. It will be fun to see how much of a splat can be accomplished with a well organized team of 6 well equipped and alternatively experienced foes.<br>
<br>
We are on a PvP server for crying out loud. Not every war needs to be wrought with bad feelings toward the foe. Do not let the gankers be the only ones who get to have fun with PvP. Endure this war in the spirit of good fun that I sense it was invoked with. They did not declare they were going to squash us out of existence. They said they would rain our heads on Norrath for 24 days. I mean how much more goodwill can you get than that?<br>
<br>
I'd call this the &quot;battle of the appointment calendar&quot; more than anything else. Have fun with it. Don't get angry, resentful, etc. Preserve the good spirit of fun and cooperation.<br>
<br>
Then again, I only play about twice a week. Easy for me to talk. Only get my head rained on Norrath four times.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
Are we going to find out who in wudan, or what wudan inits, if there were any, were at the CoTW/Fusion raid? I would think it's pretty important to find out if this had happened, and if it did, who it was.  <br>

 Wasnt Wudan killing Sol ro when they stole our TT? If so then everyone should have been at that event...not with CoTW/Fusion killing TT. Who said we had twinks/inits at the TT event? Get some names!  <br>

 Someone sent me a tell when I was online yesterday, I don't remember who it was, and they didn't have a guild tag up. Some other person from a different guild, Dissonant Intervention, had asked me about this fact as well, but I don't remember the name. And one other incident with a Fusion member that was OOR was saying all this stuff in /say<br>
<br>
I can probably look through my logs if I had /log on (which I usually do) for the names, but I also have seen these (not sure if these were posted before, during, or after I was made aware of this)<br>
<br>
I was going to find the quotes from CoTW and Fusion's public boards, but it's probably not worth posting the them. Elusive/Surefoot, Dimento, and Raveena claim this.  <br>

 If they claim it, then they should be able to give the names. Simple.<br>
<br>
I believe that said person would have already spoken up though, so I'm not really believing 'em  <br>

 It may well be that those who were involved in the raid have already left the guild.<br>
<br>
Seriously though...this is all hearsay until we see some list. We cannot take CotW or Fusion word for any names. Proof is essential. Of course it is equally possible that Wudan members (twinks) were at the raid and are now embarassed to admit. They probably thought there was no harm to it until now when they realize that much more was at stake.<br>
<br>
Maybe we all learn from this.  <br>

 Got friends in both guilds, and I have enjoyed pvping them. However, I happend to hear FL was apart of this raid, they helped Organize the raid and even split the lewt. Just hear say from the otherside. Not trying to start anything just thought it MIGHT be worth mentioning.  <br>

 Oh man, I can't wait to beat the crap out of Sird..the ass has my surname and won't remove it. Galf, as to Ruulzu and Zebis, even if they fought a war in the past, if they're unwilling to fight another no matter WHO the opponent is, i see it as abandonment. Did you read Ruulzu's post about backing up his friends? He didn't even wait for Needra's post on why we were warring, he just jumped ship. Good riddance imo.  <br>

 Seems to me than any who left during time of WAR!! and. went to the enemy joined them to inturn fight against us !! was only using wudan in the first place.. IMO they would forever be kept KOS and i would not let them have an easy tiem on rz.... that is pretty deceitfull to turn your back on the people that bascially made you with not only gear and uber loots but with encouragement and compliments...<br>
HAHA before i was in wudan and the initiate program OMG my charachter sucked bad .. it was realy sad... being with you guys has really changed my attitude on how i play and look at my charachter now , not just because of loots but because of everyone in Wudan.. I Totally support any decision Wudan makes and will stand by my guild 100 %<br>

I had spoken to both Fusion and CoTW about flagging mobs and to check with us before killing.

erm? i believe i had a pretty good grasp of what went down...    everyone except wudan who was involved in some way said i had it pretty much correct.. and anyone who could read what i wrote could understand what went down.<br>
<br>
<br>
as to the posting of pics with wudan corpses, i do believe we did win that war.. you deguilded kurleyx and moehx thus ending the harboring of kos pos's which is the main reason we warred you... we ended the war cause you did as we asked... seems to me that we won since you did what we wanted you to do... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608" target="top">Daetien Beyazid</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
And it seems many dont know what was up with the wudan vs cotw/fusion 'war'.<br>
<br>
#1 this was the first cotw/fusion raid so how could it be 'our' fourth offense?  wuday kos'd reverd and another guild too. <br>
<br>
#2 How could fusion know what wudan had planned?  We had no access to the 'rotation' board and wudan doesnt even have a public msg board....<br>
<br>
#3 Wudan had a recruit/tweenk there, yet said nothing.<br>
<br>
Basically, fusion/cotw had no idea what wudan had planned since we never had any access to any board that said so.  Read all the past 200+ posts on verious msg boards if you want to get into that again.<br>
<br>
Like I said, whoever this Boomstick guy is either very clueless or just cleverly (though rather obviously) trying to start a war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>So nice</span><br>  Posts: 1107<br> <font color=#333333>(2/9/04 7:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=513.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.tu-clausthal.de/~wits/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Drama Entrante</span><hr size=1> You are all very bad persons.<br>

And i do support the killing of Pyrosprial at any Place and any given Time.<br>
<br>
Also i do agree with everything that includes Amsterdam, Weed and Ruhi paying the Whores. Beside that i do also agree with Lohengrin.<br>
<br>
Now coming to the Point. Mearis sucks and Nayah needs to shut up. Beside that there is nothing really new to see here except i do remember the whole Wudan Guild AE TL when we wanted to fight the Biggest Fight on RZ.<br>
<br>
I shall curse all Wudans since they are indeed &quot;Fraggles&quot;.<br>

Summary.<br>
<br>
Wudan = Fraggles<br>
Pyrosprial = Gnomo<br>
Mearis = Saddams Friend<br>
Nayah = needs to shut up<br>

Your fucking kidding me right? <br>

When I or my guild gets beat I know to have to common courtesy to tip my hat and say cya next round. Shouting GOOM and doing the Cha cha cha, while you plan your next luring tactic to &quot;annoy&quot; the other guild isn't exactly winning. I guess the definition of actually winning a war has changed somewhat on RZ though. Now you have time limits on wars so things don't interfere with regularly scheduled activities lol...<br>
