Here is my story......<br>
We are a family guild (father and children), both my son and I, Shannara (63 Pally) have been on Rallos for about 3.5 yrs.<br>
We are honorable and anti-pk, always have been. We have always respected AD and its members. Your own guild helped me get my last epic piece, for which I have always been thankful.<br>
About 6 months ago Shannara, Naroo and myself were meeting at Stormfeather. There was someone there camping it. A character not in a guild. I forget his name. He TOLD us to leave the area. I assured him we were not going to take his spawn. We were all meeting to camp-out there. I told him we werent going to leave. He then got on his main, Faarmarki and killed me without reason. He PK'd me. I was revived and he killed me again. In fact he killed Krump 4 times for no reason. I had not made a single aggressive move toward him.<br>
<br>
First, he used his AD character for PKing. It was totally uncalled for. Now he is attacking Molokovolocet on sight. This is ridiculous. We have done nothing to AD. This is a simple case of one of your guild members abusing your guild. The bottom line is Faarmarki PK'd Krump without reason. Faarmarki's overwhelming fear that Stormfeather would be stolen from him obstucted his common sense. What he did was wrong.<br>
<br>
This KOS status of Molocovolocet is wrong and needs to be corrected. Shannara and I have very good reputations and do not deserve to have AD acting this way towards us. I get PK'd by Faarmarki and then he has AD treat us as if we have done something wrong.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this isnt the first time Faarmarki has shown such poor judgement. Even though he PK'd me, I would have no problem settling this FAIRLY (him and I) but for him to lie (certainly AD requires a reason for making others KOS), thus involving AD is simply wrong. <br>
<br>
Again, we are a small family guild. Faarmarki's abuse of his guilds power is wrong. I ask your Officers to please address this issue and end this unwarranted and incredibly unfair KOs status. <br>
Thank you<br>

Couple things:  <br>
<br>
1)  That was a nice letter.<br>
<br>
2)  You are wrong about who killed you in Iceclad that day, it was Faamarki, and she was guilded AD at the time.<br>
<br>
3)  Stormfeather is a VERY contested spawn on RZ.  Just like Lodizal, the velious dragons, etc.  If someone, who is obviously camping this spawn, and is worried about getting ninja-looted asked me to leave, I would have the common sense to say &quot;hey, yea, I guess we should vacate&quot;.<br>
<br>
4)  You neglected to mention that after you got killed you started running thru velious zones screaming in /ooc &quot;AD IS A PK GUILD!  THEY ATTACK PPL FOR NO REASON!&quot; plus about 5 lines of crazy babble, like someone had just ax-murdered your wife or something.  Calm down, it's only PVP.  It'll be ok.<br>
<br>
So what have we got here:  You have a poor memory, you did not display good judgement at a highly contested spawn, and you ran around screaming that AD were PK's.  That contradicts your &quot;We have always respected AD and its members&quot; line.  I'd say you owe someone an apology.<br>
<br>

<br>
I got 4 screenshots of the stormfeather encounter on my hard disk just waiting for you to try to refute what i am about to say. So think wisely before you claim something and make yourself look even more foolish.<br>
<br>
First off Obsiddion was camping stormfeather for days,  I know cause i had him idling on my 2nd pc while i was doing other things.  When you and your merry band of assclowns showed up I asked you to leave cause stormfeather was camped.  You so eloquently informed me that you would not be leaving my camp because people havent respected your stormfeather camps in the past and as such, you wont be respecting mine.  I told you once again to leave. You refused and said sorry.  Meanwhile your 2 friends naroo  and shannara or whatever began the crap talking.<br>
<br>
I loaded up faamarki on my main pc and asked you again to leave.  You refused and said &quot;what you gonna do now pk me now?&quot;  And yes. I did PK you for refusing to leave.  You had 3 chances to leave, you declined all the chances.  Now if you were just camping out there as you said you were you could of just said, NP were camping here and will try checkign the camp later.  No issue would of became of it. <br>
<br>
INstead you tried to be buster badass and walk over some green con and step on his camp cause he wasnt flying an uberguild tag over his head.  Talk about disrespect.<br>
<br>
Now why didnt you mention what happened prior to me killing you and what happened after i killed you?  Hrmm?  I sent you a tell after i killed you saying &quot;come back and get your ring i looted off you and leave this area&quot;  You proceeded to go on a tangent of cussing.  insulting everything you could possible think of. You got ressed in a few times. I gave you ample time to loot and leave, you refused and got killed 3 more times. <br>
<br>
Realising you didnt stand a chance in hell vs faamarki you started running around iceclad ocean screaming like a moron that ad has gone random and great injustices had been commited against you.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile your &quot;son&quot;  decides to comment on my legs smelling like fish, calls me a fucking slut, and a pussy.  Back to the respect issue,  is that the kind of talk any father allows his son to use?  <br>
<br>
After you got bored of spamming you decided to tell me &quot;your fucking dead&quot; and promised to wreck AD as a guild.   BTW i am still waiting for that day.   <br>
<br>
Its funny how you claim you were so in the right about what happened that day but even the officer on in AD told me I was right to kill you and placed you as KOS.  I also recall Steph gating in to assist me with you if i needed it. did you even try to contact online officers? <br>
<br>
btw get sinmaster to come over and here give us the &quot;totenreich prespective&quot; on things, god knows they would never lie / cheat / or act dishonorably.<br>
<br>
Anyhow. So ya that about sums it up. Your a moron, you dont respect others camps, you got your ass kicked, you talked shit, now your kos, and now your crying.<br>
<br>
I think xblade has some spare manpon's if you need one. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.aladarya.com/tiigsig01.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gsam>Gsam</A> at: 6/19/03 9:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ithador>Ithador</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(6/19/03 10:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Molokovolocet / Rallos (Attn: AD Officers)</span><hr size=1> Gsam, thank you for admitting you PK'd.

As for hiding behind my guild thats a joke.  I dont *NEED* my guild to take you out. My guild backs eachother up tho, thats what guilds do.<br>

the 4 pictures I have of you are your comments to me. Your reactions to my offers, and your zone spamming. none of them are killshots. <br>

You are a disgusting example of honor. You exploit this game by abusing rules others abide by. If you had been waiting for this post for so long, you knew why.

Call the GM's, cause i'm sure this whole server are all PKers. Someone please make a guild of anti's and when you do kill a Player, you can join the PKers side.<br>

This is Rallos Zek, comprehend the fact that folks got the ability to kill folks like you.<br>

When Ordo joined Rebirth Shanarra and Krump moved to Fusion, were they attended absolutley no raids outside of Kael (We were doing Fear and Hate on a regular basis) but because Brolly is the awesome guy he is, he helped everyone else out on loot.<br>
<br>
Shanarra and Krump made about 4 raids, being guilded for like 5 months ish.  They got Krump's epic, and some Thurgadin armor, and then deguilded.  Not once was there any communication in guild chat, so like I said, I am not surprised they were totally ignorant to the RB war.<br>
<br>
Now for this PK incident.  I dont know who you think you are bossing around people just because you have had a bad time at a camp, fuck I camped Stormfeather for two straight weeks and constantly got KSed.  However, I didnt tell newbies or weaker/more powerful people I would kill them if they didnt leave.  No, despite growing up in NY I have tact and class, to an extent.  You sir, diserve to lay in the grave you dug for yourself.<br>
<br>
Gsam has my total support.  I followed under him as an officer, I followed him as a respected friend, I follow his as a real life good friend, and leaste of all because he is in my guild.  He doesnt need his tag to hide behind because he was kicking ass in the name of reason way before you were high enough to see him in any zone.  So before you go making uneducated assumptions about people or guilds, infront of impressionable children I might add, I would try to get a grasp of the history of your characters, their guilds, and the server you play on.<br>
<br>
Wonder what your kids think, you got owned sir.<br>
