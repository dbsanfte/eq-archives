I am afraid the empirical data supports the supply-siders.  The large money supply and high taxes policy of the 70s saw employment and inflation move in the same direction, up to be specific.  Unfortunately, a lot of professors espouse demand-side economics and students swallow hook, line and sinker.<br>
<br>
In the 80s we saw inflation plummet as supply increased.  Huge growth as incentive to work hard increased.  Income tax revenue increases while taxes decreased.<br>
<br>
Clinton raised taxes in the 90s and the economy did not collapse.  Is that the empirical data you refer to?  The end of the cold war (thanks to Reagan) and the tech boom/bubble could have had something to do with that as well.  You get an “A” for asshole and a “B” for bullshit (hah, couldn’t resist).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Point 7 applies directly to the Japanese economy, where the household savings rate is very high. Given the well-documented behavior of Japanese consumers, it should not surprise anyone that loose monetary policy would have little effect on consumer spending there.<br>
<br>
American households have never shown a similar propensity to hold money when interest rates are low (Americans have one of the lowest household savings rates in the world). Americans have always been willing to take on debt when money is cheap. If you've paid any attention at all to the mortgage market in the last 18 months, this is exactly what has happened. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The point in quoting the exact same article that you used to supposedly bolster your own argument, was that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that article didn't support what you said</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  In fact, it said exactly the opposite. You claim that tax cuts are responsible for the current economic resurgence, your own example article says otherwise.  Grats you on lack of reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
A couple of other points:<br>
The USSR was on its way to collapse with or without Reagan.  The Soviets were spending an unconscionable portion of their GDP on military production, essentially starving their own people.  This had been the trend long before Reagan.  It was not a sustainable political model.  You might as well give Reagan credit for gravity.<br>
<br>
As for the effects of stimuli being different depending on the behaviour of consumers, clearly that's the case.  However, the willingness of American consumers to assume debt (which is exactly what they've done while the interest rates were down) argues strongly for monetary modulation of economic cycles in this country.  Saying that the Japanese behave differently under simular stimuli (as your article did) is irrelevant to this discussion. We're not discussing Junichirou Kiizumi and his economic plans, are we?<br>
<br>
Empirical data supports supply side economics? Really? Hmmm.  <br>
<br>
Why did the household private savings rate decline to 60% of its 70s level after the Reagan tax cuts (exactly opposite of what supply side theory predicts)?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In the 80s we saw inflation plummet as supply increased. Huge growth as incentive to work hard increased. Income tax revenue increases while taxes decreased.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Really?<br>
<br>
Why did multifactor non farm labor productivity grow at a pace an average of 65% more under Clinton and his tax increase, and corresponding deficit reduction, than it did under the Reagan tax cut and balloon of deficit spending(Bureau of Labor Statistics, Multifactor productivity Index 1980-2001)? Sooo either people were either working smarter, or harder during a time when supply side theory maintained they would have less incentive to do so.<br>
<br>
Why did the labor force grow at lower rate during the Reagan era as it did prior to Reagan (Bureau of Labor Statistics, total non-farm employees 1970-2004), and then higher again under Clinton? Again, this is *exactly* the opposite of what Supply Side theory would predict.<br>
<br>

The only point I really wanted to get across was that your post was hypocritical. You could leave the &quot;rather obviously&quot; part out and it wouldn't change anything.<br>

I didn't really mean to jump into the political foray on either side (although I suppose I did in the end). I dug up the data just to emphasize the point that you did not provide data, contrary to your own admonition.<br>
<br>
One thing I'll agree with is that economics isn't an exact science. There's tons of data, but really no way to do an experiment. So every study you do is going to have a lot of uncontrolled variables; some will even be unknown. So, in the end, we're really looking at correlations, not cause and effect. Which can lead to fallacies such as the pet example &quot;higher ice cream sales cause increases in rapes,&quot; and in the end, you or I really can't prove a thing.<br>

What is the empirical data, and is it comprehensive?<br>

What theories does that data support?<br>

<br>
However, what I can say with certainty is this: the US economy behaved in ways that are exactly the opposite of what supply side economic theory predicts during the Reagan period, which were the true halcyon days for supply siders. For this reason, supply side theory has been rejected by most serious economists.  Its main proponents are not academics, and pooh-pooh crazy things like academic journals, conferences, and peer review (Robert Bartley, Jude Wanniski, Irving Kristol--journalists all; Arthur Laffer--an academic to be sure, but whose contributions to the real body of academic work are dwarfed by his popular lecture circuit appearances).<br>
<br>
The empirical data I quoted comes from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' web site.  The trends I referenced run specifically counter to what supply side theory predicts, and also what Smawty claimed for that period (&quot;incentive to work harder&quot; blah blah blah).<br>
<br>
Smawty's basic argument is: Reagan Cut taxes.  After that, the economy recovered, therefore the tax cuts caused it. Bush cut taxes, after that the economy recovered, therefore the tax cuts caused the recovery.  A classic example of the coincidental correlation logical fallacy(post hoc ergo propter hoc, for you Latin Geeks). This fallacy is evident when one says that when an event follows another in time, it is caused by the previous event.  He ignores real data which run counter to his pet theory, because they do not fit conveniently. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pinaduzrz>PinaduzRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#333333>(6/25/04 4:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> Wasn't it Laffer who developed the J-curve and spurred supply side economic &quot;popularity&quot; during the Reagan era? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#333333>(6/25/04 8:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=188>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> Yes Pina.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#333333>(6/25/04 10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=189>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> Thanks Leh, although in my opinion my argument doesn't need any help as your article demonstrated.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Empirical studies of tax cuts that happened during the twenties and sixties buttressed the supply-side position. Prodded by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, three major tax cuts reduced the top marginal tax rate from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent in 1926. In addition, the tax cuts eliminated or virtually eliminated the personal income tax liability of low-income recipients. The results were quite impressive. The economy grew rapidly from 1921 through 1926. After the rates were lowered, the real tax revenue (in 1929 dollars) collected from taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 rose from $305.1 million in 1921 to $498.1 million in 1926, an increase of 63 percent. In contrast, the real tax liability of those with less than $50,000 of income declined by 45 percent. Thus, as the tax rates were cut, the revenues collected from high-income taxpayers rose, while those collected from lower-income taxpayers declined. The tax cuts of the twenties substantially increased the percent of taxes paid by the wealthy. <br>
<br>
The results of the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts of the midsixties were similar. Between 1963 and 1965, tax rates were reduced by approximately 25 percent. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 91 percent to 70 percent. Simultaneously, the bottom rate was reduced from 20 percent to 14 percent. For most taxpayers the lower rates reduced tax revenues. In real 1963 dollars the tax revenues collected from the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers fell from $31.0 billion in 1963 to $29.6 billion in 1965, a 4.5 percent reduction. In contrast, the real tax revenues collected from the top 5 percent of taxpayers rose from $17.2 billion in 1963 to $18.5 billion in 1965, a 7.6 percent increase. As in the case of the tax cuts of the twenties, the rate reductions of the sixties reduced the tax revenue collected from low-income taxpayers while increasing the revenues collected from high-income taxpayers. <br>
<br>
Major tax legislation passed in 1981 and 1986 reduced the top U.S. federal income tax rate from 70 percent to approximately 33 percent. The performance of the U.S. economy during the eighties was impressive. The growth rate of real GNP accelerated from the sluggish rates of the seventies. U.S. economic growth exceeded that of all other major industrial nations except Japan. <br>
<br>
The critics of the eighties tax policy argue that the top rate reductions were a bonanza for the rich. The taxable income in the upper tax brackets did increase sharply during the eighties. But the taxes collected in these brackets also rose sharply. Measured in 1982-84 dollars, the income tax revenue collected from the top 10 percent of earners rose from $150.6 billion in 1981 to $199.8 billion in 1988, an increase of 32.7 percent. The percentage increases in the real tax revenue collected from the top 1 and top 5 percent of taxpayers were even larger. In contrast, the real tax liability of other taxpayers (the bottom 90 percent) declined from $161.8 billion to $149.1 billion, a reduction of 7.8 percent. These findings confirm what the supply-siders predicted: the lower rates, by increasing the tax base substantially in the upper tax brackets, caused high-income taxpayers to pay more taxes. In effect, the lower rates soaked the rich. <br>

The article still falls prey to the same coincidental correlation fallacy already referenced.  During the same period in the 1980s, interest rates were in a nearly constant <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/research/data/us/disc.cfm">decline</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, increasing &lt;gasp&gt; the money supply.  Productivity statistics from our own Bureau of Labor Statistics contradict directly the other claimed implications of supply side theory.  <br>
<br>
And to answer you about my particular beliefs with regard to economic theory Smawty, I'd probably place myself firmly firmly in the camp of the New Classicists, who assume rational actors at both the micro and macro levels, who make decisions based both on current situations and on future expectations.  Both the Keynesians and the Supply siders miss a good portion of the boat.<br>

That might be true if my point had been that monetary policy is useless.  But umm, it wasn’t.  My point was that discounting the positive influence of the tax cuts on the economy as negligible was silly.  A combination of tax cuts targeting investment and low interest rates are what the economy needed and that is what it got.  I purposefully used a source that seemed fair perhaps even favoring your position.  I could have easily done a google search on, “conservative+taxes+economy+Bush is the best thing since sliced bread” to find an article to support my claim but a fair article strengthens my position.<br>

Why did the labor force grow at lower rate during the Reagan era as it did prior to Reagan (Bureau of Labor Statistics, total non-farm employees 1970-2004), and then higher again under Clinton? Again, this is *exactly* the opposite of what Supply Side theory would predict.<br>

<br>
Well first of all your numbers seemed fishy and I confirmed this for myself.  You probably used a selective resolution that supported your argument.  I began to link some data to show this but realized that I would be here all night if I did so.  Instead, I encourage people to visit www.bls.gov and any other source they wish themselves.  If you do you may notice that total payroll numbers began increasing before Clinton took office and began decreasing just before he left office while maintaining a relatively stable rate of change in-between.  Regardless of the latter centuries data, productivity in the latter part of 2003 was through the roof.  Although, I wish it hadn’t been so we could have seen a larger increase in the payroll numbers sooner.<br>
<br>
As far as the deficits go, it is important to analyze them as a percentage of GDP.  For example, Reagan inherited a 2.5 % of the GDP deficit and when he left office after fighting and winning the cold war, lowering taxes and spurring enormous growth the deficit was still about 2.5 % of the GDP.  Yes, somewhere in-between 81 and 89 the deficit hit about 6% if my memory serves me.  What about the Bush deficit?  Bush needs to do more to control spending certainly (token criticism).  But as Reagan showed you can grow your way out of a deficit by increasing the size of the pie.  However, given 9-11 and two fronts in the war on terror the 2004 deficit is estimated to be 2.4% of the GDP and the 2003 deficit was 3.4 percent of the GDP(www.cbo.gov).  The deficit during WW2 was at least 17 percent.<br>

1.) The Soviets beat themselves in the cold war, Reagan had little to do with it.  This is just more revisionism to canonize a controversial president.  <br>
<br>
2.) Did we look at the same numbers from the CBO?  The single year deficit during Reagan's last year was 3.1%, not 2.5%. Deficits averaged 4.1% of GDP during his term.  During the term of his successor, deficits averaged 3.9%.  Help me conceptually with how this shows &quot; you can grow your way out of a deficit by increasing the size of the pie.&quot; The deficit, expressed as a percentage of GDP, did not see a number under 2.5% until well after Bush Sr was out of office.<br>
