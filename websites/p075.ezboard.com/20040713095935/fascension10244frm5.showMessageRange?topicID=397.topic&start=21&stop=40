I'm not quite sure where to begin....  <br>
<br>
Tavil is a good guy, and can be a huge asset to a guild which he is in.  I believe the positive testimonial from his recently ex guildmates can attest to that.  However, as the not so positive testimonials can attest to.. there can be another side.  I'm sure that the officers of any big guild, AD included, can understand some of the frusrations Tavil has felt.. it's rarely simple to decide the right course of action for a large and diverse group of people, and working within that system can lead to HUGE headaches and frustrations.  However this whole stink is about power.. who has it who wants it who does and doesn't deserve it.  It's unfortunate that it has come to this end and so quickly.  <br>
<br>
MiM and its membership has every right to be upset with you Tavil.. you turned your back on and abandoned them yesterday.. and then to run here and apply hours later...  <br>
<br>
Personally.. you were in my home 2 weeks ago.. as was Isildr.. yet you did not spent 1 second of time talking to us about any of this.  I feel like you walked out on me.. that you slapped me in the face.. that you let the bull loose in the china shop and left me to clean up after.  I don't give 2 shits about the loots... I do however care about the people.  <br>
<br>
If this is what you want I wish you luck.. AD is a good guild with lots of good peeps.  I hope you're able to find your in game happiness here.<br>

I once posted what MiM means to me... like &quot;I am mim4lyfe, this guild geared me up countless hours, they stick to me in bad and good times. Its a family and I am happy to be among them. I could never disband without thinkin I slapped em, all the gear they gave me I am thankful for and will give my info to officers so they can use me for events... as I play less I cant contribute more...&quot; and he replied that was the nicest thing he ever saw from me.

For over the past month MiM has has 20 raids. Out of those 20 raids Tavil shows up 6 times this alone would discredit you from joining AD as they want members that attend and help during a heavy raid cycle. Also during the first time MIM did vex thal we had a very tough time it took us 4 days to finally clear the zone due to all the trains and lack of pulling experience there. During this time Tavil was goofing around on a twink instead of helping his guild during this grueling process and he basically only shows up to vex thal after the guild has suffered through all the boring and crappy pulls too finally get to the last few bosses. After Tavil loots the Aten ra necklace he shows yet another lackluster appearance at helping the guild during major raids which means he is barely ever present. <br>
  The next time we do VT we are on the last day and this is when I finally see tavil present, but due too the AT&amp;T backbone going out we have a half of our guild go linkdead during a major train which causes a wipe and several hours of corpse recovery. So that night we had to start back at step 1 and continue the grueling process all over to get to aten ra. The next day Tavil writes a post on the mainboard about his differences with the way the guild leadership is run, which isnt any different than any guild is run on rallos btw. A few hours later he justs decides to jump ship and apply to AD now hows that for guild loyalty or trying to work out your differences. <br>
  To some it up Tavil left for only one reason. He recieved the top drop from Vex thal and instead of helping his guildmates through the drudgery of camping Vex thal numerous times to achieve the same reward that he achieved he decided to jump bail and milk AD for 4th tier planar loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alurarz>Alura RZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/03 3:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> Good luck Tavil.

Your facts are skewed on that one.  As far as how the guild is run, you have no idea what's gone on behind the scenes.  Take a look at Cilla's post.  He stepped down from being an officer due to how things are running, the only difference is that I am more passionate in what I am looking for than Cilla was.  You also quote that in the past 20 raids, I've attended 6 of them.  You also fail to mention that is the average for MIM members during that 20 raid period. (I was in Austin, Texas at a gathering of MIM members, which was a reason I've missed about 5 raids on my usual Thursday - Sunday play period.)  Some have more, some have less, also, I believe your time is wrong, I've been to 8.<br>
<br>
Before comin' here acussing me of what you think I did or did not do, I'd strongly recomend talking to the officers of MIM or those that knew me very well.  They'll be able to give you a much clearer insight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tavilrz>TavilRZ</A> at: 3/2/03 2:51:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tsudanosh@ascension10244>Tsudanosh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='filter:glow(color=#0000ff,strength=2);width:100%'>Guild Hopper!</span>

The reasons she gave is that she felt guilty about holding an officer title, yet not being able to do the job due to her low play times lately. Second the raid times I quoted were off the raid guild attendance sheet if you dont like the figures then take it up with the people that put the information in. Thirdly  1 or 2 out of those 6 days you showed up at the end of the raid to scoop up the loot and then leave.. meaning they were vex thal days as i posted earlier. Lastly you can look at the other members that went to your &quot;Austin&quot; gathering and they have the raid time in meaning they raid alots so &quot;Austin&quot; cant be used as a piss poor excuse for lack of performance. Also as far as talking to officers are concerned I was in guildchat last night and the general concensus of what you have done is just F-ed up so dont tell me to talk to the officers considering when I read the board I see that they were working on the very issues you claim to have quit over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aladarea>Aladarea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style='filter:glow(color=#990000,strength=2);width:100%'>Paint me!</span></span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/03 4:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> I am sure whatever Tavil is deciding to do, he is doing what he feels is the best decision to enjoy EQ to its fullest.

Once again, I played my monk for a while. From MIM, I got primal that was going to rot, the warder 4 robe was going to rot. 4 monks were there, 4 robes dropped. The only items that I asked for and was awarded over someone was the dain belt and the shiny trinket of speed. (Which comprise 2 of the 5 loots I've gotten in the year+ I've been in MIM). <br>
<br>
Well we had 5 monks there Takro was left robeless, but you werent actually there were you, it was someone else playing your character when the robe was looted.  Although it must be mentioned that Takro didnt show up till the end.  The Primals that were gonna rot coulda have gone to our beastlords who were still without them.<br>
<br>
Tavil Wrote: <br>
He's right, I was awarded the loot off of Tunare, it was my second loot from MIM after administrating their website begining in December of 2001. The tunare loot was awarded in September of 2002. My first loot was a north ToV loot, which was awarded in August of 2002. Numia was very upset because he felt he should have been awarded the Essence.<br>
<br>
You are right i was pissed off, i spent 6 hours that day clearing PoG to kill tunare, and 5-6 hours the 3-4 Tunare raids before that.  You however came in at the end of pog clearing to pick up loot once again.  Its kinda funny our rule on other Tunare events was if you didnt help clear you didnt have chance at loot cause that clearing was shit.  But yet that rule was overlooked.<br>
<br>
Tavil Wrote:<br>
<br>
The time period on this VT landed w/in the Mon/Tue/Wed rotation in which they all know I can not play. I was awarded the loot based upon the assumption that I earned it. I had been very active at our raids, and had gone 3 or 4 months since recieving a loot (and in that time, I only asked for two, the neck being one of the items I asked for.)<br>
<br>
The time frame was a saturday through Tuesday, Granted you were in Austin that weekend.  But according to you you cant play monday/tuesday/wensday.  But oh look Aten going down, everything else cleared i guess i can find a way to log in to get loot.  Yes it had been 3 months since your last loot wich was on your Monk, but do you rember when you switched mains? The beginging of the year (I rember because i went on a ski trip for 6-7 days on the first of January).  And if you ask me switching your mains is like starting all over, starting at recruit status.  So guess what that 3 month period just got cut to a month and a half.  And this was another one of those things like Tunare, or atleast it should have been, if you werent there for the clearing you shouldnt have been eligble for loot that was a bitch of 4 days.  There were other people who had waited 3 months, 3 months of playing one main mind you, who were there for all 4 days and got screwed out of that neck.  <br>

Tavil Wrote:<br>
This gets into more of my reasons for deguilding, which I have made abundantly clear to the membership base of MIM after reading this post. I've been very unhappy in MIM for over three months, the past week is when I seriously began to consider other alternatives.<br>
<br>
So for 3 months you had problems with MiM, not making any of them known to the majority of the guild until after you had betrayed us.  These problems of course took a back burner to mention until you had gotten loot wich is when you said ok, i got loot time to go.  <br>
<br>
Tavil Wrote:<br>
I'm not sure what instances he is refering to, but in MIM, we had a very small percentage of active officers. While not everything done was attributed to me, I had a very large hand in setting up the strategy for a few of our encounters, as well as leading most of our Ssra raids.<br>
<br>
I wont deny that you did lead a few events, you did help some, but you never have helped nearly as much as you say.<br>
Infact i was just talking to you about that last VT raid, you told me you spent 5 horus clearing that zone.  I was there the entire time seeing you there 1-2 hours tops.  Thinking maybe i didnt see you, wich would be impossible because you are a vocal person, i asked around.  I asked 5 different people, all of wich spent many hours in the zone, i got the same answer from all of them, 1-2 hours.  So like i said embalshing(sp) what you actually did.  <br>

<br>
Is Tavil competent: very<br>
<br>
Is Tavil good for AD: very<br>
<br>
My officers have asked us to stop posting on this thread, but I couldn't resist posting here because much of Tavil's defense of the accusations against him are entertaingly dismissive. I used to be good friend with Tavil, as evidence of such, 15 minutes before we engaged Aten Ra on our first VT raid, he called me on the phone to ask how close to Aten we were. Then he promptly logged on his character and looted the best item our guild has ever earned. He spent 30 minutes in VT when many of the rest of MiM had spent 40 hrs on that raid and got nothing. Bad call by the loot council. According to his own admissions in this thread, he had been unhappy and considering other options than MiM for the last 3 months but he did not lead on to anyone in the guild. Tavil has tried to spin the top on his detractors , which he is very good at, unctuousness, not honesty has never been his strongsuit. As Dermel knows I fully supported him leaving MiM, we were at a very low point in turns of our productivity, and he had put way more into MiM than he got out. Tavil on the other hand has taken far more than he has given. Tavil was still playing his monk 3 months ago. during which time he was geared exceedingly fast on account of his officer status and people believing his campaign that he would never play an enc again and that he was the only capable puller in the guild. Bad call by Mim's leadership again, we arent perfect, and he has taken full advantage of that. Was Tavil an unbelievable assest to MiM before the VT raid that he deserved the neck: no. Ssorak is correct, he has only attended 6 out of the last 20 raids since we started tracking attendance recently. I don't mind when people leave guilds for the right reasons. But it should be abundantly clear that Tavil abused his officer status to leverage for that VT loot knowing full and well he had been planning to leave for a very long time. <br>
<br>
He cashed out. But with AD, this is not a problem. He can't trade up or use you guys as stepping stone and perhaps he will attend more than a paltry 30percent of the raids. This is why you find many MiM upset, we were manipulated and deceived. Nonetheless, I think he is good for AD , b/c I doubt his character flaws will have much impact on his competency to assisting you guys in your pve goals. <p>&lt;center&gt; &lt;br&gt;  not allowed &lt;/EMBED&gt; &lt;/center&gt;<br>

Unless people cowerd down to Tavil and I didn't know about it.  Tavil earned that neck and if he hadn't earned it wtf would LC give it to him.  Its what I call giving people their just rewards I'm sure people have heard of that before right.  I've been in MiM loot councils alot and I know what happens in them, I try to be as fair as I can and other people try to be fair aswell.  If letting Tavil get that loot wasn't fair the only people to blame were the ones in the LC IMO~<br>
<br>
As far as Tavil switching mains yes he did do that and it was bad in my eyes as it was to others.  Tavil got alot on his monk and quit playing him do to his personal reasons I think (btw he did alot for MiM with that monk while he played it).  I also do know MiM didn't award a loot to Tavil for a long time due to just that reason.  If Tavil didn't prove to MiM that he was going to stick with his Enchanter from then on why did we give him that loot? hmmm he was deserving of it? that would be my logical guess.<br>

As I pointed out in my earlier post, Tavil had not been nearly active enough to justify such an honorary step. Will MiM's officers and LC admit to this mistake? Unlikely, leadership always tries to save face, thats why I suspect we've been asked not to post here. The vocal minority that have come forward in Tavil's defense, are his RL friends too, if Tavil wishes you to throw out the factual testimony of Numia and Rynns b/c they are friends ( I myself am not friends with either Rynns or Numia so he'll have to come up with another way to undermine posts ), then you have to discredit the ringing endorsements from his RL friends. And the sticking point is , that he asked and took the loot under full knowledge that he had little time left in a guild he considered to be failing. He looted and scooted in the poorest form. Remember when IE held its high and didnt use any of its loot hours right before Synergy collapsed? IE left in good form, what Tavil did, was a calculated selfish gesture. As far as, MiM's LC, with a few exceptions, yes officers get more loot, look at their gear compared to the average member. Our LC is arbitrary and there is *always* bias, intentional or not. Tavil as an officer would usually be on LC at the raids he was present for even if there were more far more active members in attendance who were more in touch with the guild, and people tend to vote for those that have influence over their own loot. Feathering the nest if you will. Do you honestly think a regular member that wasnt at the raid and barely attends raids would have been allowed to loot an uber loot? Give me a break, who are you kidding. I doubt you'll find anyone that will say Tavil is not a good player, which is probably the most relevant factor in his admission. He didnt raid much for us, but I'm sure he will be whatever color you want him to be and bend over backwards to get in, he will even seem like your best friend, I've been with him since IE, I thought he was mine at one point too. I think its only fair to AD to let them know they are getting a good player, but a duplicitous character. <p>&lt;center&gt; &lt;br&gt;  not allowed &lt;/EMBED&gt; &lt;/center&gt;<br>
