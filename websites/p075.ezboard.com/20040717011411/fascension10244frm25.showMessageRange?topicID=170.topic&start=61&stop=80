That dipshit just loves talking to my guild officers like we're kids. Whenever we had a conflict with OM, he was in the front line talking to us like we were 12 years old and level 30. Hell, I shouldn't even use the word &quot;talking&quot;, it was more like downright slandering Revered, calling us newbies, telling me I have no idea how to lead raids, etc etc; the typical angry retard retort. It's funny, cause now every time an officer sees him they say &quot;oh god, Vantaris is here&quot; in officer chat. I'll admit openly, I hate Ordo Malleus as a guild (though some of their members such as Talthan, Lunar, etc seem really cool), and it's mostly because of Vantaris alone.<br>

Have i pissed off u revered in some past life or something? I remember the days when OM was raiding with revered. After talking to Moordred i got the impression that revered thinks om screwed them over.  At the time I wasnt even a officer nor was i above lvl 55. I hardly had any say if any in what happend between OM and revered. <br>
<br>
Morb we had dealings over a year ago because u guilded a pk. I cant remember his name. When i have guildmates throwing fits cause they wana kos your guildmate, something had to be done. You wouldnt deguild him and i told u that i couldnt stop my guildmates from kosing him. You said &quot;If its around me im going to help him&quot;. Which would later cause more heat between om and revered and most likly cause a war. You were being unreasonable and i guess my anger got the better of me. Im not sure what happend from there i think people just forgot he was kos. Mabey I was a ass I can only remember bits and pieces of the conversation. But for what its worth im sorry for any past aggresion i showed u as a officer of om <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uvantarisrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VantarisRZ</A> at: 8/6/02 11:25:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uaerokrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AerokRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(8/6/02 3:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://snow.prohosting.com/brinkor/kaaqsig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vantaris</span><hr size=1> haha morb i remember problems between u and him.

I have read over some of this stuff and am going to add a little something to my stance.. my first post really reflected his personality, so ill talk about his abilities now..<br>
<br>
I haven't met a mage to meet him. He never complained about his class, he never whined about pearl costs ect (some may say its because of guildbank ect but no, he was always willing to buy them on his own and stuff), he always knew what was expected of his class- always knew when to call nukes what kind of strat was needed for whatever mob (I got proved wrong more time than, as Hamurr would put it, my raging ego would like to admitt), and he was just all around really good at his class. I have had personal issues with him for as long as I can remember, but aside from those he is definitly an asset to any guild he joins. That doesnt however change my first post; i stand by what i said there as well..<br>

For my part Vant is a really nice guy. What else to say, Oh yeah From SoD point of view OM is one of the worst guild talking about good behavior and nice people even though some in it are nice guys (Chaengmoon, Vibron, Kendrel and very few others).<br>

I sure as hell know why it continues. Since you wanna know specifics, I'll break the piggy bank:<br>
<br>
1. Trueleaf and I (both Revered druids) were sitting at DN zone in WW talking when OM comes to do Klandicar. NP, we stay there and keep talking, figuring we can watch since we're bored, and some jackass named Soulwind arrogantly asks us in ooc &quot;you Revered guys need something?&quot; as if he owned the zone. I felt like telling him I &quot;needed&quot; him to shut the fuck up and mind his own business but I held it back.<br>
2. You guilded Truelaw and Tantelus, among plenty other, shall we say, Grade A wankers? (Or possibly Grade C; sort of like Grade C eggs which look browner than they are yellow on the inside and cost somewhere in the 20 cent area per dozen; or Grade C beer such as Milwaukee's Best or Schlitz) I'm aware that Truelaw is no longer a member, that still doesn't negate the fact that you guild the retards in the first place. As if a druid was worth guilding at all, let alone a dickhead with a wonderful rep to boot.<br>
3. Truelaw, among a few others, liked to pk lower-level Revered while they were xping cause &quot;he was bored&quot;. OM leadership didn't give a fuck. In fact I don't think I got a single reply out of them, they simply ignored me.<br>
4. I was sitting in EW camping the 8th ring mob when lo and behold she spawns. As I'm logging my monk on the other box, Barmaley and Dosid (hi!) run up and tell me to fuck off, &quot;we've been camping it for 3 hours.&quot; I called their bluff (I prefer the term &quot;BLS&quot; for &quot;Bad Liar Syndrome&quot; which may be pronounced as &quot;Bullshit&quot; for the people who think &quot;u&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are words), yet I graciously offered to roll for the spawn instead. They didn't reply and turned in their note and proceeded to execute the 8th ring script. Angered by this I pked the two dicks (accidentally xp lossed Dosid) and got my ring, at which point OM leadership declared war on Revered and refused to hear my side of the story. I'm sure we all remember this one. They later corpse camped me in Thurg at my bind point for about an hour, I petitioned and ordered a pizza while they enjoyed themselves (even managed to kill some of their pets by looting my epic and clicking 'em!). I managed to clear it up with Talthan later (how the fuck such a cool guy can lead such a shady guild is beyond me).<br>
<br>
Hell I could name a couple more off the top of my head, but I don't feel the need seeing as Arqos's shining brilliance explains mounds. Speaking of brilliance, is that &quot;Lame-uh&quot; or &quot;Llama&quot; cause I wanna know whether you're a gangsta-thug mo' G or a 5th grade dropout. Probably both.<br>
<br>
To the members OM who are really cool, sorry to be dissing your guild, but you've got a lot of baggage. As for Somthor, you seem real cool and dedicated to improving your guild. I think you'll make a good leader in Vantaris's place. <p>-Morb<br>60 druid</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umorbrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorbRZ</A> at: 8/7/02 9:29:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usomthor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#333333>(8/7/02 10:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iofthestorm.org/images/EQicon.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the funny thing..</span><hr size=1> 1) none of these people are in OM anymore mostly becuse of officer actions.<br>
<br>
2) some officers invited people they shouldnt have they are no longer officers and these people are no longer in OM<br>
<br>
3) truelaw was in OM for a week i think and was removed or he just plain left for wudan<br>
<br>
4) disputed mobs are a source of many arguements but im glad Talthan was able to settle this<br>
<br>
I appreciate the complement but ill never be the leader Vantaris was.  i cant even get my ST keyholders to show up for events.  Only thing i have on Vant is im older more pateint more willing to listen and yes i get my pipes cleaned reguarly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Orchid and Cascia are my personal Goddess but I'll share
