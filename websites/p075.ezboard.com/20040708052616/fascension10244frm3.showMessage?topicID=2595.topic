<br>
As I have become aware after spending a couple days on legends and then transferring to rallos zek for what I thought was the first time for this character, I'm being told Kalea was a member of The Curse, was geared and sold by an xblade, and other reasons which I wasn't enlightened with. It wasn't until I brought Kalea into Maloudi Clan with other anti pk friends of my main formerly of Fusion and helped do some epic raids and help out with LDoN's and leveling anti's to 65 that all the sudden langomusic removed Kalea with no warning. I understand it is your policy to KOS Kalea for her supposed history. But as any of you who may happen to work in the corporate world know, policy sucks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and are more like guidelines to refer to in some situations where other remedies than the policy prescribes may be appropriate. You can't prove to me Kalea was in the curse or a PK, but I can most certainly prove to you she is owned by a friendly, fun loving selfless father of two and a devout anti-pk who was scammed by the former owner. Not one person I have grouped with since Kalea came to RZ has mentioned a PK history outside of AD. In light of all this I would like to urge the council of AD to consider my plight and rescind her KOS status. If you have any questions I will check the post frequently to reply. <br>
<br>
Thanks and I hope you come to the right decision <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Why do you call it a supposed history, are we liars?<br>

Sorry that we cant prove it to you, sorry that our word and what everbody knows cant be something that you are willing to accept.<br>

<br>
You told me you have been on RZ for over 3 years.  Well you should know better than to have purchased a PK character that was kos us to us.  I would work on getting a refund.<br>

Is there anything preventing you from getting your money back?<br>

I wholeheartedly believe you, which, combined with your advice, led me to post here. I have accepted it and am trying to resolve this in the most dignified manner possible. I have already asked for a refund as of the time I first caught wind that something was up with Kalea, but the payment has already been posted and processed. SWG came out and EQ kinda fell by the way side until I learned just what a crappy game that was, so I've been away from EQ for awhile. I started playing my 60 shaman again (60 was the cap when I went on my hiatus) and got kalea in the same week I came back, so I would certainly like to apologize for being out-of-the-know.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 2537<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/04 2:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2595.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/fart.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can't we all just get along...</span><hr size=1> Well, see, here's the thing:  You could be telling the truth, in fact, you probably are.  The trouble here is there's no way we can really verify this...nor is there a way you can verify it to us.  Coupled with the fact that 'buying accounts' is a shady business and is generally frowned upon anyway...especially here on Rallos Zek and especially by guilds who have invested time and energy into a character like Kalea.<br>
<br>
We're kinda hard-ass about this because check out this scenario:  Kalea puts in lots of time but little energy to become a super uber monk like she is...due to the fact loot comes pretty easy 'round here.  She sells it to a person in a PK guild who then sells it to a nice, innocent guy.  We let him off KOS, 3 weeks later the seller calls SOE, turns in the CD key and ganks the account back.  Next day the pk'er (who has our flags) runs into Time, launches a Tier 1 trial and fucks up our raid for that night.  He does it the next time we try, and the next time.  Or maybe ninja loots something.  So now he has YOUR money, he has a character WE invested time in, and he is ruining OUR eq time.  That's a sweet deal.  And it used to be a common occurence here on RZ...but not much anymore.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons it doesn't happen much anymore, is just cuz of hard-ass policies like this.  I feel for ya.  But really, the best course for you is to try to unload it yourself or sell it back.  Barring that, transferring back to Stormhammer is an option.  Or you could level up your own monk! <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146302" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/vansig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Honestly, I feel nothing short of a complete ass for ending up with Kalea and unwittingly bringing her to the server I've loved playing on for so long. Juyshin your name sounds very familiar, did you used to be a fusion shaman? I'm Kahnebus Sahtiva from fusion (not sure if you remember me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) we were THE shamans in that guild next to brolly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That is pretty much my history on this game is Kahnebus, who is now 61 and a member of Maloudi Clan. I know that sounds pathetic, 3 years and a moderately geared 61 shaman, but its hard with work and a family and with the kids a little older now, last week I wanted a monk to duo with my shaman to help get him to 65 and get some AA's going. Maloudi Clan didn't even have a 65 monk so everybody was happy. If juyshin remembers me, he can vouch for my history.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalea21>Kalea21</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/04 10:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2595.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can't we all just get along...</span><hr size=1> ADD: The fellow that sold kalea to me has not responded for awhile now so I have a feeling there's no refund possibility for me.

<br>
no offense, but he wasn't necessarily smart, you were just acting stupid.  You should have asked questions regardless of what he said.   I'm assuming you paid several hundred dollars for this account.  That's a decent amount of money, at least to me.  I don't spend $500 on something on a whim.  <br>
<br>
Not only that, but as you said, you knew it was against Sony policy. I don't care if people buy accounts, but if you're going to break their EULA, don't put the blame off on someone else when you make a bad decision.  <br>
<br>
As for the policy, if it wasn't in place, I could go PKing for a couple of years and get a lot of phat lewt, then claim I sold the account and was the new owner, and completely get rid of my pk rep.  Does that seem fair to you?  No one knows if you're really a new owner or not.  The policy also helps to discourage PKs from being able to steal everyone's items, cause everyone grief, and then make money off of the items they stole.  For all you know, you could be geared up with items that were pked from this very guild.  <br>
<br>
And sorry, but did you say you had a family with two kids and yet you named your character &quot;Kahnebus?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bytorsnoedog>BytorSnoedog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/04 2:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2595.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can't we all just get along...</span><hr size=1> As far as I remember Kahnebus wasnt in Fusion long nor was very active. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dodecadour@ascension10244>dodecadour</A></span><br> Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/04 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2595.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> can't we all just get along </span><hr size=1> <br>
