<br>
No, you can't.  Unless it's ALL just a great big hoax!  Let's say for the sake or argument that I am &quot;paid&quot; $50 per hour.  A good wage.  But whoa...here comes taxes and such.  6.2% for SS, so now I'm earning $46.90.  Now here comes Medicare at 1.45% (of 50) and now I'm earning $46.175.  Federal Taxes come in at 19.47%, so that's $36.44 / hour I'm earning.  Look out!  It's state income taxes next at 6.39% (in California) and I'm bringing home $33.245/hour now.  Fortunately, there is a thing called defered compensation where I can hide some of the money away to be taxed at a LATER date, but it can earn some interest untaxed in the meanwhile.  So of my $50/hour, in a two week cycle, with $500 off the top for defered comp and the rest paid to me AFTER TAXES...<br>
$4,000 - $500 = $3,500<br>
$3,500 - (3500*.062) - (3500*.0145) - (3500*.1947) - (3500*.0639) = $2,327.15 on the paycheck every two weeks.  GRANTED, the $500 is there two, but you cannot use it.  Take home wage is $29.09 (as compared to be &quot;paid&quot; $50)<br>
<br>
Sounds like lots of money, right?  In The area I live, It's barely enough to own a house WITH a partner earning a minimum of $50,000 themselves.<br>

The only way a was able to afford a house in my market was the fact that my mother and fatehr scrimped and saved and acquired a good nest egg.  I followed similar steps and will hopefully be able to leave my children more than what I was left.  I hope they can do the same.  And so on and so on and so on.  Eventually, yes, the &quot;dream&quot; is to make it so that no one in my family ever HAS to work.  It &quot;could&quot; happen this generation, but not freaking likely and I will just continue to buy 5 $1 chances on the lottery when it gets above $50M like the rest of the world.  I am not ignorant to the fact that I have about the same chance of making the money work out in that manner.<br>

&lt;sigh&gt;  I will not try and argue that Paris isn't worthless.  CLEARLY, she is.  I do applaud her for taking her life by the reins and RUNNING with it.  If I was her, I would.  Wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
But let's face it: Paris employs an arseload of folks in the process.  She probably employs 5 times more people than your average heiress because she goes on the &quot;road&quot; so often.  She is using her family's fortune, yes, but at this point in the game, she's almost certainly breaking even.  She does work pretty darn hard if you stop and think about it.  I wouldn't wanna have to be that avilable all the time.  Would you?  My God!  Sometimes my friends get on my freakin' nerves with planning planning planning for weekends!  I think all of us would like to be able to spend 1 or 2 days per month on a drunken binge or stoend to the bejezzuzz or meditating in a treetop or whatever.<br>

<br>
In socialism, everyone is moving forward &quot;together&quot; at reasonably the same rate.  Right?  We all have access to the same medical, right?  The same education, right?  The same liesure activities, right?  The same rights to pursue life and liberty and happiness, right (because socialists believe in those ideas too!)?  Surrrrrrrrre.<br>
<br>
Two people from the same family (heck, paternal twins) of very different natural abilities are offered the same education.  One excels tremendously but comes up against the wall of 'normalcy'  To make sure that everyone stays on reasonably the same course, you keep this particularly exceptional person from ever being free to pursue the sky.  But wait...there's a few people out there (HUMAN NATURE) that realize this persons potential.  They harness them in service of 'the people' and milk their talents mercilessly to their own benefit.  The talented person is exploited, a few people benefit, and 'the people' are 'better off'.  You better beleive that folks will focus more attention on keeping the talented twin healthier.  Remember: Serving the greater good.<br>
<br>
Socialism is a GREAT CONCEPT, but in practice, it does not work.  I agree that there MUST be certain basic levels of everything we need to ensure there is a level of human dignity.  Not that you stated such a lofty goal, but that IS the goal, right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;well there was corruption in russia, that musta been socialism&quot; dont really fly. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There wasn't socialism in Russia to fail by corruption, so I'm not sure what exactly you mean.  There was Communism in the Soviet Union, yes.  Socialism in Russia though?  Never.  Just ask the pensioners throughout that country what their lives are like right now.  It's no secret why &quot;strong-man&quot; politics work there.<br>
<br>
Communism or any other one party (or two...?) system obviously doesn't work.  The possibility of graft and corruption are always too high.  A purely socialist country would still be riddled with people that had &quot;extra access&quot; to certain things.  I mean COME ONE!  If only biologists and geologists and the like had access to the wilderness ranges since they are the only ones doing something &quot;meaningful&quot; there and the cost to have it available to everyone was too high and (breathes in again) thus ONLY those folks could go...What the heck kinda place would it be?  You'd have the biologist trading time with the bridge engineer trading time with the neurosurgeon trading time with the lawyer trading time with...<br>
<br>
The systems of entitlement would continue with a different currency, that is all.<br>
<br>
I'll admit that I live in a bourgiose dreamworld where hard work and education and wise investment can pay off in the long run.  But your bong must definitely be WAY bigger than mine to think that pure socialism is the answer.<br>

Whether you live on a farm with a good old fashioned aversion to birth control OR you live in a ghetto with an engrained aversion to birth control, the result is similar: Resources split WAY to far.<br>

Exactly.  It's not money until it's money, baby.  While it's nice to have that house on the coast, if you refinance it, you could be assessed a greater amount of real estate taxes (depending on where you live...).  You will always be expected to pay the taxes on the property anyways so it's not like it's &quot;free&quot; ownership of the inheritance.<br>

Or if you try to &quot;argue&quot; Away from point i.e. derail argument, just give it up already, you will never do it as well as Mithril who could BS away any argument he lacks in.<br>
<br>
27 beneficiaries to one inheritance, it got to be a pretty fucking big estate for all of them to get hit by estate tax in a BIG way, dont you think? Lets figure out how much money you need to get in an inheritance that you wouldnt need to work ever again in your life. Government seem to think its about 1 million. Anything more is appreciated but not necessary.<br>
<br>
One more time, if we are talking about split up inheritances, then whats your problem with them? Over time they will &quot;fall&quot; to under 1 million according to you and wont be taxed when passed to those &quot;multiple dear grandchildren&quot;.<br>
<br>
Also please enough with a sweet old grandma that worked hard all her life and left her little sweet children a small estate worth 50 millions, ok? I somehow dont see that. A ruthless businessman squeesing workers into 12 hour shifts in coal mines during great depression, I can see that.. a sweet ole grandma selling cookies with girlscouts.. for 50 millions.. nope, doesnt seem .. sorry.<br>
<br>
Point is, upper class in USA doesnt want to work in their lives.. ever, they also would rather that their grandchildren and grandchildren of their grandchildren didnt work either, working is just unpopular for them, its for those that are LAZY that rich people somehow SUPPORTING. This shit always cracks me up btw, the rich that never work, somehow end up SUPPORTING those that work all their lives... I mean.. damn!<br>
<br>
As for jokes about socialism, I prefer 1 about freedom of speech. Russian and American argue who has more freedom of speech, American says:&quot;I can walk before white house and scream president of USA is an idiot, and nobody will stop me&quot;. Russian responds:&quot;so what? I can walk in middle of Red Square and scream president of USA is an idiot and nobody will stop me either&quot;. But then again, bringing political and economical debate down to &quot;MY GRANDMA SAID&quot; or to political jokes is rather gay.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 787<br> <font color=#333333>(5/5/05 4:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=167>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Meh</span><hr size=1> While I agree with Sadko about the ethics in taxing, but disagree with his attack on Daetien's grandparent.<br>

The argument of what is big and what isn't is rhetorical.  Would you presume to create an inheritance tx system that was progressive?  Assets worth &lt; $1M do not get taxed, those that are &gt; $1M but &lt; $10M are taxed at 2%, etc etc etc...?<br>
<br>
What would be the ceiling of the progressive rate?  Would you make it 50%?<br>
<br>
I am confused that you seem to truly believe that anyone that is 'rich' became so by exploiting or walking over those around them.  This is not always (and probably not mostly) ever the case.  Do we have a &quot;Nice guy&quot; meter (paid for by the government, of course!) to determine who was a jerk and should be taxed and who was nice and should be allowed to keep the money?<br>
<br>
Frustration with an idle overclass is a valid point of contention.  But how much of their money do you think we as a society are &quot;entitled&quot; to take as a result?  When will the amount of money extracted be enough to make folks feel as if the overclass has &quot;paid their dues&quot;?<br>
<br>
Remember: We have the society we have because not everyone can be expected to do everything for themselves.  Some can't grow gardens for vegetables, so they rely on others to grow enough vegies for millions of us.  We can't all kill animals, skin them, tan their skins, and make shoes, so we pay someone elese to do it for millions.<br>
<br>
It's obvious to most everyone that they are completely and utterly reliant on others for most of whjat they count on to survive.  This is the society we live in.  THIS IS.  As such, some folks will naturally do less and less and less actual WORK and focus on the other aspects of our society which is namely, TRADE which leads to MONEY which brings us HERE AND NOW.<br>
<br>
Every family, no matter how rich, has someone in their history that busted their butt.  They also have folks that had the good sense to hire the right people to help them increase their fortunes.  Historically, there has been blood on the hands of these folks if for no other reason than ignorance of their actions.<br>
<br>
Should we decimate the fortunes of all the diamond merchants because they deal in a blood-soaked commodity and make their fortuens from it?<br>
<br>
Should we strip housing builders of the profits because they hire laborers at $15/hour rather than at $50/hour?  Could the workers get more elsewhere?<br>
<br>
The endless cycle of trying to redistrbute wealth without any consideration of the consequences is silly at best.  At worst, it's dangerous.  The Bolshevik revolution should be proof enough that people are not able to contain their passions and jealousy <p>Paladin of the Koada'Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 894<br> <font color=#333333>(5/5/05 4:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Werty</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, he probably was not a cookie seller, but a buisnessman, but you can be a buisnessman and still be an OK person.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A VERY valid question in times like these.  Our deficit is exploding and the war in Iraq is far from over.  The push is on RIGHT NOW for one simple reason: Republican majority in both houses of Congress and the Presidency.  THAT is why now.  I do see your point and acknowledge it.  There is no escaping the beauty of simplicity of the need to find a replacement for the money once it is not there anymore.<br>

Inheritance tax is unique for one reason: A person only dies once (hopefuly, right)!  Unlike ANY of those others taxes which can be applied over and over and over again, the inheritance tax truly is a &quot;Death&quot; tax.<br>

<br>
you don't want to believe about the sweet old grandma made 50 million with cookies.. well.. my grandfather made his money in doughnuts... good people can make it big... sure, they might not make the headlines, and it might be more rare, but it does happen.  <br>
<br>
yes, the estate is being split up, quite a bit.  my child will still more than likely have to pay estate tax when i die though (unless they repeal it completely).<br>
<br>
i just brought up the splitting of the estate to bring up a point that hasn't really been considered here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
oh and to clear up how the estate has and will be split  1-grandfather<br>
7-children<br>
26-grandchildren<br>
20-great grandchildren (atm - will grow as more of the grandkids have children)<br>
<br>
yes, it is easy for one estate to be split many many times over.  (oh and i might point out, that my grandfather and grandmother were each 1 of 10 kids, but think about the times when they were born too... well before the pill.. heck my parents siblings were all born before the pill was introduced.. - pill introduced in the 1960's... lots of big families before the 60's.) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.wowrankings.com/viewb.htm?id=20843">Daetien</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

this is how my grandfather did it.<br>
<br>
find a business to get into with a good product to sell<br>
start a franchise.  <br>
work hard. (my grandfather started out making doughnuts by hand 12 hours a day)<br>
maintain quality in the product.<br>
work hard. <br>
treat your customers well.<br>
be honest and build trust.<br>
treat your employees well.<br>
work hard - set a good example for your employees to model their work ethic after.<br>
expand your business into other market areas. (i.e. open more franchises)<br>
work hard and be smart.<br>
have the parent company you work for be bought out.<br>
see that the quality is going down, and unite with some other franchise owners to stop this. <br>
get BIG BIG bank loans, morgage your business, house, car, etc etc as collateral.  <br>
take a HUGE risk but have FAITH it can work.<br>
buy the company from the people who bought it out shortly before (about 2 years after it happened i think in my grandfather's case).<br>
have a lot of LUCK.<br>
now you own a large share in a fairly large company.<br>
since you put in 51% of the money to buy the company - the other franchise owners put up the other half - you have control over the company, and become CEO/president/etc.<br>
maintain the quality of the company.<br>
work hard and maintain trust.<br>
keep employees happy and well paid.<br>
work hard and reward hard work.<br>
expand the business slowly and steadily after paying off the loans.<br>
work hard and pay your debts.<br>
maintain and gain new customers who are fanatically loyal to the company.<br>
work hard and be honest.<br>
after running the company for 10 years, retire.<br>
<br>
tada, you are worth many millions and didn't kill anyone on the way, maintained your ethics, helped others make alot of money too, treated those you work with well, etc, etc.<br>
just takes hard work, honesty, trust, luck, intelligence and a willingness to take a calculated risk.<br>
<br>
(oh and in my grandfather's case the big, big money didn't hit until shortly after he died and the company went public, traded on the nasdaq and now the NYSE.  1 share split 20 ways in the IPO, then split again, then again... so now 1 share then is worth 80 shares today...) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.wowrankings.com/viewb.htm?id=20843">Daetien</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
