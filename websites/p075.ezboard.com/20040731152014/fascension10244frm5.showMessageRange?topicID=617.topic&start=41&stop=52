I retired this is true, more than a year ago, but from my prior experience from beta up until that point I've known treasure and all his toons, and have gone through first hand the trials of numerous top end guilds, from Seekers of Norrath, Mythic Legion, and Vindication (the guild now known as Township Rebellion). <br>
<br>
I see nothing in this application which in my opinion should defer anyone whom satisfied the requirements. Instead I see 1 post, upon which a multitude of decisions have been based, clearly without any consideration for whom this application was originally based. I see post after post of people jumping on a band wagon shouting &quot;yea, I remember now this trivial thing I had forgotten up until now, that agrees with that 1 post.&quot;<br>
<br>
This appears to me as a circus, a show, a drama fest of menstrating little girls. The application was denied immedietly, without any regard for Treasure's sake, or even conference of. It has been a 1 sided issue since Phizle posted an obvious flame towards Treasure. No where do I see any mention of skill, personality, equipment, flags, experience, history, leadership skills, or loyalty. I see 1 post which tarnishes Treasure's conduct in game. And I will not deny that he is in fact extremely hot headed and rash, power hungry and a control freak. But I will also insist that when I knew Treasure, when he played his necromancer on SH, he was probably the only necro who never fd'd in a wall, never went afk on a pull, and refused constantly to demote himself to the lowly position of power twitching. Instead he was always alert, always pounding out spells and filling weak holes, assisting crowd control, and spewing out dps. He carried on whole conversations and arguments with people at the same time as multitasking his character's movements and actions. And I know for sure that at least half a dozen raids would have failed or wiped had he not been present. <br>
<br>
No, what I see here, is a fellow applicant, whom has some personal grudge against Treasure, attempting to sidetrack attention from his application, instead pouring attention into a drama fest. At the same time attempting to suck up to the powers that be by ratting out others, especially with said situation which was employed in the assumtion of privacy through tells. <br>
<br>
Perhaps Treasure approached the situation in some socially unacceptable way, but if this is phizle's form of &quot;Tact,&quot; and is in any way a suggestion of the way EQ will continue to evolve, then this is by far the best medicine to curb me of my desire to return.<br>

For all im cared for go for the class u need fuxx a 2nd enc or another bard or somethin if u need a healer. As for the friend thing, yes they maybe ur friend, but if u already told someone to come and they are there and all of a sudden your like,&quot;no sosorry my friends gonna come instead&quot; thats a lil gimp. <br>
<br>
On the KT issue..that shits been FFA forever. And the &quot;going against other AD thing&quot; is a lil weak. Hell few months back SoD was going for KT and pina/crew where with them but wudan and me got to it first, but since my brother was the first there and he brought peeps it was his raid not mine. Course then we went and did the correct course of action. We invited the ADs from the other raid to join up with us but they were still under Snows lewt discretion. <br>
<br>
However close your friends are in the guild or not, i realy dont like people saying &quot;if u dont wana be kos to AD you betta get out&quot; if u are not tagged. YOUR FRIENDS ARE AD. YOU AINT. And just like was said, its off time not raids, recruits can go chill with whoever they want (barring they arent kos aka curse or somethin). Prime examples are the SoD/AD mini raids.<br>

I first thought that you were the most ignorant person I've seen on the boards.  As I finished your post, I realized that you've just never played on RallosZek, you don't know Ascending Dawn, and you're just blowing wind between the largest two of your four cheeks.<br>
<br>
Unlike $tormhammer, Rallos Zek bases everything on character history, integrety, and reputation.  See, on RZ, if one of your members is an asshole and makes threats to KoS someone, it is a serious threat, ESPECIALLY when flying the AD tag (AD is currently the best geared, highest leveled/AA'd guild on RZ).<br>
<br>
You later posted that Phizle made an &quot;obvious flame&quot; post of Treasure.  I do not see it as a flame at all, though you are correct in stating that his post did not reflect Treasure's skill as a player - because that fact is not questioned.  Treasure's value to the guild and likelyhood to threaten other guilds again while under the AD tag WAS questioned.  The matter is a serious one, as far as online gaming goes.  The person must have a mindset that is for the most part congruent with the guild.<br>
<br>
After this, you claim that Phizle has a grudge against Treasure.  Well, I find this very hard to believe, I know Phizle IRL and we chat on and off about what happens in the game.  He had no grudge at all against Treasure.  He did not even know the person.  Phizle brought the situation up to me, I told him it wasn't a cool thing for Treasure to do, and that he should bring it up to the officers to speak about it, turns out that this is not a one time event.  The officers are the ones that discussed the matter and chose to decline his recruitment.  Not because of Phizle, but because we care about our guildtag and the people that fly it.  We want a good reputation, we are not like &quot;Vindication (The guild now known as TownshipRebellion),&quot; we care about our members and our reputation as a guild.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I notice a sickening trend throughout our modern society as well as in game.  That's the desire to &quot;pass the buck.&quot;  The blame no longer lies at the feet of the people that commit the act, but at the feet of the people that make the act known to the general public.  I would like to believe that people have a duty, a moral obligation, to themselves and to their respective societies to sustain or to improve the current society.  If doing this requires exposure of poor behavior, the blame lies at the feet of the person who has poor behavior and not at the feet of the person that tells what they saw.<br>
<br>
Your comments, while welcome here, are not well thought out, well informed, or well intentioned.  You intended to sling some mud around at a person that did what the officers of the guild he is applying to asked him to do.  (Which BTW sounds like a better way to stay on good terms with AD than helping another recruit kill King Tormax).  I suggest rereading through your own post, especially the part where you say &quot;And I will not deny that he is in fact extremely hot headed and rash, power hungry and a control freak.&quot;  Perhaps that is why he was denied, we finally saw that he was this type of person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daetienofrallos>DaetienOfRallos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 753<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/04 4:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Subject</span><hr size=1> hello Dilandau,<br>
1. there was alot more to this than what appeared on the boards.  much of it was in guildchat and in our ventrillo channel.  <br>
<br>
2. Tcat assumed alot more than he should have when throwing our name around, and we don't like that... he isn't even a recruit yet, just an applicant..  he threatened another applicant .. and this isn't cool by our standards.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. we aren't exactly hurting for members, we can be choose to deny people for ANY reason whatsoever.  we were indifferent to tcat to start with, and some formed a decent opinion of the guy, but some actions of his made others of us form a negative opinion of him...  quite frankly, we have quite a few shaman at the moment and don't really need an applicant who is going to create drama with other guilds..<br>

I believe yuey and I were left out because of previous bad blood between ES and doz.  I think it was Treasure's decision so that there would not be any hard feelings in the group and I do not feel he had malicious intent with it but I see yuey point about wasting his time and mine.<br>
<br>
Sadko...I never had any issues or even said anything about this failed group until now.  You also have to understand that yueyenie sticks by his ideals and his guildie no matter the cost to himself which is why I admire him.<br>
<br>
As far as Tcat being a lootwhore...he is a solo guy trying to improve his char and sometimes that can be difficult and these people who fly solo can be seen as pushy, lootwhoring, or otherwise.  <br>
<br>
I have grouped with sadko to help treasure do his droga ring quest.<br>
<br>
Treasure should never use AD name to influence or attempt to disuade other people.  Of all the things said about him here this is the one thing that I do not like to see...otherwise he is not a bad guy and is a very good shammie.<br>
