(best pvp ever..)</span><hr size=1> Old school UO.  I always loved the days from 97'-99' before the Trammel... Being able to fight duels, have real tournements, hunt pks/ be pkers /thieves, and actually prove yourself...  mostly Pks and griefers will be on this server (no shitty stat loss) so anti's will probably be the weaker team... but its ok.<br>
<br>
New server set up by a bunch of guys who played on Baja (one of the two servers i played on) who were like a pretty elite pvp ring (wtfman - w/ like nighthawk, ronald mcdonald etc)<br>
<br>
Its free, bit laggy i bet, but it holds one of the best ideals for a game, and with the admins actually caring about the game, about 8000 accounts are made, with about 1000 people on at the same time (about the same as a regular shard)...<br>
<br>
Nice little thing to do if you only have 1-2 hours free a day... can macro the rest, and go pvp (modified so that its harder to run away and be a wuss - best part is that Dial up can play too probably)<br>
<br>
Visit their website... i probably wont play a bunch or at all with school, but if you see tom(za) strife or  THe MaN (like my old two names heh) or something like that, might be me... say hi.<br>

Edit: I played Atlantic around the CC/Pluggers era too. I didn't give a shit about those guys though... too many UOP users. I was a dex thief and hung out with the Trinsic Borrowers. When they nerfed thieves is when I quit. Damn though, those are some memories; I think I played UO from ages 12-15...

i remember the goood old days when it first came out... chopping corpses up after luring a bunch of asian guys, who didnt speak english, with a trail of gold coins and slaughting them- archery isnt overpowered like it once was during the 2nd-half of the first year UO came out - and there is always pvp, even at night when you only have like 30 mins to go fight- skill gains are rough, but afk macro owns - no time wasted. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146631">Tomza Strife</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of <br>

My fondest memory is PoDW hacking the UO web site.  Funny.<br>
<br>
But alas, it is hard enough getting the energy to log into EQ, let alone go back to UO, even if it is pre-nerf.<br>
<br>
Viva La Fuckheads.<br>
<br>
TL<br>
<br>
<br>
edit:  I always disagree with people who feel PvP in EQ is lame or dead or UO was the &quot;bestest PvP ever&quot;.  UO PvP was fun because EVERY server was PvP, and guilds competed not by raiding dungeons, but by fighting.  UO was a fun war zone, but the tactics and strategy involved was trivial.  With all the nerfs and boosts, it would be just a matter of days before everyone who was into PvPing was just about identical.  Rampant cheating gave the game a nice gayness quality.<br>
<br>
As far as tactics and strat went UO was about on par with Diablo, and with the varying classes EQ has, I find EQ PvP much more challenging and stimulating.  Of course EQ PvP does have many gay factors as well, like HT, Manaburn, Lifeburn.  There will probably never be a game like UO again, and designers just don't give a shite about PvP, but it would be cool if EQ got a group of PvPers together, mix all their ideas together, and do some heavy changes.<br>
<br>
Oh and one of my fav tactics was similiar to the gold thing.  Place a bag on road near Vesper Xroad.  9 out of 10 times anyone running past would stop to either pick up the bag or look in it.  Jump out, slaughter, Ooo Ooo Ooo.  I only did that in Beta though, back in my dark dickheaded days.  During Beta I became more concerned with beating up the shit talking guilds.<br>
<br>
Favorite punching bags:  LLTS aka The Syndicate and The Mercs,(ninja or nija or whatever his name was, reddogg would know who I speak of, was a supreme shit talker, well every Merc was), and AoD.<br>
<br>
Can't remember fighting Pluggers at all ever, think we were fairly peaceful with one another.<br>
<br>
My guild was small, when I got bored and left those who stayed on ATL joined CC(dolza, angus, maybe couple others it too long ago).<br>
<br>
I always like the old UO players, friend or foe.  The big fights were a blast.  The shit talking was funny.  I can hardly remember anyone's avatar names, hell I can't even remember 50% of the people I was guilded with. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tleqrz>TLEQRZ</A> at: 12/15/03 4:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=awfalxx>awfalxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beauty Queen</span><br>  Posts: 1218<br> <font color=#333333>(12/15/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2430.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ah, those were the days</span><hr size=1> Hi Bytor.

Yea UO pvp was simplistic but it was balanced.

Like I said I can hardly remember any of the people I was hanging around with in UO, even guildmates, unless they actually moved on to EQ.<br>
<br>
If Young was the last name of the Angus who was Covetous Crew, then yes it is the Angus I am refering to.  Otherwise it not.<br>
<br>
The guy who plays Firik was Xero-PoC or Your Master.  There were two Xero's on ATL though.<br>
<br>
We had a tower near Cove(place near the orc fort, whatever it was), I think one of the first towers(I know when we built it there was one castle put up near Britain but no towers around).  Had a ton of fights against LLTS and The Mercs there, who tried to break in.  We had a tamed dragon inside, I remember some Mercs tried to rush in and bam they were dead.  This  back when not many tamed dragons around and their breath attack was nasty.  Sadly though I had only key and my comp died for a week.  By the time I got back, tower decayed and our dragon pet wandered off.<br>
<br>
Best PvP was before the massive melee nerf and when that level 8 or whatever fire blast spell was actually more uber than Corp Por(I remember I had magic reflect on walking with sadko once and some dude fireblasted me and instantly killed himself).  Pretty much all of us were charter so we had about a week to quick make money and advance our skills.  Being a GM swordsman was uber.  I cruised around on horse with halberd.  I get message in IRC that 6 LLTS killed a friend of mine near Orc Fort.  I ride over there, move into Fort, and two hits each with Halberd drops each one.  Then when they ghosts standing their watching, I decide to butcher all their horses as an added effect.<br>
<br>
Cheating sucked though.  Inner Circle was probably the most advanced cheating guild there was.  I remember dying to Dalamar IC I think it was.  He wrestled me to death in two hits, maybe one.  Fairly obvious they were mad cheats, so their confesion months later on I think Lum the Mad's site was not a shocker.  There was basically no way to kill those dudes unless you were a mad cheat as well.<br>
<br>
I still have my old UO comp with hard drive inside it with tons of UO stuff on it, including mass screen shots.  If I ever feel up to it, maybe I will actually hook it up to dig out the old lore I have.  BTW, I was Mistress Tracy Lords, or Tracy Lords, hence the TL, right now.<br>

I can remember fighting all the CC guys, including Tempra.  Fought alot with another guild called SSJ, Gohan and co.  Didn't fight much with the Pluggers, though I did play EQ with Plug when it first came out - dying alot with him in unrest.  LLTS was the big newb guild on ATL, that was for sure, killed countless members.  Thats also where I met Shaoshorty, Srobb, Strydere, Thraax and Flawlex.  <br>
<br>
Long time ago, many fun times in UO...  till they totally nerfed it, making it worse and worse.  Then one day, even though I had 2 7x gm chars, and a relatively decent pk char, I guess I was greedy and got caught macroing yet another char - account banned.  I think I was relieved, I had lost interest at that point, but couldn't let go.  But, I gotta say, UO at its best was the best online game I've played, the pvp was exciting and super fast paced.  Cheers,<br>

They were pretty cool, but one guy flipped out when we got in his castle and looted everything!

UQ did get bad when the cheats got real bad, like fast casting, etc.  But EQ is getting that way too with the speed hacks and others.  PvP in eq was never very good because of the class differences.

You remember Louse/cherryrush/Wisteria or lice/Parasite at all? I think Tate (Parasite) may have been a friend of yours. I was Louse and Morbid Death (my shitty Dread Lord archer until rep patch) until my sister quit, when I scrapped Morbid and macroed Wisteria up instead. cherry was my dex murderer.<br>
<br>
I was an ok pvper, but admittedly I mostly fought people who were far less skilled or prepared than myself (mostly did Leiah's Rune Library ganks with Parasite; I owned a group of 7 houses right next door to it). I never died as any of my statloss characters though so I guess I could be considered smart in that regard. Parasite was a good pvper, but he fought battles he couldn't win (hackers, UOP EB chainers, etc.) a lot and had to take statloss resses often.<br>
<br>
Funny, Tempra... I had a provocation murderer named Traci Lords. And as for Drako Prime, maybe Neitschze would ring more of a bell; that was his Order dexer. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 12/16/03 2:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sineaii>Sineaii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(12/16/03 9:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2430.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: was fun</span><hr size=1> Morb, most of those names ring a bell.  I knew lots of people in UO.  But most of my fighting was done in shame poison elemental room with CC (Metaxa - RIP, Tempra, etc), SSJ, and that Danish guild which I can't remember the name of.  I can remember always staying close to that 5 kill limit to make me a murderer, and often turning red for 8 hours at a time.  Was always so happy to come back to PC and see my ghost blue again :-)   Lots of people were always crying about pks, but, I never had a problem with pks, they made the game much more exciting.  Stat loss was the harshest blow dealt to the overall fun of the game.<br>
<br>
Shao (the char he used was Sir Robb, which was Srobb's character that they shared, as his own was stat lossed pk which he gave up on) and I used to take turns going grey, then run around various dungeons to see who we could get to attack us.  And the funny thing was, even though Shao was wickedly laggy, and was playing on a lap top, he won the majority of his fights.  It was crazy, he would be obviously laggier than his super fast connection/pc opponent, yet he still managed to best them.  He just had great skill and timing.  I miss him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I had met Strydere long before that even, he was the first UO friend I made really, when even I was still sort of newb.  Miss him to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I hope they're all doing well.<br>
<br>
I remember also my first meeting with Nimade (he had various characters such as, Kusa, Saku, ShaDow), he was trying to pk me and some friends.  Went on to become a really good friend, who took such great care of me when I was in Vancouver.  One of the most selfless and generous people I've ever met.  It's kind of funny because I almost never got the chance to befriend him, and would have remained enemies if not for a friend, TAMAGOTCH, convincing me that he wasn't a bad guy.<br>

<br>
I remember if you killed people you became red named? and you were like &quot;murderer&quot; or something?<br>
<br>
But I don't think I was even on ATL when that happened, think I had moved to Catskills by then, and I played some on Sonoma cuz Fuckheads moved there.<br>
<br>
I left pretty much soon after Covetous Crew was formed.  A few of my guildmates were excited about that guild, mainly the ones who stayed behind like Dolza and Angus and joined them.  I never got into it.  Like I said earlier, I liked a good strategic and tactical fight in my PvP.  I can remember one night they were going to do a seek and destroy mission in, well, Covetous, so my guild went there(Priests of Chaos).<br>
<br>
A dude opened a portal and in we went, and it was just a slaughter.  There wasn't a single thing tough about it.  I don't know if there was a spy or just dumb luck but another guild happened to either port in or be running in right after we destroyed people, so we killed some of them and they ran off.<br>
<br>
It was a fairly large battle, and back in those days a large scale fight like that would probably get my heart beating a little quick and the adrenaline rushing, but none of that happened, it was just so easy, even when the other PvP guild came in to fight us.  I remember typing in IRC to my guild at just how easy and almost boring it was.<br>
<br>
I was already disappointed with the nerfs and the trivial PvP, and I really hated the fact Origin never did a single thing about the GM in a day bug or at that time had the manpower or motivation to do anything about cheating.<br>
<br>
With the Fuckheads gone from ATL and all those other aspects, when Sadko said &quot;lets move to Catskills to get away from stupid GM in a day bug&quot; it was easy for me to agree.  Had we remained everything to this day would have took a drastic change, as odds are my guild would of merged into CC, like those who remained did, and then my EQ career would have been totally different.  But no regrets, we were small and powerful and as it turned out anyway it was the CC people who talked me into going to EQ.  I only wish I listened to Dolza as my original main was a cleric who told me &quot;make a bard&quot;.  But it still okay I got hooked up with Tempra when he decided to quit and I rock in druid PvP.<br>
<br>
UO was a lot of fun but I still think EQ PvP is more challenging.  They just need actual PvPers to go through and refine it.  That is one thing that pisses me off creating another PvP server when they should be talking to PvPers and fixing the current PvP they have now.<br>
<br>
I think I remember that mungilla or whatever name that was mentioned.  I am kinda actually thinking about digging out my old UO hard drive now and finding what hidden treasures I may have.<br>

<br>
First Online Game I ever played was UO.  I had just bought my first PC (I386, 64 MB ram, 4 gig HD, Win95), Aol had just gone to unlimted monthly hours online, I was newly assigned to my first duty station, and being in the field for weeks at a time.  <br>
<br>
I remember getting UO the first day it hit the shelves, firing it up (after waiting for prob 15 mins of sitting there trying to get connected to aol), making a character, seeing the world open up for the first time, somehow finding the bank and- promptly got my stuff gone thru and ripped off while i watched my bags being open, to which I turned around and tried to do the exact same thing to semeone else: few millisecs later *boom* i had tasted my first Town guard death and was &quot;oOooOOing&quot; to the nearest shrine.  Promptly tried to run out and take on a deer after that and score my first kill, needless to say the deer won after I couldnt move becuase my stam ran out.<br>
<br>
I remeber on my first successful run to another town finding some poor slobs corpse on the path, I sueryed that for a trap for prob 5 mins before i got my biggest winfall of the game, potions, gold and other misc stuff, hell I was rich.  I was equiped for my first Dunegon Excursion.  To make a long story short i died badly that first trip, got stuck on a bad Z axis as well and couldnt get to my corpse (UO sucked on the z axis too).  Lol i remeber yelling a storm up, packing the game up, typing up a letter to the makers and mailing it back; and later getting a full refund.  Months later after being bitten by concept thats somehow gotten to a bit of each of us, single player games jsut suck I rebought it.  <br>
<br>
Things had changed a bit, maybe i guess they got a bit less chaotic, guilds had formed beyond those that came to the game in organizations before and.  I remeber getting recruited into a guild, sharing my first house with a few peeps, realizing what all the skills did, how to raise them, how to balance them out.  Think that was the first cycle of the decline of the tank mage, Archer casters were coming into reign just about then so thats what I made.  <br>
<br>
Met Sir Srobb (dude seemed to have multi personalities ;p), and later Mungila in Shame....Was funny, whenever certain personalities were down there, an uneasy sort of balance and order were present, meaning people didnt just randomly kill each other when your health got low enough for a quick kill.  <br>
<br>
I went from invisible obersever in the Invis/Shame Archer wars to ranging far and wide, laughing hysterically at some of the ingeunise ways in which other people concocted to entrapp and torment theyre fellow man (or woman).  To camping decaying towers, to ambushing pks, to standing agasint the lighting strikes of different organized PK crews as CC and the others, to T Map Hunter, even trying my hand on the darker side, but by then the Whole faction blue/red/grey thing kinda sucked so bad it wasnt worth it.<br>
<br>
It was hard leaving it, I miss the earlier years of it, I did enter it late, but I met a lot of people, had a lotta good times and god damn camping shiot for hours was unheard of.  Saw this post orginally and went and looked at what they were offering there, it was tempting too......<br>
