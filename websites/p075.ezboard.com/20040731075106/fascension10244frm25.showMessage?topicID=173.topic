MiM at first attempted and agreed to political solutions to the growing tensions mostly revolving around Bastion of Thunder.  With minor conflicts and trash talk from both guilds brewing for a few weeks, the guild officers on both sides responded to slow to the escalating conflict, and eventually one night an incident occurred that would lead to the outbreak of war.  Like most events, each party had their own story, and while officers communicated with one another, apparently reaching a peaceful solution, the following day MiM decided to strike a “Pearl Harbor” attack and declare war.<br>
<br>
Regardless that this is a PvP server, the majority of players steer clear of PvP if they have the chance.  Thus it was no surprise that MiM offered up an “out” tactic, making a small list of perma-kos or players who had to “buy” their way off KoS, and everyone else could “go free” by simply deguilding.  With it obvious that players who do not enjoy PvP sure to deguild, most believed the guild Destiny of Zek would thus drift away, and as people negotiated their status, MiM claims victory.  This, however, is not the case.<br>
<br>
A small band of us have united together and continue the fight.  Originally when the guild was first disbanded(in order to keep people who didn’t know what was going on or had not logged on for a few to become unwillingly KoS), I had planned on recruiting an army to fight against MiM.  I had written up the recruitment, rules, and goals of the Army.  It was not to be a guild under normal circumstances.  No large scale raiding, simply a PvP guild of people willing to fight non-stop if needed.  Only raiding for the purposes of flagging for more zones to war in and mini raiding for spells, etc.  I had also originally planned that once the war was over, the “guild” would be disbanded, but in recent times I have been witness to activities and actions, which have since changed my mind.<br>
<br>
Loyalty, friendship, honor, truth…virtues that appear a rare find in Everquest.  Guilds are formed, people come and go, friends become enemies.  For the most part, greed for loot is the main cause of defections.  Strong guilds fight against this, with strict recruitment process, wanting people who will not only “raid” but also defend the guild from potential attack.  It is not hard to tell who your true friends are.  The people who stand with you through the most difficult times are those whose friendship you should value most.  Those who stick with you only through the good and easy times, but leave you behind when the going gets tough are those who should be avoided.<br>
<br>
Thus, I am recruiting an Army to battle MiM, but I plan on taking it farther.  I believe the best guilds are formed with those who share similar beliefs and goals.  The fact that we are instantly at war means those who join have already shown themselves willing to fight and defend one another.  The backbone of this guild will be brotherhood.  The guild will not be disbanded at the conclusion to this war, because I believe through this guild we can form a strong bond.  If members wish only to join for the PvP and move back to a raiding guild afterwards, they are free to go, and always they will be remembered for the brother they were, who fought side by side under a united flag.<br>
<br>
Rules for recruitment:<br>
<br>
If you are currently a member with another guild you are welcome to join the war.  You must take the proper steps with your current guild officers and leader.  You will be going off to war and PvP.  The decision of if you will be allowed back into your guild at the end of the war is up to them, and thus the decision if you decide to leave your guild under those circumstances are up to you.<br>
<br>
All players interested in joining must be level 60+ and you come in with your own equipment.  Do not expect or demand help with quests, gear, etc.  During downtimes, we may offer up help with things or give advice on small crew quests/raids that could help with your equipment, but for the most part, we will just be fighting.  We do want you geared for PvP combat, so for people with the will to fight, but who lack some essentials, as brothers we will help when time is available to do so.<br>
<br>
If you have KoS issues with another guild(except MiM), you must first clear those issues before you will be allowed entrance into the army.  You must inform me of the guild(s) you were KoS with, so that I may double check that you are now non-KoS.<br>
<br>
No random PKs will be allowed entrance.  The only rare exception would be if you can somehow clear your KoS issues as being a random PK, but that also means you have to clear KoS with the Army itself, because we are Anti-Pk.  We are not the Foreign Legion, joining us does not give you a fresh start or wipe your past record clean.<br>
<br>
You will not bring personal grievances with you into the Army against another member of the Army.  Once you join, you are considered a brother, and you will thus treat each other accordingly, and your brothers are expected to do the same.  We will be fighting together, side by side, and all that is expected of you is to fight and defend your new brothers.  If you have a serious grievance with someone, then bring it to me and it will be discussed in a civilized manner until a resolution is reached that satisfies both individuals.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in joining the Army and are interested in having fun with PvP, and you have read and understand what is required, or if you have any questions, you may send me a tell in game.  I will keep all such inquiries secret, so if you decide not to join, it will bring no heat upon you from MiM.<br>

We are warring MiM.  I have no problem fighting them with the small number we have now, however it just wouldn't be as fun without recruiting other players, who may be bored with current EQ status, dislike some factions of MiM, and most importantly, like to PvP.<br>
<br>
All of us are old Diablo/UO players, games that IMO, were PvP.  RZ is our home, because in EQ, it was the only way we could PvP at the time.<br>
<br>
I am working on posting this message to a variety of guild boards, because it wouldn't be recruitment if people didn't know it was going on.  However, I ask permission from guilds before posting it.  Last night I asked Adell and she said okay, but said another officer may move it, I said okay that is fine.<br>
<br>
If players are interested they may contact me in game.<br>

Lucid Vision was part of a raid group called the Conclave.  They were anti (or neutral).  Conclave warred the begotten over a ragefire ganking and Mangar let the raid group use his guild for guildchat (and to bolster his sadly lacking ranks).  After losing many people to umm...&quot;inner turmoil&quot; that that the war caused, LV decided they didn't like EQ anymore and moved to DAOC.  After a couple of months there they returned to EQ as random PK's, since they were fussy after getting run off the server. <br>

Reason I wanted to post this is because AD board is probably one of the most viewed message boards for RZ.<br>
<br>
I've been around for a long time, and I have a lot of friends in AD, whose times I played with them I still value the most.  In fact, the best &quot;Raids&quot; I ever went on was with them, and it wasn't because of &quot;phat loot&quot; it was just fun shiz.  I have a few old screen shots of these raids, course back then it was Sabbat, but all my old House friends who were there are now AD.<br>
<br>
I find it an insult that MiM people claim we will go PK or whatever.  I have always been Anti-PK, even though the friends who got me into EQ from CC were I guess considered &quot;PK&quot;, I consider them PvPers, and most the time they just warred certain peeps, like Pluggers, The Mercs, etc.<br>
<br>
Now I did do my little newbie &quot;Pking&quot;, but my newb pking days were playing an alt while I waited for my friends from UO to level up so we could do things together.  I saw a post here or on MiM board talking about the &quot;Short Militia&quot;.  I had my lowbie pk in that guild, but back when I started it was mainly limited to misty thicket, it was all haflings, we were level 8-14, and I used to roleplay it out as protecting the &quot;Wall&quot; from evil outsiders(even though not everyone else did it).  I got involved in it because at first, I was against them and fighting them, then I just thought it was really fun diversion so I made a druid and joined them.  In fact, there is at least one person from AD, one of my favorite leveling partners back in the day, who also for a short time played around with the Short Militia, but his lil alt was a gnome...bah.  If you read this bud, leveling back in the gorge was fun, those minotaurs used to be bad ass..<br>
<br>
Of course back in those days many high level people had lowbie alt pks, I am sure there are many today who do.  And while I stopped my lowb pking in the Short Militia when they got people higher level(20-30) and a lot of non-hafling(all non hafling were supposed to die!), I also remember another crew similar to Zigen, Tewini, and Xengi(who all had high level alts), and that was the Gnomebinos.  Gnomebinos were alts to the likes of Xein and Lugoj, and I use to fight them sometimes Short Militia vs. the Gnomebinos.  Little lowbie PvP was fun, and it was always fun when the people in the thicket started chasing us around.  Now it just isn't the same, with all the expansions people twink out their little lowbies in high end droppable gear like click dd wands and such.  Hell, part of the fun was when the citizens of Rivervale created a posse to chase us down and try to kill us.  Running around as a near unkillable just takes out half the thrill of the pursuit.<br>
<br>
I have a few screen shots from those days of yore.  I found two of particular liking and put em up on a crap geocities page.  I don't like geocities because it limits the number of times a page can be viewed in an hour, so I am working on xfering all that junk to another site.<br>
<br>

But I digress...I just wanted to let you (TL not Critchy, whoever you are) know that *I* am impressed that someone wants to make a guild for the sole purpose of killing *my* guild.  I can't see it being too much of an interesting time, but to each his/her own.  It's your 12 bucks.  Good luck with the recruiting.

I probably gathered more kills of PKs in one week than you have in your entire EQ career.  I have no desire to ever turn ganking PK, but if I did then I guess I would be friends of MiM, seeing how they have their PK Pal Society.<br>
<br>
I don't post on message boards.  Only time I ever posted on AD board was when they had the problems with some DoS people, and I made one post during that conflict.  I got tired of message board warriors back in beta UO, I speak with my in game actions.<br>
<br>
As far as creating a guild goes, it has already been created, and I have no problems PvPing you guys the rest of my EQ career.  I don't care about seeing some big mob fall to the ground, I only care about loyalty to my friends.<br>

I myself have rooted/stunned you to death many times recently while other guildies beat your char into a bloody pulp<br>
<br>
MiM was formed as a PVP guild. It has existed for 5 years as a tight knit grou of friends with a VERY high pvp background. And a very anti oriented stance on pk's<br>
<br>
Your chances against my guild are how shall i say it nicely. NONE NADDA ZERO!!!!!<br>
<br>
As for your posts. They provide a sense of humor while im at work or in class.<br>
<br>
If you can pull off this &quot;Anti MiM&quot; guild more power too you. We seem to have old members start crawling out of the woodwork when pvp starts up. If you think you can break MiM then you really need to take another look at the situation.<br>
<br>
But if you enjoy a futile goal which will cause you to loose interest in the game then well.

I don't stoop to the lower than PK..yes, lower than PK tactic of corpse camping naked people.  Most PKs don't even, nor did they ever do that, only on rare occassion did a PK stick around to kill me naked if he killed me.  Recently we have started CCing you when we can, because MiM will swarm to a zone if they kill one of us, and attempt to CC non stop.  So you started the CCing/Zone camping, we will fight back with the same when we can if that is the kind of battle you wanted to fight.<br>
<br>
Brannd and Glor suicided into your lynch mob who camped a zone in, camped a graveyard.  I can see you boasting about that though, for it is the extent of your PvP abilities.  I can count on my fingers the MiM I have fought who actually have PvP skill.<br>
<br>
Semmy.  Semmy is a smart and knows what he doing PvPer.  Hesikth isn't bad, we have had good sparring one on one, I know a couple times if he hadn't run for the wind or he didn't get backup he be dropped, but he is decent.  K that about all I can think of.<br>
<br>
Those are not all the killshots I have of MiM.  I'll have to remember to start including the naked ones too, seeing how in MiM eyes, those count, but I get kinda bored going through and changing from bitmap to jpeg and uploading pics.<br>
<br>
If your guild is so anti-orientated why do your guildmates sit and relax with random portal ganking pks?  The people in MiM I have talked to about it say they are &quot;neutral&quot; and will attack only when it suits them.  Want to compare PK kill shots?  I have about a 100 of those, but I have more respect for pks from a battle stand point, because I never met a PK who thought PvP skill was camping a zone in or corpse for 3 hours.<br>
<br>
I know how to fight a war.  UO was a constant war zone, and you died there, you lost everything.  This is just a walk in the park for me.  You should also pay attention to the history of warfare, as you are begining to make the most vital of errors.<br>
<br>
I'll remember when you die that CCing is viable kill in your eyes.  See you on the battlefield gimp lord.<br>
