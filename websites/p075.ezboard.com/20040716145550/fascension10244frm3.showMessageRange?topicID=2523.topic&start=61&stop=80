&quot;We know not, but the rangers will not rest till we know master&quot;<br>

The dwarves expression tightened. Pausing for thought he whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;The matter must be resolved before the Mistress finds out, or the heads of the defilers will not be the only ones to roll this season&quot;. <br>
<br>
The silence confirmed the dwarves words. Almost invisible traces of frost on their breaths suggesting they were being watched with an icy gaze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our warriors are mighty but they are old. They have families and responsibilities. Our crusades require planning, and long communications with our allies to coordinate our efforts and share the rewards. We will not stand for continued disruption of our plans.&quot;<br>

&quot;Perhaps a warning m'lord?&quot;<br>

&quot;They were warned&quot;<br>

&quot;This is the forth such incident, lad. It is easy to steal eggs from the birds nest when she defends her nest with her song and not her claws.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Until the new moon, for two dozen days and two dozen nights, the heads of those who seek to undermine us will fall like rain upon the lands of Norrath. Perhaps the rhythm of sword on sword will serve somewhat to lull my anger.&quot;<br>

Was having a little difficulty getting access.<br>
<br>
My name is Trefellgion (tref to my friends) and I just wanted to post, and thank all those who have shown their support for our guild.  I'm proud to have been in COTW now for 4+ years on this char and my ranger.<br>
<br>
As an officer, i'd like to let you all know, that dispite Wudan's &quot;war&quot; with us, we've had ZERO people leave the guild over this issue,  altho I've noticed that Wudan can't say the same.<br>
<br>
Our guilds morale is HIGH, and we're actually having allot of fun.  We've sorta made a game out of the war that I like to call  &quot;WUDAN FOR BUCKS!!&quot;   (or bowling for wudan, but that's not as catchie!)  Points are awarded for each kill or assisted kill (they sorta have an advantage in gear lol),  officer kill and  guildleader kill (tho she's not shown her face in a pvp zone that we can enter).  Surprizingly,  the points are wracking up for some of our members, and we're trying to think of a suitable prize for the winner!<br>
<br>
<br>
But seriously,  I'm still confused over the &quot;4&quot; issues that our guild has been charged with, as this past saturday's TT kill was our first (maybe they count Rhag 1 and 2, AL and vindi as thier mobs that permission is required to kill and POJ trial mobs (the only POP mobs we've done allot of lately)).  <br>
<br>
Some things that have come out, false statements,  hearsay, and direct lies have brought us to this point.  We know were they come from, and who are friends are, and will remember long after this has passed.<br>
<br>
If Needra were realy the &quot;peace maker&quot; she likes to make herself out to be, she would have checked with our guild leader Raveena about some issues PRIOR to jumping the gun and making war.  Instead she spoke to me and when I told her rave was beside me in rl and logging on, she declined to speak with her and logged of.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for provided a place for me to vent alittle bit, since Wudan's boards are well..... you know hehe.<br>
<br>
Trefellgion<br>
Officer, COTW<br>

know mater if its AD, MIM, Wudan or a pickup raid, the only way to truly claim a mob is to be there in force.<br>
<br>
unless you supply everyone with a server wide msg. or away for all who  r able to do the mob, away of knowing u intend to do the the mob on a certain date with in reason, or otherwise  all mobs r fair game.<br>
<br>
But if your guild  knows that another is planing to do the mob and u run there the day before and kill the mob, well thats just wrong and your guild should be slaughtered.<br>

<br>
from what i gather. ( and this is from memory, read some posts yesterday, some today, and might be off on some things a  bit, but i don't think so)<br>
<br>
1. cotw had access to the boards, but didn't realize they were used anymore.<br>
<br>
2. fusion had asked for access at some point - brolly did this - but didn't get in because of a problem with the email address he used.  - he apparently didn't get informed that he had a problem with his email address and thus he didn't get access.  this is why fusion are claiming they were denied from the rotation boards.<br>
<br>
3. TT is a FFA mob that people on the board schedule kills of so as to not step on each others toes.  since fusion didn't have access due to a problem with the email address and this problem having gone unfixed, fusion didn't know wudan had it schedules.  cotw had access but didn't realize they were still in use after the velious rotation broke down due to some guilds not respecting the rotation, and thus didn't check the rotation board to see if it was scheduled by anyone.<br>
<br>
4. fusion had a problem with CE in the past before with the killing of TT, and CE told fusion that if fusion killed TT on wudan's turn again (rotation here?) that wudan would kos fusion.  note - wudan didn't tell fusion they would kos them. CE told fusion that wudan would kos them(fusion) if they did it again.  fusion correctly said that if wudan had a problem with them killing TT then a wudan officer should speak on wudan's behalf, not CE.  -<br>
<br>
 edit in. wudan apparently did warn fusion directly about killing mobs. ealill did send a tell to brolly.  this information from mearis's log he showed me. &quot;&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:49:44 2003] Brolly tells you, 'heheh i like your tell better then ealill's he just said we demand you ask us before hand or you will be &quot;penalized&quot;'&quot; . this bit comes from an irc conversation mearis and i just had.  brolly refers to the tell he had from ealill about a previous incedent from over a month ago.<br>
<br>
more from mearis's log.<br>
<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; Tue Dec 09 23:48:58 2003] You told brolly, 'the rotation board does not specify a specific order for pop content <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   mostly we just post our intention to kill xx mob on yy day to not step on each other's day'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:49:08 2003] You told Needra, 'no I would definite it more a gentleman's agreement'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:49:28 2003] Needra tells you, 'thats all i want to know'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:49:44 2003] Brolly tells you, 'heheh i like your tell better then ealill's he just said we demand you ask us before hand or you will be &quot;penalized&quot;'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:58:11 2003] You told brolly, 'we have a board on the sodboard - if you post on our public board we can give you access'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:58:33 2003] Brolly tells you, 'what is the address? and does wudan check there also?'<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:58:40 2003] You told Brolly, 'www.eqseekers.com - and yup<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:59:00 2003] Brolly tells you, 'ok cool thanks cuz again ealill telling me they want us to check with them before killing anything '<br>
&lt;Mearis&gt; [Tue Dec 09 23:59:09 2003] You told Brolly, 'great then'<br>
<br>
5. apparently there are 2 other instances beyond this where there was a problem with fusion and pop mobs, but no one has mentioned what those 2 other instances were that i noticed.<br>
<br>
6. this was fusion/cotw's first raid together.  <br>
<br>
7. some wudan members were along for the TT kill with fusion/cotw and they DID NOT MENTION that wudan had it planned.<br>
<br>
8 there is apparently a post on the rotation board that wudan did have it planned, and while i don't have access to the board, i'll believe the people who said there is a post. <br>
<br>
9. cotw had nothing to do with the other 3(?) episodes involving fusion and the rotation(scheduling?) of mobs that were signed up for by someone else who had access to the board when fusion didn't(either through lack of knowledge of the board in the first place, problem with the registration, or lack of knowledge of which mobs were actually scheduled on the boards)<br>
<br>
10. prior to the kill there was some confusion as to if it was alright to kill TT or not, but in the end the all clear to kill was sounded and the raid proceeded. (kinda fuzzy on this one) <br>
<br>
these are 10 of the &quot;facts&quot; that i've discerned from this whole ordeal.<br>
<br>
to me it seems like wudan stepped quite a bit over the line in kosing fusion/cotw - cotw especially.  basicly however it just boils down to a lack of communication between the guilds who had access to the boards and used them, and cotw/fusion.  the members of the boards who use them assumed cotw still read the boards and thus should know. cotw thought the board was dead and therefore had no reason to read the board.  fusion didn't have access to the board, through some technical foulup on brolly's part, and that foulup going unfixed, and thus didn't know that it was planned by wudan.  somehow there was some confusion over what was ok to kill that night as they had tt, gummus, and soemthing else planned, but others had planned grummus, but apparently fusion/cotw recieved in their eyes the all clear to kill TT.  they killed TT, with some wudan members being present and the wudan members DID NOT MENTION that wudan had it planned.  wudan shows up to kill TT, finds it dead and that cotw/fusion killed it and declares a war on them.  <br>
<br>
this is a comedy of errors on multiple people's fault, but again assumptions and lack of communication fouled it up.<br>
<br>
TT is apparently a FFA mob however and isn't rotated, and thus fusion/cotw was well within their rights as guilds on this server to kill TT as they got there first, even though wudan had mentioned to some others that they wanted to kill TT.<br>
in the end since its a FFA mob, i can find nothing really wrong with fusion/cotw killing TT.  wudan can war them for any reason they want, but the reason stated doesn't match with the &quot;facts&quot; i've put together. <br>

edit in. the one question i really want answered. - did fusion KNOW that this was Wudan's Terris spawn, that wudan had claimed it.  ( i can't see any guild asking an officer of another guild if it was ok for them to kill every single mob they wanna kill.. - which is what brolly seemed to hint as what ealill requested they do in his(brolly's) tell to mearis)  if wudan told fusion that it was their spawn, (other than on a message board fusion didn't have access to) then fusion, as a guild trying to get into the board should have respected the wishes of wudan and not killed it.  if fusion on the other hand was never informed that it was wudan's spawn then they had every right to treat it as a FFA spawn and did no wrong in killing it..<br>
<br>
btw. &lt;3 ez board.. no stupid 5k character limit in posts.<br>

can you reserve a 3 day spawn mob 2 weeks in advance or even a week inadvance? especially if its a ffa and then claim it was your mob after is has been up for 2 days and have it scheduled for 2 days later.<br>
Come on its a 3 day spawn make sense.<br>
<br>
Wudan are you telling me you cant run in there in down time to check if the mobs up and then form a raid to kill it?<br>
I cant get enough to kill it on the week day so I have to kill it on the weekend, but I do go in kill enough mobs tillI can track it.<br>

It sums up about Effectively 99% of the deal.<br>
<br>
Now CoTW new representant + No Tears Guild leader and soon a Fusion officer is joining this board, so i hope in the future this will no more happen.<br>
<br>
As most of PoP is on a 3 day spawn, each can have a turn on each mob easily just need to fix dates and plan it in advance...<br>

Its a shame their scope does not seem to extend beyond 'their world'. This would be perfectly acceptable behavior if I were at home playing GTA 3 on the PS2. Funny how they dont have a public message board or a listing of any of these arbitrary rules that seem to only come up when dealing with lower tiered guilds. My experiences with Wudan have been mixed. I have both friends and enemies in Wudan. But leadership has consistantly been disrespectful to us, many times even against the objections of their own members. Its a wonder how a guild even functions with management that shows such disdain for others even the ones they are there to serve. <br>
<br>
These views are my own and are not represented by my guild in any way. But I'd gladly disband to be kos to you just to take this opportunity to say from the very bottom of my heart,  this is bullshit and you can french kiss my ass right on the hole.<br>
