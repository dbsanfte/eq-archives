<br>
I, Salvador, have decided to apply for Ascending Dawn, as it is time that Drattsab (My Cleric) finds a permanent home.  I love my class, I love to play him, and I'm ready to test my skills with the best of the best.  I've decided to apply for AD because I want to try out for the best.  The following reasons are why AD should consider my application for recruitment:  I like my class (period), I have a good history with RZ, my playtimes PST Mon-Fri (4pm-12pm) and Sat&amp;Sundays (12am-12pm), I don't talk shit aloud or complain about getting pked, I'm honest about my history (good or bad), and I can get to any zone on my own without a port or loc.<br>
<br>
To begin, I play a cleric named Drattsab.  He is currently level 65 with 22AAs, 3 unspent.  I recently acquired my cleric from a friend in Celestial Empire, who had exped Drattsab to level 51 before I took over.  It's been one month since Drattsab has been restarted (after a year long break), and I am already 65.  I had recently applied for CE, but my application was denied.  <br>
Link to my denied CE application:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub134.ezboard.com/fcelestialempirefrm2.showMessage?topicID=365.topic">pub134.ezboard.com/fceles...=365.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
For those of you who do not with to click on the link, I'll sum up the reason as to why CE denied my application.  I was a rare sight to see at raids during my recruitment and the decision to deny my app came as a result of ignoring a direct raid call.  I spoke with Bollix after his decision to deny my application, and it ended peacefully.  In defense, I applied for CE on the first day I returned to EQ at level 51.  The minimum requirements for a Cleric in CE was 55, so I exped fast!  But I didn't stop at 55, I kept going, I kept exping in LDONs/BoT/PoV.  As you can imagine, I didn't do much else but EXP in that time, thus my lack of raid attendance and the result of my denied application.<br>
<br>
In contrast, I had a good reputation with Celestial Empire a year ago when I was an officer of CE.  One reason I chose to apply for CE so soon was because of my history with the guild and the friends I had in it.  My Cleric's name was Savioriana Medicina, 56 Cleric.  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://ralloszek.stephans.org/rz/playerhistory.php?player_name=Savioriana">ralloszek.stephans.org/rz...Savioriana</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  She is no longer around because my account was banned for Corpse Camping on one of my lowbie PvP alts.  Instead of starting a new account again, I took a break for a year.  So when I was offered the cleric account, I hopped right back on the Cleric playing train I was on before, and here I am!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
So here I am, and I'm playing again...  a lot!  My playtimes are after school hours, which is 4pm to bed Time on Weekdays, and pretty much all weekend long.  Recently I've been spending some time camping Lucid Shards, because it was a requirement for CE.  When I get bored I'll sell Temp/Virtue in PoK until I find a LDON group.  I prefer High Risk LDONs... my record is currently 6 and 2.  I do alright for having FT3 and SCM3.  And when the going gets tough, the tough gets going, and I don't mind dying, it's apart of EverQuest.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I don't mind getting pked.  Well, I hate to die, who doesn't?  But, if I get killed, oh well... shit happens.  What the hell can I do?  Do my best to get the hell out of the situation, DA and run, Heal myself, dispell just to be a nuisance, and die while weilding my Hammer of Damnation in a fit of swinging glory.<br>
<br>
And finally, I can get to any zone you want me to get to, on my own!  I have jboots and a rope horse, I can get to any zone on my own without the assistance of the guild, except for maybe the Emerald Jungle...  even then I could just pay for a port from someone else.  Point is, I don't need help getting anywhere.  I carry invisible potions and pumice in case of mobs and PvP.  I usually don't die on traveling unless I'm ganged up on.  My resists (with buffs) are all over 100, and it's enough to get me from place to place without dying.  <br>
<br>
I hope you all consider me as a recruit, and I'm up for LDONs and exping with you guys.  I didn't get to 51-65 in a month by being a piece of shit cleric.  I'm on a lot of peoples friends list for LDONing, Exping, and Rezzing.  I hope you all give me the opportunity to be a recruit for AD and I'll see you all in game.  If you'd like more information contact me in game or ask a question here.  Thanks, see you in game.<br>

I met Kamaa about almost 3 years ago in Lower Guk.  He was not a member of CE at the time, and he had been hunting in Lower Guk (live side).  Him and players who have now become my circle of friends in EQ needed assistance retreiving their corpses, and I helped them through the maze of Lower Guk.  A few months later he was a member of CE.  He and I have spoken on the telephone and have exchanged addresses.  We talk about real life and our situations, so I'd say I know him fairly well...  <br>
<br>
However, the account wasn't originally Kamaa's, it was his real life friend's who had started EQ with him (4 years ago).  But his friend lost interest EQ and left it entirely almost as soon as he he started his account.  Kamaa had been in possesion of the account and used Drattsab mainly for rezing himself and his friends in game.  Drattsab was not active, persay, until I let Kamaa know I was interested in returning to EQ.  He offered the Cleric (since the class was my main before), and I took it.<br>
