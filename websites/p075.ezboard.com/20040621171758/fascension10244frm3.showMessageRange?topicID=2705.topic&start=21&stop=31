<br>
And if you want to get technical then prisoners have been murdered in the prison by soldiers.  Maybe they weren't dismembered and hung from bridges but they were actually killed.  <br>
<br>
So what's your point?  And the only reason a big deal was made over this is because of U.S. media.  Go figure.      <br>

The Abu Ghriab prison pics are definately a black mark against the U.S., and it will take a lot of positives to erase that tragedy.  However, in no way does this compare to the years of terrorism, killings, dismemberings, mass-killing of their own people, televised executions, kidnappings, etc. that Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, etc,  have been doing in just the last few decades.  Let's try to keep that incident in perspective and remember who the good guys are here. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146302" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/vansig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

They aren't getting revenge, they aren't in the heat of battle. They are methodically and calmly torturing helpless prisoners.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you didn't know I will let you know.  During the first Gulf War I was briefly a part of a unit call POP, or Psy Ops Printing, what we did was we printed brochures and pamphlets in Arabic that the Air Force would routinely drop on Iraqi villages.  The pamphlets said all sorts of things, but believe it or not most of them were warnings.  The pamphlets would say, &quot;The U.S.A. will bomb [this] area tommorrow beginning at 10 A.M. please take as many of your necessary belongings as possible and evacuate the area, for we do not wish you harm.&quot;    Not only did this server the purpose of warning innocents and getting them out of harms way, but believe it or not many Iraqis I sopke too respected us greatly for it.  This is just one example of what Psy Ops does.  Psy Ops is also responsible for the means by which prisoners are interrogated.  If you know anything about the muslim faith you would understand alot better why those pictures are considered torture to them.  To be touched on a sexual part of the body by the same sex will get you in hell.  To have a woman command over you is super taboo as well.  Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why these pictures even existed?  They were not taken for fun they are part of Psy Ops.  If you have these pictures and need information from a true Muslim all you'd have to do is show them to him and say, &quot;This will be you if you don't tell me&quot; and he is BOUND by his religion to tell you, or else he is sentencing himself to hell which kind of defies the whole point of what he's trying to do.  It creates a moral cunundrum.  Another thing does anyone actually believe that a Private First Class - E-3- or a Specialist E-4 reservist has the authority to even be near a prisoner without NCO supervision?  Not in the U.S.Army I was in, not a chance in hell, no way no how.<br>
<br>
&quot;You say you are a soldier. Is this view common amongst your comrades? Are you a US soldier or a member of the coalition forces?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think my reference was too having been a soldier, but moot point I will be again if it is required.  And yes it is a common view amongst soldiers that a good smack in the mouth isn't necessarily torture, at least in my unit.  We were trained very well and in that training there were more harsh things done to us as training than these &quot;poor prisoners&quot; experienced.  And any way you twist it you can't compare what Saddaam was doing to his own people to what we are doing to enemy combatants in time of virtual world war, it's a poor analogy that doesn't even deserve attacking.<br>

Read all of it- note in particular that the prisoner was unaware of other abuses taking place elsewhere in the prison.  Note also that he is classified as a civilian detainee at the top of the report, not a detainee/suspected detainee, not a prisoner of war, a militant or &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;  This is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>civilian</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> likely picked up in a random sweep, being detained in military custody.<br>
<br>
Several of the detainees were badly beaten, one almost to death, and only partially treated by a doctor- the medically untrained MP finishing his nasal stitches as part of the punishment he'd already taken.  Another detainee had freezing water poured over him until his heart had nearly stopped.  As observed in a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/150422.pdf" target="top">sworn statement by a detainee</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (requires Adobe Acrobat)<br>
<br>
Another <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/152307.pdf" target="top">severe beating</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - this one was beaten with a chair until it came apart.  The name of this detainee shows he was a Shi'ite tribal leader of Juma, one of the tribes that helped overthrow Saddam's thugs during the war, risking their lives for British Military intelligence in Basra and coordinating with No. 42 Royal Marine Commandos in the taking of the Fao marshes.  Col. GK Messenger (42 RMC's CO) later compared their efforts to the French Resistance working behind German lines during WWII  Wonder what his tribe's going to do now?<br>
<br>

<br>
Now unless you're suggesting that any of the above acts were consensual- I call it sexual abuse and rape.  Both of which are clearly classified as torture under the universal declaration of human rights (to which the United States is a signatory nation).  The same goes for the institutionalized beatings, and sleep deprivation exceeding 48 hours- both of which were practiced policy in Abu Ghraib.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, all of the links used were sworn statements of some of the detainees obtained exclusively by the Washington post, and can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/swornstatements042104.html" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps worst of all- Abu Ghraib is the same prison that was so feared under Saddam, where rape and beatings were common.  Whether or not you consider rape and severe beatings torture Dae- it will undoubtedly blur the distinction between Saddam's justice and US military justice.  Especially when the CPA has since admitted that between 70 and 80 percent of the detainees (and 74/91 cases of abuse) were civilians picked up in random sweeps, held not because they were responsible for attacks, but because they might have seen something or known someone. <br>
<br>
Now there's a novel way to find criminals- beat and torture innocent people who knew them.  One of the detainees that was made to crawl over broken glass until his face, chest and knees bled- was a street vendor that supposedly sold some food to an insurgency suspect, an engineering contracter he'd known for 20 years.  That is why so many of them were released after the scandal broke.  The vast majority of them weren't &quot;bad or evil fanatics&quot;, but ordinary people.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not you call that hazing or torture, I call it WRONG.  It is also fundamentally illegal under the rules of war, and involved a lot more than 6-7 soldiers.  Else why would there be a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/Investigation/abu_ghraib_cover_up_040518-1.html" target="top">cover-up?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Also, Neeeedra is right in this sense- the kind of wide-spread abuse we now know exists (91 cases pending) must have had at least operational officer approval, possibly the *taciturn* approval of staff officers.  <br>
<br>
Also, not ONE civilian responsible for the administrative affairs of the army- from the lowest office secretary to SecDef Rumsfeld, not ONE person has been fired over all this.  This is an administration that doesn't believe it has made any mistakes- that is a deplorable lack of accountability.  Especially when you consider that an extramarital affair that didn't maim or kill anyone was an issue where stringent accountability was sought.  But not this administration!   Bush even said it at the live press conference, that he couldn't think of any mistakes he had made in office.  There is confidence and there is recklessness in the face of facts- judge for yourself which category the above pronouncements fall into.<br>

<br>
All those &quot;sworn statements&quot; were made by people who must have been placed into custody for a reason. I am not saying they were definitely guilty or innocent but someone arrested them for a reason.<br>
<br>
I can give a sworn statement saying that a police officer beat me. It isn't necessarily true and that is why investigations happen. If I was a terrorist thats just what I would do since what is the difference? I am already in jail and if I am guilty am probably going to stay there.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is you probably shouldn't jump to conclusions since you weren't there. Innocent until PROVEN guilty...<br>
<br>
And just for the record I am all for getting information through what might be considered &quot;rough&quot; interrogation techniques under certain conditions. If the person being questioned is either definitely or most certainly in possession of information that is of vital importance to human life would be the main caveat.<br>
<br>
For example, if I know that detainee #1 knows info about a terrorist attack that will quite likely take friendly lives through unconventional means or will kill/injure noncombatants then I will be the first one to wire his balls to a car battery. It's that plain and simple...<br>

<br>
PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL MOORE ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU &quot;THEIR&quot; VERSION OF THE TRUTH, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ACCUSE POLITICIANS OF DOING. LET'S ALL MOVE TO CANADA.<br>

<br>
Also I went through worse stuff voluntarily during college.<br>
<br>
Not condoning it, but please lets not make a bigger deal out of it than it is.<br>
<br>
Nobody seems to show pictures of the 4 civilian contractors that a huge crowd tore to pieces and dragged through the streets.<br>
<br>
Also Michael Moore is a rich man, has made a lot of money from his work, he is entitled to.  But lets not confuse entertainment with reality.  I often agree with the points he makes but he is a master at manipulation.  <br>
<br>
I am happy that he is around and provokes debate and is a loud voice from the left. <br>
<br>
What I dont like is the fact that people, especially euros, take everything he says as fact and all other americans but him lie.  <br>
