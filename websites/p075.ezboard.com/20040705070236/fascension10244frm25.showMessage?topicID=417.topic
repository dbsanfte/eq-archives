Currently I am accused of coh'n the cursed down to ST in attempt to wake the sleeper.  Now for the facts.<br>
<br>
1.  I dont have access to that mage and havent for least a month.  We havent been able to do ST and get Zuit a robe due to it  It isnt my account and never was my account.  One of the dying guilds back when i started bamboo gave me access to thier mage.  I dont know who the real owner is of it thats why i never was able to get access back to it.  <br>
<br>
2.  I was called by a guildmember, Zeirus, at 4am last night.  He has a friend in wudan that told him he should leave bamboo b4 he's kos.  His friend couldnt tell him why, so he thought it was important enough to wake my ass up in the middle of the night.  I logged on, talked to Merna, they knew nothing.  Sent Ealill a few tells, no response, went back to bed cause I had to clear PoG in 4 hours.<br>
<br>
3.  Thursday (not sure of the day, but the day after i found out ad/mim/wudan was waking the sleeper) I changed our events for the weekend.  Pog/grummus was scheduled for sunday and Vulak'Aerr was scheduled for saturday.  I had to switch those dates due to concern that the sleeper comes to ToV to kill vulak when he is woken.  <br>
<br>
I dont know what else i can list to prove it wasnt me, but if feels like again i'm being put under the gun for opening my mouth in Plane of Tranquility, letting the server know that you were waking the sleeper, while trying to keep it secret.  <br>
<br>
I have a guild of 76 really nice ppl, that have worked thier ass off and done nothing to any of you.  If you think I'd do something to jeapordize that, well you are wrong.  For those that dont know, I left AD for several reasons.. i had a history of being a dumb ass, rude, disruptive, acting holier than though etc, and was given several chances by adell to change my ways.  Well i didnt learn and then i was accused of farming ST for rl cash.  And while there was no evidence of me doing so, the rumor persisted and i would of most certainly been voted out of the guild.  I left before it came to that, cause it was clear i had used up my welcome and burned way to many bridges for it to ever go away.  So I left AD.  Now we have a new rumor and it threatens not just me, but everyone in my guild that have put thier trust in me to lead them through the gaem best i can.  If you think that i could betray thier trust and jeapordize thier eq lives, you are very wrong.  And i will not let any rumors or accusations arising from me do that to them.   I will quit this game before I let you kos all of spirit of bamboo.  I dont know why i have been singled out for this, but I can only assume its cause of stuff i said in plane of tranquility and let the cat out of the bag.  <br>
<br>
If you want to believe the rumors, then there isnt anythign i can do about it but post the above in my defense.  I hope I can keep playing this game, but if it will save my guildmates from being kos, I will resign as leader of bamboo and quit EQ.  <br>

That mage account got passed around like a bottle of cheap liqour.  Im thinking even the Curse would step up and state that you had nothign to do with this. <p>vita non est vivere sed valere vita est<br>

I believe the mage in question was one that a mamber of ES had when I was guilded in ES that we kept in ST for the purpose of CoHing.  That particular mage did go thru alot of hands when it came to the password.  Although i did not have access to the mage myself, I know that some that left ES for Wudan had access, some that remained in ES had access, some that went to MiM had access, possibly even some that went to (or applied) to AD had access, and I believe access was also given to Stynkfyst as well because he often joined ES in ST (more or less for support, always told us what a good job we were doing, occaisionally offered a little advice, but always allowed us to learn our own strategy).<br>
<br>
Even if Stynkfyst opposed to the awakening of the Sleeper, in my mind, I can not believe that he would consort with the likes of the curse for this or any reason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 2248<br> <font color=#333333>(11/16/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/maliosm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Before it gets out of hand...</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Stynk has sold ST items on Ebay for real life money, using an AD mage we used for CoH to the warders.<br>
<br>
Stynk used to hide in Karnor's Castle during the Rebirth war, with his tag down, while we were all PVP'ing.  He &quot;needed a TS staff to pvp effectively&quot;.<br>
<br>
Stynk corpse camped someone's corpse in Velketor's lab for upwards of *30* real life hours...yes, real life hours.<br>
<br>
Tell me again how Stynk is a sweetheart and would NEVER do something like this.   He's a fucking whacko.  This is right up his alley. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://malhavok.50megs.com"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Malio Mourningwood</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->/<br>

But almost everyone in ES had access so alot of folks had access.  Furthermore, luiden is in the curse(and ex-ES).  There are alot of posibilities here but stynk did say he was gonna do it which is why people took a second look.  I dont know whether he did or he didnt but I am inclined to agree with you and falarye on this.  Either way he did talk alot about it and it is curious that this happened.  I also believe the curse would have gotten down there either way as they wanted to be the spoiler.<br>

<br>
I have Never sold any item from EQ to anyone for RL cash.<br>
<br>
Ever.<br>
<br>
Quit bashing me with rumors.  Please.<br>
<br>
<br>
I camped someone in velks for 3 days straight b4 i passed out and they got thier corpse.  Why you ask?  Cause they stole Cykubis' account and I was pissed he'd do that to AD.<br>
<br>
I felt i was doing the right thing to send a message to ppl that mess over AD.<br>
<br>
<br>
I sucked ass back then, I couldnt pvp for anything, no gear, no skill, no experience.  But i put in more than my fair share of pvp and defending AD.  I was on a many a day going out with Kringe on hunting parties.  there were no safe zones back then and i did what i thought i had to do so that i could be a viable member of the team.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I dislike that i have to defend myself against these things, cause more than anything i want it all to go away.  I get rumor after rumor after rumor, and it's really sad.  Do i go around spreading rumors about you? No.  I dont.  Anyone got any facts yet?  Just rumors and lies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes I spoke my mind in Plane of Tranquility.  Yes I was pissed off cause I knew I would never be able to get my monks thier robes.  Yes I said &quot;well if you are waking the sleeper to prevent 75$ server transfers from farming ST, I guess bamboo will wake it tomorrow&quot;.   I said that to point out that i thought y'all was using it as an excuse to wake the sleeper.  Who is going to help some server transfers kill warders?  Who is going pay 75$ to transfer over here to get a robe or a sod, then pay 75$ to transfer back to thier home server?  I dont know anyone that would do that, that's 150$ down the drain.  To me it all seemed like an excuse to do something that most of the server didnt want you to do.  I was very upset at the news that the sleeper was bing woken for 1 MAIN reason.  I have a guild member named Zuit and Zuit has been with me from near the beginning of bamboo.  He helped camp zland in the early stages as we were building so we could go to ST to get primal, to get sods, to get robes.  I had always intended on getting him a robe.  Then we got caught up with ssra and i couldnt check st easily.  But i wasnt worried, cause who was ever gonna wake the sleeper.  I guess in all reality i'm pissed at myself cause I dropped the ball and didnt get the job done.  He's passed on loots he should of gotten cause he was gonna get a robe.  I thought i had all the time in the world to get him a robe and to have 2 day notice b4 the sleeper was to be woken, I was upset.  I spoke my mind, but thats where it ended.  I ran to ST, zoned in, zoned out, lohengrin was in EW.  He put me in my place and thats where it ended.  I logged off went to bed. <br>

I'd just like to point out that the person he CC'd was Shakalakalakawhatever- a very nasty piece of work, and shortly after Shaka had blown out of our guild.  <br>
<br>
As for the incident in question, no idea what happened- but I personally don't believe he is capable of something like that.  Whatever rumours, half-truths and hearsay one might have heard circulated, helping PKs has never been up there with Stynk.<br>

<br>
yes charlie has no life other than eq he can be difficult to get along with he can say things that would make even his best freindes shake their heads BUT he is innocent of these false rumors.<br>
<br>
until such time as you can show a email or a PA account or a paypal account that can be traced to him all you have is hearsay.<br>

<br>
<br>
you are right he doesnt need me to defend him, but he is my freind and i'll do it anyhow jsut like id defend you if you were accused of somthing you didnt do.<br>
<br>
the poll to kick him out has nothing to do with this anyway, charlie can be a royal pain in the ass as we both know.  he doesnt really get along well with others has great difficulty controling his temper and often says ill thought out things that make eniemies out of friends.  Still charlie is loyal to a fault.<br>
<br>
<br>
what i cant understand is why people cant jsut accpet people for who they are and get along.  I like all of you you are all my friends its pains me that my freinds cant seem to get along with each other.<br>
