Application</span><hr size=1> Hello, <br>
 <br>
My name is Neomorchius Pendragun, I wish to apply to your guild and am hoping be acccepted as apart of the family. I am currently a level 65 wizard, with 112 AA points at the moment.. I am not keyed for the Emp of Ssra, and I only have 1 piece for the key, but I have 7 shards for VT zone and I'm sorry to say not really flaged for much, only POV and POS. The requirements for your guild I have met, all AA that is needed, my saves all above 100, I have an EB item, my gear is good to ok, with good stats.<br>
 <br>
Some info about myself, I came from Karana server with Lndi, looking for alittle more action and fun. We have played for acouple years on RZ and I believe are pretty well known around the server. My guildstatus started off with Silent Reign with Gurynx or aka Suma, where we had a great time one that I wish was longer lasting. Most the guild moved on to other things and being around lvl 40 with only me and Lndi in SR we decided to leave the guild behind and move on. We were quickly invited into ToG, where I have no idea how that happened or why but it did :/ being in that guild wasnt what me and Lndi decided we wanted. We did not want a guild that was internally fighting and crying about little things, all kids we believed. So being fair to them we just said this wasnt what we wanted and left. Later on we were invited to Knights of No Remorse.. where we met more good people and seemed to have a family with everyone, we did a little raiding but mostly leveling with guildies or what not, since me and Lndi were out leveling everyone and seeing some of the guild move on to other things we again decided it was time to also move. That is where Insanity's Edge found us and invited us to a Synergy event. After that we just fit in and were invited to IE. They then later merged into MIM which I believe was a bad move to put two different kinda people together.  Atm I am no longer in MIM, happy about it and looking forward to bigger and better things.<br>
 <br>
I know very few people in AD atm but I'm hoping to fix that. I have pvped with a couple of you before in GD or other zones which you may or may not remember me. I dont beleive my name is bad in your guild nor good because I know so few of you and you dont really know me. I am hoping that we can work on that and meet up more.<br>
 <br>
I have never logged from a war and am pretty much one of the first on to defend, fight with and support my fellow brothers and sisters. I have pvped in the MIM vs DoZ war, MIM vs ES, and MIM vs TB which I have to say was one of the most saddest times of my EQ life. I had many friends in TB that I really spent a lot of time with and having to war them was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. But being in a family of people and committed to them by wearing their tag I did fight and kill and die. I am happy to say that I am still friends with a good amount of the people we warred but some I have lost out of touch with. I do promise you that if i am admited into AD as an iniate my loyalty is yours.<br>
 <br>
Hoping to hear from you guys soon, thx for your time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sumax>SumaX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(2/11/03 11:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=386.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 65 Wizard Neomorchius...

Application</span><hr size=1> Well i can see why Pyro is upset and doesnt want to see me in AD or even a recruit is cus i blieve of the war with DoZ vs MIM. Where we were attacking one another also where MIM decided they wanted TB to join up and merge with MIM and TB didnt want that and war started. It wasnt my decesion to war TB i would have wanted to sit that one out personally but that wouldnt have looked to good to the my family i was in. Also with  DoZ i again fought against friends and didnt want it but had no choice for i am loyal to the guild i am in and protect the people in there and must fight off others that attack us. Your only reason really for not wanting me to join AD is cus i was in IE. And you have some person hate for them. But you dont know me, i remember the times we did have fun, you, me, voltic tell he pked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and the halfing remarks to gnomes, all for run. I believe if you gave time to really get to know the real me, we would have fun again and you would over look that i was in IE. For it could have been TB i was in for we were allys and i still have many friends among them still. <br>
As for renix saying no, i dont even know why, i dont know you, you dont know me, theres no connection that i can get out of it. IF maybe you gave me a reason why you wouldnt want me to show myself as a recruit im lost, or a reason so that i can talk to you about it, or explain my actions. If you can supply that for me i would glady like to talk to you about it.<br>
