Most of the middle aged farmers have a lot on their plate, and paying for life insurance usually slips a good way down the priorities.  At best they'll take out mortgage life insurance on their primary land purchase, but not frequently on the later 2nd/3rd mortgages they use to buy new equipment.  Also, a farmers income schedule is extremely far from regular.  90% of the Farmers I deal with have their homes/land on annual payments.  They have no income for up to 3/4 months at a time during the summer/winter.  At those times when they do have income it's in huge chunks, most of my farmers are above the median annual income for our area, but at those times their focus is going to be paying extra down on mortgages or purchasing more supplies for the farm.  It's a focus on building the farm, not protecting the farm.  <br>
<br>
Multiple heirs only makes situations worse, b/c if a farmer does leave a will, it's almost always &quot;all property left equally to all my children&quot; to avoid fights.  What that does, in my experience, is pit the ones who do work the farm against the ones who don't.  The taxes will fall on them all equally, but only certain children are receiving income from the farm.  So the non-farmers want the farmers to buy their part &amp; pay their taxes.  This rarely, if ever, can happen at once, which leads to a significant portion have to be sold off to settle the disagreements legally.  <br>
<br>
It is my opinion that farmers are much more impacted than those who inherit business empires b/c of the liquidity of the commodity they inherit.  If childA inherits stock and childB inherits a huge tract of land, then childA is much more capable of selling only that which would be needed to cover the debt, in the form of individual shares.  ChildB cannot split a corn field down the middle to only sell part significantly lessening the value of both pieces.<br>
<br>
Finally I don't believe Paris Hilton, once her elders are dead and gone, will have the slightest clue how to maintain that fortune.  Even if she hires someone who can, they'll end up skimming off the top while she overspends to the moon.  The only different between she and GW, IMO, seem to be their personal financial aptitudes.  GW can clearly handle personal finances, at the expense of the national deficit.  The origins of their money is all old family wealth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barmaley>Barmaley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 318<br> <font color=#333333>(4/26/05 11:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: please</span><hr size=1> Vanessa, I am watching TV, term life insurance is under 1 dollar a day with premium up to half a mill. I am not sure what kind of prices are there where you live, but assuming we are talking working farmers between 40 and 60 years of age that dont drink heavily, I doubt the insurance is that huge of a burden on them. If it is, then its problem with insurance rates and health care, not with taxation.<br>
<br>
If siblings that inherited farm cant work together, then farm probably isnt going to be a viable venture in the future anyways. If sons of a farmer hate each other, what kind of family operation do you expect? Once again, I was under impression that estate tax is only on property over 1 mln. if I am wrong correct me, if I am right, then uhh.. what huge taxes are you talking about?  What it encorages IMO is farmers that live and farm land instead of rich land owners that buy land and then rent it to others. I am by no means an expert on land prices, but from house prices in rural communities, wouldnt a farm that is worth a million be a pretty good farm? Assuming regular family size is 5 people, then an estate worth about 3.5 millions after sudden and un-expected death of the head of the family that never got term life insurance would still let members of family equally divide farm among themselves and STILL not pay large estate tax. I am not sure what kind of farm would cost 3.5 millions, but I am pretty sure it wouldnt be too shabby.<br>
<br>
Once again, with a few sound financial decisions farmers and small business owners should be pretty well off, unless they are family that are clawing each others eyes out.<br>
<br>
The law isnt even against rich people like Paris, and you are wrong, she will never become poor, she will only get richer and richer as time passes, look at GW, he mismanaged every single business venture he touched, at their level it is simply IMPOSSIBLE to go broke unless you are being robbed blind, but that isnt the point.<br>
<br>
The law isnt against farmers or rich people, its against keeping amassing unthinkable wealth and encouraging it. Lets see, with 1 million dollars if you arent trying to live la vida loco, you get what? by the most conservative estimate 50.000 a year. Even in most expensive cities like San Francisco or NY, that isnt too shabby for NEVER HAVING TO WORK, in some less expensive areas, it is pretty damn good. If you recieve more in inheritance and have someone with more than a dogbrain to manage your finances (note, u still dont have to do diddly squat) by the end of your life you will at least double your wealth. If you have inherited real estate in california, more like make 10x the money at least. At the end you will have 1% of people possessing 99% of the total wealth in the country paying 0 taxes on them and making absolutely no fucking effort, never working, never doing shit just living generations in uncredible luxury without any way to reverse or chip away from them BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN INTO WEALTH. There are already cases like that, you suggest that we encourage that? At that point, working and risking their wealth for those people becomes counter productive. Why risk if you are already rich and your children will be rich? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1643<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 8:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: please</span><hr size=1> While you may see many cases of this in your area, farms make up a relatively small percentage of estates actually subject to estate tax. Democrats who are in favor of retaining the estate tax in some form, have proposed amending the tax to exempt farm assets up to $4 million for individuals, and $8 million for couples.  This would exempt 98%+ of farms from being subject to estate tax.  The revenue impact from this would be relatively small, as the number of farms affected by estate taxes is just not that high, as compared to total number of estates affected by the tax. Similar proposals have been made to protect small business assets.<br>
<br>
Guess what--those proposals were rejected.  Anyone paying attention knows that this is not really about protecting family farms, or small businesses, it's about paying off to wealthy political contributors. Republicans don't really give a shit about farmers, or small business owners. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 880<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 9:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: please</span><hr size=1> Or maybe it's about the fact that it is a stupid fucking tax all the way around?<br>

Even if I were to agree with that assertion(which I don't), there are lots of taxes that are flat out unfair, regressive or just stupid.  As a country, we're just not in a position to cut revenues.

The combination of our deficit spending, and the enormous trade deficit this country maintains, means we're heading for a very painful period.  When the chinese finally revalue their currency, and the dollar finds its deservedly much lower level vs other currencies, what do you think interest rates will have to be to attract capital flows into this country to finance the republicans continual appetite for growing our national debt?<br>

Cut taxes on any group you like, but figure out how to pay the damn bills, without bullshit laffer curve optimism. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 881<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 10:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: now we're back to where we started</span><hr size=1> Teh sky is falling our economy shall crumble.

<br>
Some quick questions, that will allow you to confirm this:  <br>
<br>
1.) in a free floating currency exchange system, what's the normal reaction of the market for a nation that runs trade deficits?<br>
<br>
2.) given that currencies are not asset based, what is the likely direction for a currency's valuation, if the participants in the forex markets see that government in a continual pattern of deficit spending?<br>
<br>
3.) If from all indications, the direction of a currency's value vis a vis other currencies is down, what do interest rates have to be high, or low, to attract capital flows into that country to continually finance that country's growth in public debt?  Bonus: what are the implications above for domestic interest rates?<br>
<br>
Your snide comments only hide your lack of concern for, or ignorance of the real problem. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A> at: 4/27/05 10:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 882<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: now we're back to where we started</span><hr size=1> Are you implying that this conditions are only true under the Bush administration?

<br>
Not true.  Try getting your budget numbers from the CBO, rather than from Republican apologists.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The united states has run trade deficits for most of the 19th century<br>
<br>
The difference would be the abandonment of Bretton Woods fixed exchange under Nixon in the early 70s, and the resulting implications for the fluctuating value of our currency. Essentially we've been existing on inflows of foreign capital since.  To maintain that capital flow, in the face of the likely decline of value of the dollar in the medium to long term, interest rates will have to rise significantly. That's a fact.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, there are some good things about a devalued dollar.  It will be good for our exports, we'll repay the public debt in effectively cheaper dollars, and domestic goods will become relatively cheaper compared to foreign goods.  But higher interest rates, and higher overall domestic price levels are an inevitable consequence.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;the sky aint falling chicken little<br>
<br>
No sky is falling talk here.  I don't foresee economic armageddon. There is, however, a good deal of unpleasantness for the nation that can be avoided or mitigated with responsible government action. So far there's been anything but that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 883<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 2:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: now we're back to where we started</span><hr size=1> Ok let me rephrase that for you Bumraz, if a budget surplus is not used to spend down the debt is it really a surplus? NO, surely you can't argue another way.<br>
<br>
If I have a &quot;surplus&quot; and I don't spend down the debt but instead use it for something else, how can it be called a surplus?<br>
<br>
According to the US Treasury, the debt has increased under ever president since 1900 with the exception of 1951 (Eisenhower).<br>
<br>
Edit: found a more comprehensive list list from the treasury, the previous one I listed broke it into two pages, this one is better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/fed-debt.shtml" target="top">www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/fed-debt.shtml</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
A spending &quot;surplus&quot; or break even would show national debt standing still or shrinking right?<br>
<br>
If Clinton truely had the largest surplus in history, why didn't the debt decrease or even stay the same?<br>
<br>
Try asking for someones sources next time, on second thought I love your accusations. Keep em coming. I'll make sure I ask Rush next time for you, so you can be right.<br>

Uh, not really.  Debt could easily still grow through interest, even when you're running a surplus. Duh.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;According to the US Treasury, the debt has increased under ever president since 1900 with the exception of 1951 (Eisenhower).<br>
<br>
Nominal dollar figures tell you jack shit.  Those numbers as a percentage of GDP would be informative.<br>
<br>
&gt;.If Clinton truely had the largest surplus in history, why didn't the debt decrease or even stay the same?<br>
<br>
The deficit declined every year Clinton was in office, becoming a surplus in the last years of his Presidency.  Debt held by the public actually did decline the last years of his presidency, in nominal dollar terms.  When expressed as a percentage of GDP, the debt declined every single term Clinton was in office.  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=1821&sequence=0">www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?i...sequence=0</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

How does that make sense?<br>
<br>
If you can't pay the interest on your debt, how can you say you have a surplus? Sounds like more debt to me.<br>
<br>
The debt growth shrunk to 0.32% but there sure as shit was no surplus.<br>
<br>
You can massage the numbers any way you like to make them look &quot;Informative&quot; to you, the fact is the debt grew even under Clinton, every year he was in office. <br>
<br>
Point out here where the debt shrunk and I'll agree with you.<br>

Otherwise your so-called surplus that couldn't even pay the interest (according to you) on the debt is just wishful thinking.<br>

First, I don't care if you stipulate anything, the debt has increased every year since 1951, dispute it or is the department of treasury part of some grand conspiracy?!?!<br>

Now, you state that what I say is &quot;demonstrably untrue&quot;. Are the numbers that I presented from the US Treasury true or not, yes or no? No lessons on whole math or real dollars or wishful thinking. Has the debt increased every year since 1951 or not?<br>

Looks like Bush is cutting the deficit. Is the CBO wrong only when it favors Bush?<br>
<br>
Bumraz answer. The AMT is Bush's stealth tax that will balance the budget.<br>
<br>
Mith. Ok let's fix the AMT and raise other taxes. What is the difference?<br>
<br>
Bum. The rich should pay for the deficit, not the poor.<br>
<br>
Mith. The AMT affects the rich.<br>
<br>
Bum. It will affect 30% of top bracket tax payers by 2015.<br>
<br>
Mith. They are still the rich.<br>
<br>
Bum. They are the upper middle class, silly! Democrats care for them too. Tax the top 5% to pay the deficit, because.... hmm they have more money than me, I work hard and they inherited it all.<br>
<br>
That is the bottom line. Tax the rich more, and more, and more... you know... just like they do in Europe, where the economy, unemployment, and innovation has been flat or getting worse for two decades. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.philbrodieband.com/Slide13.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1653<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 4:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: now we're back to where we started</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;Looks like Bush is cutting the deficit.

<br>
Astounding. The only way the numbers from the CBO hold true for the future, is if Bush's tax cuts, both in the form of the estate tax, and for the income tax *expire*.  CBO's projections reflect ***current law***, not the laws as they are most likely to be. CBO specifically mentions this.  How likely do you think that is?  I've referenced this in numerous past posts, or did you just forget?<br>
<br>
Further, Bush and Congress have passed another fucking flimflam to make those budgets look better than they are:<br>
&quot;The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that if current laws and policies remained the same, the federal government would run budget deficits of $368 billion in 2005 and $295 billion in 2006 (see Summary Table 1). <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>However, because of the statutory rules that govern such baseline projections, those estimates omit a significant amount of spending that will occur this year--and conceivably for some time in the future--for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for other efforts in the war on terrorism.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6060&sequence=1&from=0">www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?i...e=1&from=0</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
In other words, Bush and Congress passed a law that said &quot;Doh, Iraq and Afghanistan don't count&quot;  so things appear to be getting better.<br>
<br>

Also, I believe that in the near future the generation of financially ignorant, spendthrifts will reach a critical point and begin to cause their own destruction.  Obviously not all &quot;rich kids&quot; cause their own failure, but the ones who don't care about the source of their funds, IMO, will fail when they lose the support of their elders.  Especially in cases where there aren't more financially minded siblings to take on the earnings load.  I could be wrong, but it's my opinion and I don't really care to make it a further topic of this thread.  Finally, your doomsday scenario will never come to pass b/c the richest want the nicest things, and they spend the most money into our economy to keep everything turning over.  The only way the situation you described could actually happen would be for the rich to take all their money and go hide in a cave.  As long as they continue to own property, purchase goods and interact with society they're paying taxes and contributing to the country as well as the wellness of the economy.<br>
<br>
Bum, way to keep gunning, even when I agreed with your position.  I stated very clearly that this is the worst possible time to be eliminating this tax.  I also agreed that Bush is pandering to the rich.  While only a small number of the total number of estates in US involve farms, you claimed earlier that it rarely happened a family farm got sold, I simply told you were incorrect about that one aspect, and unlike mith I never claimed being wrong about 1 thing made your whole stance wrong.  I also never claimed this amendment was to protect the family farms, and again, I agreed with you Bush was catering to the rich.  <br>
<br>
The estate tax is still fundamentally wrong.  If someone saves assests over time then they've paid taxes on them.  They pay income tax on any interest/dividend earnings, they pay property tax on real estate, and they own non-income producing assets, then when those assets are sold capital gains will take effect.  Why should the exchange of assets due to one's death be a taxable event?  The only possible reason would be that someone is TOO wealthy and they need to give some of it back now that they're gone.  This is simply obsurd.  <br>
<br>
Again I'll say you were exactly right that our entire tax code needs to change, and the AMT needs to go away, but estate tax is simply wrong in a capitalist society.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=3301.topic&start=181&stop=198>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=3301.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=3301.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=3301.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3301.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3301.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm36">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft<option value="ascension10244frm5">Closed Applications<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private -
