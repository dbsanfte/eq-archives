As far as the duel goes, if you were dueling in a zone, and one of you left the zone, the duel is over.  You are a ranger in an outdoor zone against a druid.  Your damage owns his so badly it's not even funny- you should have beaten him comfortably.  Except Semmy's a better player and you had to flee the zone, which means you lost the duel.  If that wasn't bad enough, you come on here and make it worse by claiming foul play.<br>
<br>
Firstly, the rules stipulated before a duel are the only ones that matter- and secondly...you're a fucking ranger.  There's no WAY a druid should make you run like that if you're prepared to pvp one beforehand.  Even if he'd used conflag wand and hoop you should have still beaten him.   <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

Now, ok, no stipulations duel is stupid, but come on, there is thing called &quot;common sense&quot;.<br>
<br>
When 2 people duel it is expected they don't zone and come back while duel is going (note while duel is going), it is expected they don't get outside heals or someone to help them gank an opponent, it is expected that if you are trained in duel, its a rematch, I would say that it's expected that you don't run off for 15 minutes and med/rebuff during a duel, otherwise, what is the point?<br>
<br>
If say Sirdario came at the end of duel and disc. HTed Seeknd and declared semmy winner because there was no &quot;no help from outside&quot; stipulation, would you side with him too?<br>
<br>
Let's not engage in character debate, Seeknd is loud mouth jerk and a baby, I can tell you that from start, but while not questioning his character flaws, can we just not completely skew the issue because of his personality? Let's be fair, if YOU duelled someone and they just hid for say 30 minutes would you say fuck it and zone? What about an hour? 2 hours? 3 hours? How long do you feel it is acceptable to avoid any appearance of PvP in a duel? PvP duel on RZ is test of pvp skill, gear and class balance, not test of who can sit in zone longer.<br>
<br>
I am not asking you to like Seeknd, I am first to tell him to STFU. I am asking you to view issue objectively. <br>
<br>
Anyways, Seeknd stfu.<br>
<br>
As for ranger vs. druid, Tempra beaten Seeknd 1 on 1 in EJ (admitting there were trees), Gloryia (clr) beaten Muffinshooter (MiM recruit AM3 ranger) 1 on 1, many MiM rangers refuse to duel DoZ druids and many of MiM rangers lost to DoZ druids 1 on 1. Druid imo is a very potent and deadly pvp class. I have seen Praxx (good old times) and Neckros do some pretty darn good PvP against Curse and LV/DB (in case of Praxx) vs multiple classes.<br>
<br>
If those 2 duel again, make sure its a zone both are comfortable with and both agree on basic rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trikzter>Trikzter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/9/04 10:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=537.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Semmy</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;font-family:Redensek;font-size:small;">Okay, I'm not from your server or anything, was just browsing different guild sites and etc. Here is what I think from observing the current conversation and the screenshots. Seeknd lost the duel, yes he did. When you duel, it doesn't end UNTIL someone dies, or zones. Semmy didn't fight fair, yes, with the running and hiding to med. Then again, there was no rules.. anything goes.. am I correct? Okay, well you should have clearly stated none of that. I don't know who would have won or anything, but Seeknd, you seemed pretty bored and fed up with the &quot;games&quot; of running. So I CAN fully understand you zoning and saying screw it. The 100k shouldn't even be bitched about, nobody's going to pay, and we can see that. So forget that. Semmy, could have and should have thought about that, and 20 minutes gone medding? That is pathetic, IMHO. Though.. You are a ranger from what I see Seeknd? Well, you could have tracked Semmy.. it seems to me both of you have sow + horses. So you should have done that. Being a ranged fighter, you also would have been able to interrupt the medding process with arrows. However, the duel is over, and this is just my opinion. Just next time both of you should consider. Though, Seeknd you did LOSE..even if it wasn't &quot;fair&quot;. But if it was up to me to call it....

du·el    ( P )n. <br>
A prearranged, formal combat between two persons, usually fought to settle a point of honor.  <br>
<br>
<br>
The word &quot;duel&quot; itself is a rule for 1v1 (unless you add a stipuation that says so other wise =P), so I do not believe Sirdario could jump in and harm touch him.<br>
<br>
As for the prearranged part, they decided to be drunkards and go 1 on 1 in a vast zone without setting any rules - so either could have used the entire terrain for an advantage (water, the wall, the pits, the cliff).  As for the honor part, they were fighting for 100k pp instead. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tomstrife>tomstrife</A> at: 3/9/04 11:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ezzrz>EZZRZ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 377<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/04 12:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=537.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/creep/bmw120k/avatar_1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Semmy</span><hr size=1> im just wondering wtf is with the stupid ppl posts recently..from neeeeeeeeedra to idontplayeqanymore to random_idontplayonyourserver_01..no one cares about u here..if you dont play eq anymore then why the hell are u posting on eq boards. if ur not from our server then u dont have the slightest clue as to what is going on. if ur the person posting as neeedra or some resemblence of that you need to lay off ur happy pills keke. <br>

Once, while I still owned voradoor I agreed to a requested duel of Orraden. He wanted to duel in OT, so I agreed. I owned him up hardcore and he died while i had 60% mana and 100% hps. <br>
<br>
His response? You killed me cause I forgot my cure disease potions, you didn't win. Let me get potions and lets have a real duel.<br>

Hi.<br>
<br>
Bards can cast while moving.  Run in close enough to get in song range, then run out of range as you sing, then run back in range just as song lands.  You'll then be oor of spells about 90% of the time.  Unless person you're fighting is extremely lucky, they'll be getting an oor msg either as they try to start a spell or when the spell would have landed.  Course with bard dots now being completely and utterly useless, this may not work as well as it used to.<br>

I once dueled umm what was his name... he was in curse. I couldnt do anything because the mana costs of my dots &gt; dispell, no ro.... all I can do it use dmg shield and melee him, which is what I did using ToT mace till he was oom then got him to about 10% and he zoned. Most people wont be as lucky as I was with channeling and will die.<br>
<br>
Rng vs druid is never pretty and dueling in such a huge zone was silly. Druids run in a duel, that's what they have to do, dont be pissed when they horse off into the distance because that is a smart thing to do, you dont stand still and die....  <p>Neckros Dundee<br>
