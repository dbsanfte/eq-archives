You realize, there were melees in your guild who still needed a key long after your druid alt had one?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Rofl once again Baghdad Bob aka. Mearis spreading out false infos!<br>
<br>
Lez see, You joined Atsukos and my raid in Kael. And yes we gave the first Key to random. Noone randomed from our Toons. Thats correct only your Guild randomed at our Raid, hey do you see something there? HMN nah i bet you cant see cuz you are blinded in your own Propaganda. Then we continue to kill Statue, we let you guys still tag along, even you was just a handful people there. And omg guess what you even got loot again, at my Raid omg??<br>
<br>
Okay now coming to the Thing, there was Meeles in AD that still needed the key? hello McFly wake up there, around 90% of the People (not only meeles) that needed still Keys got their Keys with me! Hell, just get your fucking Facts straight. When some First Brood was spotted from anyone in our Guild, who went there to kill it? <br>
<br>
Beside that your arguments with First Brood Dragons are completly laughable, cuz you fail to see that those are THREE Year old content. All of them (except Sont) are doable with 1 Group. And why you care so much about their Loot, then just do your own Raids there, if you cant agree with someones else raid on them. Dont forget you was invited as Guests, so have some respect and behave like a GUEST at someones raid. But i know you dont even have respect to come here to complain how someone does Loot on their Raid, guess if you dont like it, dont even come? I dont need you, never did or never will. You was the person that wanted to tag along, and now you are whining about the loot ? hahaha right! some more plz! share the crack you are smoking!<br>
<br>
Also everyone is laughing at you since you try to Prove your Points even they totally lost any weight. You are M.S.S. you fail to see the truth. And since you are still angry that we dont invite you to tag along cuz you was way to greedy and was COMPLAINING at my raids / atsuko's mini raids. Get a clue.<br>
<br>
Also, hello why you care so much about our Twink Chars, does it bother you so much, that 2-3 RL people can get some Stuff done and have fun with the Game? Also if you inspect anyone of those <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Bad Twinks that ruining your Gamefun so much&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> then you will find out, that a) most items they got was rotting or b) was achived with 2-3 RL people. <br>
<br>
Indeed i feel sorry for you that you cant do the same, but that doesnt means you have to carry your anger here. Only because you can not do the same.<br>
<br>
I am really sorry, that some People entertain to have 2nd Chars around. I am very sorry you have to carry all your Hate you bring against those Chars here. Forgive me that some People just dont share the Point with you and use their Freetime to have fun in the way they want without listining to your Idiotic Propaganda.<br>
<br>
Edit: Beside that only cuz you trying so hard to spread out your boring stereotype propaganda against me, that doesnt means that anyone beside yourself is believing in it. <br>
<br>
I can say the same about you. I got so many tells that you are just a fucking Retared, from so many People all over the Server. Do i say you dont got friends? no cuz i dont even know you nor give a shit what you doing. While you on the otherside Mister M.S.S. know everything about me and know who are my friends and everything.<br>
<br>
Now you can get some lube for your ass. Later. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A> at: 6/29/03 6:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#333333>(6/29/03 5:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WAAHOOO</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you rolled on st key off vindi and so did I, I won<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
From Tetzou<br>
<br>
Here we have Alrec claiming you both rolled on the key - and he won, then YOU are claiming you didn't random on the key.<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I wonder who is slightly more believable?<br>
<br>
What do we have here.. ANOTHER lie!<br>
<br>
I am not sore at all about you killing Zlandicar with 6 people, its trivial for any group of level 65's to do, don't think you are any special because you can do it, the difference is other people aren't willing to steam roll others in the search for fun 6 man comment.<br>
<br>
Sontolak is also doable with one group, he's been 6 manned several times on blue servers - I only bring up the example of first brood dragons because they are the most obvious example of your behaviour.  <br>
<br>
I know you aren't very bright, but I wasn't even there at that raid where those keys dropped!  The only reason I stopped coming to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ATSUKO's</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raids, was - because Atsuko was shipped to Iraq, and after Atsuko left nobody was willing to go on doing late night raids in velious content under your lead.<br>
<br>
I am not angry that you outfit your twinks, I have my own twinks too, with decent gear, and I outfitted them as well with 2 - 3 RL people farming their gear, but guess what, I never went after contensted content to farm gear for my twinks, believe it or not, its possible to gear up twinks without stepping on other people's toes.<br>
<br>
This is getting borderline hilarious too, the contradictions keep piling up, first you say you only ever killed 'a few' Zlandicars, and then on the very next paragraph you say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>around 90% of the People (not only meeles) that needed still Keys got their Keys with me!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But wait - you only killed A FEW Zlandicars OMG OMG, yet you got keys for 90% of people who missed their keys in AD?<br>
<br>
Wowzers.<br>
<br>
Listen, I know this is hard, but at some point, you need to take a deep breath, realize that every post you make you end up looking dumber, and just call it quits.<br>

It's because the majority of our guild don't give two flying fucks about any of this spam.  I can guarantee you that most of us saw your post, skimmed through it quickly, and hit the back button in their browser, I know I did.  Now, a week later, I come to the gimp gallery and still see you bitching about your spawns, your velious raids, how your guild divies up your runes, and how we're a bunch of ignorant assholes -- no one wants to fucking hear it.  You said your piece, now.. just .. walk .. away.  Oh and by the way - Tetzou is a great guy and a good friend of mine.

<br>
This thread has long served its purpose, and its obvious that its just turned into a flame war between me and Tetzou, plus a few idiots who are bitter their guild collapsed and cheerlead on the side, and its unlikely that anything anyone is likely to read is going to change whatever opinion they have formed of him or me.<br>
<br>
I am not an angel, however I do repute myself a better person than Tetzou, and I am sure Tetzou thinks the same about himself.<br>
<br>
I enjoy a good flame war, but this is quickly degrading, and I am going to draw the line here for myself anyway - unless its to adress some obvious attack on me or my friends.<br>

Are you that fucking retarded?  Did i not just make a post yesterday that told you why i made my first post in this thread?  Mearis, quit being such a dumbass.  Seriously.  Im not bitter about a thing, and im not here to cheerlead.  What i am here to do is hate on people who can only talk shit once a guild is dead, and try to make their defense for being a &quot;better person&quot; than someone else.

First off, it's not &quot;cool&quot; to be such a dipshit guild that 80% of the high end game other than yourselves hates your fucking guts, and secondly, it's nothing to brag about here (which is essentially what you're doing by saying Mearis didn't have the balls to say that while Reverant was still around). Go join Wudan or DoZ or something and shut the fuck up.<br>

Oh yeah, by the way, the moment in question regarding Reverant watching Revered kill Tormax: no, you weren't killing Vindi. You had just killed Klandicar or something, and then you came to Kael and literally sat your asses behind us while we gave Tormax a try. I remember quite vividly turning around only to see Itchybottom's fat ass standing right in front of me, with 20 some odd people standing behind him. I remember some newbies in the zone even asked if Revered and Reverant were doing AoW. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/30/03 2:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xxmacooxx>XxMacooxX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#333333>(6/30/03 2:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh yea</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Who the fuck are you kidding Macoo?

Haha.  You made what clear?  Im not trying to brag about anything, reverant wasn't some godly guild.  But it was my guild, and when cumguzzlers like you decide to try and bash them only after they are dead, i get pissy.  You never said a fucking word when we were around, shut the fuck up and quit trying to act like you did.<br>
<br>
If by 80% you mean all of the lower guilds we surpassed and got the quality members from (revered being one of the main ones) then i guess youre right.  Oh nos!  Anything but morb hating me...<br>
<br>
We could argue about kael for years, probably take this post count to 300 if you would like.  But i distinctly remeber the night yall blew tormax (oh you were going to leave that out?) we were doing statue as yall blew it.<br>
<br>
BTW i don't play anymore morb, no need to shit talk and suggest other guilds for me to join =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xxmacooxx>XxMacooxX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/30/03 2:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asshole, P.I.</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#333333>(6/30/03 3:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh yea</span><hr size=1> Um, Revered never failed Statue a single time in all our attempts at him (side note: Reverant also tried to steamroll us from Statue after we killed Vindi one time cause they didn't think we were capable of it, but Dupre wasn't a total shithead and took them elsewhere). If we failed Statue we wouldn't have tried Tormax, duh. I know you're used to steamrolling guilds, but please don't confuse number 140 for number 141 ok?<br>
<br>
And considering you read the LV and AD boards, I'm SURE you could find some posts from a few months back where I stated my abhorrance for Reverant. But if it makes you feel bigger, then just don't bother looking.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to argue at all about your &quot;got the quality members from&quot; comment, because I think that any &quot;quality member&quot; of any guild wouldn't blatantly leave his guild for loot. But that doesn't bother me as long as those dipshits don't apply to AD (instead they applied to Wudan, woohoo). <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/30/03 3:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=razzinel>Razzinel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#333333>(6/30/03 7:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh yea</span><hr size=1> Hey Morb,<br>
<br>
remember when I let your guild do Statue in KD, even though you were not being diplomatic? I allowed you to get it, even though I needed the BP bad, and DOZ could have done it in 20 minutes. It was not going to be very unreasonable to come walk past you and kill it, after giving you an hour in the arena and it was still up.  Yet, we let you and 20 other people sit in Arena &quot;claiming statue&quot; and getting prepped for HOURS.<br>
<br>
Remember little things like that before you throw dirt at guilds like DOZ and Wudan on public messageboards.<br>

Razz, Statue can be killed with a lot less than 20 people. I remember telling you we were waiting on a cleric or enc or something, which you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>seemed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at the time to understand fully. I also told you I'd tell you whether we won or lost, but you didn't trust me obviously because you sent me a tell every 5 minutes asking. I didn't mind though. We also both know the reason it took us so long was because we couldn't figure out how to pull him, so we had some bad pulls and some people died a couple times, which I told you. I still think you're a nice guy, even though you just came and posted in a thread that doesn't concern you at all so you could act like Billy Badass. Hopefully you'll be able to lead another raid sometime for your own selfish gain and fill that void that you call a shitty bp. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/30/03 9:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laney7>Laney7</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.coasterforce.f2s.com/phpBB/images/croft1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(6/30/03 10:06 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.coasterforce.f2s.com/phpBB/images/croft1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh yea</span><hr size=1> Morb, spin more shit, cuz it always amusing.

Half of revered wanted to war my ass.  I guess you forgot the night our guilds did fight?  Let me refresh your memory.  Step back a week proir in pov Gravitorr(sp?) lvl 60 or so shit talks in PoV to ghouldan for whatever reason and finally says Bring it bitch.  But of course he cant since mister all talk is green.  So a week later hez not green and in WW and 4 of us zone in to 3-5 of your guys and ghouldan says still want me to bring it and he gets a fuck you so he super HTs him bam dead. so Takon MBs ghouldan and he dies then all 3-4 of the rest of your members drop instantly to the one wizard in our guild there. (no not macoox)  then 2 of your officers came and wanted to peace us.  Not even 20 fucking minutes later morb.  Oh shit if half your guild wants to war the other half that didnt must of worn the pants in revered.  Now i have to agree with you on somthing the truth does hurt.  Specially since thats that truth.<br>
<br>
You never wiped on satue my ass we saw you sit on one and gather at it for literally 3+ hours while we where in tov.<br>
<br>
BTW nobody gives 2 shits about your opinion of a guild that doesnt exist now + nobody cares what you did think of us you play on RZ a PVP server instead of thinking we gonna troll every damn eq board to find out what u possibly think of us.  Show us what u got.  But oh no you gotta wait till its over and done to bring shit up.  <br>

You know i know you wanna impress Ad with this i can hang with the big boys and talk the talk.  But it just doesnt work for you since you a cock fucker and smack when you know you can get away with it.<br>
