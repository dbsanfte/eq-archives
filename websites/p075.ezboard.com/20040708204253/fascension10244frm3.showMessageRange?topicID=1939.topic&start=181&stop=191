I dont want to embark on a long debate on Civil Liberties here on this board. But, I find your remarks strikingly similar with sentiments most americans share.<br>
<br>
Many of you react strongly on even the most trivial interferance from the goverment, you have a passion for liberty in all respects that is not only remarkable, but unique. I was in US before christmas last year, and I remember one of the things that struck me was the plates on the cars from New Hampshire, with the text ' Live Free or Die'. <br>
<br>
I thought that was awesome.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I'd like to shed some light on the state of affairs now, and let you judge for yourself, will your remarks still hold water a year or two from now, or even today? <br>
<br>
I am sure you have noticed the dabate around the USA Patriot act of 2001, the one that moved through Congress in the matter of weeks. I have included a link at the bottom where you'll find links to analyses and what not if you're interested.<br>
<br>
What about Patriot act 2 bill? Where does this leave you as far as your remarks go?<br>
<br>
I tried to find some positive comments on it, but failed, maybe you will have more luck if so inclined. So I included only one, out of many, negative comments. I also linked the draft with analyses.<br>
<br>
Please dont take this as bashing of you or the US in general, this is a turbulent time indeed, with alot of emotions invested. And if you think I'm way off target here ,then I can respect that, and I'm sorry if I upset you.<br>

Kad, the opinion piece may be in the Times of London, but two points.  First, Fox news and the Times have the same owner:  Rupert Murdoch.  Second- the only sources in Britain that support the war- the Times, Sky News(our version of Fox news) and the Sun tabloid- are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> owned by Rupert Murdoch.  So it can hardly be called the mainstream British press.  Second, Ann Clywd's political agenda was supportive of a war of regime change long before WMD was ever an issue with this Labour government.  In fact, her position was so compromised that she wasn't even put on the speaking list for the war debate- the Speaker of the House said that her contribution could only be &quot;disruptive&quot;.  A lone voice from the Labour back benches versus 149 votes for the substantive ammendment, does not a mainstream make <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
EDIT:  Side note Kad- a site you may be interested in, Veterans in the US who oppose the war but who support American troops:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vaiw.org/vet/index.php">www.vaiw.org/vet/index.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Lot of good articles there.  Let me also congratulate US troops and US + UK special forces who risked their lives to rescue a teenage PoW.  Against this war I may be, but that operation is a tribute to the great spirit and courage of coalition forces, and an encouraging sign that we won't leave our comrades at the mercy of what everyone acknowledges is a brutal regime.<br>
<br>
However, I cannot stress enough how much the vast majority of the British press, and public and political opinion is against the idea of our troops dying for regime change in a region that has been torn apart by the failures of regime change.  Yes, Saddam's regime is horrific, but I don't think any government we leave behind will be any better.  A small collection of squabbling opposition leaders who hate each other only slightly less than Saddam, with absolutely 0 experience in government.  <br>
<br>
No civilian infrastructure being discussed.  In fact, the transitional administration is planned to be run from the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pentagon</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not even the State department.  Look at the history of regime change in the region, show me a single success Kad.  Whatever government we leave behind, it will inevitably be tainted in the region by the leavings of a military administration of a country and the presence of foreign troops on its soil, both clear signs of occupation.  <br>
<br>
Occupation, neocolonialism and foreign influence only used to be ideas on the fringes of Arab politics- men like Osama bin Laden were dismissed as raving lunatics by the Arab press, with their far-fetched conspiracy theories.  Pick up any Arab news source today and you see the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>same arguments</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Osama bin Laden has been making for a generation, now part of the mainstream.  If ever he needed an example to hold up to would-be Al-Qaeda recruits, an example of foreign aggression, he now has it.  <br>
<br>
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president said he feared this war would create &quot;a hundred bin-Ladens&quot;, his very words.  Those aren't the words of a fanatical muslim cleric, but of a moderate, democratic Arab and Muslim leader- that worries me deeply.  When Egypt and Turkey, democratic, moderate Arab &amp; Muslim countries, our allies, oppose a war on their doorstep, why didn't we listen to them?  If we continue to ignore the Egyptians, the Palestinians and the Turks, if we closet ourselves only with Israel's position in the region...will that not increase terror?  Don't take my word for it, visit any political think-tank's website, 99% of them are saying exactly the same thing.<br>
<br>
PS-  Kad, if that's football, why don't they play the game with their feet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     And helmets?

<br>
personally, i have never registered to vote, i don't really bother with politics, i do make it known who i wish would win, but to lazy to actually go out and do it. id probally say i sway to the republican side.  after sept. 11 there was alot of talk about why we didn't see this coming etc.  there were comments made that we had information, but it wasn't passed along etc.<br>
<br>
americans enjoy to many freedoms in some cases, some people i feel are way to liberal when it comes to trivial things.  i also feel that the rights of some are overlooked in the process of securing rights for others. not much personally i can do, and it doesnt really affect me much.<br>
<br>
but the diversity of people in government and diff parties even it out or keep it in check.<br>
<br>
i checked out your links, and honestly i dont find them disturbing in the least bit, i think its a good idea, i don't feel my freedom or privacy is in threat by it, but then again it really doesnt affect me, can spy on me 24 hours aday would be boring experience for the watcher <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i think if we had more of it going on maybe we could have prevented 9/11<br>
<br>
i asked my husband, who is in law enforcement and a registered republican, he said yeah, and told me about something where libraries kept track of what books people would take out, and maybe keep eye on a person etc. he didn't find it disturbing either and is for it also.<br>
<br>
though im sure you would find more americans who were against it.<br>
<br>
from reading this board and talking to alot of players from other countries, i find it interesting how much non-american, average people talk so much about politics, in america and in my life, be it at home, work etc, we don't discuss these things much. we do discuss things now because of war. but if there was no war, we wouldn't discuss this, yet i feel you probally would be xezzt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Ur security service could have prevented it by listening to Mossad and Egypt, both warned CIA 3 months prior. So I dont see why all this spying got enforced now, since there was enough information to prevent it and it was simply the failure of CIA.<br>
Afterall the investigation on strange put-option exchanges got stoped immediatly after a german bank reported largescale trades that where leading back to CIA (dont remember the name of who exactly it was, something around NR.3, but if u challenge me, ill find that name).<br>
But i guess we gonna know more about this in 20 to 30 years, because the us likes to lay dust upon its citizen in the name of national security (usually its for around 70years, but i saw 2 senators say in a interview this time it would be 20 to 30 years). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khardrosie>KhardrosIE</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freebsd.org/gifs/dae_up3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(4/3/03 11:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> smeg off</span><hr size=1> xezzt:  actually i'm writing a research paper about the legislation being enacted in america through the fear created by &quot;terrorism&quot; -- which includes both the patriot act and the DSEA (patriot act 2).  there is virtually no coverage about this in the mainstream american media.  the bush administration has currently repealed so many freedom of information acts and classified so much -- there hasn't been a push like this since the nixon administration.<br>
<br>
bush has allowed for non-citizens accused of terrorism (which with the new definition &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; can include valid political organizations) to be secretly arrested, secretly tried by a military tribunal (without having to know about the evidence or charges), and summarily put to death in the case of capital crimes.  the patriot act directly infringes on the first and fourth amendment of all americans - and of course terrorists don't deserve the protection of the constitution (ashcroft or chaney i forget -- works cited page is on my laptop =/).<br>
<br>
the DSEA is really scary, it was leaked on jan 10th or so by the Center for Public Integrity.  it looks to be finished, and has been sent to the speaker of the house and chaney, but has yet to be formally introduced to congress.  the scariest thing that is contains is now american citizens who affiliate with any &quot;terrorist&quot; group can now have their citizenship striped by the justice department (heil ashcroft!!!) and deported to anywhere in the world.  they are also no longer under the protection of the constitution (see first paragraph - sup secret police).<br>
<br>
but i dunno i'm a political novice so i dunno why i'm even feeding the fire.<br>

if you can accept these acts and say, &quot;well at least i've got nothing to worry about&quot;, then i ask what kind of an american are you?<br>

well you don't see much on the evening news about all this--if you do any bit of research on the political actions of the bush regime you (hopefully) would be alarmed as well.<br>
<br>
i guess maybe i am &quot;paranoid&quot; -- i suppose i just object to secret arrests, military tribunals, and executions.<br>
<br>
on a side note to macattack:  i love my country and am fairly happy to live here.  i do, however, have issues with the way the country is run~<br>
<br>
btw my research topic owns you thx~ (its better than some of the other kids' papers, &quot;Charles Schultz and his effects on American society&quot; -- seriously who the hell really wants to research something like that)<br>
<br>
oh yes and TEXAS SUCKS<br>
