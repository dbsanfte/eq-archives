I not sure.<br>
<br>
The way I have always felt is, your officers make decisions for your guild, you follow those decisions regardless if you personally like or dilike or believe or do not believe in them.  You stick with those decisions of your officers, that is what they are there for, and for you to show your loyalty, you agree.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is your personality or the lack of true leadership in MiM for officers to  say &quot;This is how it is, if you don't like it, GTFO&quot;, I am not sure.  It could be a leadership issue, as MiM has no true guild leader(Perplexer been gone) and a lot of officers left creating I am sure a little chaos as people got situated/promoted to fill those vacancies.<br>
<br>
I am an outsider of your guild trying to work out a peace over a stupid war, and I don't get the road block from your officers as I do the membership, and you cannot deny that you were one of those major road blocks.<br>
<br>
Now, I never had a problem with you before this war, in fact I only had a problem with you during peace process and I was very surprised how you, and other ex-OM members talked about us.  Thus as I said, I will be very reasonable to you and work with you to resolve our differences as a mature person, and to pardon my language this one time(as you were one of the biggest pains in my ass towards peace), I will be a fucking shit load more fucking merciful towards you than us.  Remember that when you think what dickheads we are.  I will even do you a favor and log into EQ so this can be resolved as quickly as possible and you allowed to move on, as I would not want to be a jack ass and postpone your peace for 10 months.<br>

     If you truely read my post's you would have seen i never had an issue peaceing DoZ. I had an issue peaceing Sadko who continulally grief's people. You can defend him but i remember him coming to MiM's board and attempting to block strydere's recruitment application. This is my grudge against him outside this war. I do regret you got caught up in it with the rest of your friends but you refuse to let him deal with his own problems.  <br>

Perhaps the worst (or best?) memories of the war with MiM are those pvping Zaria and Setti who are truly well played characters. I have died to Zaria's crits probably more than to rest of MiM combined (and that includes HTs that you guys always save for me) and believe me or not, I keep no ill feelings towards them.<br>
<br>
You Shao, however are a different story. I saw you PvPing total of 2 times in over a year. You fought this war on message boards. If you were Rullz, believe me, you would have easier time.<br>
<br>
DoZ does not believe or approve of Perma KoS practice, we are the guild that suffered from that the most, but we believe in people paying the checks their mouth wrote. If you still wish to resolve your problems with DoZ, I suggest talking to Tempra (guild leader) because I, as an officer won't take responsibility for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chilea>Chilea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(11/10/03 10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=592.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sup shaoshorty!</span><hr size=1> <br>

I can't get in game yet.  I am on dial up for the time and have to download a couple hours of patches, so if you see me in game, it is not me.<br>
<br>
We may have to discuss this tomorrow night, for I will be at casino for most of the day.<br>
<br>
Sadko is a part of DoZ, so I would disagree that you don't/didn't have a problem with it.  Regardless of anything, people had to disband DoZ in order to then pay their way off.<br>
<br>
You say Sadko griefed.  But what is war?  It sure hasn't been &quot;happy fun super cool flower time&quot; for us.  Want to talk about griefed?  How about having highest flag Plane of Tactics.  Then how about zoning into that zone about 5 times in the past 8 months.  This was war.  It is the entire concept I have tried to get MiM people to understand(when people complain about tactics/strategy used in war).  You cannot peace without a cease fire, you cannot peace pointing fingers who did what when or to who(cuz both sides guilty).  I am sure things must of been so rough and grieving for you and your mates during the war when you got flagged all the way to Elemental Planes and saw things that I may never see in game.<br>
<br>
Sure I could ditch on friends and paid a price and maybe see this stuff, all of us could have(cept sadko and seeknd).  Bending over my pals and riding their hershey highway isn't my idea of fun though.<br>
<br>
So, I will try to figure out this private message thing you talked about, as you can tell I don't post or use this shit much.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I will hopefully be in game tomorrow night and as I said, we can work this out as quickly as possible.<br>

<br>
Srobb I'm dissapointed in you, MIM as done so much for you, dicking other warriors on loot simply because you were our MT (not your fault, but still). You've gotten so much from us, and the moment we go through a rough patch, you bail. Your reasons for leaving MIM were trivial, and the incident that made you type /guildremove was rediculous. I fail to see it as anything other than an excuse to move on to higher end loot. Perhaps I'm wrong, if you truely feel I'm mistaken, feel free to /tell me in game, I'd like to hear your side of things.<br>
<br>
I find it kind of funny that you will be paying or doing something to get off of DoZ's kos list, being one of the main enforcers of kos'ing DoZ forever, and after all of the anti DoZ comments you have posted on our private forums.<br>
<br>
Far as Srobb's skill goes? He's a good warrior, skill wise he'd make a good addition to AD, he has what it takes to be a warrior in a high end guild. I personally think he could use some work in positioning but hey, no ones perfect. Oh and BTW, don't let him pull in PoE he sux at it =p, donno why he always insisted on doing it, lol.<br>
<br>
What ever happens, best of luck to you Srobb.<br>

   I dont think you now the full story of why i left. Id be glad to explain it to you sometime if you really wanna know. <br>
<br>
<br>
   As for snubing other warriors to gear me up i dont think that ever happened. I had the highest warrior loot ratio when i left. I had over 100 more raids then our second warrior. I also only missed around 10 raids since ubertanka left the guild. I researched strats, ran raids, main tanked, and pulled at times. Sorry if you feel i didnt do enough or earn my keep. I did try my best to make MiM a better guild. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    As for kos'ing DoZ i wasnt the only one against peace far from it. I never said kos them forever. I stated many times peace should be made by a case by case basis. As for paying to get off kos the verdict is still out on that.<br>
<br>
<br>
   As far as skill goes i agree theirs alotta area's i can work on. I dunno exactly which mobs you felt my positioning was weak but id like to hear it sometime. The only mobs i felt uncomfortable on really were those gay PoF birds.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanerian@ascension10244>Tanerian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.insanitysedge.com/~teren/MIMTeren75s.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#333333>(11/11/03 8:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=592.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~</span><hr size=1> No I don't know the reasons that's why I said feel free to explain. I never said you didn't deserve what you got, and I even said it wasn't your fault, but other warriors did get snubbed when it came to loot vs you, I witnessed it in LC , and I've even heard it straight from the mouths of officers that you get special treatment and more consideration on loots, because you were the MT. <br>
<br>
Don't know why you mentioned anything about how active you were, in reply to my post, I never said anything about that, other than You have what it takes to be a warrior in AD, nor did I say you didn't do enough to earn your keep. Please read what I wrote.<br>
<br>
I was being honest and doing my best not to start a flame in my post, so please don't get defensive about anything. <br>
<br>
I just don't see any reason for you to have left, maby it's just coincidence that you left soon as MIM got to a rough point, /shrug.<br>

<br>
As long as we never disbanded, and as long as we kept fighting, doing raids as a guild, recruiting as a guild, then war not over.<br>
<br>
Regardless, Srobb had plenty to do with war.  He was hardcore Pro-War on your message boards.  Hmm wait, are you an officer Justdis?  Cuz if you are an officer, and if officers agreed to my peace proposals that they took to your membership, then it means you did as well.  If you not an officer, then know your role and shut yer hole.<br>
<br>
Posting hardcore Pro-War statements does keep a war going.  It intimidates other members who may want peace, cuz the hardcore Pro-War people will say things like &quot;you pussy&quot;.  People feel it best to just not say anything rather than cause a inner guild flame fest.  Posting those messages can also sway people whose opinion is neutral on the matter.<br>
<br>
It never ceases to amaze me how fairly ignorant you are Justdis, but then again you are the one who cried and whined in the first place to start the war over you trying to KS.<br>
<br>
Srobb, I have some info for you.  I still have not been able to get in game though, just got back from casino gambling.<br>
Just wanted to touch base and maybe I get in later tonight.<br>
