You cite proof sources of which you have no personal knowledge (or you do and prefer to obfuscate that) of the agendas behind the statistical data, ie who's funding it, who's conducting it etc.<br>
<br>
How about this time you take a real look at what you actually spend in real US dollars on taxes.  When I do all the calculations (Fed tax-refund/state tax/property tax/vehicle tax/gas tax/6% on all purchases of my taxed income/profits taken and taxed) I find that my taxed income exceeds 40%.  Now it stands to reason that I'm not taking into consideration other taxes I'm paying, so I'm getting much closer to that 50% in tax burden than not.  <br>
<br>
What's really scary for an average person is when you compute your monthly obligations out including your tax burden.<br>
<br>
~42% Taxes <br>
~$400 in groceries<br>
~$800 car payments<br>
~$1000 for child care<br>
~$400 for pre-school<br>
~$1000 to retirement<br>
~$600 for college<br>
~$800 for insurance<br>
<br>
The biggest flaw in all your argument is using statistical data that gives you percentages as an obligation instead of real dollars.  I personally have zero problem with someone that has figured out how to make $900,000 per year in income and when they pay $150,000 to $300,000 in taxes (keep in mind that most people in this pay group are self-employed so they end up paying double FICA taxes), then I think they have fulfilled their obligation to the rest of us in supporting the government.  <br>
<br>
Our society was supposedly built by rewarding those few people that have the drive and the talent to create or produce.  If you participate in charitable organizations have you ever noticed who is doing the ground work?  It's not other poor schmucks like me, it's those same people that pay the most real dollars in taxes.  Does the high net income person have more time available to him for charity work?  Usually those people are workaholics and they do the charity work because they make the time for it.  My point is instead of giving the government more money to spend frivolously or for their own constituent's interest, take the money back and let us do it ourselves.  Instead of whining about how the less advantaged aren't being taken care of, roll up your sleeves and do something about it...personally.  Hell....I can't say I care at all about someone that won't make any effort at all to improve their condition, but I will sure as hell reach out a hand to someone that cares enough to participate.<br>
<br>
Until the culture changes whereby we think government is our momma and poppa and take responsibility ourselves I guess you're right....taxes will continue to go up, and up, and up.<br>

The social welfare rant is funny too, as my essential issue with Bush and fiscal policy is that he makes cuts that are  irresponsible, not that he should spend more on welfare/aid to the poor.  We're leaving a legacy of debt for future generations, and with precious little purchased for those future generations to justify that debt.  I like getting more money in my paycheck as much as anyone.  I don't want any of that money, however, if it means that my son will be paying that money back in debt service. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=undinerz>UndineRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(4/21/05 8:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Estate tax repeal pending in the house--grats Wealthfare</span><hr size=1> Well...if 80% of the population is paying one amount and 20% is paying twice that then they are IN FACT paying double FICA.<br>

The point being made with the &quot;social welfare rant&quot; (nice touch there....instead of dealing with the points brought up you just turn it into a cute little denigrating phrase) is that the government is the last entity that you, or anyone else should be leaving their financial welfare to.

As for the Estate tax.. 20% of people in USA are millionares?

Argument that &quot;Paris Hilton isnt the representative of all rich kids&quot; doesnt fly here.<br>
<br>
If a person that inherits large estate (over 1 mln) is well off and working, then what is the problem? Or do you have to be able to QUIT WORKING after getting inheritance and just party hard?<br>
<br>
The law isnt even against kids like Paris Hilton (altho there needs to be a law against them), since their fortune is practically unspendable, they just cant spend money faster than they get those. The only problem with the law is that it taps into the infinite wealth that perpetuates in the upper class of the American society, where grand grand fathers made money speculating land or oil or just robbing indians and generations of people live in state of amazing luxury.<br>
<br>
I disagree on leveling tax field on rich, since I believe that those that recieve more should give more, but I can see their side of argument. This argument I just dont get, why generations of people should be filthy rich without working a day in their life just because at some point their ancestor speculated land? No wait, they will be filthy rich anyways because during their lifetimes their fortunes will more then double and even with 50% estate tax their children will inherit STILL more money. So you telling me that richer should get effortlessly RICHER without even trying and there should be a fucking law encouraging it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1633<br> <font color=#333333>(4/22/05 2:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> no one pays double FICA</span><hr size=1> Undine, if you make a salary, and your employer pays your employer contribution, do you think that your employer regards that as another cost of you as an employee? &quot;Employer contributions&quot; are essentially a shadow part of your salary, that you never see in your paycheck.

I'll start you off:<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed, under existing tax rates and reasonable assumptions about other spending, these projections make clear that the Federal budget is on an unsustainable path, in which large deficits result in rising interest rates and ever-growing interest payments that will augment deficits in future years.&quot;<br>
--Alan Greenspan, 4/21/05<br>
<br>
&quot;I was wrong like everybody else on the issue of surpluses,&quot;<br>
ibid<br>

Greenspan also said that some kind of tax increases will probably be necessary to reign in the deficit.    <br>

Some of what Friedman says makes sense, but the &quot;cut taxes uber alles&quot; screed is Friedman the ideologue talking, not the economist. Further, Friedman's exhortation to essentially ignore the debt is crazy, given who is financing that debt (in large part foreign investors), and the likely continued growth of  our  government debt, and our trade imbalance.  <br>

<br>
Essentially, by looking at 1992 and 1993 incomes in isolation, Feldstein and Feenberg were able to draw some conclusions about tax that would have been collected in 1993 if no tax increase had been put in place.  What F &amp; F specifically leave out, however, is the overall trend in incomes for wealthy tax payers from 91-95.<br>
<br>
In 1992, Clinton and Congress were widely believed to be on the threshhold of passing a tax increase,specifically to deal with the deficit.  In anticipation of this, some income that would have been paid in 1993, was shifted to the 1992 tax year (through exercise of options, early Wall St bonus pays, etc).  So, while it's certainly true to say that taxable incomes for high income earners fell from 1992-1993, that's only part of the picture.  The reality is that incomes jumped substantially from the 1991-1992 tax year(27%), fell in 1993, and then resumed normal growth patterns thereafter.

<br>
In short, Feenberg and Feldstein were able to show a one time tax avoidance effect due to anticipated changes in the tax code, whoopee, not exactly news.  You , however, have overblown their conclusions into a long term trend that just isn't there Mith.  Are taxes somewhat inefficient? Sure, people have the ability to game the system. As tax rates increase, the incentive for avoidance behaviors rises with them.  But the statement that more taxes=less revenue, and its converse, has not been proven empirically true for anything other than the very short term. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mithrilleyes>mithrilleyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.philbrodieband.com/Slide13.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#333333>(4/26/05 10:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: please</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;But the statement that more taxes=less revenue, and its converse, has not been proven empirically true for anything other than the very short term.<br>
<br>
Just quickly, this is not what I said. I said higher tax rates do not ALWAYS raise revenues. If you raised everyone's taxes to 90%, to give you an extreme example, revenues would drop because people would a)stop working at their maximum productive level b)would find ways to evade taxes. This is basically the Laffer curve, which I am sure you know already.<br>

Some people don't believe in the curve, but most respected economist do. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have called this paper an analytical review of&quot;supply-side economics,&quot; a term associated in the United States with extravagant claims about the effects of changes in the tax structure on capital accumulation. In a sense, the analysis I have reviewed here supports these claims: Under what I view as conservative assumptions, I estimated that eliminating capital income taxation would increase capital stock by about 35 percent.... The supply-side economists, if that is the right term for those whose research I have been discussing, have delivered the largest genuinely free lunch I have seen in 25 years in this business, and I believe we would have a better society if we followed their advice.&quot;<br>

LOLOLOLOL.  Please, please read the papers you cut, paste and link. From the Goolsbee article you linked:<br>
&quot;As a testable hypothesis, however, the original Laffer curve has not fared well...the public has taken the explosion of budget deficits...as a refutation of the idea. More careful<br>
econometric analysis has not been any more supportive.&quot; <br>
<br>
From the author's conclusion in that same paper:<br>
&quot;The notion that governments could raise more money by cutting rates is, indeed, a glorious idea.<br>
It would permit a Pareto improvement of the most enjoyable kind. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Unfortunately for all of us, the data<br>
from the historical record suggest that it is unlikely to be true at anything like today’s marginal tax rates.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It seems that, for now at least, we will have to keep paying for our tax cuts the old fashioned way.<br>
<br>
The Laffer Curve is viewed as utterly refuted by most economists.  Econometric analysis simply doesn't bear it out, and indeed, such analysis was not part of the curve's conception. Laffer theorized that there *might* be such a curve.  If the folklore is true, he drew it on a napkin over dinner with a colleague.  As pretty pictures help tell stories (even untrue ones) to voters, Americans were flimflammed with it.  If you like, I can walk you through Goolsbee's analysis, as well as the mile high view of what, exactly, econometric analysis involves, and why that methodology is powerful in testing economic hypotheses.<br>
<br>
Further, Goolsbee says:&quot;Using the same methods that NTR authors have used for the 1980s, the elasticities of taxable income calculated for other tax changes seem to be much more modest with several indistinguishable from zero.&quot;<br>
<br>
Essentially Laffer postulates that income is elastic (meaning it has a negative correlative response) with respect to tax rates.  Laffer postulates the existence of some curve representing some point at which the incentive for avoidance is so large, that tax increases lose revenues.  Goolsbee's work, using F&amp;F's own methodology, shows that for most periods, the historical records of the government would indicate this elasticity to be much less than unitary(meaning less than one).   Income elasticity at any point in the income spectrum would only produce the kind of effects Mith describes (losing revenue with an increase) if it were greater than one.  So, for increases in the tax rate, you'll lose *more* {damn typos}revenue to tax inefficiency than the amount of the increase itself. <br>

All of this budget mumbo-jumbo is trash.  The estate tax is a tax that hits the government directly, so you can stop the economic theory in this one.  <br>
<br>
The primary crux of Bumraz's statements are that Bush is pandering to the rich, which he is.  There are hundreds of thousands of important issues in our day and age, and he's clearly picking the ones to support the prime revenue generators.  I personally have no problem wit this, but from a socally minded standpoint it's wrong, especially at this point in time.  Our economy is going to be a trainwreck in the very near future, and sadly it's going to take an extreme democratic congress to pass a bunch of bullshit laws to balance out all these bullshit republican ones.  I wish that we could have an honest, fiscally minded congress who just tried to do what's right for the country...I'm not holding my breath...<br>
<br>
The one thing I can firmly side with Kura/Dae on is that &quot;death tax&quot; is exactly that.  You die, you pay.  End of story.  And while the beneficiaries of the estate are the ones who pay those charges, estates almost always have to be liquidated, in part or in whole, to pay those taxes.  Then the inheritants end up with a stack of cash, no doubt, but they do frequently lose the family farm.  <br>
<br>
Land is the hardest, and in rural communities it happens well over half the time Bumraz.  I'm a community banker in a VERY rural area.  I've seen lots of family farms come up for auction for that very reason.  You're statement that this only effects the rich isn't fair.  The last few times I've seen this happen was with average farmers, who spent their entire lives amassing land &amp; equipment, then they die suddenly and given that the land is usually partially mortgaged, for the benefit of equipment purchase, there is -0- liquid cash in the estate, and once the estate tax kicks in it's been 40%, and that was AFTER the last estate tax cut.  I can't personally remember what was paid before that, but my grandfather died in 1989 and paid ~42% tax on his estate.  Luckily he had planned a little ahead and had some whole life insurance along with successful children in their own rite, but a family farmer who's kids either work the farm or work a lower middle class job can't even think about shouldering that tax load.  The estate tax is wrong, and while some multi-billionaires will benefit, those are a vastly small portion and they generate plenty of sales/luxury tax on their own, along with their spoiled-Paris Hilton-esque children.  You watch, Paris will end up in BR after her parents are gone.  That's Darwin's law in a financial environment.  <br>
<br>
Back to the main point of what Bumraz has to say, now is the wrong time to do this.  This should have been changed, but it should have been part of an entire income tax revamp.  As wrong as this tax is, I believe it's just as wrong to change it in this day and age, by itself.  Bumraz's points on the AMT are also dead on the money(no pun intended).  <br>
<br>
My personal opinion on the Estate tax is that it's paid by the successful who die unexpectedly.  There is an annual exlcusion to the gift tax (11k/year) and successful, upper-middle class people use it throughout their entire life to move that money down the line, and if they're like my grandfather, they pass on a sense of financial responsibility with it.  <br>

question 1. Life insurance. Isnt it an option for farmers? Especially if they are sole owners of the farm? If farm is a complex financial entity to operate, arent people aware of complications that arise from sudden death?<br>
<br>
question 2. the scary scenarior is it only cause with a sole benefactor? I mean, if a sole benefactor isnt a farmer himself, i really dont care what happends because farm should belong to someone that farms the land, not to someone that comes for a week from city to relax a la Bush, but lets assume its family business, wouldnt actually splitting inheritance between relatives eliminate the problem completely?
