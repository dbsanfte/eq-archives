<br>
This is just a post of my desire to rejoin Ascending Dawn.  I have seen tons of new names since my return, so I'll give you a recap of my EQ history.  I was the original owner of Luta (65 barbarian rogue) back in the first days of Everquest.  I was one of the first rogues in POF and POH and had a blast.  I met lots of great friends back then, many of which are in AD now.  A few months after Kunark came out, Everquest lost it's magic and became a source of negativity in my life.  That is when i retired from EQ for the first time and my original account left my possession.<br>
<br>
I came back (I think it's been like two years now) with a gnome rogue named Livre.  I joined HoX with those wonderful norweigens we all know and love.  Soon after, while I was still leveling to 60, Ascending Dawn was formed from HoX, Sancti and a number of other guilds.  I retired for the second time about this time last year.  This time, it was a lot less negative.  I met a wonderful girl and tricked her into wanting to marry me.  We'll be getting married on November 8th; if she doesn't kill me for my EQ habits first.  The new graphics also made Livre look so stupid (little flaming Italian guy =/).<br>
<br>
So Grosca was born April 2nd of this year.  I knew little of beastlords when I started this iksar bst, but damn are they fun!  I actually have the ability to tank, slow and buff.  I am currently level 65 with 50 AA's.  I plan on having the other 50 before November or December, but hopefully sooner.<br>
<br>
They consist of: <br>
<br>
run3<br>
regen3<br>
nd3<br>
ca3<br>
pos<br>
bf5<br>
lr1<br>
<br>
I know there are some critical raiding abilities that I need to aquire.  I expect to have mgb, scr3, ambidex, and pet hold by october.  After finishing lr5 I will be focusing on offensive aa's (and wasting 10 on suspend minion eventually because it sounds fun).<br>
<br>
My gear at the moment is a mix of ornate and cheap bazaar stuff.  I'm focusing on exping and not gear for right now.<br>
<br>
As most know, I've always been willing to pvp.  I would not rank myself up there with the best of them, but it took some guts to pvp with rogues before any of the expansions.  They wear horribly underpowered! <br>
<br>
I have two sponsers currently; Vanessalynne and Kwaij.  I think there are a lot of AD that already know me well, but I'm always looking to spend more time with members.  I spend lots of time in PoV and BoT, since I have only 1 flag.  You can also find me on Xenith and Xizzt often.<br>
<br>
Please provide feedback, both good and bad.  I know I have a long ways to go before I'm ready to rejoin, but I can't imagine any other guild to join.  <br>
<br>
Also, thanks to many of you that have helped me out a ton so far and in the past.  If it wasn't for you guys, this whole experience would be pointless.<br>
<br>
I apologize for any bad humor I may have used in this post.  As Adell and Winas will tell you, I've got a shitty sense of humor.  Oh well!<br>

At any rate, I know he will be there when things get rough, and I never have to worry about his competance in game, whether it is PvE, or PvP.<br>
<br>
In summary, I think he will be a great addition to the guild.<br>

You sold your first rogue, then retired your second, and you're now a beastlord. What's stopping you from selling or retiring the beastlord?

I assumed they'd be brought up.<br>
<br>
First off, in regards to the sold account.  Selling accounts has never been looked upon highly by most people who play Everquest, especially higher end players both back in the day and currently.  Please remember that this account was sold four years ago; it wasn't a recent thing at all.  I, myself, (before this happened) never liked the idea of selling accounts, buying accounts, etc.  The problem was that EQ had become such a huge part of my life that it was drastically affecting my RL negatively.  What do you do when you're playing a game that makes you very unhappy?  Most normal people would stop playing it.  What do you do when your life is so bound to this game that you can't imagine just stopping cold-turkey?  I expressed my situation to somebody in game and was given a way out, which I took.  I often regret doing that, but it was four years ago and there isn't anything I can do about it now.<br>
<br>
In regards to changing mains, I'm not really familiar with that rule.  It's been a while since I had access to the AD rules since I was put on the &quot;retired&quot; list a while back.  Livre is still in Ascending Dawn and I've never been approached about being deguilded.  Even after retiring Livre, I loved coming back and seeing posts by my friends.  When I talked with some officers about the process to reguild Grosca, it was pretty obvious that there would have to be some sort of reapplication process.  There are lots of new people in AD that have no clue as to who I am.<br>
<br>
If changing mains means that I want to play my beastlord now primarily, that would be the case.  I don't think a level 60 rogue (even though he is a gnome!) would be useful to anyone.  <br>
<br>
Please let me know what you guys think and feel free to drop me a tell in game.  I'm up to 53 aa's now!

<br>
I'm up to 83 aa's now.  <br>
<br>
=======<br>
<br>
I now have:<br>
<br>
run3, regen3<br>
<br>
SCR3, ND3, CA3<br>
<br>
MGB, Ambidexerity, Paragon<br>
<br>
LR2, BF5<br>
<br>
=======<br>
<br>
This fulfills the required aa abilities for my class for AD recruitment.  I will be spending the next two weeks or so getting the other 17 aa's I need.  I'm working on LR5 now and then Suspend Minion.  After that, I'm not sure yet.  If anyone has suggestions, feel free to share.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<br>
I decided to put some AA into mental clarity as in exp groups lately I ferocity as many people as mana and recast allows, since the removal of the reagent, and at 600 mana a cast every 3 mins it takes a chunk considering you are also melleeing not medding. Also there is a huge lack of beastlord FT gear, none of the elemental stuff you will get will have any mana regen on it.  It seems to help.<br>
<br>
Glad to see you apply btw and look forward to your attendance at raids, you have been cool to talk to in game.<br>
<br>
Flupher only has 75 aa atm though and I keep hearing conflicting advice about planar power. <br>
