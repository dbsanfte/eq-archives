&quot;Lawmakers have been increasingly uneasy about the rising human toll and financial costs of U.S. involvement in Iraq. They have questioned whether the Bush administration has done enough to win international assistance and how long U.S. troops will have to remain there.&quot;<br>
<br>

&quot;<br>
The University of Miami School of Business/Zogby International poll of Latin American elites found that only 12 percent of those questioned rated President Bush's performance on Latin America as positive. <br>
<br>
<br>
In Brazil, Latin America's largest country, 98 percent gave the U.S. leader a negative mark. <br>
<br>
<br>
In Mexico, where President Vicente Fox  has been frustrated in his quest to improve the lot of 3 million to 5 million Mexicans living illegally in the United States, just 5 percent gave Bush positive grades.&quot;<br>
<br>
in addition bushs policies toward the military and its veterans wont give him any love from that camp, expect them to vote against him as well<br>

• ''A week of unrelenting bad news for President George Bush was capped yesterday by a new poll showing that Americans are losing faith in his ability to handle foreign policy crises - something the White House had expected to be a major asset as he prepares his 2004 re-election campaign.''--Rupert Cornwell, The Independent, 10/4/03<br>
<br>
• “... if you look at the issues ahead of us, and consider that Bush has lost the integrity issue over the Iraq WMD lies, and then factor in the voters’ views on the direction of the country, you see that Bush has incumbency and money going for him in the coming months, but not much else.”--The Left Coaster, 7/12/03<br>
<br>
• “Bush turned surpluses into deficits and transformed a robust, job-creating economy into the mess we see today.... Good luck running on the ruined wreck Bush made of the Clinton Boom. Or the mess Bush made of Iraq.”--MikeHersh.com, 10/2/03<br>
<br>
• “The press has become a lot less shy about pointing out the administration's exploitation of 9/11, partly because that exploitation has become so crushingly obvious.... in the past six weeks President Bush has invoked 9/11 not just to defend Iraq policy and argue for oil drilling in the Arctic, but in response to questions about tax cuts, unemployment, budget deficits and even campaign finance.”--Paul Krugman, The New York Times, 9/11/03<br>
<br>
• “Just as in 1973, when they lost confidence in Richard Nixon and the prestigious newspapers and TV network news shows seemed to open their pages and screens to those eager to explore the holes in his Watergate argument, so too has the liberal elite now seem to have gathered enough energy to expose the lies and weaknesses in Bush and company's Iraq story.”--Saul Landau, author of Pre-emptive Empire: A Guide to Bush’s Kingdom, CounterPunch, 10/2/03<br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;What is the standard of impeachment? Clearly if the standard is now what the House of Representatives did in the impeachment of Bill Clinton [in 1998], the actions of this president are much more serious in terms of dereliction of duty.&quot;--Sen.

• “This administration is the worst as far as job creation since that of Herbert Hoover…At the same time, he's talking about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>providing health care for the people of Iraq</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Yet he's done absolutely nothing for the people here who are without health care -- people who have to choose between buying prescriptions or food,''--William Burga, president of the Ohio AFL-CIO<br>
• “When Bush's popularity ratings were in the stratosphere, Republican legislators contentedly basked in his warmth. The White House political operation could threaten to discipline Republican legislators who defected, refusing favors and even threatening challenges in primaries. Those days are simply gone. Nothing succeeds like success. And nothing fails like failure.”--Robert Kuttner The Boston Globe, 10/01/03<br>
<br>
• “George W. Bush confronts one of the most difficult choices of his life: Should he turn Iraq over to the UN and thus save the lives of our men and women in uniform, but lose the oil, the campaign cash, and probably the election? Or should he keep our troops in Iraq to protect Halliburton, Bechtel, and his other Republican corporate campaign donors, skim millions in campaign cash out of the billions these friendly corporations are being paid by American taxpayers, and hope all that money can buy enough commercials to make Americans forget about the price of gasoline, growing Iraqi nationalism, and the resulting coffins returning to America on a daily basis.”--CommonDreams.org, 9/4/03<br>

At least 50 percent of Americans own a portfoilio or mutual fund.  If you do not know what portfolio is or you do not understand the signifigance of that statement then let me know and I will explain it to you.<br>

I find it funny and surprising that in your world you think the Dems are banking on the supposed ignorance of the American people to win.  Wait...actually I am not that surprised at all.<br>

As far as Bush being dumb you should know that he got better grades in college than Howard Dean and they went to the same college.

The timing, coordination and sophistication of the attacks show two things.  First, that there is cooperation between local resistance and foreign fighters- and second, that there is a criminal lack of good intelligence on the ground.  The only way to defeat insurgency is hard intelligence- there isn't any indication of even who is behind the attacks.  No intelligence, porous borders and badly overstretched forces- if none of these issues is addressed then things are going to get a hell of a lot worse.  <br>
<br>
That sort of leadership must come from the top- and the administration is letting down its armed forces badly in this regard.  If Rumsfeld hadn't opposed Pentagon plans for double the forces- the borders might well have been sealed early and the central region mostly pacified.  Disbanding the Iraqi army completely- putting a million well trained and armed people out of work wasn't exactly a brainwave either.<br>
<br>
The result is a hugely hindered reconstruction, chaos on the ground.  Aid agencies, and by extension businesses are scaling back their staff by the day, and private money will soon also take flight.  Although foreign fundamentalist fighters were responsible, they could not operate successfully in Iraq without a local power base and local support.  The only way to undermine that power base is a political solution- guerilla wars cannot be won by purely military means, but they can be lost that way.  <br>
<br>
A political settlement and a return to sovreignty is the only way out of this type of conflict.  We must ask ourselves- if the state of Israel with brutal and oppressive security policies hasn't been able to curb militancy through force for half a century- then what hope does the coalition have pursuing similarly brutal means?  Such madness, when political empowerment could bring it to an end almost instantly in either case.<br>
<br>
Trying to put a positive spin on this bloody mess is ridden with pitfalls, here's a couple of articles that show it quite well.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/30/opinion/30DOWD.html">www.nytimes.com/2003/10/3...0DOWD.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
As far as the presidential race goes- I wouldn't say that Americans &quot;don't care&quot; about the 6,000 civilian deaths in Iraq or the 5,000 plus innocent civilian deaths in Afghanistan or the death of their own troops- but they care far less about it than their own jobs and the state of their own economy.  That's just human nature- most places aren't any different.  One would hope trust might turn things for the better- lying about the reasons for war is little better than a prosecutor tampering with evidence and saying &quot;I know he's guilty, and even if he ain't, he's a scumbag &amp; should be put away.&quot;  Then again, if previous administrations have got away with the Gulf of Tonkin, Noriega, Iran Contra- there's little reason why telling the truth should be any more important this time.  The truth could probably go hang itself as long as enough people are well off and in work.<br>
<br>
In a sense I couldn't care less who wins- whoever gets the job will inherit the disastrously incompetent post-war plan<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>s</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (let's not forget about Afghanistan), a huge national debt that'll need to be repaid and a seriously low international standing.  Stupendous blunders of that scale won't be sorted out by whoever inherits the post, certainly not in the next 4-5 years.<br>
