It's a HUMAN CONSTRUCT! But true to his irresponsible nature, man won't own up to being its engineer, so he blames his dark deeds on my ilk! But his selfishness is limitless. And its not enough to shadow his own existance- NO! He turned Hell into a suffering pit. Fire; Wailing; Darkness-the kind of place anyone would do anything to get out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is beyond your abilities to simply make self-recompense for the sins you commit! No-you choose rather to create a pyscho-drama and dwell on a fallace belief that God can never forgive your grievest offenses! So you bring your guilt, and your inner decay with you to Hell, where the Horde imaginations of so many gluttons for punishment gave birth to the sickness that has infected the Abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there begging to be punished! And in doing so, they have transformed the cold and solitude to pain and misery! I spent eons, privy to the flames, inhaling the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I KNOW WHAT AFFECT SUCH HORDES HAVE ON THE DELICATE PYSCHE OF AN ANGELIC BEING!&quot;-Azryl, &quot;Dogma&quot;<br>

Tonight i finally realized how much i let people use me in EverQuest. I have been quite generous to people and in return i receive nothing but 9-1-1 calls for assistance in powerleveling, twinking, corpse retrievals because certain people cannot think with a clear head and say, &quot;Hey, i should not be doing this because its way ahead of my league.&quot; But no-these certain people try to boost themselves by using me to gain advances when truly the game was not meant for this intervention. Yes, i can help people out here and there, but do not even think for one second i will be your Gold mine for LdoN tradeables, Flags to upgrade your PoP charm, Powerleveling due to the lack of energy in leveling a character on their own, and assistance in all of the worst places because they were over confident and expected that because a zone was hard 5 years ago that it will be cake when you return to that zone. I am sick and tired of these so called &quot;friends&quot; who demand that i be behind them because of how hard i worked and earned to get my character to such a great degree. GROUPIES- that is all you people are to me. Seriously it just amazes me how these players maintain entertainment in this game with using their &quot;friends&quot; or others and in return show nothing but lack of friendship.  And tonight being a day off without raiding, I decide to do a quest for myself-something i rarely do and i get demanded to assist in more adventures in babysitting twinked players who do not know how to play the game anymore than a newcomer just creating his first character. I have been patient with every single one of these people and the time has come to let these ties go.<br>
If ever these so called &quot;friends&quot; wishes for my presence, do not come to me because you need something-do it because you actually have something to say from inside your little head that is worth more than pixels to flant at other players or talk about with when you go outside and do RL activities. <p>What NiN am I?<br>

when the server's a bit amiss<br>
and the zone's go down<br>
across Rallos Zek<br>
I get down<br>
I feel had<br>
I feel on the verge of going mad<br>
and then it's time to punch the clock<br>
<br>
I go to the server select<br>
and create some damn Alt<br>
and log on as I shake my head <br>
suddenly I'm Miss High Elf<br>
Enchanter drama Queen<br>
until I get bored<br>
and put myself to bed<br>
<br>
I look back on where I'm from<br>
look at the player I've become<br>
and the strangest things<br>
seem suddenly routine<br>
I look up from my keyboards <br>
a gift-wrapped new game still in the box<br>
yet it doesn't even tempt me.<br>
<br>
So I go to the server select<br>
and create some damn Alt<br>
and log on as I shake my head<br>
Suddenly I'm Mr Troll SK<br>
Until I wake up<br>
And try to log  back on to myself<br>
<br>
Some players they have natural ease<br>
they play it any way they please<br>
with their high speed ISP's<br>
and others create endless enemies<br>
you can level  it up<br>
or even delevel  it down<br>
This is the best way that I've found<br>
to pass the time until the server goes back up<br>
<br>
So I go to the server select<br>
and create some damn Alt<br>
and log on as I shake my head<br>
suddenly I'm Mr lame  griefer<br>
from RZ<br>
until the server goes up<br>
and I can't seem to want to log on myself<br>
<br>
<br>
I post on some message boards<br>
turn up the music<br>
I'm pulling the new thing down from the shelf<br>
Suddenly I'm in a new world<br>
of pixels and flashing screens<br>
and I ain't never<br>
I'm never turning back <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=somthor>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/19/03 9:16 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=2276.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=2276.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2276.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=2276.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2276.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2276.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
