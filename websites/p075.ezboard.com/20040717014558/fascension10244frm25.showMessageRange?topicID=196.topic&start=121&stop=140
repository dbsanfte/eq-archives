Sorry, but thats a load of bs. <br>
<br>
Firstly, using the logic that if you screw up you have no right to preach out against screwing up, is rediculous. As a parent myself, I'll put it in terms you can relate to. Being that just because I do something wrong, doesn't meant I don't enforce rules against my kids doing the same. It just means I set a bad expample. ( I truly hope you don't live your life by this principle, it's a set up for failure)<br>
<br>
Secondly, for all his faults (and he has many) at least G.W. Bush didn't raise this serial raping, murdering sack of s*** - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.megastories.com/iraq/family/udai.htm">www.megastories.com/iraq/family/udai.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  <br>

I still feel you cant really be a leader if you cant get your own rank and file to toe the line.  obviously he wasnt the best role model for his own kids or he didnt pay enough attention to their development.<br>

I dont think so.  I'm not saying i believe saddam over Bush, Gawd no.  I'm just saying, bush isn't making the best judgment calls about this situation.  I honestly dont see how people can argue with that.  Not even people in the military.  <br>

Basically the reasoning is:  if the US + NATO was able to deter a huge military superpower like the Soviet Union...then tell me why they can't deter Saddam.  He poses a minute fraction of the threat, a microscopic dot upon a microscopic dot of a threat that the USSR posed the West.  Yet we deterred them for 50 years, and won't be able to deter Iraq according to Bush &amp; Blair- why?<br>
<br>
Praxx- I don't believe oil is the main reason for the present bellicose stance, but neither do I believe that disarmament is the main reason.  They are both reasons, but secondary to the primary goal of regime change.  That is the only conclusion that fits the analysis of policy, and is one I fundamentally oppose.  Flying in the face of the very principles of international law that allow us to address poverty, hunger, terrorism and international treaties- that is a dangerous game of brinkmanship to play.  Reckless, and totally unecessary is how most people in this country (and a fair few in the US) see the current rush to war.    <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And thank you to the hundreds of thousands of sailors, airmen, troops and Marines for their sacrifice to make our world a safer place. Like or dislike them, you really must admire their courage and commitment. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'll second that- and would suggest that anyone who directs dislike at the military needs their head examined.  I don't dislike them at all- I have the highest respect for them and their charge- which is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>defence of the United States</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  They're willing to risk their lives in the execution of their duty- regardless of personal feelings or misgivings.  That does take a lot of courage and commitment Kad, I agree completely.  Which is why I wish all the forces in the region the very best of luck- if it does come to a war, I'm sure we'll win comfortably- hopefully with a minimum of loss of human life.  But here's the rub- it'd be a lot easier mentally-speaking for our troops (and yours I suspect) to risk their lives under fire if they knew their publics and the international community were behind them.  Those two mandates being unequivocal, fighting effectiveness would (I believe) be improved.  That is why I argue for a policy rethink by the Bush administration around the policies that work and win you friends.  Remember, it's not Saddam that is dividing the international community- but Bush administration policy.  If the administration commits to the due process of inspections then it'd win the friends it needs for military action (if necessary) and after the war for reconstruction and warding off a terrorist counterattack (absolutely necessary).<br>
<br>
  Re-emphasizing the point though: just because I broadly disagree with the idea of pre-emptive action against a nation-state, doesn't mean my admiration for the men &amp; women ready to risk their lives for that policy so far from home is lessened in any way.  Two of my oldest college friends are currently with their unit (42 Commando) on a Royal Marine troopship in the Gulf- they know my stance on pre-emption and agree with me that it's a policy doomed to failure in the long run.  But they will do their duty as staunchly as anyone who believes 100% in the war- because that is a soldier's calling:  duty, courage and self-sacrifice, no matter one's one feelings.<br>

<br>
Would this international pressure be the millions of dollars of trade that the US government had with South Africa?  Or perhaps the complete lack of acknowledgement by any major government of the ANC's cause until the early 1980s.  Perhaps an example of this &quot;overwhelming international pressure&quot; might be the way in which numerous governments including France, the United States and Italy all <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>praised</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the British Raj for the manner in which it was dealing with civil disobedience.  The simple truth was- no major government of note put any practical degree of pressure on either South Africa or the British Raj.  The British government protested loudly in the UN, but still allowed British firms to buy cheap S African diamonds with the blood of miners crushed by apartheid.  <br>
<br>
The victory of these peace movements was down to determination, commitment and unbelievable moral and physical courage.  Determination to stick to the path of peace even when met with violence.  I challenge you to show me a country other than those two which saw emancipation from united and unwilling masters in quite the same way.  It reinforces my point- the easiest route is the force of arms:  the hardest yet fairest path to settlement is the refusal to use them.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They were strong leaders who had to rebuke violent members of their own organizations. If US leaders turn into Ganhdi or Mandela, we'll be fooked<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Violent members of their own organizations?  Granted there were ANC members who preferred violence, but show me a single significant incident of note where they actually took it.  As for the INC's &quot;violent members&quot;...name one.  Not a single member of the Mahatma's movement favoured or even sought a violent solution.  You seem to know little about either peace movement, trivializing the hardship and self-sacrifice involved in the peaceful route to change.  That attitude disgusts me completely- study the history of it a bit more and then talk to me about it- ignorance is no platform to preach from.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;the US being fooked&quot;- it's funny to note that the closest the Middle East has ever been to a peaceful resolution was with the two presidents most reluctant to commit US forces to a war of aggression.  Carter and Clinton have their critics to be sure- but the amount of conflict resolution they channeled their efforts into certainly puts them closer to the Mahatma or Mandela than it does to Bush's eagerness to commit troops.  I feel Clinton and Carter will in time be remembered for their hard work in achieving peace where they could- remembered alongside those great presidents who had intelligence, character and resolve in abundance.<br>
<br>
America's elder statesmen, the most respected presidents (Adams, Lincoln, Roosevelt)- acted in a moral, just and compassionate manner when faced with the choice of using force, used it as a last resort, and always justified it with a case for war.    Turning to the naive, less statesmanlike alternative for a moment...  When you give an insular, mentally challenged politician like George Bush(Who's the president of Pakistan again?) or Dan Quayle in days gone by (p-ot-a-t-...?) a large hammer like the US military- all their problems tend to look like nails.  Crude perhaps, but it has the ring of truth to an extent.  It requires intelligence, planning and foresight to construct a sound foreign policy that achieves something lasting.  Knee-jerk responses (the post-war scenario in Afghanistan for example) yield nothing but resentment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Countries would be stomping all over the US, taking advantage of our good nature and we'll soon be assassinated by Saddaem, PLO, Iran, or North Korea. They could care less about wiping out their enemies.<br>

Just to point out the glaringly obvious- the PLO no longer exists, Iran is very much a US ally in the region atm (how times change), and North Korea is being treated with kid gloves.  None of those nations save North Korea poses a credible threat- and the real threat (N Korea) is actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>deterring the US</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with nuclear weapons.  That must be a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the price of years of diplomatic isolation and neglect.  Saddam doesn't even pose a hundreth of that threat.<br>
<br>
The bottom line here is lurker- that you need to show a constructed case for war.  Basically, you need to show that containment isn't working and that Saddam will not be deterred.  You say that he &quot;could care less about wiping out his enemies&quot;.  <br>
<br>
That's bollocks quite frankly- it's what McCarthy said about the Soviets.  Deterrence worked then, and it works now.  He hasn't touched his neighbours since 1991, the north and south of his country is closed to him:  Kurdish rebels hold the north, Shi'ite village factions hold the south.  Fact is- the USSR had a tonne of nasty weapons too, thousands of times more than Saddam- and that threat was deterred.  Saddam's regime is not suicidal- prove to me that he is either suicidal or a miscalculater.  Fact is, he's an expert at surviving- and there's no way he'd throw that away by launching a WMD attack.<br>
<br>
He's being contained, he's being deterred:  unless you can prove to me that either of these measures have failed substantially- then there is no reason to go to war now.  You've said the international community will &quot;walk away&quot; if we give the inspectors more time.  Well here's the point- the only reason the international community cared two bits for the problem is that the US &amp; UK moved thousands of troops to the region and started typical diplomatic bully-speak.  With over a quarter of a million allied forces encircling Saddam, with several hundred experts combing his country aided by western intelligence- there is no way the international community will walk away unless the US &amp; UK lets them.  To be blunt- containment and deterrence worked even when no one cared a fig for Iraq, even before all those troops mobilized.  It's even more likely to be a successful marriage of measures when attention is focused so rigidly on Iraq as is happening now.<br>
<br>
To summarize- deterrence and containment are working until you prove they have failed lurker.  That is why Clinton continued them as policies, and we haven't had a problem with Iraq since.  Given that these measures work, there is no almighty rush.  Remembering there is no almighty rush- the inspectors, the weapons experts on the ground should be given freedom and space by the US/UK to do their job.  If the inspectors report they can't continue their work, then the US &amp; UK will have 0 problems winning the support they need in the UNSC and disarmament by force will take place.  I remember when Bush, persuaded by Blair and Colin Powell to use the UN route to resolve this.  I find it disgusting, that having committed to the UN route, Bush and Blair are only willing to listen to expert advice if it suits his adminsitration.  Sorry, but the inspectors are the judge of how well Iraq is complying- until they feel their job is impossible there is no need for further action.  <br>
<br>
Prove to me that containment and deterrence have failed lurker.  You've ignored that argument assidiously and I'm pointing it out to you again.  Until these measures have been proved insufficient there is no imminent or forseeable threat and there is no case for war.  .<br>
<br>
I repeat again- the military option isn't going anywhere.  To all of those who maintain that Saddam is playing for time...well so what?  What does that time give him exactly?  I've already shown that he is being contained, and deterrence is there as a safety net.  Nothing is lost with the passage of time if that time is spent with inspections.  If inspections fail, the first people to tell us would be the inspectors.  When that happens- the Security council will line up behind the war option because it will have become the last resort.<br>
<br>
In conclusion- I'm a little fed up with the arguments being used to advocate a war.  It's not about trusting politicians or dictators, not about a ticking clock.  All that matters is that the right policy strategy is adopted.  The most effective strategy has been demonstrated over 12 years:  containment.  It's the most sound strategy legally and morally.  Also- 95% of WMD destroyed were destroyed by inspections:  it's the best system for disarmament that exists.  <br>
<br>
War on the other hand, isolates the very opinion that is needed to fight the global threat of terror.  An international forum with open and clear policy discussion is the only platform to defeat terrorism with.  Al-Qaeda may vanish very shortly, I pray for that every night- but terrorism will not vanish with it.  The fires of extremism, already lit by that brutal bearded murderer currently running for his life in Pakistan...those fires will be fanned to white heat by any war in Iraq.  I have no argument with the American people- indeed I am well aware that opinion is as divided there as it is in this country.  Like Benlian- I simply think war is a hasty, reckless and most importantly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>irrevocable</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> policy step.  Once started, the policy is committed- there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.  Saddam's not going anywhere, can't do anything, wouldn't even if he could(containment + deterrence) and inspections work.  As soon as a credible threat is proven, or inspections fail- there will be a case for war and I'll support it- moreover, so will the rest of the UNSC.  Disarmament must take place- but does it have to take place via a destructive military conflict?  Currently I don't believe that it does, I haven't seen any proof of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>credible</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> threat.   <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

USSR collapsed because it could no longer afford it's highly corrupted elite and it's centralized economics structure. Those two simply cannot coexist. Example: you cannot make cars in Tolliati because you are missing parts that are being made in Irkutsk and the reason you are missing them is because they were stolen and sold on the black market. You see, by the time USSR felt apart it was no longer dictatorship which is the only regime that allows communism, fascism and other violent utopias. It was more of a twisted version of republic with corruption eating it up from top to bottom.<br>
<br>
 A blood-lusted paranoid dictator like Stalin can keep corruption extremely low because people don't feel like getting shot for taking a bribe or stealing from work. Same thing with Saddam. He can keep his regime afloat forever by siting on Iraq's oil. He is allowed to sell 4bil worth of it a year due to so-called &quot;food-for-oil&quot; programm. According to various analysts most of that money is being spend on things other than food. USSR was a self sufficient country, Iraq is not, but Saddam's regime can last forever as  long as it can sell oil and is allowed to buy wtf they want.  Iraq will never collapse due to economics. On top of that Iraq is a barabaric country with no science or technology of it's own. A kid with matches comes to mind. Believe it or not, back in the USSR they tought us that a war involving WMD cannot have winners, I very much doubt that's what Iraqis are being taught. Also(and I beleive we had this argument on some other board), Communist regime in USSR has killed more of it's people than WWII did. It is not something you can simply dismiss or call  a bloodless victory for the West. Whether or not the West could've prevented those deaths is questionable, but over 20,000,000 lifes lost is far from &quot;bloodless&quot;. Saddam on the other hand can be stoped relatively early and before he is too powerful to deal with. Why not just do it?<br>

It makes it even worse that all the mindless cowards who make up our nation don't even mind what Bush is doing. So long as it'll make them feel alittle safer when they goto work its ok if the government restricts our freedoms or attacks foreign nations and kills thousands in the process.

Oh and Aybolit I don't think you understand what deterement means. It has nothing to do with Iraq or the USSR collapsing.

I was in fact talking about the success of deterrence as a policy re:  the Soviet Union.  Even at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, even with that degree of brinkmanship, the doctrine of deterrence prevailed.  How stable the Soviet Union was has no bearing on how well they were deterred- in fact, at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, it was Khuruschev who pushed the aggressive policy- one Bush Jr. would have been proud of.  Glasnost came decades later- there were decades of aggression to come yet- and the only thing that stopped either side from acting first was mutual deterrence.  Despite that aggression from a militarily powerful Soviet Union, NATO deterrence worked on numerous occasions.  <br>
<br>
Why won't Iraq be deterred where the Soviet Union was Aybolit?  They're less of a threat, they're not a nuclear power so can't even mutually deter the US/UK, it's not even certain whether their WMD are in a fit state to be used!  Surely such a defanged dictator desperate to survive as he is, can be deterred?<br>
<br>
Now on to an interesting couple snippets:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>USSR collapsed because it could no longer afford it's highly corrupted elite and it's centralized economics structure. Those two simply cannot coexist<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Iraq has both a centralized economy and a highly corrupted central elite.  What else would you call the Ba'ath party for goodness sakes?  Saddam's sons are all &quot;industrial leaders&quot; in Iraq, party members' children similarly hold positions of influence.  How on earth can you say that's any different in terms of corruption from the way sons of Central Committee members in the USSR were treated?  Same level of name-dropping, use of power, influence.  Most industrial projects in Iraq are financed on credit, payable by Saddam Hussein, credit that never materialises, now there's a suprise.  How many business leaders do you think end up complaining about this?  The Iraqi system will fall to pieces all in good time, even without the burden of UN sanctions.  Speaking of which:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but Saddam's regime can last forever as long as it can sell oil and is allowed to buy wtf they want<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Earth to Aybolit!  They aren't allowed to buy &quot;wtf they want&quot;, that's the whole <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>point</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of sanctions.  And here's the rub- black market profits amount to a trickle of what Iraq needs in terms of imports.  Food and water alone costs an arid country half the size of Iraq 2 billion dollars a year.  Industrial upkeep and maintenance investment for a country that size costs 9-12 billion dollars a year.  Like it or not- there is no way Iraq can scrape that kind of money up.  It certainly isn't enough for a weapon's programme (irrelevant in any case, since containment &amp; deterrence work).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On top of that Iraq is a barabaric country with no science or technology of it's own<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It's easy to be dismissive, but I'd dispute that.  Before containment measures were applied, they had significant indigenous technology, even if you only examine their military.  Al-Samoud missiles, Khal-Tirya rockets, Iraqi-modified SAMs and Scuds, they have an abundance of technical expertise.  The fact that people are languishing in poverty doesn't preclude arms development to a reasonably high standard- the Soviet Union was living proof of that.  Starvation in numerous provinces for decades, yet a model of technical and military might, for a time.  The system was doomed to collapse in time, as will Iraq's- just as the Soviet Union slipped into decline, so will Iraq under the Ba'ath party.<br>
<br>
And, talking of bloodless victories- Saddam in 12 years under containment has been deemed responsible by Amnesty International for the loss or disruption of 7,000 lives, estimated 2,000 fatalities.  Sounds horrible, and it is- except that the figure is considerably less than China, North Korea, Libya, even Saudi Arabia's government as assessed by Amnesty International.  Worst case scenario- Saddam is contained for another 12 years, inflicts comparable statistics- compare that to a war which will likely claim 100,000 lives or more (see the last Gulf war's casualty listings for a ball-park figure).  This one is likely to be considerably more bloody.  So, not bloodless, I take your point- but certainly less blood-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>y</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than the alternative.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Saddam on the other hand can be stoped relatively early and before he is too powerful to deal with.  Why not just do it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Too powerful to deal with?  He's being <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>contained</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  If you have proof to the contrary, feel free to present it.<br>
Under sanctions and under threat of violent reprisal, Saddam is being effectively contained.  Not a single person on this thread has managed to prove that containment has failed.  And as for why don't we just &quot;do it&quot;- if it ain't broke, why fix it?  Containment works- it'll take more than suspicion or conjecture to convince me or any sane individual of its failure.<br>
<br>
He's developing weapons?<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Prove it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He's passing them to terror groups?<br>

<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bloody well prove it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Just some of the allegations, suspicions, beliefs and general paranoia from this thread, and not a shred of proof for any of it.  Containment is working ladies and gents- unless any of you or anyone from either the UK or US governments can provide proof to the contrary.<br>

<br>
Woah, a government doing dodgy economic deals and skimming off the top of pristine initiatives?  *Claps hands on cheeks in horror*- Say it ain't so!  /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
What government hasn't is a better question- you're gonna have to do a lot better than that to convince me that a war is justified Kad.  The fact that all politicans practically at some stage in their career have lied, cheated, cajoled and skimmed off the top- many while in office, should leave us with no suprises if a corrupt totalitarian regime does the same.<br>
<br>
Side-note:  Let's just take a quick look at the Bush administration shall we?:  <br>
<br>
Meet Thomas White, former Vice Chairman of Enron Energy Services(sounds rather familiar that).  While he was in the job Enron rigged and exploited Californias electricity market, causing chaos, power cuts, and unemployment, in what the Senate investigator called, A mob style protection racket.  He doesnt work there any more.  Hes now Secretary of the US Army!  <br>
<br>
Meet Larry Thompson.  He headed up the audit and compliance committee of Providian.  This insurance firm was forced to pay $400m in fines and compensation after swindling its investors, the frail and elderly, of most of their savings.  Larry later faced personal claims of insider trading, after selling $4m of Providian stock just before the share price dropped.  But he doesnt work there any more.  Hes now George Bushs <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fraud buster</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, charged with restoring faith in American business ethics.  Sound appointment there George!<br>
<br>
And meet Dick Cheney, head of the Republican Committee to find a Vice Presidential candidate.  He found... himself!  He sold 30m of his shares as Chief Executive of an engineering company Halliburton, after accounting changes allegedly inflated the share price by 234m.  The shares later collapsed, and Halliburton are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Its thanks to men like Tom, Dick and Larry, that the biggest of the big guys, that George W Bush can stand proud and say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;We should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers.  By banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
George Bush actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>said</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that, and he should know I suppose, because hes been arrested 3 times for different offences, and only got off with an $800,000 oil shares trading charge when the investigator, appointed by his <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>father</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said there was insufficient evidence to proceed.  Quel suprise? <br>
<br>
Wow, not a bad job there- and that only took me 15 minutes.  Goodness knows what I'd find in another 10 or so- I think I've made my point as far as political corruption goes.<br>
<br>
Finally:<br>
You seem to have the courage of your convictions in backing this war Kad, but I have yet to hear your reasoning for why war is needed now.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  If containment has failed, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>prove it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
                  If deterrence is failing, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>prove it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
               <br>
In the absence of proving either of these, there isn't even the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>beginnnings</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of a case for war.  He's playing for time- time to do what if he's contained?  He's deceiving- to what end, if he's being deterred?  He's not telling the truth- what politican isn't economical with the truth?  <br>

There isn't a proven case for war Kad- give me a case for war and I can begin to argue its efficacy- in the absence of that, supporters of the war have no argument for supporting it.  Suspicion, hatred, fear, conjecture, bloodlust, hatred for &quot;A-rabs&quot; or &quot;rag-heads&quot;, those aren't a case for war, none of them are.  Speculation is no basis for committing troops Kad, surely someone with a military background can appreciate that reasoning?  Only with properly gathered intelligence and clear proof of an imminent threat should forces be committed.  Of course, if you think it's civilized to target &quot;suspected&quot; terrorists and &quot;suspected&quot; purveyors of WMD, why not take that one step further and convict &quot;suspected&quot; criminals?  Oh yeah, there's that little thing called due process isn't there...<br>
<br>
Here's the irony- the lowest of low scumbags being tried for murder with intent- even he needs a case to be built before a conviction can even be considered.  Where's your case Kad?  Or do you think your suspicions and conjectures plus those of your government is a strong enough case for war?  The floor's all yours Kad- tell me why you think there's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>proven</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> case for going to war.  Because if there is proof that the current measures aren't good enough to see off a potential threat...I sure as hell can't see it.<br>

How...  Has he attacked us?  Is there indisputable evidence of his impending attack?  <br>
<br>
I know he hates America, most of the arab countries do, i would to if i lived in a nation that was in constant strife and everytime it got a little out of hand America came down with its army and killed a bunch of shit.  They dont understand we are trying to help, cause half of the time we dont help at all.  We just make matters worse, and we leave...  <br>
<br>
You guys are being fooled by the propaganda being spewed forth from the media and the administration.  Most everything you read and see if propaganda, but you HAVE to use your mind and disifer what is true and what is false.  I dont understand how you can be screaming for a war with Iraq.  Nothing good can come of it, and why not scream for a shift of anger, and a war with N. Korea?  That is a war i could get behind.  Or how about a continuation of a war on terror.  Lets send some Spec Ops guys into the field's and see what they turn up with the vast amounts of intel at our countries disposal.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever heard the expression &quot;pick your battles&quot;  Well this pertains to Iraq, bush needs a war, and he thinks Iraq is a good spot, but he hasn't thought it through.  Neither have you people that are screaming for it.  Use your brain.  There are lots of better targets in the world.  This is just the only one W. knows how to spell.<br>
<br>
Btw.  Dont be sheep, think for your selves.  All to often people follow the leader, but often times the leader is blind and leads them all off a cliff... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lurker555@ascension10244>lurker555</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/03 4:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll on US Presidents speech is closed</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote from Everas:<br>
It makes it even worse that all the mindless cowards who make up our nation don't even mind what Bush is doing.

There are some people in the world who automatically hate other people no matter what they do or what they say.  Be it because of their religion, race, sex, ideology, etc.  Judging someone on their actions or giving them a chance doesn't seem to come into the equasion.  <br>
<br>
All this automatic hate because Bush is Republican and automatic praise of Clinton because he is Democratic from certain people really is sickening.<br>
<br>
Labeling everyone against your position as mindless cowards is basically retarded and shows your immaturity.  I would love to see anyone on this board run for President and get past the primaries, let alone win the election.  It's not a easy process.  Bush didn't have to steal any election.  He won it.  This is a free country where everyone is entitled to a vote.  If your candidate didn't win, then you should of particiated more in the voting process by getting more supporters to vote. <br>
<br>
I for one don't believe 49% of America that vote for Bush is dumb.  Or the 51% that voted for Gore is dumb.  If your 50x smarter then half the US population and 50x smarter than our President.  Then perhaps you should post your thesis on the Palestinain/Israeli Solution, solve and implement the problems on world hunger, aids, poverty, and peace.  Perhaps even state the solution on the emerging North Korean problem, while translating it into Koreans so the Koreans could understand it.  <br>
<br>
Frankly I don't think you care about any of those issues.  Except in a, I'm right and Bush is wrong sense.  And yes, Bush will be held accountable for our troops if war happens.  By the US population, by God, by his conscience.  It is a great responsibility to have hundreds of thousands of people, ready to die for our country's cause.  Frankly I don't think you would have the balls for making such a decision, or know when to committ troops on any situation unless you were on a bandwagon.  What exactly were you doing on 9/11?  Or the days after 9/11?  Nothing I would guess.  Perhaps back in school, at work, at friends house, or at home on the computer playing EQ.<br>

<br>
But to comment on a few other people....Deterrence DID work vs USSR.....and from the prolonged deterrence and military build up USSR ran out of money and fell apart.  Regan did a great job of causing USSR to keep trying to build up its army which led to it's downfall.<br>
<br>
I will explain more later on why this comparison won't work if ya want me to, but I am at work right not and don't have the time to type it all out until I get home. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=221&stop=234>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=196.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=196.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25>Pyro's Gallery</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
