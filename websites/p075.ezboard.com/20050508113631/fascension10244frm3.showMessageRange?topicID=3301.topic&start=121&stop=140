Which is what?

Nice dodge.<br>
<br>
Answer the question. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Is the department of treasury lying or has the debt increased every year since 1951</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Yes or NO.<br>
<br>
Go ahead, link the CBO numbers again instead of answering my question. It's a simple yes or no. <br>
<br>
You either think the deparment of treasury is making up numbers or you don't.<br>
<br>
Again don't give me whole math or &quot;real&quot; dollars. I am talking actual money. did the debt increase every year?<br>

<br>
CBO's methodology is certainly the only acceptable one--one can't make projections based on what might pass.  But to point to those projections and exclaim &quot;see, Bush is balancing the budget, OMGZ&quot; without paying attention to all the little &quot;but's&quot; (but Iraq and Afghanistan spending aren't counted, but Bush's tax cuts have to expire, but the AMT can't be adjusted,but the estate tax will have to remain in place as is) is beyond moronic. <br>

In backwards Russia where all rural labor was owned by government and only recently was privatised, farmers have insurance for draught, flood, fire any other force major including locust or early frost that can destroy their harvest, they get credits and insure credits against all those things in a complex financial package. Are you telling me that in USA farmers live from harvest to harvest and a death in family regularely puts farmers out of business? What do they do if there is draught or flood or fire? They got no insurance against that too? I find that difficult to believe.<br>
<br>
Seconly, you are wrong about &quot;filthy rich&quot; kids that are going to go broke in near future. You may when your credit card debts add up and economy has another burp, they wont.<br>
<br>
Paris Hilton and GWBush dont have a huge money sack from which they pick cash out and spend it on diamond collars for chihuahuas, their capital is thoroughly invested in assets and stocks via trust funds. Not only they cant mis manage their inheritance, they arent even going to be able to spend it if they had the only goal of spending it a la &quot;Brewster's Millions&quot;. Look, no one even argues against ultra rich. No one even argues anymore against leaving money to your son or daughter, you do realise that there are GENERATIONS of people that live in perpetual wealth that keeps making more wealth to make them richer and richer, right? They simply cant mismanage that much money, GW tried real hard and he kept getting richer and richer. <br>
<br>
The tax law isnt even going to put those that inherit that wealth out on streets and working, it wont even cut into their spending because their fortunes are far beyond of being spendable. It simply slows the process DOWN instead of encouraging it. It will keep progression from very rich, filthy rich, ultra rich, ultra filthy rich from happening in 4 generations to may be 8 or 12 generations.<br>
<br>
I dont understand how having generations of people being born into perpetual wealth isnt absurd and notion about more even redistribution is. There isnt an argument about &quot;hey I earned that money, I want to spend it&quot; because neither they can spend the money, nor did they earn it. In capitalism money can keep making money, after certain barrier no matter how much you spend in your life time, you will still become wealthier and wealthier no matter what happends. That isnt absurd?<br>
<br>
As for farms being sold, of course a lot of them are being sold after death of a head of a family, mostly because sons dont want to stay on farm anymore. Once again, the law isnt even to stop generations of people living in perpetual wealth, its just to slow the process of amassing wealth in their hands down. Note, they dont even need to do anything, they just spend as much as they humanly can, mismanage whatever they lay their hands on, smoke pot and run for presidents.<br>
<br>
Imo, there is much bigger chance of Paris Hilton running for White House than her going broke.<br>
<br>
Yes, I understand that you disapprove of the change as well, but you seem to disapprove of it for different reasons. I think there should be a limit of how much of the inheritance can be even passed on to direct family, I mean 50 millions ought to be enough at any rate. Say what you want about Billy Gates, but he is actually a comrade commie.. well at least a socialist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mithrilleyes>mithrilleyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.philbrodieband.com/Slide13.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 623<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 6:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: now we're back to where we started</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;The deficit declined every year Clinton was in office<br>

This isn't a communist country, people are, should be, and have every right to do with their money as they please. In my opinion it is absurd to allow anything else. Redistribution sucks ass in my opinion. To think you can help anyone succeed by punishing the successful is about the most absurd thing I can think of.<br>

So are you saying it was never earned or this particular person in this generation never earned it? I mean basically what you are saying is that if I put 500 dollars in the bank, technically I should redistribute any interest on it because I didn't &quot;earn&quot; it, it just grew on its own.

<br>
Despite your anecdotal evidence,IRS data show that more than 93 percent of taxable estates in 2001 were valued at less than $5 million. Farm and family-owned business assets accounted for less than three percent of the total value of these taxable estates in 2001. Because of your area, you may see more of this than other areas of the country, this doesn't, however make it common. Further, without going into it, there are substantial breaks in estate tax law aimed specifically at farms.  No one can help those who don't plan appropriately for their own death.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If someone saves assests over time then they've paid taxes on them. <br>
<br>
This is a common misconception.  Much of the value of assets passed by bequest is usually in the form of asset appreciation or capital gain.  That is value that has *never* been taxed.  It's also value that would be taxed if you transferred that asset in any other way while still living, whether sale or an outright gift.  The estate tax is simply an extension of other rules already in our tax code, not a departure from them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1658<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/05 8:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> more good stuff on estate tax</span><hr size=1> For family farms, repeal of the estate tax would actually increase, not decrease tax liability for those heirs that choose to sell or liquidate their portion.  With the estate tax repeal,the basis cost of the transferred asset will remain the cost at which that asset was acquired by the deceased for the purposes of capital gains.  So instead of an heir paying estate tax on only the portion of the estate outside the exemption, an heir who sells or gifts their inherited property would be liable for capital gains on the entire amount of the gain. Carrying this tax basis forward through an asset transfer upon death also introduces numerous opportunities to cheat, and needless additional complexity.<br>

The deficit and debt shrunk under Clinton because of gridlock, which was caused by Clinton bringing people together to compromise. So compromise leads to gridlock.<br>

Its question of who pays how much and what are taxes spent on. I dont understand, are you against any kind of government regulation or program? You one of those people that thinks that NASA should be privately owned? I am not calling for communist system, it is technicaly un feasible by definition to begin with, nor am I even calling for socialism, I am trying to appeal to common sense. Do I need to argue that taxes should be paid depending on earnings? That is amount of money that Donald Trump pays and a single mother of  2 pays need to be different? Can we at least agree on that? Next logical step is taxing large estates passed as inheritance.<br>
<br>
One more time, I dont tell anyone what to do with money they have earned. We arent dealing with that concept, people I am talking about do not earn money. In fact, most of them either never worked/managed their money, or if they did, have disastrous record (look at GW). Yet their unwilingness or inability to manage their capital has not affected their wealth. Why? Because by virtue of inheritance, they have inherited so much money that literally no amount of indifference or mismanagement will have a profound effect on their financial future. At the point where THEY are at, 10 millions more, 10 millions less makes absolutely no difference. <br>
<br>
Note, when you are talking about that much wealth and how much it increases every year, those people simply can not ever be poor. Ever. Unless you have a revolution and change property ownership. Lets recap one more time, those people did not earn the money to begin with. Those people do not manage their own money (normally) they do not produce any kind of positive feedback to the society, they are class of social parasites that exist because of flawed laws that govern the society. How precisely flawed those laws are is subject to discussion, but I am still waiting for you to explain to me how the hell paris hilton deserves her wealth and what is difference between P.Hilton and GW?<br>

Why debt increased with budget surplus? Because instead of paying off debt, the surplus went to provide tax cuts to the rich.<br>
<br>
Why was there surplus under Clinton? Because Clinton raised minimum wage which increased consumer spending, which in turn gave push to small businesses that pay far more in taxes than large corporations that mostly use legal loopholes to avoid taxes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mithrilleyes>mithrilleyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.philbrodieband.com/Slide13.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 625<br> <font color=#333333>(4/28/05 1:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kurakai</span><hr size=1> Barm,<br>

will explain everything you need to know on the national debt.  Intragovernmental holdings, make up the difference between the Debt held by the public figure as reported by the CBO, and that from your treasury figures. IGH are defined here as:<br>
Government Account Series securities held by Government trust funds, revolving funds, and special funds; and Federal Financing Bank  securities. A small amount of marketable securities are held by government accounts.   <br>
<br>
The difference is a key one, as the SS trust fund, and the corresponding increase of the SS tax under Reagan was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>designed statutorily</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to build up a debt, to eventually be repaid by the government.  Did those holdings grow? Sure.<br>
<br>
But which is it by the way?  Bush says that the Social Security trust fund doesn't exist.  He's been quoted so numerous times.  So, if Bush says it doesn't exist, how can it be part of the debt? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mithrilleyes>mithrilleyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.philbrodieband.com/Slide13.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 628<br> <font color=#333333>(4/28/05 11:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=140>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kurakai</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;and the corresponding increase of the SS tax under Reagan was designed statutorily to build up a debt<br>
<br>
Not sure if this is intentionally vague or misleading. It was Johnson who made the changes to accounting SS in a way that would reduce the apparent debt.<br>
<br>
&quot;This   budget, therefore, for the first time accurately covers all Federal expenditures and all Federal receipts, including for the first time in one budget $47 billion from the social security, Medicare, highway, and other trust funds.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;On-Budget<br>
<br>
In early 1968 President Lyndon Johnson made a change in the budget presentation by including Social Security and all other trust funds in a&quot;unified budget.&quot; This is likewise sometimes described by saying that Social Security was placed &quot;on-budget.&quot;<br>
<br>
This 1968 change grew out of the recommendations of a presidential commission appointed by President Johnson in 1967, and known as the President's Commission on Budget Concepts. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The concern of this Commission was not specifically with the Social Security Trust Funds, but rather it was an effort to rationalize what the Commission viewed as a confusing budget presentation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. At that time, the federal budget consisted of three separate and inconsistent sets of measures, and often budget debates became bogged-down in arguments over which of the three to use. As an illustration of the problem, the projected fiscal 1968 budget was either in deficit by $2.1 billion, $4.3 billion, or $8.1 billion, depending upon which measure one chose to use. Consequently, the Commission's central recommendation was for a single, unified, measure of the federal budget--a measure in which every function and activity of government was added together to assess the government's fiscal position.<br>
<br>
This change took effect for the first time in the President's budget proposal for fiscal year 1969, which President Johnson presented to Congress in January 1968. This change in accounting practices did not initially put the President's budget proposal into surplus--it was still projecting an $8 billion deficit. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>However, it is clear that the budget deficit would have been somewhat larger without this change</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (it is difficult to say how much larger because this change was mixed-in with the other legislative, budgetary and fiscal policies the President was urging Congress to adopt)&quot;<br>
