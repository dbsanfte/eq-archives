<br>
Currently, all the guilds represented in the rotation except AD, are the only guilds on RZ that have killed anything greater than Vindi, so the situation is, assume that five guilds that are the only guilds capable of those mobs rotate those mobs, and a new up and coming guild comes up and wants to try them, what right do they have to 'cut' the cue?<br>

But i think its hard for others to understand our prespective on things.<br>
<br>
Killing tormaxx, or vindicator statue etc.. is like a 1 group event for us. (i am not trying to brag here)  Its like how lower tier guilds form up and kill umbral plains mini's when they find them up, we do much the same with old world bosses of choices. Its not any big risk to us nor is it hard.  But in many cases the rewards are quite beneficial even to mains in ad. <br>
<br>
Granted some of it goes to twinks, some goes to mains.  But people gotta remember just cause people have an AD tag on them doesnt mean they automatically have great gear. Many people come to us with pure crap for gear and we do our best to gear them up when we can and how we can.  <br>
<br>
As for the dont touch our mobs or its war thing. Once guilds get to the point where they are ready to take on elementals on RZ, we give them a shot, at first it was ad only doing them, wudan joined after and we rotated with them, now are are rotating 3 ways with mim is my understanding. <br>
<br>
normally when we do these mobs (king t, statue, vindi, 1st brood dragons)  its at around 9-1 am PST.  We pretty much feel if they arent claimed by then, somebody missed their chance.<br>

Note that I'm an AD recruit, not a member yet.<br>
<br>
I've participated in a few small-group killings of these mobs and a few others. Every time it's a spur-of-the-moment &quot;we're bored and have time&quot; kind of thing. They're never planned, and whether or not we kill them really depends on whether we can scrounge up a group or two of people who aren't too tired from the day's raid. With that said, it's pretty much impossible for us to join a rotation on these mobs, because 80% of the time it comes up to &quot;our turn&quot; we won't be ready to kill him (We'll be too tired from raid, we won't have a tank on who wants to come, etc. Believe it or not most AD members don't want to kill Velious mobs... it was difficult enough for me to convince 3 groups to do Seru). That may be really good for you, but from our perspective, it's awfully unfair. You'd have the same rate of success by telling us to stop killing the mobs completely.<br>
<br>
I also respect your point of view Mearis and as an ex-officer of a Velious level guild I understand how fierce the spawn competition is. But I do feel that you coming here and basically shoving your rotation in our face and saying &quot;you have to accept this because Wudan and MiM did&quot; is disrespectful. Now you've got half your guild here with puppy eyes.<br>
<br>
Like Adell said, if AD happens to kill one of your mobs, then hopefully you'll give the guild whom we &quot;stole&quot; it from another chance in 3 days after respawn. I honestly cannot see how AD could join your rotation without dicking themselves over. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/23/03 6:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333333>(6/23/03 8:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> Right, Gsam, I agree that some mobs are trivial enough that any attempt to rotate them is stupid - but I think with the exception of ST you'll admit, that none of the mobs we were particularly concerned with people 6 manning can be done with 6 people.  Tormax *might* be done by 12 superbly geared AD people but I doubt, and I doubt it takes any less than three groups or so do those, and as such they are a bit more of a coordinated effort.  As much as I'd like to see Dozekar and Statue rotated, those mobs are so easy that attempting to legislate them is asking for trouble.<br>
<br>
I entirely agree that if a guild left a mob all the way until it arrived to you, then they deserve to lose it, the problem is that often times the mob does not spawn until its way past our bedtime (or raidtime) and it only spawns after all the guild has logged off, and as such we get no real attempt at it.  I have no qualms *whatsoever* about losing a mob that we could have had an attempt at, if we didn't get it, its our fault, but the very idea behind a 24 hour grace period, which is standard practice in all rotations is that even with the random timer associated with them, you will get a shot at the mob at your timezone.<br>
<br>
Morb, the idea that within 24 hours of Tormax spawning, AD could not both do its event and drop Tormax or Cursed is a bit absurd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There's enough AD members to kill all those mobs anytime from 4 EST till 2 EST every day, and I have yet to see a day where AD raids that long.<br>
<br>
As I said, the danger is not losing one mob, that's not a problem at all, if anything its a minor setback.  What is VERY VERY disruptive is how much of a morale killer it is to have your entire guild log in to attempt a special mob, only to have it killed before your guild logs in.<br>
<br>
We had Avatar of War planned a few weeks ago, but Bollix informed me that they had that same event planned for several weeks now, and that several guildmates had logged in specifically for that.  We had farmed the previous 3 AoW, but could have very easily killed it well before Bollix's guild got online, and probably would have been several weeks before they would have gotten another shot, but we yielded.<br>
<br>
The only reason I brought up MiM and Wudan adhering to the rotation, is because they are in exactly the same situation as AD as far as those mobs go (I think King Tormax is equally trivial to both Wudan/MiM/AD for the sake of argument, and both raid at roughly the same times) but those two guilds both decided to honour our rotation.  We have no 'authority' to impose a rotation on AD, but hopefully by explanining our rational in detail people can understand why we are so hung up on it.<br>
<br>
RZ is a relatively low population server, there is not that much competition, and there's so many FFA targets that a guild could hit after their regular e-plane raid without interfering in anyone's rotation - some examples:<br>
<br>
Griegs<br>
Rumblecrush<br>
Doomshade<br>
Eashen/Ikatiar<br>
Dozekar<br>
Velkeltor<br>
Ring War<br>
Dain<br>
Yelinak<br>
Vindicator<br>
Statue of RZ<br>
Rhags/Archlich<br>
High Priest<br>
Seru<br>
Itraer VIus<br>
<br>
Etch... I could fill pages - the mobs that are meant to be protected by the rotation are mobs that are 'stepping stones' for guilds try to progress, unfortunately, those are obviously the mobs that drops the best twink/recruit gear.  And this doesn't even include any of the rotated mobs becoming FFA. <br>
<br>
Anyway, as I said, I have no authority to impose any rotation, but I have already tried explaining my view point repeatedly, and why several other guilds in your position have adhered to it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so far its been pretty civil so I am happy to discuss my position further,<br>

I represent LoTF for rotations and what I quoted from Mearis is the point blank idea of this thread.  If we lose a mob within 24 hours of it spawning then that is our fault.  Would it be difficult to ask that you wait 24 hours (aka grace period) after such mob has spawned so that the guild who is currently up on rotation has a chance to kill it before it is taken by someone else? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asshole, P.I.</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#333333>(6/23/03 9:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> Huh?

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Of course, i could try to shame you into it, by asking what a guild that just killed xegony could possibly hope to gain by slumming it in Kael <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well for a start- most PoP high end encounters are ridiculously number-intensive.  They're also long and often punishing events.  Tormax on the other hand, is relatively trivial to access and requires almost no effort to kill.  As Gsam said, quite a few members (particularly those new to guild) can benefit from items these mobs drop.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is VERY VERY disruptive is how much of a morale killer it is to have your entire guild log in to attempt a special mob, only to have it killed before your guild logs in<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and there's so many FFA targets that a guild could hit (list) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Many of the mobs in that list have as good loot as any of the rotated mobs- plus BoT minis that spawn more frequently and aren't even rotated.  We've logged in a number of times, even gathered at Fennin once only to be told to go hit another zone.  We weren't particularly frustrated etc, because if the drops are roughly equivalent it's not an issue.<br>
<br>
Those statements above are therefore conflicting- I'm not sure how it's frustrating to find a single mob killed when as you say, there are so many uncontested mobs up.  Now if those mobs drop loot as good, or nearly as good- this is a bit of a non-issue.<br>
<br>
I think the crux of the matter is the accessibility of the mobs in question matched versus their reward.  It isn't realistic for a small group of AD to clear all the way through Griegs for loot that isn't worth the trouble.  Likewise for the ringwar and Dain- takes a lot more effort that, after hard elemental sessions most ppl just can't put in.  Cursed and Tormaxx are both very accessible, easily killed with a relatively small crew and are fantastic risk/reward.  <br>
<br>
With random spawns it's really luck of the draw when it pops- and it certainly isn't after every event that a small group of guildies goes after these mobs.  So in terms of the odds of something like this happening- it's a very low chance- it needs to pop in a relatively small time window *and* we have to be willing to muster ourselves to go after it.  Plus, as has been said, RZ is hardly a highly contested spawn server, and there are simply loads of targets out there- including BoT minis that now drop loot better than Tormax far more frequently, and spawn every 8 hours- so why the big fuss over the occasional Tormax or Cursed kill?  In terms of progression- Cursed and Tormax gain a guild nothing- the only 'essential' loots for progression are BF's off cursed perhaps.<br>
<br>
Progression mobs from Velious/early Luclin are Emp, VT mobs and PoP flag tier- those grant passage to the high end game, not repeated farmage of Cursed etc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I understand people's frustration at the pace of farming- but the point's been done to death I think, that there are more than enough loot-droppers out there uncontested.  Not saying that the occasional disruption of an established rotation is inconsequential- but it's certainly not a huge inconvenience given the content available.<br>

<br>
Heck, I am sure AD back when Velious content was cutting edge, probably farmed at least over 20 King Tormax.  How many of those people still use the boots they got?  110 mana FT 2 boots are nearly unmatched until Emperor, and, assuming they are upgrade they can be passed on.  It is in fact very very easy after you have gotten better boots than WDS, to turn them back into Yelinak for a 'droppable' helm, then give the droppable helm to the needy recruit, and then have the recruit request the helm with Yelinak for boots.<br>
<br>
I am not denying people the chance to get gear for twinks, heck, twinks are some of the most fun you can have in this game, but there's so much gear you can upgrade for twinks without touch rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
And Tar as I said, there are a lot of targets, but none of them do drop equivalent loot to Tormax.  While you can progress fine through Velious and SoL without Tormax loot, I am sure if people could pick TWO Velious mobs to farm at the expense of all others, they would be Tormax and Avatar of War, because most of their drops have no logical replacement.  Tormax drops THE best hat in game for most melee classes, the best caster boots in game, A ST key, the best melee boots in game, one of the best wisdom caster belts in game.... etch.  Tormax is a quick even, but Ikatiar, Eashen, Dozekar, those are as fast if not faster, with new pathing literally any class can pull Iki/Eashen to zone in.<br>
<br>
Heck, Cursed cycle is by far the most time consuming raid SoD does, but we are glad to do it whenever we can, because the loot returned is just so very good (drop some !%! BF though!!)<br>
<br>
In terms of progression to the higher game, yes, PoP flags and Emperor mark 'gatekeeper' mobs, but in terms of gear progression, Cursed/Tormax are as important, otherwise with that logic people would kill Fennin only once, maybe twice to flag the entire guild, instead people kill it non stop, because the increase in HP and DPS from Fennin loot is very considerable.<br>
<br>
Finally, yes, we have had to 'give up' on a target sometime, because the mob hadn't spawned yet, and its an entirely different situation, because you know the mob will be there tomorrow, and its just random chance.  Imagine if instead of Fennin being called, because the Guardian of Doomfire spawned late, Fennin would be called because Wudan killed it earlier in the raid time, after their regular raid because : &quot;With random spawns it's really luck of the draw when it pops- and it certainly isn't after every event that a small group of guildies goes after these mobs&quot;.<br>
<br>
Would the reaction be the same, and would people be willing to go do another event? :P  (don't answer that, hehe) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asshole, P.I.</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 7:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> Revered never even was able to take a shot at Zlandicar because Eternal Shadows permacamped him.

<br>
The difference is that until recently, nobody had tried to establish a rotation on lower tier mobs.  Until we made an effort to establish this rotation, we never evern raised a hair if someone got the mobs before us, heck, to this day we haven't gotten Dozekar for the past two months, but even though its been usually farmed by a crew of MiM, I haven't ever complained about it.  There's a key difference in a rotation encompassing all mobs able to kill a mob, except one key partner, and losing a mob that nobody has even thought of rotating.<br>
<br>
The reason we 'formed' this rotation, is so guilds wouldn't behave like hawks and wait for people to wipe so they could take the mob.  We are a European guild, the spawns usually work in our favour, and with Reverant and ES breaking up, if we wanted we could do a damn good job hogging all Velious and easy Luclin content, yet we are making the best effort we can to share the mobs evenly.<br>
<br>
If you notice what I posted, it isn't the setback in waiting one week/nearest patch in getting the mobs that's the annoying part, its the fact that it makes scheduling mobs a logistical nightmare for me.  Hell, before Reverant finally agreed to a rotation, CE, CN, CoTW didn't stand a chance in hell of seeing Tormax alive, because we'd rush to kill it whenever it spawned, half of the reason we wanted to impose this rotation, is to give newer guilds a chance to try out this content.  In an FFA system, new guilds would never ever get a chance to try those mobs, instead with a scheduled rotation, as long as they show they are capable of killing those mobs, they are given 24 hours free to throw bodies at him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Powernap</span><br>  Posts: 921<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 2:10 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/blizzard/fullsize/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think all but three spawns that I know off in the last 6 months have been farmed by Tetzou with a few friends, and that's a LOT of Zlandicars.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You are incorret sir. I killed a few Zlandicars, i never farmed or perma camped it. Incase you have a problem with that, you can adress this problem here. I have no problem with hearing facts, but i also dislike your attidue with coming here and giving out wrong facts. Beside that i had a fairly long talk with you ~ 2 Months ago. <br>
<br>
I think you are sad that you wont get invited to those events anymore, which is basicly your own fault after the stuff you pulled Mearis. Anyhow, i would like you ask you to check your facts before spreading out more Lies, Thx. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=409825" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.tu-clausthal.de/~wits/tetz.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I can pull out a few examples when you went to AC to kill the Burrower, even a Minor Guild was in the Gathering progess. <br>
<br>
I would like you ask you, to watch the Problems your Guild gave some 'Lowbie Guilds' i.e. Spawnracing even they are in the same Zone, before you come here crying about the Problems with a few People, random having some fun with Mobs that they are challenging for them in a small Group. And indeed for me alot Things that i did with small groups was a Blast and made EQ exciting for me.<br>
<br>
There are 100 Million Humans on the Earth hungry, i feel sad for them, but i still dont eat everything on my Table.<br>
<br>
You should get the Point, you shouldnt come here and cry about the Things you find unfair. I dont see that SoD as whole Guild is aiming to Explore new Content, for me it seems you are stucked in time (3 Years ago) there are almost all Teir 3 Planes Fullly spawned.. noone ever going there and doing something challenging (Saryn for example). I would like to see that your Guild is moving to the Content that is challenging for them, insteadly you crying here about 3 year Old content. Cockblocking upcoming Guilds with your perma farming of fairly easy Mobs is also an Issue you should have talked about in your fairly long Posts. You have threaten war to others if they touch your Mobs, and you come here and ask for Fairness?<br>
<br>
You should walk in the same Shoes you want others to wear. <br>

As far as I know, I never got invited to an event lead by you, with the possible exception, when SoD helped you do YOUR ringwar, after you denied Stynkfyst a chance to roll for it and promising you'd help him organize his, and I agreed to pass on it, since you'd get more use out of it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Do you mean the same Raid that was formed after we invited SoD for a few Kael mobs and gave them 2 ST keys + other loots? also Stynkfyst told me he didnt want to roll, but indeed you asked to roll (as a Mage) even it was clearly called that we going there for this Ring for me? Also this was the same Raid where all Droppables went to SoD, correct?<br>
<br>
Also you can just ask Atsuko about how many times we let you tag along and even had you complain about loot (for example when you wanted to roll on the GoDS we was trying to get for Atsuko's Bard). And if you ask if you burned down the Bridges just remember how you threat Dermel, Kilyin and me and a few other AD's that came to help you out a ton.<br>
