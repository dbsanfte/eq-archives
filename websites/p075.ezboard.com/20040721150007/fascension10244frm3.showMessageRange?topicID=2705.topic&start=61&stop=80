I also want the US, as a country, to behave in ways that are best for us and for the world.<br>
<br>
I also agree with most of what Taranna says.  So am I disloyal because I think Bush is an incompetent, and that his international policies are so haphazard as to border on the schizophrenic?  Because I think Bush is a shill for large corporations, particularly those in the petrochemicals industries?  <br>
<br>
Despite what Fox news and other political neanderthals spout, dissent is not disloyalty.  Indeed, I dislike the current administration, and its actions, not because I hate my country.  In fact, quite the opposite is true, I dislike Bush *because* I love my country, and I feel that his actions diminish both our reputation, and the fundamental freedoms our founding fathers held so dearly.<br>
<br>
If you want to make leader worship a litmus test for loyalty, then I'll suggest to you that a republic is the wrong form of government for you, sirs.  <br>

Bush was voted into office by the [almost] majority.  Bush also does not make decisions on his own, but relies on many forms of council.  Maybe it is just semantics, but I think if your going to blame someone throw blame at the whole administration as well as the people who voted him into office.<br>
<br>
I agree with you Bum 100% that dissent is not disloyalty and I respect your opinion greatly.  However, I tend to agree with the actions of Bush directly.  The reason I agree is that I see Iraq as a clear threat to the U.S. in that he would have and could have harmed us given the proper resourses which he was proven to have been acquiring.  Enough said, in my opinion.  You say you want to kill me then I see you trying to buy a gun in my opinion I now have the right of more than a defense, but to attack in defense.  I only have one life and would not have the opportunity of defense if I waited until you killed me to decide an action. Honestly, would you have rather seen more Americans die first then months of hearings to prove resposiblity before action?  Do you think the lives of 900 Americans who volunteered for service is too high a cost to protect countless others who did not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#333333>(6/7/04 2:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> &quot;Despite what Fox news and other political neanderthals spout&quot;<br>

Peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and decent human values- everything that was pissed on in Abu Ghraib.  After the fiascos of Vietnam and Iran, 3 US Presidents- Reagan, Herb Walker Bush, and WH Clinton restored the world's faith in those fundamental American values.  <br>
<br>
Their administrations were by and large competent, they both believed in multilateralism.  Reagan called the Soviets an evil empire yet negotiated arms treaties, and negotiated smiling with Gorbachev.  The &quot;downfall of communism&quot; was planned multilaterally and to be as painless as possible.  HW Bush put together an Arab coalition, a specific UN resolution and an exit strategy for the first Gulf War.  If he hadn't, Bumraz would likely still be there, his tour extensions and &quot;no-quit&quot; policy etc.  Clinton was a known multilateralist, I won't go into that.  <br>
<br>
What I remember most about Ronald Reagan, what I remember most of all, is that when those American marines died in Beirut, he said in his address that &quot;If responsibility exists for a policy mistake of this nature then it rightly rests with this office, with this President.&quot;  He took responsibility for his policy, whether it was good or bad- and he was humble about his role in the biggest change for good an American President.  Rest in peace Ronnie  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
All three of these Presidents that made America great and good again in the eyes of the world (2 Republican 1 Democrat) were greeted like heros when they traveled as statesmen.  For his achievements in the world Reagan was truly a hero.  Protestors follow Bush around everywhere he goes, more than I've seen.  Do I hate America because I can't stand a piece of shit deserter addressing veterans and comparing the sacrifices of WWII with a failed war of choice?  <br>
<br>
What have I said here after all Kura?  The Iraq policy was wrong, and is failing.  Torturing innocents is wrong and democracies shouldn't tolerate it.  Good government doesn't let this happen on its watch, and is held accountable when it is.  That's not hating America, just hatred of brutality, oppression and incompetent waste of life and treasure.  Last time I checked, America hated those things as much as I do.  Last time I checked, those are some of the justifications given for removing Saddam Hussein.  <br>
<br>
No, what I posted here isn't hatred of America.  You want to see hatred of America Kura, you go to the slums of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and the Cairo Aq-Fayar ghettos in Egypt.  You go to the Palestinian refugee camps and see the results of a failed policy, where destitute poverty lives within eye's glance of the shining walls of a dictatorship of sheikhs fat on oil and American/British support.  There you will find hatred of America Kurakai, real and burning hatred.  You won't find a shred of hatred for America in my heart.  <br>

Fox news is Murdoch media.  Like all Murdoch media, from Fox, to Sky News in the UK, to Star News in the Middle East- Murdoch media without exception broadly supports the position of the governments in the countries that it covers.<br>
<br>
Even when those positions collide.  Members of Hamas' political wing are regularly interviewed on Star News Egypt, Israelis are described as &quot;Zionist murderers&quot; on Sudafi News, and America is called &quot;a global force of evil&quot; on Star News in Saudi Arabia(one of our allies- where incidentally Al-Jazeera is also popular).  If you want something I personally find disturbing yet hilarious, there is a show on Star News in Egypt(a country the US gives a billion dollars a year in aid to be friends with them)- called &quot;The Al-Massoud Factor&quot;.  He gives you the straight facts just like O'Reilly does!  Here's a quote from his show, translated from Arabic-<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What is the difference between 10,000 civilians in Iraq, 6,000 in Afghanistan and the 3,000 Americans killed in America?  There isn't one my friends!  3,000 Americans killed in America by extremists, and 16,000 innocent Muslims killed in two countries by soldiers ordered by religious extremists on a crusade.  They even said it was a crusade.  Extremist militants attack America killing innocents then extremist Americans order the killing and torture of innocents in revenge.  You've heard what they say just like you here what bin Laden's tapes say- the broad message is the same &quot;Us Against Them&quot;- it is a hateful propaganda that they both believe.  <br>
<br>
Extremist militants run away like cowards after sending young men to blow themselves up.  They aren't accountable for their murders.  The American extremists in power hide like cowards behind the actions of their troops on their oil-profiteering pedestal of power- you and I know there isn't a real difference there.  If there was why is their Vice-President's oil company given a contract for Iraqi oil that no one had a chance to bid for?<br>
<br>
We know the score viewers, we've known it for years, just as we've known Sharon and Islamic Jihad have no difference with bin Laden and Bush- they're all murderers.  The worst part for me is that they never dirtied their hands with what they believed in themselves.  Bin Laden was a rich oil businessman, Bush was a coward who ran away from his army in Vietnam, the leaders of Islamic Jihad would never blow *themselves* up!&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sanctimonious and insidious bullshit like that is what Murdoch media broadcasts in the Middle East- it's Fox News looking in the mirror.  So you'll forgive me Kura if I don't take at face value what Murdoch's media says in the US on Fox News when all it does is preach to the government and extremist position crowds in whatever country it's in.  Murdoch's stance as a businessman is expeditious and calculating- the calculation here is that Americans rarely if ever look for foreign sources of news, especially those with extreme viewpoints, the same goes for Middle Eastern viewers.  So it's relatively easy for the two extremist viewpoints to coexist in the same media organization, like two ships passing in the night.  <br>
<br>
Lastly Kura- I'm not on any side of any aisle.  I just think that torture and police state behavior is wrong and that competent democratic states/governments don't let it happen.  Torture of innocent civilians shouldn't be a partisan issue for god's sake, it is just WRONG.  Stop believing that and we might as well not be fighting terrorism.  If saying that torture is wrong, imprisonment without trial is wrong and that the Iraq policy was wrong is hating America in your eyes, then I'm saddened and astonished.  Especially since half of America does think the policy was wrong, and far more than half believe it's being mismanaged.  But I guess they all hate America to you Kura, they must do if they agree with me.<br>

You made a lot of sense and really, your right.  I didn't see your point until you made the analogy between Reagan taking responsibility and Bush not.  I saw the address where Bush refused to admit any wrong doing and I, a staunch republican, thought it was horribly egotistical.  That coupled with the &quot;People&quot; magazine article I read a few years back whereas Bush was saying that Jesus came to him and told him to lead the world leads me to believe that his inability to admit guilt is driven by his belief that everything he does is God given destiny, therefore incapable of error.  Scary, considering his actions thus far.  The scariest part is what God may tell him to do during his last 4 years if re-elected.  I'm not a Christian, or any religion for that matter, although I do believe in God and have a profound respect for anyones religion.  However, I do not feel that God gives people orders and I think it is scary, very scary, that Bush believes he does whether it be in prayer form or directly.  You have opened my eyes to something and I will have to give alot of thought to how I will vote this November.  I dislike John Kerry, but he may just be the lesser of the two evils. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neeeeeedra>Neeeeeedra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#333333>(6/7/04 9:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> !</span><hr size=1> www.scaryjohnkerry.com/wmd.htm <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just came back from giving a lecture at UCLA yesterday, and the lecture was on the Middle East. I tried to step back and take a more strategic view of the Middle East and the issues out there and maybe give them a perception of the problems and issues from the eyes of those that live with it day to day: the Arabs, Israelis, all those that make up the peoples of the Middle East.<br>
<br>
On the way back I was thinking about what to talk about here, and I know Iraq is a hot topic, and I thought I would stay with Iraq. And I thought on the airplane about how history is going to record what happened in Iraq, how we got into it, and obviously it's too early to tell. And oftentimes the outcome defines how history characterizes it.<br>
<br>
But I thought about how much has been misconstrued about what has happened so far, especially at a time when I commanded CentCom and we were in the process of containing Iraq as part of the policy. And I thought about the mistakes we made, that, as Bruce [Blair, the president of Center for Defense Information] said, I've commented on before.<br>
<br>
And what I thought I would do tonight is go through the 10 crucial mistakes to this point that we've made. Because I think it helps frame what, in fact, has happened over time ... and is going to be the first part of that history. And I will conclude with maybe some thoughts on the way ahead, at least from my point of view.<br>
<br>
I think the first mistake that was made was misjudging the success of containment. I heard the president say, not too long ago, I believe it was with the interview with Tim Russert that ... I'm not sure ... but at some point I heard him say that &quot;containment did not work.&quot; That's not true.<br>
<br>
I was responsible -- along with everybody from General Schwarzkopf to his two successors that were my predecessors, myself, and my successor, General Franks -- up until the war, we were responsible for containment. And I would like to explain a little bit about that containment, because I thought we did it pretty well, given the circumstances. And it began with Bush 41 [President George H.W. Bush] accepting the U.N. resolution to conduct the war, staying within the framework of the U.N. resolution, and not after the war going to Baghdad, breaking the coalition, ending up inheriting a country that I think he clearly saw would be a burden on us, our military, our treasury, and would break relations around the region, and would put him outside what he considered his international legitimacy for doing this -- the resolution by which he operated and conducted the war, and the resolution by which we established the sanctions.<br>
<br>
Administering those sanctions was done pretty effectively I thought. In the entire U.S. Central Command, in my time there, on any given day we had less troops in the entire region than show up to work at the Pentagon any morning. Think about that. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, carriers, squadrons, battalions. On any given day ... on an average day in CentCom, we had about 23,000 troops, soup to nuts. Logistics, fighters ... and we ran that with these 23,000 troops. The whole region. To top it off, those troops were not assigned to CentCom. In other words, that structure wasn't created to be part of CentCom, like the troops are in the Pacific Command or in the European Command. These were troops that were on rotation. They came from other places, from the United States, from Europe, from the Pacific region. And they rotated through. Ships rotated through, battalions came in and out, squadrons came in and out. So we never created a structure. We did it with borrowed troops, so we could up the rheostat or lower it when we needed to.<br>
<br>
It was, in my view, what we would call in the military an &quot;economy of force theater&quot; without these assigned forces. We had no American bases out there. We were sharing bases with allies in the region who provided for us. Any given year, those in the region ponied up $300 million to $500 million to support our presence out there. What we called &quot;assistance in-kind.&quot; They provided the fuel, the food, the water, the things we needed. The Saudis built a $240 million housing complex for our troops. Never once when we decided to take action against Saddam, when he violated the sanctions, or the rules by which the inspectors operated under, never once were we denied permission to use bases, or airspace, or to strike from those places. We built a wonderful coalition, without any formal treaties, without any particular arrangement.<br>
<br>
During that time, when we asked allies in that region to join us in other conflicts, like Somalia, they came. Egyptians came. Pakistanis came. The Saudis came. The Kuwaitis came. The Emirates came and provided forces. They joined us in the Balkans. They joined us elsewhere on operations when we needed them. We ran the largest military exercises in the world ... in this part of the world. In Egypt we did &quot;Bright Star.&quot; We built a magnificent coalition of forces, without ever once signing a piece of paper. And we contained Saddam. We watched his military shrink to less than half its size from the beginning of the Gulf War until the time I left command, not only shrinking in size, but dealing with obsolete equipment, ill-trained troops, dissatisfaction in the ranks, a lot of absenteeism. We didn't see the Iraqis as a formidable force. We saw them as a decaying force.<br>
<br>
We couldn't account for all the weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors that were in there had to assume that the weapons of mass destruction that were in his original inventory that we could not account for might still be there. So that was always a planning factor. But when you look hard at that, these were artillery shells, rocket rounds, that he would have to be hiding somewhere that were getting old. And if he had to bring them out and use them, think about this, he's got to move them to artillery positions, to battery positions, under total dominance of the air by the United States. I sure as hell wouldn't have been ... want to be that battery commander that said tomorrow you're going to get five truckloads of chemical weapons to be stored in your area to shoot. Not under the air power we brought down and the ability to interdict them. And these were tactical capabilities.<br>
<br>
Much has been made, which confuses me, about unmanned aerial vehicles. We monitored the L-29 program ... a trainer that he was trying to put tanks on. Never once in my experience did he ever fly it unmanned. He usually crashed it even manned. And in order to even hit Kuwait, he would have to bring it into the no-fly zone and launch it from an air base where we didn't allow aircraft to fly from, and we would have taken it out -- preemptively.<br>
<br>
We bombed him almost at will. No one in the region felt threatened by Saddam. No one in the region denied us our ability to conduct sanctions. Many countries joined us in sanctions enforcement, in the no-fly zones, and in the maritime intercept operations where we attempted to intercept his oil and gas smuggling.<br>
<br>
So to say containment didn't work, I think is not only wrong from the experiences we had then, but the proof is in the pudding, in what kind of military our troops faced when we went in there. It disintegrated in front of us. It didn't have the capabilities that were pumped up, that were supposedly possessed by this military. And I think that will be the first mistake that will be recorded in history, the belief that containment as a policy doesn't work. It certainly worked against the Soviet Union, has worked with North Korea and others. It's not a pleasant thing to have to administer, it requires troops full time, there are moments when there ... there are periods of violence, but containment is a lot cheaper than the alternative, as we're finding out now. So I think that will be mistake No. 1: discounting the effectiveness of the containment.<br>
<br>
A side note on that. The process of containment created an &quot;alliance,&quot; which I would put in quotation marks, in the region. We located our forces in all six GCC, Gulf Cooperation Council countries. When we deployed, we made sure that we got everybody in the region pregnant when we acted, and deployed, and enforced sanctions. We deliberately put our troops in positions and operating out of bases where everybody had to make a political commitment. That was the rule and everybody understood it. And we built an arrangement out there, a security arrangement, through the enforcement of those sanctions, that I think helped us create stability. I think we made a mistake in not capitalizing on that. I think the Clinton doctrine and policy of engagement was right, but we never really got the resources or authority to do it to its fullest extent. I think there was a reluctant Congress to provide those kinds of resources, but that would have been cheaper by half. The idea to regionalize our problems and allow us to build the forces within a region that can deal with these problems, I think is a much more powerful idea. We could have done that in Africa, we could have done that in the Middle East, in Central Asia, and elsewhere. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm not a warhawk, I didnt want to go out and nuke every country that was involved with the terrorists of 9/11, I didnt want to invade and kill Iraqi's.  While you may not see a clear stance from me, I do love democracy, but I understand that some people who have been living their whole lives in a society where they are told what to do might not like the chaos that a democracy holds.<br>
<br>
You take out quotes and put words in my mouth, like saying how I support torture. Read through all my posts and see where I said that I think that beating and raping them is good - I was iterating the ability to pick people up was right because it was wartime and reflected a different time where some liberties must wavered. But I said that what it lead to was sad (meaning that I DONT condone raping them)- its not like I explicited stated we should tie a rope with a brick to their balls and drop it. The statements I made were that things like that happen all the time and that even our own citizens fall into those cracks - but these things arent as widely important or publicized as Abu Ghraib. <br>
<br>
The thing I was defending was their right to pick up anyone for questioning if there was evidence of them...  I read some of those articles about the prisons and the Red Cross report, and it said that the abuse was taken place in the high-security sector of the prison which a few of the prisoners were held on scant evidence - the rest of them were held on very strong evidence and intelligence (albeit - like i said before, it could be a salem trial where neighbor X points his finger at mrs.goodwife and gets her burned at the stake). Plus the only people that were tortured were people held there on highly suspicious evidence and because of their &quot;high value intelligence&quot;... But that aside, I would have conducted the interrogation differently process much more differently.<br>
<br>
I dont think the best interrogation methods are to rape, beat, or injure... and even if the greatest amount of evidence would not come from them, at least detain them so that they dont cause any problems, until a judical branch is set up so that they can have their day in court - possibly help them establish a process much like our own where they call the witnesses and swear on their words to the bible/quran/or whatever... <br>
<br>
If your rebuttal is that it might take months... even years... well it could take many months even in the United States for some others... but yes, it is a long time, but if they were even able to show the kind of process in taking time to help the Iraqi's set up a judical system to try these suspects, it would also help in the process of the Iraqi's to have some faith in democracy.<br>
<br>
But during wartime, even stated in the constitution, we are subjected to lose some of our rights as Citizens as well for the protection of the greater good - yes it was taken out of hand due to the torture, but there are far more pressing matters to deal with... Like I said before, I didnt think we should have been in here in the first place without the proper support already starting to rebel in Iraq and more evidence.<br>
<br>
What I am arguing for is that during wartime, certain civil liberties should be altered...  but you mistook it for torturing and raping - I meant it as being able to look into things with a lesser suspicion, instead of having to get a suponea (sp) from a judge in order to check the premises.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>...If people took that attitude then segregation and apartheid would still be around...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
These things are still around... There is still racism, there are still sweat shops in some lesser developed countries(nearly like slavery), there are still militant prisions, there is still segregation(by choice) and cliques. Definitly not to the same extent as in the past, but these things still exist everyday... no matter how you look at it, there will always be people reigning over others, and there will always be a bias of race, ethnicity, religion or anything else.  And due the the biases of race and the descepency of income, we see an economy segregation that is created.  People always take a stand on these things, my parents do a lot to try to help out the community here, but a lot of things remain unchanged even with their rallys, donations and fundraisers.  Lots of people protest, rally, lobby, but lots of times, their jobs, kids, life get in the way...  Its like the old Cliche, you cant please everyone - and in this case, you cant always get everyone to agree with their point of view.  I see what you are trying to say, I understand with what you are saying, I agree with some of your other points about the war, but with the loss of liberties during wartime, I see it differently.<br>
<br>
And yes, you are very ideological in your arguements, you base everything on &quot;natural laws&quot;, your morals and your type of justice.  Anytime anyone has ever argued for their viewpoint and how the end justifies the means, or might makes right or you have to fight fire with fire, you argue your ideology against theirs - you argue that if we stoop down to their level, we are no better than them (I think that is an ideology) - Not saying its wrong or anything, John Locke and many other people thought the same ways.  <br>
<br>
My dad and a lot of my uncles fought for freedom and democracy, some died, but they understand what it was like.  Sadly, most of them like Bush and support him.  I am a little more liberal than they are... I have much different morals, but sometimes I do believe you have bend the rules just a little (no I am still not advocating raping their women) - I am very aware of the rape, torture and other things that went on in Vietnam, as are my parents as well.<br>
<br>
You always hear people rallying and critizing Bush as well, but people are more inclined to rally against something they dont support than to rally for something they support. 5-6 more months will show the real numbers though (even though we have a pretty low voter turn out)  Plus earlier you even stated about how Nazi's were able to imprison anyone that opposed their war plans, well how do you think they got so far?  People saw the warning signs coming, but they appeased him slowly until he grew.  Not saying that Bush actually read a history book, but there are many things where a decision is very tough when you are the actual person to pull the trigger. Anyway, I've read your points, and I know you wont change how you view things, on the other hand I might, since im still pretty impressionable and new to this kind of stuff... But, I do believe that some rules need to be bent to accomplish other things.<br>

One doesn't need a huge intellect(I certainly don't have one) to read around the issues and try to understand them better.  Heck, I've been driven around by London cabbies that have more sophisticated opinions about foreign policy than the ones I've expressed here.  <br>
<br>
As you hint at, I don't dislike Bush for the party he belongs to- I liked HW Bush and Reagan a lot.  If Herb Walker Bush ran from any party, he would have still been the best candidate for me- if GW Bush ran from any party with the same administration he has now, I wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole.  Powell and McCain are both staunch Republicans, but I think they would make far better Presidents than the current incumbent, or indeed John Kerry as he stands today.  My issues with Bush are his policies and their abject failure, not party politics.<br>
<br>
  You see what I mean by accountability and faith-based policies also.  I agree with you that faith is a fine thing on a personal level- but spreading Gospel in the name of policymaking that kills people is something the Ayatollahs in Iran do, it shouldn't be what an American president does.<br>
<br>
On another note, while I'm happy that you're weighing your vote more carefully, I'd say it is far too early to decide.  Bush's alternative still hasn't defined himself very well- if he presents a clear alternative in the 5 monts remaining, then that's what democracy is all about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Well the only problem with that line of argumentation is that the rule of law is not at all chaotic.  The rule of law is anything but chaos, it provides certainty and the bedrock upon which democracy is built.  In the Iraqi constitution like the American constitution, due process of law is imperative.<br>
<br>
What would you find more chaotic- soldiers sweeping residential areas and rounding people up, or a regulated system of due process law?  I find the latter more democratic and a lot less chaotic.  Again, Stalin, Chairman Mao, Pol Pot and every other tin pot dictator and brutal communist dictator sniggered at democracy for being so &quot;chaotic and unstable&quot;.  Indeed...I wonder where they all are now? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The ironic thing is that democracy is incredibly stable- 90% of democracies that have been established naturally have survived.  Only where serious foreign intervention takes place (CIA assasination of Mossadeq in Iran or MI6 liquidation of Bashar Sulaiman) does democracy ever give way to authoritarian government.<br>

I never said you supported torture, I merely said you were indifferent enough about the subject to make me ill.  I may not be a slave owner or whip slaves for example, but if I invest my money or opinions in a company that would go bankrupt without the slave trade- I am still tolerant enough of it to let it happen and profit by it.  Tolerance of morally heinous actions doesn't mean you condone them, but it does mean you accept them with apathy.  Something I personally am unwilling to do.<br>

See I think we have a misunderstanding here, I apologize for not clearing it up sooner.  You say in wartime, the war has been fought and done with.  There are no moving fronts, no axes of advance, no clearly defined battlefield, no organized battlegroups facing us.  This isn't war, but occupation and an insurgency challenging the legitimacy of that occupation.  In such a situation, suspending civil liberties only creates tension and atrocity- Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Israel-Palestine provide perfect examples of how counter-insurgency and brutality work at cross-purposes.  Heavy handed tactics of any kind simply provide fuel for the insurgency and rob the occupiers inch by inch of the moral high ground.<br>
<br>
If it was a battlefield situation, then I can see how innocent people might be briefly detained.  But these individuals were detained and tortured for months at a time, nearly a year in some cases.  Whatever it is they're supposed to have done, it hasn't been proven and the process isn't even remotely transparent.  That is dangerous and is a big part of the reason why the security situation is far from improving.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The statements I made were that things like that happen all the time and that even our own citizens fall into those cracks <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It wasn't a crack but a huge gaping fucking hole.  US citizens fall through cracks in a well oiled and fundamentally fair (in most states) process of law.  The only process in Iraq is the say-so of occupying forces and appointed authority- nowhere near the same thing.  US citizens are answerable to each other, and all 3 branches of government- not to some foreign occupying army.  If you can appreciate the significant differences, and put yourself in the shoes of an Iraqi civilian without any way to challenge being detained or to prove your innocence- then perhaps you'd see what I'm getting at.<br>

I'm not suggesting red tape to hamstring security measures.  What I am saying is that good street-level intelligence is a must.  Not just a random Iraqi pointing the finger at another- but reliable turned sources inside the insurgency.  Given the apalling lack of soldiers that understand local affairs or even know more than a few words of Arabic- it is impossible to gather the intelligence needed to arrest guilty parties reliably without due process.  Without the guarantee of good street intelligence, you're always going to get a majority of innocents by randomly sweeping a &quot;hostile&quot; neighborhood- and possibly create enough hostility for the teenage son of a prisoner murdered in custody to strap a bomb to himself.<br>

Slavery as defined by the sale of human beings as property has been eradicated- the same is true of apartheid politics and politico-religious inquisition.  Their abolition didn't occur by people being &quot;sad&quot; about it, it happened by active engagement in a political process.  Tolerating injustice in the name of security has overthrown dozens of immoral principles and policies.  But it all begins with a clear stand against the wrongdoing- without a clear belief that it is wrong in any circumstance, then it is certain the practice won't change.<br>
<br>
Segregation by choice isn't apartheid, it's human ignorance, and you can't make ignorance illegal, else we'd have to arrest the whole of Lucid Vision and most of Sullon Zek.  The laborers in sweat shops aren't property, they are paid a wage and don't wear a slave collar.  They can also leave their job at any time, equating that with slavery is extremely misleading.  <br>

I don't believe in natural law persay- as argued by HLA Hart the jurisprudential philosopher.  I favor the Ronald Dworkin view, that law is a reflection of society and its values.  Civilized values, values that the United States has always stood for, clearly declare torture of innocents as abhorrent and unconscienable.  If American civilians abroad were detained in prisons without trial and tortured, you can be sure their government should and would stand up for their rights.  Who stands up for the Iraqis?  They have no government, no legal recourse and no oversight on their detention- much the same as the 3 children at Guantanomo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not saying its wrong or anything, John Locke and many other people thought the same ways<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Locke hated the idea of natural law, and would likely have argued with HLA Hart extensively over his merits.  Locke was far more a subscriber to the legal precedents of common law which reflected society's values.  That was the nature of his &quot;social contract&quot;- based on the intrinsic values a society holds dear, not its morals.<br>
<br>
I am not being ideological when I say these are wrong- I am looking at the long chain of common law and international legal boundaries that clearly forbid it.  Boundaries that it has been US policy to respect, obey and attempt to spread across the world by persuasion.  Trying to impose such values by force inevitably means abandoning some of the most important ones along the way.  <br>

You overlook the apathy of the German people in your statement.  You're acting as if the Nazi's progression in power base is the fault of nations that appeased them.  Where the real fault lies was in the apathy of the German people to the terrible state of their government.  Much like the apathy towards torture I've seen here, and the general apathy towards politics the majority of people reading this probably possess.  When people withdraw from politically engaging their government, things like the Nazi rise to power happen all too easily.<br>

I use that argument as a stepping stone if you read my posts carefully.  I say that if we stoop to their level or in that direction, that the moral justification for invading and then occupying that country is lessened.  When that justification diminishes, more Iraqis will ask themselves whether or not the occupation is worth it.  When if they are being ruled in a dictatorial fashion with no say in affairs or their own detention, there's a chance they'll wonder whether or not one of their own despots mightn't be better than the foreign variety of despotism.  <br>
<br>
The snippet you take from my post is somewhat dogmatic yes- but it forms the cornerstone of a clear policy argument.  That morally degrading our position threatens the success of the policy in a very serious way.<br>

In the presence of a convincing arguments that engage and clash effectively with mine- I am more than willing to change my opinion.  <br>
<br>
But as you've already seen, more people are content to ignore what I say, refuse to read supporting evidence, refuse to read around or research the issue- or in other cases, simply call me an America-hater, an evil-doer, a dissenter or a coke-snorting liberal.  It's far easier to hurl insults or dissemble than it is to formulate convincing arguments.  However, when confronted by one I have been known to readily change my mind or at the very least re-evaluate and refine my position.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But, I do believe that some rules need to be bent to accomplish other things<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I am still not at all sure what you mean by this.  What exactly do you think is accomplished by bending these rules?  If anything significant has been accomplished I've yet to see evidence of it- perhaps you or someone else could provide it?  It's worth remembering that generations of people in a score of countries have died to help establish those rules.  I think it's wrong and expeditious to comply with them when convenient and discard them when they aren't.  That's what the worst tyrants of history did, being associated with that way of thinking undermines policy and plays right into the hands of the real terrorists.<br>
<br>
The crucial issue is this.  Whether or not you think bending the rules is justified or not, it has to be considered with another important consequence.  We are all fighting terrorism now.  The only way to defeat terrorism is to dry up popular support for it.  As long as there is popular support for terrorism, they'll have an enormous sea to swim in.  &quot;Bending the rules&quot; as you call it, will swell the popular support of terrorism and make it even harder if not impossible to apprehend people willingly shielded by a sympathetic populace.  If bending the rules means we threaten the strategic goals of global counterterrorism, is it then really worth bending those rules? <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

You can't honestly sit there and tell me that FOX news is the problem with media today, every other broadcast station in america is equally biased to the left just as much as Fox news is biased towards the right. You cannot convince me otherwise. (no, really, don't try)<br>
<br>
&quot;Lastly Kura- I'm not on any side of any aisle. I just think that torture and police state behavior is wrong and that competent democratic states/governments don't let it happen. Torture of innocent civilians shouldn't be a partisan issue for god's sake, it is just WRONG. Stop believing that and we might as well not be fighting terrorism.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll wait for you to point out in any of my comments that said I believe torture of prisoners is a good thing or even something that I remotely condone.<br>
<br>
You're not on any side of the isle? Hardly. every conversation I have had with you about politics, religion, military, every one without exception you are on a particular side of the isle. I have loved our conversations/debates Taranna but lets not try and paint your arguments as non partisan. <br>
<br>
And lastly, on to Bumraz,<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you believe him? or our draft dodging, &quot;Daddy get me in the guard so I don't have to go to 'nam&quot;, &quot;faith driven&quot;, former drunk President? I know whom I'll choose to believe. &quot;<br>
<br>
It is exactly statements like these that motivate me to not engage in a debate, nor even bother reading someones argument, it is clear you are not entertaining logical, friendly debate but trying to instead provoke, with half truths and full out lies. Enjoy.<br>

<br>
George Bush and the Air National Guard:  if you seriously believe that a mediocre student, with no significant athletic ability scored himself that slot on merit, without pulling strings, you are crazy.  Read the list of folks who got those kinds of slots during Vietnam.  It's like a laundry list of the politically connected.  Perhaps you don't think that the wealthy and privileged (who are most often responsible for sending the nation to war) avoiding sending their own sons and daughters into combat is dodging. I think it is.<br>
<br>
Why were those slots so popular with the rich/connected? Their own sons and daughters didn't have to fight and die like those with less privilege.  Say what you like about Kerry, at least he fought.<br>
<br>
Former drunk? Long-acknowledged by &quot;dubya.&quot;<br>

Fox News?  I have heard exactly the kind of crap broad stroke painting of those with other views that I mentioned above.  Not acknowledging the deliberate slant of Fox News is at best disingenuous, and at worst, ignorant.<br>

Here's what Matt Labash, a well known conservative writer had to say about supposed liberal bias:<br>
<br>
Matt Labash --  The American Spectator -- interviewed by Columbia Journalism Review partner Web site JournalismJobs.com. <br>
<br>
Interviewer: &quot;Why have conservative media outlets like The Weekly Standard and FOX News Channel become more popular in recent years?&quot;<br>
<br>
Labash:  &quot;Because they feed the rage. We bring pain to the liberal media. I say that mockingly but it's true somewhat ... While these hand-wringing Freedom Forum types talk about objectivity, the conservative media like to rap the liberal media on the knuckles for not being objective. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We've created this cottage industry in which it pays to be un-objective ...

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>June 7, 2004  |  WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of lawyers in the Bush administration argued in a paper last year that the president has supreme authority over the questioning of terrorist suspects, and can legally order interrogators to torture or commit other crimes against them.<br>
<br>
The lawyers, not identified by name, were part of a working group writing a policy governing interrogation techniques to be used at the prison for terrorist suspects at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br>
<br>
It was unclear if their arguments are part of the legal policy of the Bush administration, or are simply one group's reflections on interrogation law and torture.<br>
<br>
Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said Monday that the final set of interrogation methods adopted for use at Guantanamo in April 2003 are humane, legal and useful. It is a narrower set of methods than some had proposed.<br>
<br>
Di Rita described the paper as a staff legal analysis that was part of an internal Bush administration debate on how to obtain intelligence from al-Qaida operatives in U.S. custody, within the confines of a standard of humane treatment. The intelligence sought was to prevent terrorist attacks, he said.<br>
<br>
The contents of the paper, labeled &quot;draft&quot; and dated March 6, 2003, were first reported in Monday's The Wall Street Journal. A portion of it was then obtained by The Associated Press. The lawyers who authored it include attorneys from both the Defense and Justice Departments, and possibly other parts of the government.<br>
<br>
At a minimum, the paper offers insight into some of the legal thinking going on within the Bush administration regarding the prosecution of the war on terrorism. It discusses both domestic law and international treaties governing torture and the treatment of prisoners, and concludes Bush has vast legal authority for a number of reasons.<br>
<br>
Mary Ellen O'Connell, a professor of international law at Ohio State University who has seen the draft paper, called its arguments unconvincing.<br>
<br>
&quot;In every case it finds defenses, narrower readings of that statute, or justifications that allow torture in a wide variety of circumstances,&quot; she said. &quot;The legal analysis is weak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the Pentagon adopted a set of 24 interrogation methods it would use at Guantanamo, Di Rita said. The majority are psychological tricks and techniques described in Army field manuals.<br>
<br>
A smaller group are not, including four methods that require at least tacit approval from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. None are torture in the Pentagon's view, Di Rita said.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's my belief that Americans would find them perfectly reasonable,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The nonstandard techniques includes isolating a prisoner from others, altering his diet (but still providing him adequate food to survive), and questioning him up to 20 hours at a time for up to three days, he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's nothing that involves deliberately applying pain,&quot; Di Rita said.<br>
<br>
The four methods have been used on two inmates at Guantanamo, including one who may have been designated a &quot;20th hijacker&quot; in the Sept. 11 plot, military officials said.<br>
<br>
Gen. James T. Hill, the senior commander with authority over Guantanamo Bay, said last week that interrogators do not use dogs or drug injections during interrogations.<br>
<br>
However, the lawyers who wrote the March 2003 paper suggested the U.S. government may have the authority to conduct some drug injections during interrogation as long as they don't &quot;disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.&quot;<br>
<br>
The lawyers identify three concepts that would permit American personnel to commit crimes in the course of interrogation.<br>
<br>
One is that President Bush, as commander in chief of the military, has complete authority to make war, and interrogating prisoners falls within that scope. It likens congressional or judicial review of interrogation procedures to Congress, or a court, interfering with the planning of a battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;In order to respect the President's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign, ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his Commander-in-Chief authority,&quot; the paper says.<br>
<br>
Another, termed necessity, is that hurting or even killing one person to save two lives is justified. The third concept, self-defense, says the harsh interrogation of a prisoner believed to have information on an imminent terrorist attack is the same as shooting someone pointing a gun at you. Law professor O'Connell O'Connell called that an &quot;absurd&quot; leap, saying the situations are not legally equivalent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Where did I say you condoned it?  I didn't put words in your mouth in that post, I'll thank you not to put words in mine.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>every conversation I have had with you about politics, religion, military, every one without exception you are on a particular side of the isle<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Firstly, I didn't realize that religion was an issue of any side of any &quot;aisle&quot;.  I don't consider religion a political issue, perhaps you do, but I don't.  I prefer to leave God out of politics myself.  As far as the military goes, I think every nation should have a strong military with a primary role of national defence and accessory peacekeeping roles and adequate funding for the same.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if that falls into any political pigeon-hole persay.  Clinton made significant cuts to the US military that I thought were unwise- Bush's presidency has cut veteran benefits more than any administration since Herbert Hoover's and implemented a &quot;zero-retirement&quot; policy, which I also find unwise.  <br>
<br>
I thought you knew me better Kurakai- I don't believe in party politics, partisanship or an ideological paradigm.  I believe in successful and well planned policy that achieves moral and reasonable goals.  That is not a partisan view, but a pragmatic view.  Pick any issue you care to think of, and you'll find I take views on both &quot;sides&quot;.  More to the point, I support policies that work, policies that are reasoned and argued.  Ideology and dogma interest me about as much as having my eyebrows plucked by a blowtorch- they are useless to good policy-making.  <br>
<br>
If I was partisan, why would I prefer Ronald Reagan's presidency to Clinton's in any way?  Reagan was a rabid conservative that was involved in Iran-Contra, Nicaragua and Granada.  The answer is that Reagan held himself accountable for his actions, good or bad- that made him a great leader instead of just a good or average leader.  I lost all respect for Clinton when he refused to hold himself or anyone he employed accountable for the policy failures of Somalia and the Middle East peace process.  <br>
<br>
If I was partisan I'd support Clinton to the hilt, but I don't- he made mistakes, Reagan made mistakes, and HW Bush made mistakes.  But the kind of mistakes that GW Bush is making have far-reaching global consequences and make us all less safe.  No president has so badly miscalculated foreign intervention on this scale since Vietnam.  Show me another one in a modern timescale Kura...the fact is you can't.  <br>
<br>
There's nothing partisan about that- it is just dangerous, intellectually uncurious and incompetent.  Not to mention it will lose us the war against terrorism.  Bush isn't incompetent because of the party he belongs to- I think Jimmy Carter was incompetent also.  Guess Democrats are gonna call me partisan now huh?!  But, but, wait! I must be a schizophrenic partisan!!!!  Well maybe not, perhaps I just oppose bad policy, full stop.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but lets not try and paint your arguments as non partisan<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Rofl, I love the way you put that.  Show me a single comment I make that is purely partisan in any way.  I don't paint my remarks as non-partisan, they just are.  You're the one accusing me of being partisan, I know I'm not.  As the accuser the burden of proof is on you- show me this supposed &quot;partisanship&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is exactly statements like these that motivate me to not engage in a debate<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Anthony Zinni is an experienced commanding officer that has overseen the strategic picture of the Middle East.  None of George Bush's advisors who supported the war have anything approaching Zinni's experience.  Norm Schwartzkopf opposed the war, Colin Powell opposed the war, both were high-ranking military commanders that know the region well.  Richard Clarke, the counterterrorism chief under 4 Presidents (3 of them Republican) said that the obsession with Iraq &quot;was unreasonable and diverted vital resources from the fight against terrorism&quot;  Is that partisan also?  Or are they, like me, simply criticizing a policy they see as wrong?<br>
<br>
What exactly do you find illogical about trusting the word of experts who have seen war and know the strategic picture of the region well?  Seriously- look at the predictions the pro-war Bush camp made about the war Kura.  Banned weapon stockpiles enough to annhilate the free world ten times over.  Post-war France again, rose petals and open-armed welcomes for liberators.  De-Baathification cleaning the slate instead of militarizing private armies.  Iraqi oil being used to pay every cent of reconstruction instead of burdening the US taxpayer.  If you compare the two strategic views...the proof as Gen. Tony Zinni says, is indeed in the pudding- the military experts and strategists have been proven right, the regime-change fanatics haven't had a single prediction about the strategic picture come true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>it is clear you are not entertaining logical, friendly debate but trying to instead provoke, with half truths and full out lies<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Full out lies like saying I hate America for example?  Seriously, we've spoken maybe 2-3 times about anything remotely political, and you've rushed to judgement there- saying &quot;I hate America&quot;.  I'm confident you're smart enough to know that what you said there was inflammatory unprovoked bullshit.  <br>
<br>
Why Kura?  Are you just trying to get a rise out of me, or do you genuinely think dislike of some American policy is dislike of everything American?  What do you base that comment on I wonder...I can't find a single remark in any of my posts that can be construed to be hatred of America.  None of my American friends at work who've read the post think so, and most of them consider themselves Republican.  That's why I'm wondering what it is I said that made you say what you did, and then accuse Bumraz of lying to provoke, because I don't think that he did, and it looks like you did by saying I hate America.<br>
<br>
You haven't made a single argument on this thread.  All you have done is called Bumraz a provocative liar, called me an &quot;America-hater&quot; and dissembled about your perceived motives for what I am saying.  Then you complain about the lack of logical friendly debate- when you have contributed nothing that remotely resembles it.  I'm confused Kura :/<br>

Refute this, I dare you.  Using familial and political connections to get into a non-combatant unit is dodging, plain and simple.  Then, to blow the flight status paid for by the taxpayers by not getting a physical, and not drilling adequately to complete his obligation, he further dishonored those who actually did do their duty.<br>
<br>
Let's not also forget: in aptitude tests for flight, George Bush scored in the 25th percentile, yet still was selected for a highly contested Air National Guard slot. Bush's reserve unit included the son's of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and Gov. John Connally, as well as several members of the Dallas Cowboys.  It was called the &quot;Champagne Unit.&quot;  Seeing a pattern here? No, of course not. <br>
<br>
Bush's reserve drill attendance is public record.  So is the composition of the list of those who got non-combat flight billets.  Instead of putting your fingers in your ears and screaming liberal bias, check it out.  Or were the officials keeping the reserve records in a big left wing conspiracy?  Maybe Anthony Zinni is a bleeding-heart liberal senior general from the Marine Corps too?  It's nice when you can ignore facts to make one's own Weltanschauung the reality.<br>
<br>
Ever served in the military?  Do you know what happens to normal people in the National Guard and reserves who don't complete their drilling obligations?  <br>
<br>
&quot;faith driven&quot;<br>
Out of his own mouth. <br>
<br>
former drunk President<br>
By his own admission, Bush spent from age 16-41 controlled by alcohol. Arrested for DUI. blah blah blah. Again, all either his own admission or public record.<br>
<br>
Inflammatory or not, the above characterization of Bush is exactly factually accurate. <br>
