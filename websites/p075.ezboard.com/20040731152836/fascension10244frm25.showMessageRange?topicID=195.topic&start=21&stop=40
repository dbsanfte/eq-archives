the telegraph to the Brittish inteligence service to help change american public opinion, even though there is little material evidence to support this claim i find two statements on the subject most interesting one made by Winston Churchill in 1922 then colonial secretary;&quot;It should not be thought that, in the Balfour Declaration, Britain gave something to the Jews for which she received nothing in return&quot; and the other by Lloyd George in 1931 talking to the times saying he issued the Balfour Declaration in gratitude for Weizmann's contributions in wartime acetone production. <br>

[/quote]<br>
<br>
Israel has had nuclear weapons for the last 4 decades, even when they were on the brink of destruction in 1973 they didn't even consider using them.<br>
<br>
If ever you could consider nuclear weapons as a peaceful deterrent that definition would be Israel, a country of 4.2 million surrounded by a few hundred million enemies.<br>
<br>
Comparing Israel to Iraq is ridiculous, history has taught us that Israel wont use their nuclear capability, while Iraq has time and again used every weapon at its disposal against its own people and its neighbors.<br>
<br>
I was in Israel during the gulf war, sitting in a room with tape on the creases of the windows and a gas mask on my face hoping that the scuds that dropped less than 800 yards away didn't carry nerve gas.<br>
<br>
Those missile attacks were an attempt to force Israel to enter into the war and thereby break the gulf war alliance that included countries at war with them, Saudi Arabia, Syria etc.<br>
<br>
If Israel didn't have their nuclear deterrent I bet that those warheads would have been filled with gas.<br>
<br>
So when you in your ignorance post about how Israel is a threat to world peace , and you have never had Iraqi missiles rain upon you with the thought of death of you and everyone you know on your mind, I wish I was as sheltered.<br>

Somthor i personally also greatly admire Wilson as an idealist but saying Franz V. Papen's testimony &quot;full of shit&quot; doesnt really say much for youre point of view as he was one of the most important german politicians and diplomats of the century.I actually had the pleasure of meeting a man who worked with Von Papen in Turkey who lived almost next door to me Reinhard Spitzy who always spoke most highly of V. Papen's morals his memoir's are very well written giving an interesting insight into european society between the world war's and prove he was a highly intelligent man who greatly loved european culture above all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=somthor>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 548<br> <font color=#333333>(3/8/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iofthestorm.org/images/mok.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crimes against humanity</span><hr size=1> ok, maybe i was hastly it certianly was a knee jerk response let me put it another way<br>

What Israel is doing to protect itself is nothing different than what America is doing in Afghanistan, only that instead of the terrorists being 13000 miles away, In Israel they are sometimes a few city blocks from their targets.<br>
<br>
I have no solutions, but I would love for some of you who are so ready to critcize to propose one.  Before you suggest that Israel makes peace and offers territory and autonomy remember that we have tried that, and by doing so thousands have died. Yet somehow Israel is still and always ready to discuss peace.  <br>

I have one question for you Cusinit as you seam to be well informed about Israel and its situation.Why does israel lay claim to such a large geographic area instead of only the historic roman province of Judea, looking at the map i see israel lay's claim to what ironically was the Crusaders Kingdom of Israel in the middle ages (Geographically speaking) instead of only to the traditional province of Judea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyranxussathir>Tyranxussathir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(3/9/03 8:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Somthor....</span><hr size=1> I understand you are a patriotic american and respect that but about the Maine incident; In 1976, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover published a book &quot;How the Battleship Maine Was Destroyed&quot;. The admiral became interested in the disaster and wondered if the application of modern scientific knowledge could determine the cause. He called on two experts on explosions and their effects on ship hulls. Using documentation gathered from the two official inquiries, as well as information on the construction and ammunition of Maine, the experts concluded that the damage caused to the ship was inconsistent with the external explosion of a mine. The most likely cause, they speculated, was spontaneous combustion of coal in the bunker next to the magazine.<br>

<br>
as to pearl harbour there is stuff out there that suggestes we knew an attack was comming but rosvelt or the base comanders did nothing out of shear lack of duty or as a way to get us onto a war time economy.  and while 6that stuff is out there i have never seen any of it substanuated <p>vita non est vivere sed valere vita est<br>

And he also turned his back when he could have easily prevented the Sabra and Chatila massacres.  He was even found culpable by an Israeli board of judicial inquiry if I'm not mistaken.  There are few angels on either side currently, not many that I'd willingly trust at any rate.  As far as people strapping bombs to themselves go- I agree it can't be condoned- but nor can putting a bullet in the head of a teenage boy throwing a stone.  Be honest with me Cus- in your experience &amp; knowledge, how many times have you witnessed a fatality involving a teenage boy throwing a rock?  Or even a serious injury?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What Israel is doing to protect itself is nothing different than what America is doing in Afghanistan, only that instead of the terrorists being 13000 miles away, In Israel they are sometimes a few city blocks from their targets.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I understand where you're coming from Cus, but with all due respect- the US didn't bomb Afghanistan <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>indiscriminately</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Whereas I would argue Sharon's bulldozers ploughing down entire residential areas is both confrontational and indiscriminate.  And it's not suprising there is anger and confusion when Israeli settlements(effectively squatters on Palestinian land) are encouraged to settle in those areas, while Palestinian homes are bulldozed.  If you're looking for a terrorist in a 5 block radius- Sharon's solution seems to be to destroy every dwelling within that radius.<br>
<br>
The Israeli government is also one of the very few to openly admit torturing its victims physically, as well as imprisoning several individuals without trial.  Whether that's necessary or not is arguable- the fact that these measures are inhumane is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> arguable Cus.<br>
<br>
I'm not taking sides here either- the PA in its current form is as corrupt as can be.  In fact, I would surmise that the most recent attack is aimed as much at the PA's current attempts to reform as it is towards the Israeli government.  Such institutional reform is critical if the PA is ever to be taken seriously.  However, that institutional reform can only take place in an environment of trust.  Only be engaging with each others' demands, and with full cooperation of the parties will that be achieved.  <br>
<br>
The solution is one most everybody agrees on- withdrawal to pre-1967 borders, the creation of a Palestinian state etc- the Roadmap and the details though, are sketchy.  I for one, don't think any further settlement can be achieved with the current leadership of either side.  You can argue Sharon is doing what he needs to do to surivive politically Cus, but history doesn't view that attitude kindly.  Barak and Rabin, *especially* Yitzhak Rabin will go down in history as men who made sacrifices for peace- the latter sacrificed his life for it and will be remembered alongside Sadat (who incidentally met his end at the hands of a PLO gunman in one of Yasser Arafat's crack death squads.  Note also- that both were shot by their own people- Rabin was shot by a jewish Zionist- and Sadat by a PLO extremist..  Extremism in all its forms has a dirty way of expressing itself- and both sides have their fair share.  The current leaders are incapable of controlling factions within their respective movements- an internationally regulated referendum for each candidate from either side (for the sake of equality) might be an idea to break the political deadlock and rub some credibility off on the Palestinian Authority (hopefully by that time reformed to some extent).<br>
<br>
Now the only realistic solution in my mind is to stop the settlements, and make a clear statement about what land will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>eventually</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> form a Palestinian state.  After reform of the PA and an environment having been built between two ambitious leaders committed to peace- we will be ready to start walking the roadmap.  But for that road to be even and untroubled- the US &amp; UK must cease their unilateral support of Israel- rather, support both sides.  Don't cut Israels' 2 bln of aid- but give the Palestinians an equal share of the money, their fair share of the land- and autonomy (when they're ready for it).  <br>
<br>
Israel is no longer surrounded by enemies in the same way it was 30-40 years ago.  There is a very strong case for peace and for bold decisions to be made on both sides.  If someone doesn't step up to the crease soon, I vrey much fear the extremists on both sides will be the only winners.<br>

One of my policitcal science teachers in college use to be a commander in the Ireali army (had been active duty in every single war isreal has been apart of, and knew sharon for about 30 years).  When Sharon got elected we asked him what he thought of it.  His response was &quot;you can say goodbye to any chance of peace now&quot;..... and he was right.<br>
He told us quite a lot of interseting stories of things going on in that region (he was very objective and almost never gave his own opinion), quite a few of them involved the media and the stupid things they did as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyranxussathir>Tyranxussathir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 8:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> On Israel</span><hr size=1> Somthor i do not mean USA sank its own battleship i only mention the fact the USA leadership created a &quot;threat&quot; and casus bellicus using a mere accident.You mention some very interesting facts about pearl harbour;the American secret service had broken &quot;purple&quot; the code the Japanese Army used to send its order's.American Admiral Kimmel actually accused Roosevelt of incompetence in 1947 for not having warned the fleet in time, but as roosevelt was dead no serious indagations were made on the subject.<br>
General Albert C. Wedemeyer who worked closely with the Roosevelt administration also accused Roosvelt of being &quot; as successful as any dictator could have been in keeping Congress and the public in ignorance of his secret commitments to Britain. Commitments which flouted the will and the wishes of the voters who had reelected him only after he had assured them that he would keep us out of the war. The fact that Japan's attack had been deliberately provoked was obscured by the disaster at Pearl Harbor&quot;.<br>

<br>
I totally agree with you Taranna the best solution for Israel is to retreat to the pre 1967 borders.On Israel i will only say; Here is a &quot;democracy&quot; based on the denial of human equality. Here is an &quot;ally&quot; that steals military secrets from the United States, while making it enemies it didn't use to have. Here is a &quot;homeland&quot; for Jews who have never lived there and can't trace their ancestry to it, but who can claim rights that are denied to actual natives of the land. Here is a country that complains about &quot;terrorism&quot; and keeps electing rulers like Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and Ariel Sharon.<br>
<br>
Lots of other writers are well aware of these incongruities, but they avoid talking about them for fear of professional reprisals. Editors and publishers fear being labeled &quot;anti semites&quot;. Israel, we are told, is &quot;our only reliable ally in the Middle East.&quot; It's bad enough having Israel's friendship, but we also get its enemies into the bargain. All this for a mere five billion bucks a year! What a deal! The fact remains as Taranna very sensibly has pointed out we will not have peace in the middle east until &quot;the US &amp; UK must cease their unilateral support of Israel&quot;.As Michael Kinsley recently wrote, Israel is the elephant in the living room -- seen, but evaded in conversation.<br>

<br>
General broad statements like this do not help the peace process.  By declaring who is the native or who can claim the land, your detracting from the peace process, as many extremists would like.<br>
<br>
The US stands by Israel and telling the US to change it's stance probably won't happen.  Asking the US to fund the Israelis and Palestinians equally is also not realistic.  The palestians don't exactly have an established long standing guy whom the US trusts.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kron@ascension10244>Kron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 5:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On Israel</span><hr size=1> If Id be in the US congress Id stand by Israel too, would earn me some more millions every year from Israel lobbys...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cusinit1>cusinit1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 520<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 9:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On Israel</span><hr size=1> Arafat had many chances. As did the peace process. After having 4 prime ministers making concessions for peace the Israeli public got sick of it.  Even the most dovish people, the ones that demonstrated for peace and fought for it have given up most hope.<br>
<br>
Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu, Barak, all tried to make concessions, to discuss peace.  Barak sat down and at the Wye River accords offered Palestinians 95% of what they asked for.  When do negotiations ever go so well for a nation. What happened next? After Barak made the largest offer of land and autonomy and even a capital in Jerusalem? Did Peace break out?<br>
<br>
NO Arafat started the second Intifada.  So it seems the more you offer the larger the Violence?  Arafat started this latest wave of regrettable violence, Nobody denies it, even his newly appointed Prime Minister says that it was a mistake.  This intifada was not like the previous ones, it wasnt just rocks, it was the shooting of missiles, the bombing of tanks, gunmen firing on towns. So please dont give the romantic palestinian boy throwing rocks in the street image.  <br>
<br>
I will tell you how that traditionaly works btw just so you who havent been there understand, they throw rocks and come closer and closer , they ignore the demand to halt, they then ignore warning shots, and creep ever closer till soldiers have no choice but to fire being situationally outnumbered often. Get a few friends and a basket of 5 pound rocks and corner a policeman in your town , and see what he does when you start pelting him from 10 feet away.  This tactic is used for the express pourpose of making martyrs.  Sadly it works, despite all attempts to use ruber bullets , tear gas etc, they know if they do it right someone will shoot.<br>
<br>
After paying in so many lives for so many years the Israelis said enough and Elected Ariel Sharon who promised what they wanted, SECURITY,  not one of my favorite people, but everyone else in Israeli politics had been given a chance and the body bags were piling up.<br>
<br>
I hope this is all a case of things getting worse before they get better, I hope the palestinian people will get rid of Arafat and stop hanging posters glorifying the children that blow themselves up.  I am sure if the violence would stop another leader who believed in Peace would be elected, but I dont think you will ever see another Israeli leader who will sit back  watch people die again. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.aladarya.com/cusinitsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=somthor>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 563<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 10:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iofthestorm.org/images/mok.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On Israel</span><hr size=1> i rember israel in the 80's nice place good milkshakes.  i rember the people were frendly and im not sure who lobed that gernade into the street but he had a really good arm.
