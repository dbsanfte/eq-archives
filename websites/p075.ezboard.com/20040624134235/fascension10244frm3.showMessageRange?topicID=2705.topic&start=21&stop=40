<br>
And if you want to get technical then prisoners have been murdered in the prison by soldiers.  Maybe they weren't dismembered and hung from bridges but they were actually killed.  <br>
<br>
So what's your point?  And the only reason a big deal was made over this is because of U.S. media.  Go figure.      <br>

The Abu Ghriab prison pics are definately a black mark against the U.S., and it will take a lot of positives to erase that tragedy.  However, in no way does this compare to the years of terrorism, killings, dismemberings, mass-killing of their own people, televised executions, kidnappings, etc. that Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, etc,  have been doing in just the last few decades.  Let's try to keep that incident in perspective and remember who the good guys are here. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146302" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/vansig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

They aren't getting revenge, they aren't in the heat of battle. They are methodically and calmly torturing helpless prisoners.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you didn't know I will let you know.  During the first Gulf War I was briefly a part of a unit call POP, or Psy Ops Printing, what we did was we printed brochures and pamphlets in Arabic that the Air Force would routinely drop on Iraqi villages.  The pamphlets said all sorts of things, but believe it or not most of them were warnings.  The pamphlets would say, &quot;The U.S.A. will bomb [this] area tommorrow beginning at 10 A.M. please take as many of your necessary belongings as possible and evacuate the area, for we do not wish you harm.&quot;    Not only did this server the purpose of warning innocents and getting them out of harms way, but believe it or not many Iraqis I sopke too respected us greatly for it.  This is just one example of what Psy Ops does.  Psy Ops is also responsible for the means by which prisoners are interrogated.  If you know anything about the muslim faith you would understand alot better why those pictures are considered torture to them.  To be touched on a sexual part of the body by the same sex will get you in hell.  To have a woman command over you is super taboo as well.  Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why these pictures even existed?  They were not taken for fun they are part of Psy Ops.  If you have these pictures and need information from a true Muslim all you'd have to do is show them to him and say, &quot;This will be you if you don't tell me&quot; and he is BOUND by his religion to tell you, or else he is sentencing himself to hell which kind of defies the whole point of what he's trying to do.  It creates a moral cunundrum.  Another thing does anyone actually believe that a Private First Class - E-3- or a Specialist E-4 reservist has the authority to even be near a prisoner without NCO supervision?  Not in the U.S.Army I was in, not a chance in hell, no way no how.<br>
<br>
&quot;You say you are a soldier. Is this view common amongst your comrades? Are you a US soldier or a member of the coalition forces?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think my reference was too having been a soldier, but moot point I will be again if it is required.  And yes it is a common view amongst soldiers that a good smack in the mouth isn't necessarily torture, at least in my unit.  We were trained very well and in that training there were more harsh things done to us as training than these &quot;poor prisoners&quot; experienced.  And any way you twist it you can't compare what Saddaam was doing to his own people to what we are doing to enemy combatants in time of virtual world war, it's a poor analogy that doesn't even deserve attacking.<br>

Read all of it- note in particular that the prisoner was unaware of other abuses taking place elsewhere in the prison.  Note also that he is classified as a civilian detainee at the top of the report, not a detainee/suspected detainee, not a prisoner of war, a militant or &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;  This is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>civilian</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> likely picked up in a random sweep, being detained in military custody.<br>
<br>
Several of the detainees were badly beaten, one almost to death, and only partially treated by a doctor- the medically untrained MP finishing his nasal stitches as part of the punishment he'd already taken.  Another detainee had freezing water poured over him until his heart had nearly stopped.  As observed in a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/150422.pdf" target="top">sworn statement by a detainee</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (requires Adobe Acrobat)<br>
<br>
Another <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/152307.pdf" target="top">severe beating</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - this one was beaten with a chair until it came apart.  The name of this detainee shows he was a Shi'ite tribal leader of Juma, one of the tribes that helped overthrow Saddam's thugs during the war, risking their lives for British Military intelligence in Basra and coordinating with No. 42 Royal Marine Commandos in the taking of the Fao marshes.  Col. GK Messenger (42 RMC's CO) later compared their efforts to the French Resistance working behind German lines during WWII  Wonder what his tribe's going to do now?<br>
<br>

<br>
Now unless you're suggesting that any of the above acts were consensual- I call it sexual abuse and rape.  Both of which are clearly classified as torture under the universal declaration of human rights (to which the United States is a signatory nation).  The same goes for the institutionalized beatings, and sleep deprivation exceeding 48 hours- both of which were practiced policy in Abu Ghraib.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, all of the links used were sworn statements of some of the detainees obtained exclusively by the Washington post, and can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/iraq/abughraib/swornstatements042104.html" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps worst of all- Abu Ghraib is the same prison that was so feared under Saddam, where rape and beatings were common.  Whether or not you consider rape and severe beatings torture Dae- it will undoubtedly blur the distinction between Saddam's justice and US military justice.  Especially when the CPA has since admitted that between 70 and 80 percent of the detainees (and 74/91 cases of abuse) were civilians picked up in random sweeps, held not because they were responsible for attacks, but because they might have seen something or known someone. <br>
<br>
Now there's a novel way to find criminals- beat and torture innocent people who knew them.  One of the detainees that was made to crawl over broken glass until his face, chest and knees bled- was a street vendor that supposedly sold some food to an insurgency suspect, an engineering contracter he'd known for 20 years.  That is why so many of them were released after the scandal broke.  The vast majority of them weren't &quot;bad or evil fanatics&quot;, but ordinary people.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not you call that hazing or torture, I call it WRONG.  It is also fundamentally illegal under the rules of war, and involved a lot more than 6-7 soldiers.  Else why would there be a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/Investigation/abu_ghraib_cover_up_040518-1.html" target="top">cover-up?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Also, Neeeedra is right in this sense- the kind of wide-spread abuse we now know exists (91 cases pending) must have had at least operational officer approval, possibly the *taciturn* approval of staff officers.  <br>
<br>
Also, not ONE civilian responsible for the administrative affairs of the army- from the lowest office secretary to SecDef Rumsfeld, not ONE person has been fired over all this.  This is an administration that doesn't believe it has made any mistakes- that is a deplorable lack of accountability.  Especially when you consider that an extramarital affair that didn't maim or kill anyone was an issue where stringent accountability was sought.  But not this administration!   Bush even said it at the live press conference, that he couldn't think of any mistakes he had made in office.  There is confidence and there is recklessness in the face of facts- judge for yourself which category the above pronouncements fall into.<br>

<br>
All those &quot;sworn statements&quot; were made by people who must have been placed into custody for a reason. I am not saying they were definitely guilty or innocent but someone arrested them for a reason.<br>
<br>
I can give a sworn statement saying that a police officer beat me. It isn't necessarily true and that is why investigations happen. If I was a terrorist thats just what I would do since what is the difference? I am already in jail and if I am guilty am probably going to stay there.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is you probably shouldn't jump to conclusions since you weren't there. Innocent until PROVEN guilty...<br>
<br>
And just for the record I am all for getting information through what might be considered &quot;rough&quot; interrogation techniques under certain conditions. If the person being questioned is either definitely or most certainly in possession of information that is of vital importance to human life would be the main caveat.<br>
<br>
For example, if I know that detainee #1 knows info about a terrorist attack that will quite likely take friendly lives through unconventional means or will kill/injure noncombatants then I will be the first one to wire his balls to a car battery. It's that plain and simple...<br>

Many of those statements are solidly corroborated Daetien.  We know for certain that sworn statement of the prisoner made to stand on a box and hooked up to wires is telling the truth.  Or is that photo a lie?  Also, the first of the statements I quote, the detainee whose broken leg was repeatedly beaten until he was made to say he loved Jesus and to deny his religion- that was corroborated at the trial of Spc. Jeremy Sivits who turned state's evidence and cooperated for a light sentence.  <br>
<br>
Many of the attorneys for the accused have similarly corroborated these statements- the only one not corroborated is from the un-named detainees, none of whose statements I cited.  The defence teams for the accused are NOT basing their defence on the idea that the statements are false or that the detainees are lying.  They are basing it on the argument of shared responsibility, that their clients were ordered to do it, that the abuse was stated policy and that there is no accountability higher up.  Given their open and free access to the facts and US military personnel witnesses, I think that is *more* than enough corroboration.  Again, you don't have to believe me: the attorneys, the soldiers who were there and have corroborated it, their statements openly submitted to the defence attorneys- you are free to believe all of them are lies Daetien.  That is your right.  <br>
<br>
But I'm confident that the majority of this abuse did happen as stated by the detainees and as reported by the Washington Post, as confident as I was in my prediction before the war (extensively posted and argued on this very forum) that WMDs wouldn't be found and that Iraq was no significant threat- and the significant terrorist whirlwind we would all reap as a result of invading a sovreign nation.  I have since been proven right on all those counts, and am confident the same will happen again- the trials of the accused are coming up and we'll both be there to see the truth that I am sure will emerge.<br>
<br>

Did you even read my post or the statements?  Mohanded Juma Juma, the Shia tribal chieftan who risked his life repeatedly and the lives of his tribesmen during the conflict.  What possible hatred could he have for the coalition that he would willingly risk Saddam's secret police, Amn-al-Khas, Mukhabarat and Fedayeen to bring out vital intelligence to the Basra attack?  What anti-US agenda did he have?  The street vendor who sold food and praised the invasion for resurrecting his business in Baghdad, and used to work for the CPA- how is it he hates America exactly?  And more to the point, without any measure of due process, how did he or anyone else in that shithole of a prison deserve any of what happened to them?<br>
<br>
You also seem to be saying that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every single detainee</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> whether civilian, militant or insurgent hates the United States.  What analysis are you basing this on may I ask? After all, polls show Iraqi Sunni civilians marginally support the war, so a representative sample of civvies picked up in random residential sweeps should also have at least half of a supportive base.  In fact, the majority of the civilians interviewed were indifferent towards America before torture, and most of the insurgents don't hate the US, they just love their country.  US soldiers don't hate Iraqis, but they believe in their mission- why can't you believe the same is true of insurgents btw?  <br>
<br>
Your statement has an edge of bitter truth in one sense however- although many of the prisoners didn't hate the US before they were tortured, a lot of them are likely to now.  What's more, the popular support for the secular insurgents will almost certainly increase.  Not to mention that the size of the sea that terrorists freely swim in just got a whole lot bigger.  It seriously threatens the overall mission any way you look at it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All those &quot;sworn statements&quot; were made by people who must have been placed into custody for a reason. I am not saying they were definitely guilty or innocent but someone arrested them for a reason.<br>

If that's what you believe, but what about this statement you made:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Innocent until PROVEN guilty...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Let me get this straight- you have no problem with justifying the detention of civilians in random sweeps- but you have a problem with prejudging the conduct of US soldiers?  Sounds like a bit of a dichotomy to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If I was a terrorist thats just what I would do since what is the difference? I am already in jail and if I am guilty am probably going to stay there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Woah there pardnuh...you just said innocent until proven guilty- but the tone of this statement sounds like you disagree with the US appointed CPA.  Who said that 70-80% of the inmates were civilians picked up in random sweeps from residential areas.  That's taking the CPA estimate at face value of course, they have every interest in maximizing the list of potential suspects.    <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For example, if I know that detainee #1 knows info about a terrorist attack that will quite likely take friendly lives through unconventional means or will kill/injure noncombatants then I will be the first one to wire his balls to a car battery. It's that plain and simple...<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So you approve of extreme or brutal treatment of defenceless people if it might save lives Brotherscale?  Leaving aside the obvious question of how you're sure if someone is witholding such information- it removes a LOT of the moral barriers that seperate us from terrorists.  Some of those tortured might know something, but many won't- that is the nature of random sweeps.  You are essentially employing collective punishment for possible information- something the Nazis did extensively, as well as the worst of the brutal police states.  Idi Amin and Stalin would wring their hands with glee at the very thought.  Killing or maiming civilians in the name of saving life is just about the most repugnant thing to me, I would hope it was to most people.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that it's counter-productive.  Out of the 20% of non-civilian detainees, more than half are criminals.  The remaining 10% are the high-value targets.  The collective torture and punishment of the civilian majority alongside Ba'athists and terrorists is likely to create hatred for the occupation where none previously existed.  Any talk of the torture &quot;saving lives&quot; is pretty much bullshit if you consider that the result of the scandal will likely kill many more American/coalition soldiers than any possible benefit from torturing them.  You can't forget Brotherscale that the only way the mission succeeds is to dry up support for the insurgency while increasing public support for the short-term occupation.  Both have been dealt a serious, possibly a crippling blow by Abu Ghraib- a few less operational casualties isn't worth the price, either morally or practically.<br>
<br>
Another thing.  Suppose we consider that the motivation for the murder and dragging of the 4 contractors was designed to provoke a US withdrawal from Fallujiah?  Local Sunni militias and leaders would certainly view a withdrawal as a key part of saving lives and avoid the collective punishment of civilians.  By the same sort of reasoning you use, if brutal treatment saves the lives of their militia and civilians then that barbaric behavior is justified in achieving a broader goal.  In fact, their goal *was* achieved- US troops withdrew from Fallujiah.  Whether or not they are linked will be as irrelevant to the militias as the torture of civilians seems irrelevant to you.  <br>
<br>
Let's make it clear- there is no moral equivalence between the two acts, I make the comparison purely for strategic purposes- since Brotherscale used the argument in favor of torture for &quot;strategic benefit&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Everybody in San Quentin is innocent btw.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Convicted in a court of law and picked up off the street- there's a world of difference there.  Saying there isn't is simply a denial of a key principle that makes us a civilized society.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nobody seems to show pictures of the 4 civilian contractors that a huge crowd tore to pieces and dragged through the streets.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The angry mob doesn't claim to represent democracy and free society values or believe in the military imposition of those values- the United States <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and never ceases to remind other nations to clean up their act.  It doesn't mean the slaughter of the four contractors was justified or civilized but neither the mob or the Iraqi people at large hold themselves or others to the same standard by force... as the US has been doing.<br>
<br>
Remember that the United States is occupying another country- and is therefore responsible for security, infrastructure and all the bells &amp; whistles of an occupying power.  Whether you think the abuses were right or wrong, big or small, they were criminal.  Under the UCMJ, Geneva Conventions, Universal Treatment of POWs Treaty, just about every legislative rule on the subject, it is illegal.  On a somewhat related note cus, remember that conversation you and I had about Guantanomo Bay a couple months ago?  I argued that it would increase tolerance for barbaric Stalinist behavior under a veneer of moral justification.  <br>
<br>
I argued that saying &quot;a little evil behavior is OK in defeating *potential* agents of a greater evil&quot;---- would eventually lead to the thought &quot;well perhaps a moderate evil is OK....&quot;  I think the responses on this thread to the abuses is a measure of proof that the denial of due process at Guantanomo is leading to greater tolerance for brutality in other related areas.  I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>genuinely worried</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that we'll all wake up one day and find that we're a lot closer to the enemy in moral terms than we've ever been in recent history.<br>
<br>
The reason it's such a big deal cus is that without WMDs or a real security threat to the West, the only remaining justification is the moral justification for removing a tyrant.  That justification is considerably lessened by using Saddam's favorite mini-Gulag to continue a slightly less brutal version of the same torture of civilians picked up in random sweeps.  Whether or not one supports the torture of civilians arrested I think it's hard to argue that it won't have a serious effect on the success or failure of the Iraq policy.  If that weren't the case then why were huge numbers of these supposed &quot;evil America-hating terrorists&quot; released after the scandal?  It certainly isn't appeasement- the Bush administration doesn't believe in appeasement.  Historians will look back on this as immoral- probably, as another in the series of policy failure blunders- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>without a doubt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>

<br>
<br>
As I said, I feel they must have been placed into custody for a reason. And as far as taking the US appointed CPA's statements at face value I don't know their credentials other than Paul Bremmer (and even then I am not intimately familiar).<br>
<br>
The CPA is UN appointed as I remember as well but I may be wrong. And anything appointed by the UN is suspect in my eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
And I did not make the argument in favor of torture for strategic benefit. I stated that in the case to preserve noncombatants when I KNEW the person was in possesion of certain information. Scroll back up and re-read it. <br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
For example, if I know that detainee #1 knows info about a terrorist attack that will quite likely take friendly lives through unconventional means or will kill/injure noncombatants then I will be the first one to wire his balls to a car battery. It's that plain and simple...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Any talk of the torture &quot;saving lives&quot; is pretty much bullshit if you consider that the result of the scandal will likely kill many more American/coalition soldiers than any possible benefit from torturing them.

<br>
No, that is not the only way the mission succeeds. &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; is a major factor but so is cutting the head off the snake so to speak. And again neither you nor I can know what information may have been gained. How do you know that information learned did not just save thousands of lives yet you will never hear about it due to operational security?<br>
<br>
Now, as to the people who you quoted as being allied with our cause. I can't say why they would have made those statements but until I know otherwise they might be under duress due to certain conditions we are not aware of (such as threats or family issues) or their views might have changed. We just don't know since we weren't there. <br>
<br>
Also as to Iraq not being a threat it was not only to hunt WMDs that we invaded. Sadaam Husein was known to fund groups that were hostile to the West, specifically the USA. Now, lets say he were to fund one of these groups with enough cash to purchase a nuclear weapon or biological weapon. Neither one of us can see the future...Nobody can. The people who made the decision to invade went forward with the information they had. And call me naive but I tend to believe they have more complete information in most ways then is available to the general public. <br>
<br>
It is late and I will respond more tomorrow. Mainly what it comes down to is I do not worry about becoming my foe or sinking to his level. My foe in this case kills noncombatants, women, children, specifically for the purpose of inflicting terror and fear. If I am inflicting that pain and suffering then it will be when I am damn sure the person holds information that will save those same innocent lives or by me acting those lives will be preserved. Call me a sociopath if you like, I really am not going to have my feelings hurt, since I do not harm without good reason. But give me a good reason and all bets are off.<br>

You need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat, think I mentioned that in my post somewhere.  They are well worth reading too- I didn't find any hatred of America in them, and they were all interviewed seperately without collusion.  Also 99% of what is in those statements is corroborated in the photographs, information supplied to defence attorneys and most importantly of all in the Taguba report.  <br>
<br>
That's the report Gen. A. Taguba wrote which categorically confirms almost all of the abuses and in which Brig. Karpinski was castigated for letting it happen on her watch.  That's mainly why I was so suprised by your response, that you haven't read the statements explains why you wrote it.  If you'd read the statements I doubt you'd have said what you did.<br>

A small correction if I may- replace every &quot;u.s.&quot; in your quote with &quot;GW Bush administration&quot; and you're absolutely right.  I can't stress this point enough- Bush Sr., Reagan, Clinton were all rapturously received for the most part when they went abroad by both foreign publics and media, because they by and large acted even-handedly and tried to build consensus rather than throwing it away.  <br>
<br>
After 9/11 the world was united in standing with the United States in sorrow and resolve, in an unprecedented diplomatic alliance against terrorism.  History will be astonished at the speed and callousness with which that alliance was sundered by belligerence from the Bush administration.  The entire world is far less safe because of that and the Iraq war, terrorism has never been so attractive to the mainstream because of it.<br>
<br>
Also, this administration is the most unilateral US administration in the post Bretton-Woods era, more than 50 years.  There are a series of incredibly offensive foreign policies that have alienated the international community.<br>
<br>
Most notable are:  <br>
<br>
-Refusing to support the Kyoto protocols on the environment<br>
<br>
-Ignoring the Earth summit on the environment<br>
<br>
-Siding with China in the trial-free detention of political prisoners, the first time a US administration has endorsed such behavior<br>
<br>
-Withdrawing from the ABM treaty<br>
<br>
-Refusing to sign a universal agreement banning land-mines designed to maim rather than kill<br>
<br>
-Pre-emptive war doctrine, throwing away all of the post WWII rules of diplomatic engagement regarding conflict<br>
<br>
-Refusal to ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war-crimes trials.<br>
<br>
-Rushing to war in Iraq on a security pretext:  people have I believe forgotten how quickly the administration pushed for war at all costs<br>
<br>
-Abandoning the traditional role of the US as an even-handed negotiator in the Middle East peace process.  A <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3681999.stm" target="top">letter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> was recently written to the President by about 50 former US diplomats and foreign intelligence officers making this very point.  This is the first time so many former foreign service officials have protested so widely over the Middle East policy issue.<br>
<br>
-The unbidded exclusive awards of contracts to US corporations to rebuild Iraq, particularly Bechtel and Haliburton that have well publicized links to key members of the Bush cabinet.  This creates the impression of war profiteering.<br>
<br>
-Guantanomo Bay.  Citizens from several countries, and three children (aged 9-14) being detained without trial is terribly worrying to all the United States' traditional allies.  The only nations that have taken great heart from Guantanomo are autocratic regimes that know the US can now no longer criticize them for their abysmal human rights records.  Innocent until proven guilty no longer seems to apply, the Geneva convention specifically forbids indefinite detention of this kind under any circumstance.  Many feel Abu Ghraib and Guantanomo are two sides of the same coin.<br>
<br>
Those are a few of the key reasons that while Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton were rapturously greeted as leaders of the free world, GW Bush has tens of thousands of protestors following his every visit.  This isn't the way people have always felt about the US.  Prior to the Bush administration the only way you could have got 100,000 protestors marching in London was when the Chinese president or some other autocratic dictator visited.  President Bush is the first US president in the history of the United States to be greeted by such large-scale protests in nearly every country he visits.  <br>
<br>
So while I agree that the Bush administration is routinely and roundly criticized by global publics, pundits and the media- I also agree that it is with good reason.  There are serious, major and numerous policy issues that have created a huge headache for America and her allies, on a scale never before seen.  I think they'd be irresponsible *not* to criticize bad policy.  Under Bush Sr. and Clinton, US foreign policy and the US military had a huge measure of respect for what they did.  Clinton gave the US military an incredibly good name with intervention in Bosnia, Kosovo and Croatia, all successful police actions with broad, near global international consensus.  <br>
<br>
Bush Sr. went to war for the right reasons, to defend a sovreign state, and brought an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Arab Coalition</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of armies along with him, keeping the alliance with Israel as he did so.  That alone was a PHENOMENAL achievement- his son can't even create a serious international coalition for a much larger-scale war, the Bush administration has made America shoulder the whole burden and ignored its Allies' concerns.  Rather than accept a compromise of policy to achieve consensus they preferred to stick their heads in the sand and go it alone.  The result is uncontrollable violence (even the Green Zone in Baghdad isn't entirely safe) and an appointed government so bereft of legitimacy or popular support that the new government has to meet in a guarded military compound.<br>
<br>
Three Presidents, one Democrat and two Republicans created sustainable policies and managed conflicts carefully, almost always achieving their goals and successfully accomplishing exit strategies.  This isn't about political ideology Dae, it's not about liberal, conservative or independent.  It's simply good policy, and bad policy.  I liked Bush Sr. a lot more than I liked Clinton as a president, his policies were superb, and he didn't seek popularity or fame like Clinton did.  GW Bush however, has endangered us all with his irresponsible and logically corrupt faith-based policies.<br>

Most likely?  You wouldn't accept the photographs or the trial of Spc. Jeremy Sivits as proof then...why's that?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>yet no one mentions the good things the us troops are doing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The vast majority of the good things you are talking about are legally required of the United States under international law.  The occupying authority is responsible for security, infrastructure, justice, government and every other natural responsibility of a sovreign government.  If it wasn't the legal responsibility of an occupying power to provide all these things, you can be sure the American taxpayer wouldn't be footing so large a bill, it's an unacceptable burden and not unforseen.  That's why (as reported in Bob Woodward's book) Colin Powell told the President before the war &quot;We will be owning another country, do you understand what that means?  We will be responsible for every aspect of life there and its betterment, you'll be President of two countries&quot;.  <br>
<br>
There is however, one major exception of occupation responsibility, and that is accountability, either locally, at the top, or internationally.  There is no means for US soldiers who commit crimes in Iraq to be held accountable to Iraqis.  It's also worth reiterating that no civilian administrator from the lowest to the highest level has been fired over any of the far-reaching policy catastrophes, that in itself, is truly staggering.<br>
  <br>
This also goes to the heart of why allies aren't providing significant numbers of troops or cash for post-war Iraq.  The same administration that insulted them and shut them out before the war, and pissed on the United Nations has now done a 180 when they're in trouble an in an election year- it smacks of expediency.  Allies can't reverse their position on the war by providing post-war support, it'd be a hegemonic policy conflict of staggering proportions and has placed them in a nearly impossible situation, both politically at home and diplomatically.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>in the end, when all is said and done, abu ghraib will most likely be a footnote in the history books<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I doubt that very much.  People much like yourself said the same of the Mai Lai massacre and of the Amritsar massacre- but they have proved to be seminal moments in popular opposition to illegitimate occupation.  Iraqi children will learn about the horrors of Abu Ghraib under Saddam and under US occupation just as Vietnamese children today study the slaughter of innocents at My Lai, Irish children study Bloody Sunday and Indian children study Amritsar.  It's a sad, disgraceful and TOTALLY PREVENTABLE black mark on the history of a proud nation with fundamentally good values that much of the world looks to for leadership.  Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton provided that leadership, all GW Bush has provided is a denial he has made any mistakes.  Well here are <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=64326" target="top">a hundred</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or so to choose from.<br>

<br>
Im having a hard time understanding the whole Iraq issue.<br>
<br>
America feels Iraq(or better put, Saddam's Regime) is a threat to not only America, but to all free people, correct?<br>
<br>
But what about N Korea, Libya, the whole India/Pakistan business, Isreal/Palestine etc etc etc?<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion these are all 1,000,000 more serious situations than the one in Iraq was, and they pose a far greater threat to free nations around the world(Including America) than Iraq.<br>
<br>
Now everyone says the war in Iraq is a war against terrorism, however Iraq's involvment in terrorist organizations is like a fart in the wind compared to what several other nations have contributed to terrorist groups.<br>
<br>
I watched the news religiously like most others after September 11, but have constantly questioned, why Iraq?<br>
Is it Osama and gang? well they booted to Afghanistan, and the fighting in Afghanistan gets about as much play on the U.S. news Channels as the Calgary Flames( Go Flames!).<br>
<br>
So I am told America invaded Iraq due to Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br>
<br>
Well they dont exsist. However, everyone is still content that this war happened, and is still going on.<br>
<br>
I post this question here because I know several military people troll around here, and I hope someone can answer my question.<br>
<br>
Why did America invade Iraq, and why are they still fighting a war there?<br>
<br>

To say that Bush's decision to enter Iraq was purely for a more friendly government towards the US or fighting against terrorism would be completely wrong... there are a number of reasons that he went there.  Lets just leave it at that and draw our own inferences.<br>
<br>
And those prisons are nothing, happens every day in State prision i bet =P.  Shit happens, just dont drop the soap.<br>
