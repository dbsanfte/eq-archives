see that first line threatens phizle with bad things in regards to AD if he doesn't stop raiding with MiM..  treasure is just an applicant, not even a recruit, same with phizle.. each are free to raid with whomever they choose (for the most part) and, then threatens to KS MIM on tormaxx if they attempt it using AD to do the dirty work..  <br>
<br>
as for tekas not liking you, attempting to gank a mom from mim surely isn't going to make him like you anymore.. and if you are KOS to MiM you need to clear that up before even applying. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608" target="top">Daetien Beyazid</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Few weeks ago I was out with my guild (now revered).. we are a small guild nodoubt (like 10 members online at once), but we were bored and decided to check zland. I believe Moordred was with us b/c he was bored and we needed a tank. We decided to go check on zland, lo and behold he was up! So our group (who was in WW) was otw to DN to kill him seeing as there were only 2 other people in zone... Treasure, and a CE necro who wasnt involved. <br>
<br>
Treasure saw a couple of us in zone and promptly claimed that Zland was camped. I /ooc'd that I thought he was FFA and as such the first group able to kill him had just right. Naturally we werent going to ks from him if he'd been camping but I was just wondering if that changed. Tcat began to get upset and ended up threatening to log his sk who he had camped there to disc HT me. So i asked if he was threatening me and he responded with something along the lines of &quot;if i was what could you do about it&quot;.. <br>
<br>
I believe i have a screenshot of this conversation on my home computer, not sure because im at work.<br>

Yes I may have turned down 2 much better geared people, but a friends still a friend, and im not going to accomodate every situation where im online around my advancement over helping friends.<br>
<br>
Ill re word the whole situation with statue in a much shorter space. Here's a nice analogy : &quot;we're both AD apps, and when / if KT spawn I have friends in AD who are going to take the spawn. It would be a very smart move for you to come help us, as opposed to appearing like a mini magus and fighting against AD for a spawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for MIM being ganked from.. It's high time I ganked something from them, after all the times they've ganked from us by shear threats. I've many nice screenshots of them taking / threatening to take contested mobs, and KoS'ing every person in the zone regardless of guild. <br>
<br>
And Takon, we were first to zland, first ready to kill, first in zone, first all around. AS I recalled tomz (who was with us) talked moordred out of zland, or at least to ensure that we got first engage. AS I also recall you were with Tekas and another mim. You were all waiting with us at the prep point, the difference being you had no slower and a druid healer, thus in order to kill zland without moordred, the only possible option would be to kill us after we had slowed / debuffed, engaged zland, then KS the spawn. Threatening to HT you was more than a grounded threat. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smlog>Smlog</A> at: 1/13/04 3:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shimm59@ascension10244>shimm59</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/04 4:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not..</span><hr size=1> Ganking Tormax off all Mobs is not nice.... /cough <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=takonrz>TakonRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/04 5:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not..</span><hr size=1> umm... wtf are u smokin? lol<br>

1st!.When i zoned in you were the ONLY one there, and unless you can solo him.. you weren't &quot;ready to kill&quot;. <br>
<br>
2nd we never once went to the prep point b/c my entire group stayed at the zone in. <br>
<br>
3rd.there was no mim with us.. only mim i remember was simsima who zoned in like 15-20min after us... and we did have a slower in group. <br>
<br>
So the random thought in your head that we will kill your ENTIRE group after debuff was grounds to threaten? Tomz may have talked moord into letting you guyz have first engage.. which doesnt matter b/c we were letting you anyway. Even if that was the case we had a very capable 2nd tank in group who could easily have done the job. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=takonrz>TakonRZ</A> at: 1/13/04 6:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirdario>sirdario</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drama Please!</span><br>  Posts: 988<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/04 7:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Subject</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>as for throwing ad's name around.. read a bit above there..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yea k, i overlooked that part, kinda dumb but hey, I was in a group with Strydere and Mico the other day, and I was like can Ezz come? and then Strydere was like &quot;I dunno man 2 encs&quot; So I said &quot;Do you want to make enemies with AD?!?!?! Let Ezz come bish you need to kiss ass&quot;<br>
<br>
Then again, I got denied when I reapplied, hey actually now that I think about it maybe thats why.. (har har joke ok)<br>
<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
He was right in all fairness. Had Phizle helped MiM kill King Tormax when Treasure and his AD friends were camping it, Phizle would have made enemies of the people who he took the mob from. Look at it in a literal sense, stop being such a girl, not everything has 12 layers to it. <br>
<br>
And the laughing thing.. if he laughed about it yea, fuck him. But to be PERFECTLY honest, what prolly happened was Sadko said &quot;Oh shit, Carnage, he's from ES I hate him.. and Yue, I told sird once why I hate her but sird forgets why right now.. Treasure tell them to fuck off or I walk&quot; and so Treasure told them to leave..<br>
<br>
I think what a lot of you are forgetting is that when he applies he is asking for the chance to be TRIED OUT. None of this stuff is major stuff really, if it turns out he sucks you'll know in a week, if he turns out to be an asshole you'll know in a week.. he still needs to get 3 sponsors anyway, don't ruin someone's EQ career because they're LDON group had a conflict of interest and there was a contested King Tormax spawn..<br>

Of course, I checked anyway, and it was up - I asked him why he lied, and he just shrugged it off, and made some vague threats and told me he'd be back in two hours with people to kill, and if we wiped by then it was his mob - I told him he was more than welcome to do that.<br>

I have not had any other dealings with him but I wanted to confirm the impression that many others gave about him being a bit dodgy in dealings with FFA mobs - besides calling someone with an excellent reputation like Takon a lier isn't a good way to clear things up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smlog>Smlog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/04 8:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When i zoned in you were the ONLY one there, and unless you can solo him.. you weren't &quot;ready to kill&quot;. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Mearis, you can't track korocust from zone in anymore, as you could before. As far as I knew he wasnt up, because I cant look with an eye.

If you do get into the guild, I hope you treat my friends better than you treated me.  Even if you don't, you might want to think about having a little more respect for people you don't know.<br>

<br>
First come, first serve rule does not apply where MiM is involved anymore. As per Tekas new rule is &quot;if a member of DoZ is present in the zone at any time of the raid, whoever is doing the raid forfeits all rights to that mob even if they cleared the fucking zone&quot;. That rule was invenvted recently by Tekas. So... there.<br>
<br>
Second thing. I don't try to exclude any AD members or people from my LDON groups. Proof? I did LDON adventures with Cascia of all people. If anything some people in AD don't like me and rather not group with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Yuenye and Carnage probably misunderstood and took above incident way out of proportion. However, I do refuse hard setting adventure groups without group that has at least a remote chance at winning. If we had another warrior in group at that point and lacked a snarer for example, it is quite possible I would object to having another warrior or wizard, that are while skilled players would in &quot;MY OPINION&quot; hinder overall group's ability to successfully complete an adventure.<br>
<br>
I grouped with Carnagex in Droga doing Droga ring quest. I even liked the guy since ES war, why would I send him back from an adv. group if we needed him? You guys probably misunderstood what was said and Treasure was most likely just frustruated trying to find a hard ldon group at 4am in the morning.<br>
<br>
P.S. Hi Cascia! /hugs <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyrosprial007>Pyrosprial007</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://fohguild.org/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=145044" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Useless</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1587<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/04 9:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fohguild.org/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=145044 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I will bit the bullet.</span><hr size=1> slurp slurp much pos? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daetienofrallos>DaetienOfRallos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 749<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/04 1:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I will bit the bullet.</span><hr size=1> sird the difference is, you at least were in AD and quit, and do have some affiliation with the guild due to your past with us.. and the fact that virtually all of AD knows you and how you talk..  i know of treasure, as do many in ad, but i don't know treasure.. he also assumed that ad would be coming to kill KT if it did pop.. and the people who he listed as his supporters/friends? lolz... tavil is a RL friend of phizle.. who he was throwing the AD tag around to.... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608" target="top">Daetien Beyazid</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I support the friendship outside of guild thing, but it leaves a bad taste to be an application to AD, and deny 2 AD member of a LDON group when they were said it was OK to come, then drop them cause a friend say it wasn't cool to group with AD folks.<br>
<br>
here's how i see it, stay with the friend and be part of that guild, why bother making new friends in a guild you trying to get in.<br>
<br>
goes vice-versa, i wouldn't expect folks to drop unguilded friends for guild members if spot already taken/filled up from verbal agreement.<br>

     We have different ideas of what shows tact in representing a guild.  I still think I handled this situation accordingly and that I did nothing wrong.  I talked with a member of the guild by my own volition and I made the decision to post with the encouragement of another.  You think I'm an asshole for saying anything to a member of AD to begin with.  Apparently what Treasure said would come to pass has happened, I have made an enemy in AD for going against his wishes.  I think that sucks, but that is part of posting something negative on someones application.<br>
    Please direct any further opinions [about me] to my application.  Thank you.<br>

Honestly, you could have talked to me, to a member, to an officer, you could have asked for a conference between myself and an officer, or whoever &quot;prompted you.&quot; Instead you torpedoed me right away, incidently 1 post down from praising me, this was a direct attempt and success to attack me, cause drama, and attempt to usurp some form of power. <br>

I read the post and the logs, and have seen the pictures.  I was honestly surprised to see you do something like that.  I did not expect it, and even hoped it would be a one time thing.  Yue and a few others have come forward and said they've had other negative dealings with you, a few members specificly say you've threatened them before.  This is not a one time thing.  Apparently you've done it before, and it came up.  One thing about applying to AD is all of your dirty laundry comes out.  I feel that you've handled this poorly, and if you'd handled it in some other way, you'd still have a shot at being a recruit.<br>
<br>
Maybe think about what got ya into this situation, try to rectify it and show that change to everyone...who knows, may even give you another shot.  But the insinuations and threats and illusion of control really has to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=617.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=617.topic&start=41&stop=52>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=617.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=617.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=617.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=617.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=617.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=617.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
