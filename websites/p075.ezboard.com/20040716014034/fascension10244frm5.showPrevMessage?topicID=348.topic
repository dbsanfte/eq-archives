Maybe my rolls were minor, but one way or another I contributed to the cause.<br>
<br>
I’ve played and play for the enjoyment of the community, hanging in Ever Quest with my RL friends and the accomplishment of goals.<br>
<br>
The major enjoyments have been playing this game with my RL friends.<br>
Many years have been spent assisting Kringe (also know as many other names) on events before the establishment of AD, watching some of my RL friends playing on the wrong side of this sever and getting their ass whipped while I just laughed, and leveling characters to realize I just didn’t like the class.  I have played Ever Quest since approx.  July of 99.<br>
<br>
I have acquired a character and spent my time working on his rep and levels. <br>
<br>
The acquirement of this character occurred at level 49 from a RL friend that left to play DAOC.  This character is now level 61 with 24 AA.  .  Since the acquisition of this account I have established a good rep and have maintained it.  I don’t believe this character has the proper keys and minor details to become a recruit for AD. <br>
<br>
Once again, I would like to be able to participate in events with friends and be part of the next major events on this sever to come.   <br>
<br>
Recently I met Warhoundt, Tohde, Praxx, Biguss and others while visiting Dallas with Kerry and Mike.  It was a great time. <br>

Now as for impackt, I told him to join a smaller guild, help them out and stay outta trouble. He acquired no gear from any guild he was in, all the gear he has I paid for myself when he proved to me he would do *good* with the character. But if you have any other questions about whom people claim are rl friends of mine feel free to let me know....<br>

<br>
The gear that I obtained myself has been through quest / camps.  I have bought some of gear myself.  Don't get me wrong Mike has helped more for my gear then my donation towards it, although I have done a lot myself.  I have only received one item from a guild (from DoS) which is a bracer.  The epic was achieved with help of friends, no guild.  <br>
<br>
Secondly I don't bug no one for help, nor do I take advantage of my friends postition.<br>
<br>
I have achieved a level which I think I can contribute, and hang with friends.<br>
<br>
I have paid for everything, if I die I don't even ask Tri, I pay for rezes, I pay for buffs, it is all self sufficient here if it has to be.<br>

Played Guinn D'vyne, level 50 ish cleric at the time for Arch Nemesis/The Nephilim when needed.  &quot;also made logo for the The Nephilim&quot; and &quot;web site for <br>
Arch Nemesis&quot;<br>
<br>
Played a few lower level characters that I didn't level past 20.  <br>

Played other characters if needed to help guild events, mostly played Guinn.<br>

Did not play for year.<br>

Started playing again May of 2002 on Impackt.<br>

<br>
You're completely missing the point. (Either that or you simply disagree with it, yet argue about something completely different. I guess some people just aren't very good at arguing and just let their ego off its leash to do the work for them).<br>
<br>
***As I said previously, I was wrong about Impackt.*** But I'm going to use him as an example anyways cause he's a RL friend of Kringe. Once upon a time...<br>
<br>
Impackt has a level 55ish wizard. He is fully intent on leveling up to 60 and joining AD, because his rl friend is one of the most integral members (*That's no problem at all*). However, he's got kind of lousy gear (in Impackt's case, naked pk wizard), so he decides to join a smaller guild to gear himself up prior to joining AD, so AD doesn't have to do the work to gear him up with the &quot;basics&quot; (from AD's view; remember from the smaller guild's view it may be hardcore shit).<br>

Now, this is where our opinions differ, apparently. In my opinion, joining another guild *simply to gear up* prior to joining AD is a majorly assholish thing to do. Members of that &quot;lesser&quot; guild put forth time and energy to gear him; it doesn't matter if the gear sucks from AD's point of view, those people used their time to gear him up because they trusted him. And AD is fully capable of getting meager things like epics and ToV gear; considering they're going to be your &quot;permanent&quot; home, why not make them do the work? You either disagree with me, thinking this is okay... or you simply missed the point.<br>
<br>
If Impackt was NOT a friend of Kringe, joined a small guild because he seriously wanted to be a longtime member of them, and just happened to get bored of the same old stuff, so he applied to AD, that's completely different. That still sucks for the smaller guild, but at least he would have a much better reason for joining them (and leaving) in the first place.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'd like to take a second to apologize to AD/Wudan/MiM for my statements in the Narlyn(?) thread. When I get flamed, I don't hesitate to flame back... I think I crossed the line with my defamation of entire guilds, though. <p>-Morb<br>

Was Impackt just leeching off your &quot;lesser&quot; guild to just gear up or was he a fellow guildmate that everyone liked, gotten to know considered a friend. If that's the case then you shouldn't have any problems when they want to see more to this game then EQ...<br>
<br>
Now if Impackt was just going for the ride, being a lewt whore and coming to raid/guild functions just to get items when it was a convenience, and not a betterment for your guild, then you or whoever as a leader should've booted him from the guild in first place.<br>
<br>
So either way, half of it is the guild fault for not being too selective and the other is the player that leave. Lots of lesser guild lack coordination, manpower, hardcore players to do lots of the endgame. Hard to have 100guild mates, when 30 of them are online for 2hours stretches. I'm don't know Impackt at all, but if he was someone that gave you more manpower to kill dragons to help other members of the guild get items, levels, experience, then he paided his dues, and can do whatever he wants to.<br>
<br>
This applies to whoever leaves guilds for other guilds.<br>

One main reason why I was in a guild, 1. because unguilded wizards on rallos zek are KOS'ed.  Maybe it is hard for you comprehend that one can receive gear other ways then from a guild.  It happens.  No smaller guilded geared me.  My gear is not outstanding, I don't not want to attend AD events just for gear, and this is one reason it has took months for me to ask to be a guest, because of the influx of recruits that are here for that reason.  I wish to hang with AD because I want to attend events with my RL friends  and AD as a guild for the purpose of ejoying this game while it is here.<br>
<br>
Impackt's guild list since May.<br>
<br>
Maloudi Clan for about a month,<br>
Danasty of Shadows for 2 months and forces of the Grimm since then. <br>
<br>
Forces of the Grimm does no events at all.  It is a guild which consist of  some old school players on this server. <br>
<br>
Ask any of these guilds which items they gave this character.  I was not in tier guilds for loot.  I was in for enjoyment of this game.  Don't get me wrong gear makes this game more fun, although to me it is not the most important thing.  If it was, this character would be geared to the max because of my friends. <br>

I only posted on the board so I could hang with Mike and Kerry and other friends in the game.  The people that were consider (influx of recruits getting gear and only for that purpose) I have seen first hand.  I have seen some people join your guild and quit to become pks or just quit and personally I was offended by it because of the effort that I have witnessed first hand (that Mike and Kerry and the rest of your guild gave them.) Because of that I waited to post to ask as a guest because it kind of ruined the excitement of the recruitment process.  Also I would help some recruits camp shards only to have them log out of my grp after they looted their shard.  Things that I speak of, I speak the truth.  At the time that I first asked Mike if I could join him and attend as a guest, I met all the requirements of your guild.  I waited 1.5 months before I ever asked to be guest.  I did not imply that all recruits are here for the loot; I was stating that cause truly there is some.  I respect AD cause I see the effort that all of you put in.  Whether some see it as a game or their hobby, effort is effort.    <br>

My opinion was in regards toward Morb and his chip on his shoulders why lesser guild lose members to bigger guild, via AD, Wudan, or MIM.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, i'm not calling anyone being recruits for the lewt or join guilds just for that. I'm just stating the obvious, people join guilds to chat/companion, someone to hang out, level and experience with. If everyone benefited from that particular guild member while he was a member, then everyone gain something, even if he/she decides to leave later..<br>
