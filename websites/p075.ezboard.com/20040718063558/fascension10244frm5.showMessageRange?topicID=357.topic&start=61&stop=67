My first time I applied to get into AD, I had a shitload of people that wanted absolutely zero to do with me.  I was the brother of an ADer and the best buddy irl of another ADer.  When I talked shit on the DoZ private board (and it got publicly exposed), I pissed a lot of people in AD off because they felt I betrayed many of them.  Also, I talked way too much shit on message boards (which I now mainly do only on LV public).  People like Tohde, Adell, Lonoorn, Tiig, Faamarki, etc.  explained this to me when I got turned down the first time.  They took a poll on my application and I lost.  I was very upset but I knew I, in all reality, had nobody to blame for this but myself.  I created the opportunity for people to have certain perceptions of me and sometimes that's all it takes to bring an applicant down.  <br>
<br>
For me, I took the hint.  I stayed guildless, went and worked on my aa's (pre-pop they were a bitch lol), worked on a few quests to improve my character, stayed off the message boards almost completely, and most important, stayed in touch with ADers and got good advice on improving in the future.  My advice to you if you really want to be in AD with all your gnome heart, is to do the same.  Keep working on your aa's, do quests with your friends, and stay in touch with the AD warriors to improve your progress.  The other day you posted a poem on the MiM message board and said something like the people over at AD won't let me do this (sounded negative toward AD), you can't do that if you want to be a part of them.  It sounds very resentful and who would want that in a guildmate.  Anyway, that's my advice - take it or leave it. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/kyle.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I believe I can perfectly judge other people's capabilities in this game, of any class. I find your post close to insulting.<br>
<br>
These are my personal views on the matter:<br>
<br>
I know, Somthor is behind gearwise. Personally, I voted FOR Somthor to continue as a recruit and Id have welcomed him in AD. Not only do I think we need a few more warriors, I also liked Somthor's attendance and his enthousiasm. He would get geared up eventually anyway.<br>
<br>
Though, and this is what I think is the main issue (not just his gear): some people either dislike him or lack faith in him, for whatever reason, valid or not. And that is what got him denied and not just cause he could not tank ubermob_01.<br>
<br>
Of course he should not expect to tank MM, nor RZ for now. And maybe Lyenae was a bad example in your eyes due to the fact she was already decently geared when she joined AD. Let me tell you that there were people who were sceptical about Lye and that she wasnt tanking the ubermobs right from the start. But the level of dedication she showed was unequaled by any recruit Ive ever seen. She has become someone this whole guild really relies on and she now is well respected. This is why I used her as an example for a warrior, not just cause she can tank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=razzinel>Razzinel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/03 4:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somthor</span><hr size=1> Endymia,<br>

no reason for you to be insulted.  I understood from your post to Somthor you were partially reroaching him for not tanking more.  Wanted to point out to you that this specific thing he is not guilty of. In fact it is likely he would have been scolded and told of if he got aggro as a tank with AD wars present.<br>
<br>
Somthor from day one (when I first met him) was trying to tank mobs on his first guest raids in POS (mini bosses etc.)  I remember thinking to myself he might get in trouble for taunting mobs when there are AD warriors present.  That 15 mins was enough for me to understand the little gnome is not the type of warrior who fears tanking, but the type of warrior who seeks it out.<br>

after talking to a few people i have somthings i will work on, while i continue to grind out the AA's<br>
<br>
the quests tetzou mentioned are things i had determined best to wait until after more important matters were taken care of.<br>
<br>
I cant tell you how disappointed i am just now espicaly about the bertox flag which would have gotten me into the elemental planes.<br>
<br>
Im not aware of any side quest that bypasses the bertox flag, if anyone knows of such  quest plse let me know where i can look into it.<br>

It never has been an issue. infact, gear is so much not an issue, that when certain people even transfered servers, they were given this basic gear for free, hate armor was given for free during those midnight raids. that is all that is necessary for recruitment. and even if a certain warrior recruits gear was above average, they wouldn't be the initial main tank for atleast several months. infact, im still pretty sure, our initial main tank from day 1 of AD is still our initial main tank TODAY, that is if he shows up.<br>
<br>
It's all about attitude , cooperation, and dedication.<br>
<br>
I'll break it down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Attitude&quot; - getting along with the rest of AD, and not causing problems because of inability to respect others outside the guild. not being arrogant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cooperation&quot; - willingness to work together to achieve a common goal. Common goal #1,234,095 = slay monster #1,234,095, this goal was probably the same as common goal #1, which was to slay monster #1(I dont just mean boss mobs, I mean every single monster along the way, because without cooperation, you wont be killing a single mob if your clerics are not in touch with your warriors.) The more cooperation there is, the faster these mobs will die, and you won't have to sit thru corpse recovery #1,059, buying small coffin #624. And listen to your raid leaders, whoever is in charge at the time. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dedication&quot; - the amount of energy and time you sacrifice for the sake of yourself and your guild. Because we all know by improving yourself, you are improving the guild in a small way. Everyone benefits from everyone elses achievements within a guild. Dedication is also seen from helping others. Not just yourself. By helping others who are having a more difficult time, or who just need a cleric or a tank or an enchanter or whatever they need, will help the guild too. When I say that improving yourself improves the guild, that goes for everyone.<br>
<br>
Combining these three things will create the key that opens the door to AD.(ok, so I've played too much EQ)<br>
<br>
Now, get out your pen and check off what you what you think you have achieved. Whatever is left unchecked is up to you to solve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aybolit>Aybolit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(2/1/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somthor</span><hr size=1> That's a shame.
