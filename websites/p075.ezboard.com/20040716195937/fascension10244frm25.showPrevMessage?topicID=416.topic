<br>
First off, I'm very sorry to everyone that I lied to and to those that defended me and those that I let down by getting my guild destroyed.  For that reason and those people are the only reason I am sorry.  The only reason I shouldnt of done what I did was because of those ppl I hurt.  I appologize to them deeply and know that no amount of time will ever get back thier respect that I might of once had, that I have to live with.<br>
<br>
Now onto the other issues at hand.  I alone and only I had anything to do with CoH'n down the cursed to ST to kill the 1st warder (last one standign at the time) to awake the sleeper and thus prevent AD/Wudan/MiM the chance to kill the sleeper.  I dont expect anyone to understand my reasons or why I acted with such disreguard for self and friends.  Some say I am crazy, Some say I take the game all to seriously, for whatever reason, I was hell bent on stopping it for a few reasons.  Lohengrin said it was his server and his right to wake the sleeper and when I said, well hell, bamboo is going to wake the sleeper tomorrow, he flat out said no and I'll kos you.  Your reasons were to prevent the cursed of waking the sleeper, for they would surely of gotten there in 2 weeks.  Your other reason was 75$ full gear server transfers and that bluebies would be farming ST.  If those were true, then it didnt matter who woke the sleeper, for the purpose would of been served, but I still strongly believe those were bs reasons used to make it ok for you to wake the sleeper.  Just cause you are AD, why is what ever you want to do the correct thing, and what anyone else wants to do the wrong thing.  All it means is that AD has the force and the members to bully anyone they want on the server.  ONly to a minor extent do you work with wudan and mim cause it keeps the peace and the general bluebieish feeling on RZ, a pvp server.  The only reason what I did was wrong, and thus kos'd for it, was cause it defied your tyranical rule of the server and for the first time in ages, someone actually did something against you on a grand scale.  I put everything on the line and failed miserably, again, something I have to live with.  I have learned though the past years, that just cause it's something you dont agree with doesnt make it wrong, I should of remembered that b4 i did what i did.  Sure AD/mim/wudan had the right to wake the sleeper, but didnt everyone else on the server as well?  We all pay our 15$ a month to play the same game.  <br>
<br>
I am in no way saying I did the right thing, or a good thing, but it was well within my right to do so and thusly paying the consequence severely.  I ruined my name, i hurt my friends, i let alot of ppl down... was it worth it you may ask?  hell no, if given the same chance to do it again would i? prolly not.  But being who I am, and with the well known history of over reacting and acting unrationally, i did it.  Did i think i could get away with it? Yes i thought i could, and thats prolly another reason i attempted what i did.  If I had any balls at the time, i would of just helped out personally, but i didnt, i tried to be sneaky and I got owned.. nuff said.<br>
<br>
So now I am Perma Kos to wudan and AD, and those are the only people i will pvp on the server.  I am not going random PK, i dont find enjoyment in that.  But i do find it worthwhile to battle those that wish me to be dead.  Yes I've been seen engaging AD/Wudan side by side with the cursed, the very ppl that sold me out.  But do you have any other suggestions of who i should fight with?  Do you expect me to sit in PoTranquility and cry all day?  No I paid my 15$ and I am gonna play the game.  Am I going to get owned? Yes  Am I going to give up eventually? prolly  Am I going to go random PK? No Am I goig to legends? That i dont know yet, i doubt there is anything for me there, so why fork out the extra bucks to do nothing.  If other guilds want to KoS me for hanging out with the curse, I guess i'll have to live with that, but I wont engage anyone other than AD or Wudan, and being a monk, there is no possible way i can buff or aid the cursed in any other way.  If i'm in the same zone as them and they attack old Bamboo members, I'm gonna beat up on the curse.  I have no love for the curse, they have no love for me, but it seems when the target is wudan/ad, both can benefit from each others help.  <br>
<br>
So in closing, My only regret is the ppl i hurt and let down, and to change that, I would do anything, but it's far past damage control and I have to live with what i did.  I know there will be alot of flames and lots of teasing and pointing fingers at my expense, it's expected, but wont be returned.  It's not personal, Y'all Kos'd me and therefore expect to be engaged in return. <br>
<br>
And oh yeah, I hope you get cancer IRL Stynkfyst!  I know someone was gonna say that, just wanted to say it first.  See you in the game, or not.  Up to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyrosprial007>Pyrosprial007</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://fohguild.org/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=145044" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Bojangles</span><br>  Posts: 1491<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/03 4:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What the fuck is that Private Pyle?</span><hr size=1> Somebody check this ip against the other handle.<br>

i've never really known you too well, stynkfyst, but what you did was pretty fucked up. i feel bad for somthor because you decieved him, even though he is a real life friend of yours, and he continued to defend you because of this. it's also pretty blatant, as pyro was saying, that you were not conscidering what was best for your guild when you did this. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=357409">Mohjohjohjoh Bunny`Slayer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
There were even some of your own guild there for portions of it. Although we did ask Boucicea or whatever to leave due to her rants about it on our message board. We even allowed Inpaller (who was recently kos to us due to mistakenly buffing and helping pk's) to hang around down there and fight with us for a time. <br>
<br>
Honestly we would have been happy to have everyone from anti pk guilds that were  in good standing there if it werent for the lag that made it almost impossible to move if the zone count went over a certain number.  We all had to ask our recruits and even some members to log out for a while.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that you couldnt live with all of us cooperating together with you excluded. You decided to ruin the event.   <br>
<br>
Honestly I cant help but think that it was your ego that caused this, not anything lohengrin said or AD's actions in the past.<br>
<br>
AD has always shared content with other guilds and accepted rotations. We could have woken the sleeper well over 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
So when someone screws up bad in your case what is the best thing to do, well if you were in the right, fight back.  But you arent. Your cruising around with the curse and even jumping people that hadnt attacked you yet is not something I find able to justify in anyway. <br>

It's no ones fault but my own, and of course, after being exposed I fess up to it.  Cowardly? Yes.  I did what I did and there is no changing that.  I'm perma kos to ad and wudan.  Did some of these ppl do anything to me? No.  But they are apart of the people that have chosen to kos me.  Just as you have chosen to make my former guildies change thier guild name.  You punish those that had nothign to do with it.  I'm gonna pvp.  I'm not fighting for honor or cause i think i was right, right and wrong are no longer the subject, judgement has been passed, and by the majority, I am the wrong.  It is still RZ and PvP is a part of that.  You have chosen me as one of your targets.   It is not even personal to me, just pixels fighting pixels, part of the game, you cant deny it.  Some may find it annoying, others might find it thrilling.  Either way it is the game and the server you chose.  We all have to live with our choices.  And I for one have alot bad ones to pay for.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its not an appology Xblade, I am only sorry cause I got caught.  Give it time Xblade, I'll fade away.  Funny thing though, the 2 ppl that think I am the biggest piece of shit are the 2 ppl that actually did farm ST and did sell stuff.  Pyro and Xblade.  <br>
<br>
I run due to overwhelming odds and class unbalancing.  I'm sorry I dont stand still so that 30 ppl can gang bang me and get a Screenshot.  There is a time to fight, and a time to run to fight another day.  <br>

No your right there isnt. I would personally make sure your rep and past history followed you there. Then again there are a few piece of shit lowlife guilds on SH you would probably meld well with.

I am happy you found a group of people with your maturity level and playstyle that you could hang out with in the curse. I am guessing it won't be long before they get tired of your bullshit and start killing you instead of running with you.<br>

p.s. We didn't CHOOSE to KOS you, you forced us to. Stop trying to play the victim.<br>

Do you really think calling me names is going to change something somehow?  If it makes you feel better, enjoy.  Hope you get it out of your system and move on with the game.  The undenyable thing is this, this is RZ, It is a pvp server and without out pk's, it's just like any other server.  Bluebieish? when 99% of the ppl in your pvp range are PVE oriented only, it's pretty bluebieish.  When 100% of your armor is no drop, it's pretty bluebieish.  Dont be mad at me cause yer on a PVP server and only a max of 30 ppl actually pvp in yer range.  <br>

Thats a good quote Charlie, coming from the guy who used to hide his tag during guild wars and &quot;refused to risk wearing droppable resist gear on pvp&quot;. You became a self proclaimed badass AFTER you became full no drop.<br>
