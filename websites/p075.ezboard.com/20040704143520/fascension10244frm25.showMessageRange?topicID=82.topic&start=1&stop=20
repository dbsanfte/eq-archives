<br>
1) Use proper punction<br>
2) Speak using proper English grammar<br>
3) Use paragraphs<br>
4) Form a coherent, and dare I say - intelligent - idea which doesn't consist of a mess of mispelled internet slang and broken english?<br>
<br>
You're here because you screwed up.  If you really expect us to respond intelligently, you'd be better take the time and the effort to communicate like anyone without some sort of learning disability would be able to.  I mean really, are you too lazy to move your pinky finger over to the single quote key?  Yes, contractions are denoted with a single quote, not a semicolon.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ho bag&quot;?  &quot;Skank ho pk&quot;?  &quot;pkzors&quot;?  What a mature description of this individual you buffed.  And you have two children??<br>
<br>
I think you should remain KOS.  When you have your high school diploma, feel free to post again so that we can reconsider your request without having to decipher the mess you create when you sit in front of a keyboard.<br>
<br>

P.S.:  If you truly do have some sort of disability which prevents you from properly communicating, then I apologize and will retract my statements.  However, given the track record, I doubt this is the case. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=praxxrz>PraxxRZ</A> at: 11/9/02 5:25:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=windress>Windress</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/9/02 7:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HI am KoS , here to clear it up</span><hr size=1> Wow... the point was he wasn't paying attention. You got the point. Was it really necessary to pick apart the post? He said it was already late when it happened, and by the time he got here it was REALLY late. Some people don't fuction well on very little sleep. Some people also don't type up long, grammatically-perfect posts. As long as the point is understood, the rest is really not important.<br>
Lighten up~ although some would argue, this IS only a game. He made a mistake and came here to let you guys know that. He didn't ask to have his post proofread for errors. Get past the petty crap and move on over to the point, about 10 miles THAT way, where you should've been by now.<br>

And yeah I'm the RL and in-game wife, I just had to see for myself that he was actually asked to POST here to beg forgiveness, like he had committed a sin. But I guess being KOS to AD would be somewhat comparable to going to Hell...<br>

It not only demonstrates ignorance, but it also shows disrespect.  This is ironic considering that ultimately, it is respect that is being asked for in the first place.<br>
<br>
For the record, his error seems quite forgivable, but if you really have the audacity to come here and explain yourself in the most half-assed, dimwitted method possible, then don't expect any sympathy.  I myself don't understand it, and I see this sort of behavior more often than I'd like.<br>
<br>
I doubt anyone asked him to post here to &quot;beg forgiveness.&quot;  Honestly, we probably hold ass-kissers in the same regard as the illiterate who post here.  I promise you, a well-written post will do wonders to solve your problems with the added bonus that nobody is going to flame you for your lack of intelligence.  This method of problem solving seems to be the exception instead of the norm.<br>
<br>
Trust me, I'm doing you both a favor here.  I'll be honest with you; most of the people we end up KOS'ing from conversations on this board result from the lack of deceny in communication. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jyleel>Jyleel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(11/9/02 10:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Country Grammar</span><hr size=1> Wow I love it when people make fun of my grammar. I am for the most part illiterate and lack the knowledge of grammar to form the paragraphs and proper thoughts and what not. I am sorry you were so offended by my ignorance, but hey this is the result of being a high school drop out who did not put any real effort into a formal education. I will however use the spell check button at the very least. But on the bright side I did get my GED and will be taking remedial courses at the local community college so maybe this time in 2 years I will actually sound intelligent when I write stuff. And as far as why I posted here. it was suggested that I do it by Winasben. Thank you for really not caring about what I did and thank you for making me feel like crap for being ignorant people like you who treat me like a sub human for my lack of education are the reason I am so hyped about getting one. I truly hope that once I have it I can see what is so good about it that I will be able to trash others for their lack of. and again I am sorry I did not use proper punction I always thought it was puncuation any way silly uneducated me.<br>
