<br>
I think the point was: should there be a war on Iraq to disarm Saddam? Personally, I am a supporter because I simply don't see how any kind of security is possible when a regime exists that keeps it's people in the dark ages but makes every effort possible to develop long range WMD. I don't beleive in Taranna's theory about Iraq regime out-evolving itself in time. And please no more comparisong to USSR, you don't know anything about us.  As far as evolution goes, Iraq is good 3-4 hundred years behind where USSR was even during Stalin. As far as I remember Russia had no problems developing it's own weaponry of any kind.<br>
<br>
The other point(which I think is the real reason for lack of international support for this compaign) is weakness and incompetence of current US administration. To be honest I'd rather see Bush and his entire fucking crew back in Texas where they belong and where they can actually do some good. International community is simply disgusted with him, his crew can't negotiate shit, his homeland security thingie stinks of McCarthyism. There is too much shadiness; Bush's connections to oil companies, his ambition to finish what his father started, the whole thing might be an attempt to raise popularity back at home because otherwise he'd be kicked out of the office for incompetence by now. A country like US deserves to be lead by extrodinary men only, in times like this especially. Bush is like... an accidental president. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kron@ascension10244>Kron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/03 11:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PNAC</span><hr size=1> Some goals of the current US administration are just very disturbing.

<br>
What really bothers me though, are the lengths we seem to be willing to go to establish some false sense of security. From airports, to violating the civil rights of our own citizens, to invading foreign nations...<br>

Who was it who said that &quot;those who sacrifice freedom for security shall be niether free nor safe?&quot;<br>

<br>
But then again i must say i totally agree with Xorthar on the fact american civilian casualities during WW2 were very low compared to other countries.<br>
<br>
So Kadandrum everybody who oposes american interests in the world and american &quot;hegemony&quot; is an &quot;american hater&quot;? i find that slightly disturbing who voted on america acting as the worlds &quot;police force&quot;(Personally i woudnt like to depend on the armed forces of a nation who have so little respect for culture; they even bombed Rome during WW2 something not even the Nazis did) there is something called international law and the principle of national soveranity.<br>
<br>
The current Bush administration is squandering america's moral legitimacy attacking the principles of the international system the allied powers set up after WW2 precisely to avoid another catastrophe as the war happening again.<br>

Posting upset is bad. Let me elaborate on some points. First off, I've noticed that many Americans take criticism to their government and/or country pretty seriously. If I'm criticizing the US, what I usually mean is it's foreign policy. Not people who live in there, nor do I imply that it somehow would be a bad place to live, on the contrary. Also, disagreeing is not necessarily hating. Like it or not, not everyone thinks the same as you do, and if you are secure in your beliefs, you shouldn't have problem with hearing the ones of others'.<br>
<br>
That being said, I don't think I ever expressed any anti-war sentiments Kadandrum. In my earlier post I questioned the motives of the war as presented by President Bush in his speech. Even though I wouldn't wish war even on Saddam, I'm cynical enough to accept that wars will happen. The point is, I think declaring them should be the job of the UN, not any single country. Saddam or Iraq itself is pretty insignificant, but when the most powerful nation in the world shows it doesn't care about international law, what kind of example will that be to other leaders of questionable reputation. You are half correct in that personally I oppose war because I don't like the US way of handling it. If it was approved by the UN, I wouldn't like it but neither would I have a problem with it. I still stand behind my points in my previous posts; US undermining UN is bad. Also, the US is wrong in refusing worldwide treaties for selfish gain. While I don't necessarily like US hegemony, it isn't a problem until it's abused. US is slowly edging on the abuse.<br>
<br>
Aybolit, my point was that the US has a military budget that is as big as the budgets of 14 runner-up countries combined. It runs a sizeable budget deficit yet it keeps increasing military spending, since wars aren't cheap. As you know, the Soviet Union crumbled since it's economy collapsed under military spending. Was just a sarcastic observation, if I was American I would be asking what's going on. I never implied Iraq would be the reason of this spending, actually I was wondering what is the US gearing up for.<br>
<br>
In closing, I don't like where US seems to be heading right now, but that doesn't mean I would personally 'hate' anyone. And since it certainly is your right to bash my poor little goverment in return, I'm Finnish. Finland is located in Scandinavia, Northern Europe. Member of EU, population 5 million =)<br>

<br>
The whole point behind my poll was merely to make people stop and think.<br>
<br>
I don’t think anyone has any clear cut answers here, I sure don’t, but I was curious about what you all thought.<br>
<br>
If the poll and following posts made you angry, challenged your view, or in any other way made you inform yourself about the situation in Iraq, and the world itself, then I consider my mission accomplished..<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally I have learned a great deal from this, for example I didn’t know the PNAC existed, thanks Kron. And, I didn’t know how some of you guys in the armed forces felt about this either. Taranna had a load of facts I found myself checking out as well hehe.<br>
<br>
The poll in itself didn’t tell us all that much, Altaris pointed out a great flaw in it early on, the fact that we don’t know how many euros voted. All the same, it did tell us that roughly 35% of this community either agree with Bush's policy, or trust his decision, and about the same number don’t.<br>
<br>
With that said, I share many of the sentiments that Xorthar has, and that’s not built on a hatred towards the US, but a general fear of the current foreign policy.<br>
<br>
Also, I don’t think we can dismiss the lessons history teaches us, or let it cloud our decision. <br>
<br>
The next few days will give us some answers, so maybe this thread will harden even more, or die out, I don’t know.<br>
<br>
Please be considerate when you post though, when you start bad mouthing someone the debate is already lost. <br>
<br>

neither was in its prime both had unseasoned troops that learned as they went along you also had vast distances and supply problems neither side had the actual materials to win.<br>
<br>
<br>
the iran/iraq war did waste alot of resourse and saddam who thought he was fighting for the arab world or some such after realizing no one cared and he was kinda in debt looked to where he could easily get some extra cash..  and we then had kuwait.<br>
<br>
one might sugest (possibly flawed) that if the arab world or even the us and the rest who supported iraq in the iran war and kept it going as long as it did had picked up the tab maybe we wouldnt be where we are now.<br>

As I had said a while ago as it had already been predict by more than just one prophet's. Time and again, As that last vote inside the USA was 'Rigged'. I remember when Gore and Bush running for President, I thought to myself 'Good lord!, Gore better win it otherwise it is a Rigged or an Upheaval is coming...'. Because Mr Clinton did indeed brought peace to our belove world for 8th year's all round, Avoiding big conflict with Iraq and calming middle east (Or at least trying to finalist peace), Which is good.<br>
<br>
Then came that argument about the voting system, It is true that as the Hopi did prophecy, A prophet called No-Eye's (a blind prophet used to live in rocky mesas in northern Arizona) speakin with Mary Summer Rain.- <br>
'Listen Summer' said No-Eye's, 'This be most important stuff here. States peoples first gonna make two or three laws for peoples. Peoples not gonna have a say (bout these laws) These laws be made in big building in state... There be seven or eight men in dark dresses.'<br>
Summer Rain- 'Could there be women in this group? Could there be as many as nine people in long dark black robe?' <br>
'Yup, Women too even, Summer is right. There be nine.'<br>
Summer Rain- 'No-Eye's, those people are called Supreme Court Justices, They pass laws that govern the entire country. And your saying that they'll be passing laws that aren't good for the peoples.'<br>
'That right.' replied No-Eye's. - Ummmm surely I wonder why did the Supreme court let Mr Bush and it 'Mobs Rules' win the vote by default...<br>
<br>
Nostradamus wrote: 'Nine set aside from the rest of humanity, Removed, having divided all by their judgement and counsel, Their fates will be determined on their departure,,, dead, banished and scattered.'<br>

I surely would'nt be looking at the US for safekeeping protection, Especially for those living in euro. They'll will retreat and turn into defence back home. When that happened and it will, Bin laden and all those Terrorist, Some country like (N,Korea,Iraq and such) would cry 'God is on our side'. Then there be bloody murder's as never seen before, Much worse than WW one and two put together's.<br>
<br>
But there will not be a Third world war, for God will not allow you to destroy this beutiful earth with your nuclear arms. You will be too busy sustaining yourselve's against the element to wage war. There will be much destruction of land before the turning of the axis. The forest fire had begun, the hurricane's have started with tornados, the earthquake, the volcanos and the winds will soon batter you to such a degree that you will not have the energy or will to wage world war... <br>
<br>
I myself do not like what our British Government are doing too, Following Mr Bush and Co like a puppet. As Edgar Cayce once said &quot;A mobs rules&quot;. But neither would I trust Saddam, for that he had to go!, his party and family too, With Bin laden and his idiot terrorists fiasco. If only I had a Magic wand... You'll know what I'll do with it!'.<br>

/snicker.  I admire Gandhi and Mandela for what they did, but <br>

If US leaders turn into Ganhdi or Mandela, we'll be fooked.

Interesting point here.  I've already said I don't support any of the statments Taranna just made.  But perhaps the environment a person grow up in does influence their outlook on life.  This question is still being asked by psychologists and <br>
socialistis.  It's the environment vs upbringing vs race card.  <br>
<br>
Typical example, does the kid who grows up in a broken family <br>
living on welfare surrounded by gangs and drugs in the projects of Baltimore or LA make it out alive?  Sometimes.  <br>
<br>
Take that example x20 and apply it to the Palestinians.  The kids grow up as refugees believing all their woes are caused by the Israelis who have the backing of America. Gangs of kids are indoctrinated into throwing rocks at Israeli tanks and policemen in the name of the intifada.  <br>
<br>
Their level of education, questionable.  Their belief in Islam...<br>
absolute.  They are growing up in a circle of violance and with no way out.  Some get recruited by Hamas or the PLO with the hopes of making a differance and striking back at their oppressors.  <br>
<br>
Gang Banger:  Get in my gang, sling rock, get paid, live high.  <br>
The big dawgs eventually branch out, get shot, get in prison, or make it out of the game.  <br>
<br>
Same principle to the Palestinian big dawgs, except they get to be terrorists or suicide bombers.  Just read the latest news to see how common suicide bombers are.<br>
<br>
Here is a very anti-israel website detailing the harsh conditions and improvishment faced by Palestinians that drive some people to become terrorists who fly planes into buildings.<br>

That link is way to long and boring.  I did a quick search and <br>
didn't see Bush's signature.  Scoll to the very bottom of that <br>
parchment and see the following subnote about your &quot;signatures&quot; aka project participants.<br>
<br>
&quot;The above list of individuals participated in at least one project meeting or contribued a paper for discussion.  The report is a product solely of the PNAC and does not necessarily represent the views of the project participants or their affiliated institutions.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do see PNAC being referred to by a lot of anti-bush conspiracy websites though.<br>
<br>
And finally:<br>
As Bush said in his speech last nite.  Everyone is in agreement that Saddaem needs to be disarmed.  The US feels that Saddem has been given years to disarm and the final ultimatiem was given last year in November.  Others like France feel that more time is needed.  This is the essential time game that Saddem is masterful at playing.  Given enough time, the world's focus on Saddem will diminish and he will kick the inspectors out of Iraq and do as he pleases.  International attention will shift in the future and you just can't EXPECT everyone to jump right back on Iraq's case.  I can just see what the international community will say about Saddem in the future when he kick's the inspectors out again.  &quot;Look at how long he hasn't caused trouble, let's forgive and forget his past.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The UN inspectors left Iraq in 1998 because of non-compliance on Saddem's part.  The US and England bombed Iraq.  After the bombing stopped, Saddem did not allow the return of UN inspectors until 11/2002.  <br>
<br>
Note:  Iraq's flagrant violation happened during the Clinton Administration.<br>
<br>
11/13/1997<br>
Iraq's decision to expel American weapons inspectors immediately &quot;is clearly unacceptable and a challenge to the international community,&quot; President Clinton said on Thursday.<br>
<br>
Iraq is &quot;not scared of the threats being made by the Americans,&quot; said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, speaking at the United Nations. <br>

That's right Xorthar, let's blame it all on Bush and nothing on clinton's outgoing administration or 9/11.  Economic 101, it takes about 6 months for economic policy changes to take hold and start feeling the effects.  It's doesn't all work instantly.  The economy was already sounding warning bells of a recession before Bush's Inaugration 1/20/2001.  The recession can be contribued more to the dot com bubble burst and policies of the Federal Reserve.  After 9/11/2001 Bush called for more spending on the military, $40 billion in aid for victims and fight against terrorism.  I'm sorry if you didn't approve of the additional spending in a time of crisis.  Perhaps you've never faced some hardship or loss that you would spend any amount of money on to fix.  The loss of life to terrorism can not be easily convered into tangible monetary amounts.  The loss of productivity, opportunity, the loss of loved ones, the loss of a future.<br>

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Kyoto Treaty:<br>
Although Bush called the Kyoto treaty &quot;fatally flawed&quot; in his June 11th remarks on climate change, he also cautioned that <br>
<br>
&quot;America’s unwillingness to embrace a flawed treaty should not be read by our friends and allies as any abdication of responsibility. To the contrary, my administration is committed to a leadership role on the issue of climate change.&quot;  That leadership role is based on the assumption that CO2 and other &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases are causing a global warming problem, the key assumption behind Kyoto. &quot;Our approach must be consistent with the long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,&quot; Bush said.<br>
<br>
The Kyoto treaty is &quot;fatally flawed,&quot; in Bush’s view, not because the underlying assumptions are wrong, but because (to cite one example) it does not apply to developing nations whose &quot;greenhouse&quot; gas emissions are expected to increase. &quot;This is a challenge that requires a 100 percent effort; ours, and the rest of the world’s. The world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol,&quot; Bush said.<br>
<br>
The Clinton administration endorsed Kyoto, but did not submit it to the Senate where it would have faced certain defeat. Bush’s reputation as a Kyoto opponent may enable him to accomplish more work on the treaty’s underlying assumptions than Clinton ever could.<br>

The United States under Bush has decided to effectively remove its signature from the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court. <br>
<br>
While signing the treaty some two years ago, President Bill Clinton did not seek Senate ratification of the agreement.<br>
<br>
Critics of the treaty - especially in the Pentagon - feared that the court might be used by opponents of the United States to pursue politically-motivated cases. <br>
<br>
It's very obvious Clinton did a lot of showy public relations shoonzing, treaty signing this or treaty signing that.  But the fact that these treaties were not ratified by the Senate is non-bindable to America.  Perhaps you would perfer fluff over substance, I don't.<br>

Although an overwhelming majority of the 189 member states have either signed or ratified the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, the United States, Russia, Israel, China, Pakistan, and India remain among several notable holdouts. <br>
<br>
In 1997, when much of the world endorsed the anti-mine treaty, the US balked.<br>
<br>
The Clinton Administration acknowledged that many mines remained deadly for decades, but it said they were a necessary part of US strategy on the Korean peninsula, where mines are sown along the border that separates the communist North from the democratic South.<br>
<br>
Mr Clinton, while refusing to join the treaty, signed an executive order in 1998 promising to obey the ban everywhere but on the Korean peninsula by 2003, and in all countries by 2006.<br>
<br>
/golf clap for clinton<br>
If superhero Clinton was so effective as a leader, he would of passed this treaty during his remaining time in in office rather than passing it on to Bush.  But even Clinton noted there were some items that needed to be worked out.  Items that Bush will carefully consider before signing his name.  It's about substance over fluff. Bush will work with the Department of Defense on this. <br>

Bush argued that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, a bedrock of U.S.-Russian nuclear stability for three decades, had outlived its usefulness. <br>
<br>
Many Europeans fear a costly arms race. The ABM treaty bans a missile defence system which the US is adament about pursuing.<br>

now you cant in most cases make a fuission bomb with those but what you can do is grind them into a fine poweder and load it into a convential warhead with convential explosives and detonate it and have a wide spead long lasting contamination of a area<br>
<br>
<br>
you can also put it into a water supply or ruin crops etc etc<br>
<br>
its not maybe a WMD in its most direct sence but say you took a pound of this powder and spred it over a major city the secondary heath problems caused would be nasty <p>vita non est vivere sed valere vita est<br>
