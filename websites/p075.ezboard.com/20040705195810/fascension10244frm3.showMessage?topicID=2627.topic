Here is what happened:<br>
<br>
We were fighting MiM in a long battle that went for about 3 or 4 hours across Oasis of Marr, North Ro, East Commonlands and West Freeport. At the final chapter we were corpsecamping several MiM members at WFreeport book (war reality is harsh, they cc us, we cc them) and several of them were zerging naked trying to get their corpses basically piling up naked corpses at WFreeport book. At some point Khorus zoned in naked and Paiinn of DoZ accidentally attacked him.<br>
<br>
The attack was in no way intentional and Paiinn and rest of DoZ want to offer their most sincere apologies about the incident. The sheer volume of naked people zoning and the rush of the battle were reason for that mistake and I offer Khorus our deepest apologies about incident.<br>
<br>
I assure you this wont happen again and would like to close the issue before it gets blown out of proportion. We apologized personally to Khorus when this occured and I am posting on behalf of DoZ with a public apologee to AD.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours Sadko. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=renix@ascension10244>Renix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Penix</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#333333>(4/4/04 4:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2627.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sensesfail.com/sensesfail_puffy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Public Apologee to AD.</span><hr size=1> time for war <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khorusrz>KhorusRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#333333>(4/4/04 3:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2627.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Public Apologee to AD.</span><hr size=1> I have a few questions and concerns regarding that night so i will start from the begining.<br>
<br>
about an hour prior to this incident, Semmy, Lonoorn, Myself, and 3 other non ad people where doing some EC advs.  We completed an adv and returned to EC to get a new one, there where about 10 DoZ in the zone, and a few mim, we went to get our adv, and DoZ attacked and killed Xlan, an unguilded member of our group.<br>
<br>
Now Xlan has no affilition with any guild that DoZ is at war with atm.  When asked why he was attacked we got the old, &quot;It was in the heat of Battle&quot; excuse.  But that isnt what bothered me, It was that DoZ appologized to the AD members of our group for killing Xlan, yet refused to appologize to Xlan because you, &quot;Dont know who he is.&quot;  So that is your attitude towards people who arent in guilds that would pose a threat to you?<br>
<br>
Back to the incident involving me.<br>
<br>
We died on a boss and were on a cr. I zoned into freeport from pok, to find about 6 DoZ sitting at book. I stood there for a good 10 seconds, was even hailed by one of your members, (Bllahck? or something like that) then nuked once for 1200, Then attacked by Paiinn.<br>
<br>
Now im not saying you would be stupid enough to attack a tagged member of AD, but i do question how lvl 65 toons who i hope have been playing on RZ for longer than 2 days, dont know how to /guildstatus before attacking.<br>
<br>
So your either complete idiots, or you pvp with PC names and guildtag filter turned off.<br>
<br>
And one quick edit.  MiM corpses where not piling up at the freeport book, there was one naked corpse there, about 15 feet from the book.<br>
<br>
Thats about all i have to say on this atm<br>
<br>

<br>
At that point we had corpses of following MiM: Zubotai, Foxbox, Kivasx, Kinthaf, Veninia and may be someone else. We looted naked corpses so they wouldnt pile near book. Blahck isnt member of DoZ, Blahck is a member of FL and is at war with us.<br>
<br>
Back to Xlan: I think hes a friend of someone in DoZ or a friend of a friend. I am not sure, when I asked in gc. whos xlan I was told that it wasnt an issue. If you wish I can investigate further and get to bottom of it, but xlan himself never said a thing about it. I'll try to find him in game and ask him to post a reply on this thread and hear his side of the story. At any rate this is in NO way a pattern of behavior in DoZ, we do NOT attack unguilded people for no reason. It was just 2 unfortunate incidents on same day.<br>
<br>
As for Paiinn's attacking. He made a stupid mistake. He is sorry. It wont happen again. I made sure to tell him in many words how to make a /guildstat hotkey, how to make sure to turn guild names up and how to make sure he is NOT attacking someone he shouldnt have.<br>
<br>
Once again, Khorus, sorry dude.<br>

I think being killed by Doz pretty much gives him the right to ask any questions k, esp since it doesn't seem like he liked the answers that were given to him. <p>Fayllia<br>

<br>
First off, Xlan is not a friend of mine, If DoZ wishes to not appologize to Xlan for killing Xlan fine, Dont fucking appologize to AD though.<br>
<br>
Second off, Xlan being killed has everything to do with what happened that night. 2 people who have nothing to do with any war DoZ is waging where killed within an hour by DoZ.<br>
<br>
I could serious give 2 shits if any Tom Dick and Joe unguilded toon attacked DoZ, it doesnt give them a ffa to kill all unguilded toon.<br>
<br>
And where am i using my AD tag to get anything? good to see you know me Sird. If it is an issue between Xlan and Sadko then fine let them deal with it, Just like it is an issue with myself and DoZ and i am sure they dont need your wisdom to help deal with it Sirdario.<br>

I tend to try and resolve things in game as much as possible, but I feel in this case a public appology is nescesarry. What happened to Xlan is resolved, as far as I know. An appology was stated to him, and hopefully he will accept it. I came here to ask Khorus if he will accept our appology, though we do not deserve one. Your post is duly noted Styf, and there is a definate track history associated with DoZ of being difficult, rash, and of the sort to shoot first, ask questions later. This is one of those situations where this obviously occured, and has caused us a great deal of grief which we wished to avoid. I heard rumors that it was believed that this was being joked about by Sadko on mirc, and I wish to convey that this is anything but the case. We are all greatly concerned over this issue, and find nothing humorous in the least about this situation. <br>
