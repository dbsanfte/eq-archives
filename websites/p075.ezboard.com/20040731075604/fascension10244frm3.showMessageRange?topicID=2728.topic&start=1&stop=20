Let me start out by saying that berzerkers are by far the most overpowered class in PVP cause of their leg slice ability.   This will snare you for a long time with almost 0 chance to resist (dodge) the attack.<br>
<br>
Beyond the berserkers I am quite pleased.  I am very happy with the balance.<br>
<br>
Rogues:  Raw fucking carnage. With kyv strike, and decreased AC on targets they are doing plenty of damage. MY only gripe is that rogue poison needs to proc more and or be a guaranteed proc after first application.<br>
<br>
Monks: see rogues above, very well done, espescially wicked with the 100 blows.<br>
<br>
Warriors: sick sick 2 h damage, tons of hp, tough to tank down, very well done.<br>
<br>
Bards: Still not 100% sure what I think of them, you cant pvp effectivly without them. They are an absolut necessity for any group. Kind of annoyed that they are needed now in order to compete.  Not doing much damage but massive massive asset to any group.<br>
<br>
Pally:  Very nice!  heals are owning, roots also seem to work. Decent 2 h damage also,  very well done!<br>
<br>
SK: HT is now more reasonable, still pvp monsters. Although I would tune down HT a little bit more it still seems they are the power. Darkness, lifetaps etc... pure ownage<br>
<br>
Ranger: didnt have a chance to really see them in actiion: no opinion<br>
<br>
Chanter: i dont see much change with them, only seems to have better luck landing spells on you.<br>
<br>
Wizard: see chanter<br>
<br>
Mage: see chanter. also, COH is a wicked nice PVP tool now that groupmates can get snared much easier,  call hero is big time usefull to bail groupmates out of some heavy shit!<br>
<br>
necros: Very wicked again, granted low AC makes them vulnerable, but you better bring a army cause they gonna be next to impossible to hurt solo.<br>
<br>
Shamans:  They are fucking RAW:  incredible, IMO they are definantly in top 5 pvp classes, sick heals, nasty dots, etc...<br>
<br>
beastlords: no opinion, havent seen in action.<br>
<br>
Druids:  no real change noticed, but better chance to stick snares.<br>
<br>
clerics:  Should just paint a bullseye on them.  decreased AC weakened them a ton, but frankly i think they are now where they should be incredible healers, decent toughness but not unkillable.<br>
<br>
thoughts?<br>
<br>
I personally found the pvp quite fun! the competition is good! there is alot of action and its nonstop fun, we were up till 5 am last night (some longer) fighting nonstop! incredible fun!<br>
<br>
btw:  RZ is outnumbered like 10:1 by SZ! so /beta you fagors and talk to hobart about getting your characters X-fered to test PVP!<br>

<br>
Only had a little time to play so far.. but this is what I posted on the SOE board...<br>
<br>
I tried the server last night and a little this morning, and things may have changed already - but thought I'd drop some first impressions/feedback.<br>
<br>
1. The server is a gankfest right now. No surprise, and it's a lot of fun - for a short while. But it could get boring soon. But - more importantly - we will have to become a bit more controlled if we want to actually test stuff. I can give a few experiences (and do, below) but I can only guess at this stage what resists my opponents had, for example. If they resisted all my spells , maybe they should and maybe they shouldn't. The point is, I don't know. With data, however, more can be analysed. I'd like to see some structure to the testing, some objectives.. and I'd like to see us (the players) organise to help the devs achieve these objectives before this is over. Let's have some fun at the same time, of course.. but leave some room for the work - because it would be a shame to waste the opportunity.<br>
<br>
2. Making the server permanent (and making it so you can copy a character for a single session) would be great! It could be a permanent warzone for those that want a Quakefest for a while without messing up the &quot;real world&quot; (sic) of their own server <br>
<br>
3. Some things are testable, some aren't. I am hoping we can test balance issues and resists for example. However, the points system (and the rewards) are only testable insofar as it's possible to test the mechanics. How it would affect a real server cannot be judged in this environment. I think each server should get to vote on whether they want it or not once the experiment is over.<br>
<br>
4. Beyond pure balance issues, it will be hard to see from this server what effect it will have on our home servers, as each has its own politics and flavour.<br>
<br>
5. To get a full picture the server needs some lower levels .. all of us seemed to be 65.<br>
<br>
Now, some observations (in no particular order):<br>
<br>
a) Rez effects are dispellable right now, and don't last long enough. Melee should be incapacitated for at least as long as the mana dependent. There needs to be some risk to death.<br>
<br>
b) Resists on individual spells need a lot of work. I saw festering darkness land a lot compared to snare, for example. Leg Slice was landing all the time. Is the level of the spell taken into account, or the level of the caster? If it's the spell, what level is entrap? What level is ensnare? Should something be done?<br>
<br>
c) Archery seemed fine. I did try floating way above PoT and shooting a wizard who attacked me, but he was able to cast on me too and there was plenty of cover.<br>
<br>
d) More zone-in points to PoT please <br>
<br>
e) More ways out of Bazaar please or it will become a log-jamb.<br>
<br>
f) Are you opening the elemental planes? The zone-in to each just returned me to the PoT book last night.<br>
<br>
g) An obvious thing to do is to place buffbots in Shadowrest.. should there be a max time before you are kicked out of there?<br>
<br>
h) Stuns didn't unhorse me. Snares etc stuck fine on me while on a horse.<br>
<br>
h) It's early days yet, but how should we feedback (your preferred method)?<br>
<br>
I'm sure I forgot stuff, but will feed it back in time <br>

casters are too easy to kill really, except enchanters. should remove the ac reduction for wizards, necros, and especially mages. It will give the mage more time to run around while their pets do damage.

 As an enchanter I'm still not landing *SHIT* for spells. I have to rapture, tash, and chain root to get one to hold for a whole 5 seconds after like 10 casts. Our DD still lands *lousy* doing only 1-2% damage to players. And everyone keeps talking about how powerful rapture is, but Crimson potions negate it easily. <br>
<br>
 I'm kinda let down personally..I feel like a clay pidgeon<br>

as a necro i was able to hold my own for the most part..<br>
then again i got the best gear on rz and i think some of the more &quot;normal&quot; players are going to get owned hard..<br>
legslice is total crap and the only reason i got killed at all fix/nerf/remove this please..totaly overpowerd...<br>
<br>
<br>
here is how you die if you have good gear on beta right now..<br>
<br>
<br>
leg slice.....<br>
5 melees all over yer ass..<br>
nothing you can do...even with high avodiance and aa's cant channel shit..<br>
might get a shadowstep or 2 off but lot of good that does you..<br>
eventually beat down just because of the raw dps on you...<br>
<br>
one on one i am failry sure i can take most any class excluding ubber sk's, the bard manadrain nerf? if its true since you have no time for such stuff atm on beta makes them at least killable.<br>
<br>
<br>
night fire landed about 65% of the time..<br>
nights beacon landed 85% of the time<br>
taps where about 65%<br>
blood of thule landed maybe 40%<br>
darkness landed 0% on about 50 casts on diff chars..same with roots..i tried a few of them..no diff...<br>
<br>
necros are still viable...but not the gods of pvp by any notion(see rouges/bard combo)<br>
<br>
mages need help they are usless other then coh..sorry daet:P<br>
<br>
sk's still best overall pvp..of course<br>
<br>
pally's/clerics   really powerfull pvp maybe they dont kill you alot but they are a force to deal with<br>
<br>
shammy's the shammys i fought are just stupid hard to kill..<br>
<br>
wizzy's /shrug not hard for me but a non healer class will get pawned...<br>
<br>
chanter's mezz...mezz..mezz...tash...nothing really changed..<br>
<br>
warriors/monks/rouges    really huge upgrade for them..watch out<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
beserker's    screw legslice....i hope you die whoever made it....totaly bs...other then that total crap pvp<br>
<br>
ranger's still good and well ballanced pvp i think...would like to see a damage nerf on long range shots...<br>
<br>
druids no idea didnt see any/shrug prolly just like necros just with a major nature fetish..<br>
<br>
beasetlord's ..once again no idea didnt see one...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
things i would like to see change....<br>
<br>
  leg slice...fix this crapola...<br>
    festering darkness .....either bring my snares and the other snares in line with this resist wise or nerf it..<br>
      bard unresitable mezz....fix/patch/remove/edit somthing here..makes the bard way to much pvp with endless mezz thanks..<br>
         HT/LB /MB why give a magor melee dps producer the highest damage nuke in the game? with no down side? bring this in line with the necro lb or wizzy gimp mb.. make it snare them..drain thier mana...stunn them...or drop their resists down to crapola for a min or something in pvp cause its not needed for them to be a danger now...<br>
            like to see clerics with a self cast high damage sheild aa or spell..long recast/use time but like 75ds for 60 seconds or so...gives them somehting to do besides heal and....heal...and....um...did i mention heal?<br>
                mages....need to rethink pets and pvp ..they suck...hard...nukes dont land...and they cant even root or snare...they need help.. i would like to see mages with a new spell that lets them summon weapons for pets for pvp with a usefull effect? maybe a manatap/endurance tap or a resist debuff proc......something...lol...sorry..<br>

 Melees shouldn't be uber pvp'ers. They should be useless unless they have a healer and are hasted. Magic is always mightier than the sword, thats the way it should be. Rogues should be little creampuffs, unless they have a healer with them. I'm just bitter cause now i'm fooked. 3800 HP don't go that far let me tell ya. If resists aren't really changed which seems to be the opinion of a few druids here, we are useless. Fighting ele geared people is already a bitch, less than 50% of spells land. Well, atleast I know to check here first when I buy a new character.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dimentorz>DimentoRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clueless...</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#333333>(6/16/04 10:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2728.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> So Far it's FUBAR</span><hr size=1> Let's see:<br>
<br>
Log in time 00:00:01 - Log in and am immediately hearing casting and attacks against my character even before my screen shows anything.<br>
<br>
I survive.<br>
<br>
I was camped at the Nex/Baz zone line.<br>
<br>
So far my predictions of zone/portal camping being the preferred method of ganking are dead on.<br>
<br>
00:00:25 - Meet up with Vorge, heal him of debuff, and start buffing up.<br>
<br>
00:09:35 - After Vorge gets a few more people invited to group and I buff up a bit, we port to GD.<br>
<br>
Somehow everyone isn't around me when I say, &quot;GD Inc&quot; so I have to go back.<br>
<br>
00:10:05 - Port back into Nexus.  On Nexus pad no one is sitting around, however as I run BACK to Bazaar I see another poor hapless slob get killed where he camped.<br>
<br>
I'm not impressed with this at all.  Sony is going to have to make these zones where people commonly camp for the night PvP a few days AFTER implementing the changes, cause sure as shit, if they don't, people will be sitting at PoK bank, Nex/Baz zone line and PoT stones popping people as soon as the log in for the day.<br>
<br>
00:10:45 - Meet back up with group, again announce porting, check 4 damn times that people were ready, port, and someon STILL wasn't near...  He decides to walk.  Good, this ain't a taxi service, it's a bus, you miss it, you walk, nyah!<br>
<br>
00:11:00 - No one but RZ'ers in GD, run to book, port into PoK, and am attacked by a couple of other RZ'ers.<br>
<br>
I cast snare twice, no land.<br>
I cast root once, no land.<br>
I cast DD, no land.<br>
<br>
Someone casts annull, top 2 buffs, gone.<br>
<br>
Well, so far it's just like it's always been with a lot more portal camping.<br>
<br>
00:13:00 - Start attacking various people zoning in from Nexus to PoK.  Yeah, definitely portal camping is king now.  BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG.<br>
<br>
Cast snare and root probably another 10 times a piece, nope, no landing.<br>
<br>
Cast DD/Stun, resisted.<br>
<br>
00:20:50 - Zone into PoT immediately attack non-RZ'er at portal, weee...  Snare 5 times, root 5 times, stun/dd twice...<br>
<br>
No lands.<br>
<br>
00:25:30 - Another person zones into PoT, get my first landing of snare...  Oooh, ahhh...<br>
<br>
Try root on her, nope no sticking.<br>
<br>
Tracking still sucks.  Had someone warping all over the goddamn place on me, and track wasn't updating frequently enough and got directed to a couple of &quot;ghosted&quot; spots.<br>
<br>
00:31:45 - A big push from non-RZ'ers into PoT.  Cast my cold based DD 10 times, no lands, cast my snare 23 times, no land, cast root 17 times, no land.<br>
<br>
Cast DOT 7 times, only twice did anyone stay in range long enough for it to land, and fortunately those two times my dot stuck, woot.<br>
<br>
Mean while I'm getting hit REALLY fucking hard by melee's now.  Of course when they notice me and start attacking, they're hitting and CONSTANTLY interrupting my casts, not once was I able to cast through a melee attacking me.<br>
<br>
Got 40% HT'd twice, absolutely no resisting of it all.<br>
<br>
Conclusion -<br>
<br>
I'm a level 65, non-planar equiped druid.  I have 230 AA's, I have DA1, DM1, FOMM4, SCM3, max wisdom, most resists 200+.<br>
<br>
After a half hour of this my conclusions are:<br>
<br>
These changes will turn EQ into a portal/zone/bind camping night mare.<br>
<br>
Non-planar druids are fucked.<br>
<br>
Sony really isn't going to &quot;balance&quot; shit.  The first and most obvious thing to do is to not only reduce the damage of the insta-kills, but to do that AND add some fucking resistability to them.<br>
<br>
Provide some method of allowing casters to cast while being physically attacked.  Most druid spells, even with max cast haste take WAY to long to cast when compared to the amount of hits a melee can dish out, or when compared to most other classes which have some sort of short cast, difficult to resist, spell.  Since snare/root won't land with any more than they used to, there's no way for me to keep someone in range long enough to land a DOT most of the time.<br>
<br>
My DD/Stun, snare and root are my fastest casting spells, and I could only get &quot;1&quot; snare to land the entire time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, call me when they actually add more balance.<br>
<br>
I'm happy for the melee's.  It looks like fighting you will be more of a challange, but the issue I have is I'm going to have to find one of you guys with low resist in the hopes of landing a snare/root so I can keep you around long enough to land something, AND to keep you far enough away so that the &quot;auto interrupt&quot; you guys seem to get when you physically attack someone will be mitigated.<br>
<br>
I'm to the point where I'm so frustrated after years of these kinds of &quot;uber super wonderfull orgasmic gonna change the whole world of EQ changes&quot; instead really don't do much to improve anything, that if I ever met a Sony programmer, I'd be hard pressed not to beat him to death with a dirty mop bucket.<br>
<br>
Call me when they work in the rest of the &quot;balance.&quot;<br>

Your logic boggles my mind. Ok so melee's should suck in pvp unless they have a healer with them and are hasted? By that logic druids should suck in PvP unless they have a warrior protecting them. Creating dependancies on other classes in PvP is really pretty retarded, but it exists. And of course your going to argue that magic should &gt; the sword/dagger etc. The fact that magic requires cast times, standing still, and mana means that now with the pvp changes melee actually has a chance as opposed to before.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siclid>Siclid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 1519<br> <font color=#333333>(6/16/04 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2728.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mage: see chanter. also, COH is a wicked nice PVP tool now that groupmates can get snared much easier, call hero is big time usefull to bail groupmates out of some heavy shit!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

 Logic is, balance. Why would a druid need a warrior? Our strength is mobility and flight, we sacrifice killing power, ac and HP for that. If a warrior can negate our mobility, then they have the upperhand without any of these tweaks. Can warriors use tendonslicer, I dunno, but its effect lands way more than our snare/root does. Mims warrior, cant remember her name, never had a problem solo pvp, get on your horse, chase em down, smack em up. When she was with Setti, well, she was uber, ubertanker was her name maybe.

        Shamans have slow, and that is enough for most people to say we are balanced. Is slow landing in the new pvp system, if it were, i could see shamans as a huge asset. But then, you have enc who slow for 70%, bst for 65% and i thnk bards for 50%. So it still dosent help much. Then for damage wise, are dots/nukes landing a lot more? I mean we have the uber like 7 second cast time for 925 damage /roar! <br>
<br>
I really do like reading about the pvp test server and i find it great how it unites most of rz. If we were able to play on rz, and have the option of puting a carbon copy paper over to a total pvp warfair zone that would be great. Now some of you might say, then why play on rz if you just want to pvp on a different server. Well, rz is my home and will always be it, whenever someone does something done or shit talks, we can always just kill them.<br>
<br>
Also, i dont want to hear much bitching from druids about not being able to pvp. There should not be a reason why a druid cannot own someone. You have dots that are low resits, high damageing nukes. And if you have the right aa's you can heal yourself for a crit for 4k+ on a fast cast.<br>
<br>
Also, for you encs out there, there is one shield out there clickie from inv with cure diease to get rid of those pesky crimson potions people use.
