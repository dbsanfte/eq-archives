Its simply wishful thinking. All you have on that is rumor and accusations. Some wishful thinking but both Bush Sr, and his son both say they asked for and received no special treatment. Additionally Col. Walter B. &quot;Buck&quot; Staudt, the then-commander of the Texas Air National Guard said and I quote &quot;nobody did anything for him. There was no goddamn influence on his behalf. Neither his daddy nor anybody else got him into the Guard&quot;.<br>
<br>
Further to think he somehow skipped out or went AWOL during his tenure in the guard is absolutely silly.<br>
<br>
Let me paraphrase a few quotes...<br>
<br>
 I think maybe you need to look into the actual public record and see for yourself. When Bush decided to go to business school at Harvard in the fall of 1973, he requested and got an honorable discharge; eight months before his service was scheduled to end. The military does not and cannot by regulation, issue an Honorable Discharge to anyone that has been AWOL or otherwise seriously reprimanded<br>
<br>
All the cited documents so far are an assortment of standard form letters that are found in many reserve pilots records. The &quot;smoking gun&quot; AWOL proof cite is actually a standard report evaluation of ANG members that have transferred during an evaluation period. Each command is required to submit an evaluation record even if the member is no longer there to keep a constant an unbroken line of evaluation. The &quot;smoking gun&quot; terminology of &quot;Not observed at this station&quot; is the exact proper wording found in any members record of evaluation during a transfer which oddly the previous cited documents actually prove was the case. This is the standard evaluation extension language used in almost all military records. For the Navy the block is listed with &quot;Not Observed&quot; for the Army it lists &quot;not present for evaluation&quot;. The flight suspension letter is also a commonplace form letter suspending flying till an annual physical exam is completed.<br>
<br>
So people who were in the military but in a non-combat unit were dodging the draft eh? Funny I thought he had to not already be in the military to dodge the draft! Neat!<br>
<br>
Maybe you could ask Clinton what draft dodging really is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurakaikhan>Kurakai Khan</A> at: 6/8/04 4:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/04 4:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Ever been through the process for being selected as a flight <br>
candidate for any of the armed services?  I have.  I've taken both the Navy and the Air Force's aptitude tests and scored in the 90th percentile on both( a 9/9 on the general and aviation portion of the Navy's test).  Bush's scores might have gotten him command of a fuel truck, they certainly wouldn't have gotten him a flight slot. You need to score in the top quartile, not the bottom to be selected.<br>
<br>
Bush's scores?  General 98th percentile, Pilot 25th percentile, Navigator 50th percentile.<br>
<br>
At the time Bush was admitted to the national guard, there was a year and a half waiting list for admission. Bush was admitted to his unit the day he enlisted.  Buck Staudt even re-administered the oath to bush in Public so that there would be a photo opp.<br>
<br>
Here's the chain of contacts: George HW Bush to Sid Adger  (local oil magnate) to Texas Speaker of the House Ben Jarnes to General James Rose, the head of the Texas Air National Guard.  Rose, who is now dead, told his friend and former legislator Jake Johnson that &quot;I got that Republican congressman's son from Houston into the Guard.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bush was also approved for direct appointment, despite zero ROTC experience, the lack of technical or medical skills, or prior flight training.  Sooo, he didn't have to go to officer candidate school like everyone else.  Direct appointments, for you non-military  folks, usually go to physicians and nurses, who get a couple of weeks of &quot;knife and fork school.&quot;<br>
<br>
Buck Staudt scheduled another press-publicized photo opp for Bush's direct appointment.<br>
<br>
And the composition of Bush's unit?  That was coincidence?  A commander of a unit filled with the sons of political leaders and sports figures says that his daddy didn't do anything for him?  And none of the other daddy's did anything for their own sons either?  They all, just by happy circumstance and alignment of the planets ended up in a non-combat unit close to home?  <br>

I don't think whether or not Bush/Kerry are scumbags matters, I think all politicians have personal skeletons in the closet.  Bush's Iraq policy was wrong, and is failing- Abu Ghraib demonstrates how other policy failures have taken place.  That is what I've been arguing.<br>
<br>
As far as his NG service goes- I think the issue isn't whether or not he served his country, I think the question is wealth and privelage.  The fact is that some poor kid from NY or mississippi wouldn't have managed to secure the privelaged treatment he did.  There is enough evidence that privelage was wrongfully used that I have lost respect for Bush as a person.<br>
<br>
Just to be clear though, I don't think personality has jack shit to do with the issues.  That's why I was shocked what a big deal people made out of the whole Lewinsky thing- neither Bush using privelage to escape military service/having been a drunkard, or Clinton getting a sexual favor from an intern directly affects policy issues to any great degree.  If Bush hadn't abandoned containment then invaded Iraq or withdrawn from almost 20 international treaties, some of them significant changes of US policy going back 50 years- then I'd probably think of his administration a lot differently.  The policies have made America and the world a more dangerous place.<br>
<br>
You don't have to take my word for it, the International Institute of Strategic Studies report has directly linked the Iraq war to a significant rise in terrorism.  No one's disputed this, or argued this.  More to the point, I don't think anyone on this forum thinks that Guantanomo bay or Abu Ghraib have helped to defeat terrorism so much as inflaming support for it.  <br>
<br>
I wish people would stand up and condemn a wrongful policy they way they used to.  I remember after Iran/Contra how senior Republicans constructively criticized the policy and related policies and how Reagan took responsibility for it and brought Congress together to enact protections against it happening again.  That is a lasting legacy of leadership that remains to this day.  Bush claims to be following in Reagan's footsteps.  He should start acting like it.<br>

<br>
Okay, back at you: how did Bush get to the top of a 150 person long waiting list with no string pulling, the very first day he applied.  He had low entrance scores, no special skills, no former military background, and wasn't a gifted student.  How did he coincidentally end up in the same unit with the sons of other powerful Texas politicos and sports figures?  The entrance scores, and Bush's academic records are all well documented.  <br>
<br>
How did Bush secure a direct appointment and not have to attend OCS, with no special qualifications, no flight experience, he wasn't an engineer, a doctor, or a nurse, and had no prior military experience?   <br>
<br>
How did he get selected to train on an aircraft, the F-102, that was being phased ou, so that he stood roughly zero chance of mobilization?  That aircraft hit it's *planned* obsolescence date 3 months after Bush finished training.<br>
<br>
Assuming this is true, and knowing it for the explosive admission it would be, what incentive would Buck Staudt or GB sr have to admit this publically now?  Get real, none of those guys will ever admit that in a million years.<br>
<br>
Give me just one sound, non-preferential reason that he was selected for any of the above.  Just one reason, supported by the facts of his admission, only one.  You can't.  <br>
<br>
As for believing Buck Staudt, why should I? Bush's own academic and test records do not bear out a reason for preferential treatment, and given that, he would have the most incentive to lie.  If what's on the *record* does not bear out what he says, should we instead rely on his word, with no additional supporting documentation?<br>
<br>
Perhaps in your world, those circumstances don't stink.  In mine they do.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself this:  if this were your son, and all the same conditions were true, what chance do you think he would stand at getting the same treatment? I'll tell you: zero.<br>
People who are honest with themselves know what happened here. This is not a unique story.<br>
<br>
Let's also be even more honest:  most people would pull strings or do whatever they had to do to save their own children.  Hell, if I knew I had to make some phone calls, have drinks with some people, or kiss some ass to save my son's life, I'd bloody well do it.  But I wouldn't lie about it.     <br>
As a parent, I can't help but understand the actions.  What I can't stand is disavowing those actions because they don't fit with Bush's current get-tough persona. <br>
<br>
Just say it with me George Sr.: I love my son, and I did what I had to do to save him.  I am deeply sorry others may have died in his place. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A> at: 6/9/04 2:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#333333>(6/9/04 5:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;I particularly condemn the way our political leaders supplied the manpower for that war [The Vietnam War].

Feeling the most heat is Governor Bush, who critics say got preferential treatment in gaining an officer's commission in the Texas Air National Guard in 1968.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In court testimony during an ongoing civil lawsuit, former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes said a Bush family friend, Sid Adger, asked him to help young Bush get into the guard after Bush graduated from Yale University. Mr. Barnes testified that he complied with this request, at a time when the elder George Bush was serving as a congressman.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Selective Service records show that Bush was accepted into the guard after an interview with Air Guard Commander Col. Walter Staudt - ahead of 150 applicants. He was accepted into pilot training after scoring in the 25th percentile on his pilot aptitude test - the lowest allowed by the guard.&quot;<br>

<br>
I am sure that the al quaidi fanatics also live in a similarly absolutist world where american  = infidel = ok to murder.<br>
<br>
Your unreasoning hatred and promotion of terror on others makes you as bad as those who support september 11.<br>
<br>
What sort of twisted pervert thinks it is perfectly acceptable to torture, rape and murder iraqis?  Would they gain a ghoulish pleasure by looking at those pictures?<br>
<br>
If you detatch yourself from human compassion, you fall into exactly the same trap as those who think it acceptable to behead a man and put the video of it on the internet.  They too have their moral blindfolds on which allows them to go against the basic tenets of humanity, reason and religion. You have the same moral blindfold.  You don't see a man, you see some sort of animal, or an object.<br>
<br>
&quot;k thx&quot;.  What a devastating conclusion to your rigourously argued defence of torture and murder.  How long did you spend thinking that one up?  The mentality you show is a juvenile one, &quot;quit screaming arab b4 i shove this baton up your ass k thx&quot;.<br>
<br>
When it was iraqis torturing iraqis in abu ghraib, was that deserved?<br>
If Americans are the torturers does that make it better?<br>
<br>
I haven't seen any french people come out and defend this torture.  I have seen some (thankfully not many) americans defend and indeed applaud this torture.  Given the choice, and as someone who has in fact lived in the US for a while, I would certainly prefer to live in a nation of &quot;cheese eating surrender monkeys&quot; rather than a nation of &quot;torturers and apologists for torturers&quot;.<br>
<br>
I apologize if i got somewhat carried away.  Clearly america is not a nation of torturers or their apologists.  That would be as wrong as characterizing iraq as a nation of terrorists.  <br>
<br>
Stop trying to sustain an argument that torture is worthwhile.  It just makes you seem barbaric.  At the very least accept it is wrong but argue that it was small scale, or an error, and that we should look at the many good things that america are doing in iraq. <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>
