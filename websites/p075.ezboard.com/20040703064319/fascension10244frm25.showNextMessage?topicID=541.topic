I troll AD's board on occasion, because EQ was once a huge part of my life and I still care about goings on-so to speak.  What I notice is it seems that daily people continue to attempt to get &quot;UNKOS&quot; through postings or what-not almost always to no avail.  So why is it you guys hold so firm to this rule?  It seems to me that by doing this over the long term your only bringing an end to the game and server you love so much and have devoted so much too.  After all, EQ is more about the community than the actual game.  Would you guys be happy if no one other than AD played on RZ at all?  Or if No PKs existed?  The game has already evolved to a point where PKs pose virtually no threat of any kind to AD and the only thing keeping people KOS really achieves is keeping the former PK or new owner from getting into any other guild.  I don't know it just seems strange that people hold grudges so long and never forgive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gsam>Gsam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Weaksauce</span><br>  Posts: 1699<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/04 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rockstarhq.com/patches/images/p0748.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is AD so adamant in regards to people staying KOS?</span><hr size=1> The only way to enforce a code of ethics on this server is for the players to take it upon themselves to do it.  GM's have long since vanished as a source of order from RZ, so now its up to the players. <br>
<br>
AD has decided that we dont want shitheads on our server. This is why we perma kos some people.  IF you war us and fight us thats fine. Your gonna get a fine and your gonna get let off in some cases.  IF you use us to gear up and then go pk your gonna find yourself KOS for life. <br>
<br>
PK's used to bring an element of fun to rallos zek. Warring enemy guilds used to be worth taking time out to do. Now all (most) pk's do is use their instakills and zone and shit talk. This is not fun nor is it worth wasting time trying to combat. <br>
PK's were fun back in the days of Gan'Hosi.  Its been a long time since a true PvP guild existed that cared about any sort of combat for respect or prestige rather than griefing.  Todays pk guilds are chumps that take advantage of a flawed system (game, pvp rules etc..) to bitchgank with their ht's, lifeburns, mb's and they hunt in packs.  This is the type of low class shit we dont want on our server. So if a person gets tired of that lifestyle we are not gonna roll over and say its all good now.  They are gonna be kos for life cause the fact is we can and will beat them when we find them and they cant touch us.<br>

<br>
Those people that did nothing but PK (ie:  gank) for the sole purpose of easy loot shouldn't be on our server as it destroys what, in the origin of the game Verant called, &quot;The Risk vs. Reward&quot; factor.<br>
<br>
Insta-nuking someone in HoH who happens to be under the 75% mark and looting whatever cash or lootable items that happen to be on them completely defeats the purpose of making premium items difficult to get.<br>
<br>
Secondly, as stated in the previous post, a lot of the jerks that practice this insta-kill PK method walk around beating their chests acting like they are god's gift to EQ and they have &quot;ubah&quot; skills, and quite frankly, that's grating.<br>
<br>
Almost every time I've fought a class with an instant kill, and they've used it on me, I've lost.  Almost every time I was able to find those people immediately afterwards in a PvP capable zone and fought them, I've won, or ended in them scampering off to a &quot;safe zone&quot; to talk shit.<br>
<br>
The majority of Rallos Zek players want to have the ability to PvP when they like, more or less as something to do when bored, or to settle &quot;in game&quot; disputes, or if nothing else, than to shut &quot;that annoying loud mouth the hell up.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The reason most players are like this is, we've all long since realized that the game really doesn't support &quot;good&quot; PvP.  I don't believe there's been a REAL &quot;race war&quot; in over 3 years on the Rallos server, and certainly guild wars now seem to always degrade into train-griefing, so other than &quot;incidental&quot; PvP, what's the point of trying to do nothing but PvP on the server?<br>
<br>
So, for those few that have taken it upon themselves to go PK (item ganking and grief killing) after using their own guilds to gear them up, or those players that have practiced nothing but the ganker/greifer method of PK, they have earned their character the right to be bitch slapped at any and all times they step into a PvP capable zone.<br>
<br>
For those poor people unfortunate enough to buy a character that they didn't research, and expect to be able to play PvE on Rallos, sorry.  Rallos is the wrong server for you.  There's a hard core group that's done nothing but play on Rallos Zek since Phase 3 beta, and we have long memories, and the strength to carry a grudge until Sony goes bankrupt.<br>

<br>
I absolutely despise people buying accounts.  Everytime someone purchases a KOS account and pleads to get off KOS, I hope it's the last time... that future people will make their own characters and not take the fast track out.<br>
<br>
EverQuest is already MUCH easier than it was 4 years ago.  When I first started playing, having 10 platinum at level 12 was an amazing feat... now you can make 10 platinum between levels 1 - 4 in all the newbie zones.  Not even 10 platinum, 20 - 30.<br>
<br>
The way Rallos Zek works is simple.  The most powerful guild(s) make the rules.  There's no discussion over it, there's no debate, that's just the way it is.  If you don't like it, then the only way to over rule it is to eliminate the guild(s) in question.<br>
<br>
Peacebreakers tried to do this repeatedly, and they were rather successful at what they did.  Because of that, it was the most exciting times Rallos-Zek had ever seen.  Times like that have long sinced passed, and no other has managed to try to change the server &quot;way of life&quot; since.<br>
<br>
Moral of story... don't buy characters, don't randomly PK people, don't shit talk, and you won't be KOS (rather generalized, but you get the point).<br>
<br>
AD isn't a bunch of bullies.  I do admit that there have been unfavorable situations regarding AD members, but that is going to happen with any large scale guild.  For the most part, we do a good job of taking care of the server and offering a sort of &quot;protection&quot; to the guilds below us.  <br>
<br>
Do we have to do that? No.  Will we fight your battles for you? No.  But if a group of PKs are out griefing you, and any member of AD happens to come across it -- chances are they're going to give you a hand.  Hell, if someone sent me a tell asking for help and I wasn't tied up doing something important, I would go help -- I would like to say that every member in AD would do the same.<br>

<br>
Drak/Webe were the douchebags of PB/PoF/etc. Guys like them and the other random retards that joined that guild were what made people hate PB. <br>
<br>
Maybe the problem is that the shitbags of today on RZ are just pale in comparison to what some of the old timers remember being worthwhile enemies. With the advent of HT/LB/MB, the severe imbalances of PvP, no real challenge from any one guild and the impression the second rate hacks now known as the Curse are nothing more than a Flowers of Happiness v2.0<br>
<br>
Anyone who was around on RZ 2-3 years from the start of the server remembers great wars, great guilds, classic fights, well known PvPers who were feared, and all around a good time PvPing. That died on RZ a long time ago with the safe zones, insta kills, warping, ghosting and other cheap shit that basically ruined any respectable sense of PvP. <br>
<br>
Whoever MaliSZ is, my best guess is you got your ass kicked on SZ so you bought a blue server char and transferred to RZ to become some badass and have an impact in PvP. Good luck with that I hope you are better at PvP than you are at playing the message board warrior role.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dimentorz>DimentoRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clueless...</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/04 5:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PB Not PK?!?!</span><hr size=1> No, I'm pretty sure PB went random right after losing the war with AD, or maybe it was during it, I don't care.

If they did it was probably remnant people who ended up with guildtag control long after PB was gone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanerian@ascension10244>Tanerian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.insanitysedge.com/~teren/MIMTeren75s.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/04 6:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PB Not PK?!?!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>No, I'm pretty sure PB went random right after losing the war with AD,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

And many PB DID go pk after the majority of PB quit/went to legends or created new characters, there was really no other option for alot of them as they would never be allowed to get off of kos =p <p>The Druid formerly known as Teren Kanan<br>

We've let far more people off KOS than we KOS4LYFE.   Even a lot of PB.  If you're a trainer, a ganker, a shit-talkin' pos, a professional $tormhammer PK, or betray the guild in some way, you won't be getting off KOS.  Buying/possessing a POS account is also a nono.  What's so hard to understand? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146302" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/vansig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

8 hour long raging battle! turning point of Rebirth war!  Ordo Mal's first entrance into that war and got their ass handed to them.  AD / Synergy vs FU / PB / Ordo Alliance!<br>
<br>
Karnors Castle #2<br>
Lil fuzzy on this one but I believe that was AD / Synergy warring over the ventrilo sathir spawn! I cant recall who but someone trained the ever living shit out of people. I seem to recall a SS with about 100 corpses in VS room.  Battle that ensued after that was classic!<br>
<br>
PoF / Gan Hosi  vs  The Mercs / Sinister in ferrot #3 <br>
Crazy long battle that put peace of formosa on the map! good 2 hour brawl! last time I recall seeing sin on RZ. Shortly after I think they retired from EQ.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.launch.com/musicvideos/view/not_start/1,1218,1078054~1134~1137189316,00.html">We'll never, see the likes of you again!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Classics:<br>
<br>
Darkenbane 1.0 &quot;Recruit every newbie in EC with a rusty dagger&quot; night -  DB, down to about 5 members, decides if you wear an apprentice robe and a rusty dagger you are there kinda player and recruits every one they can find in 3 hours.  Unfortunately, the crack team of level 12's assembled (with the couple level almost 50's, Malio, Arzos, etc.) run cockblock and slaughter all newbs that show a DB tag in 3 hours and DB is left to &quot;absorb&quot; lords of malevolance to save their pos guildafter failing to get a SINGLE recruit.  Complete ownage.  I'm sure Gaygate still has nightmares.<br>
<br>
Dragon Necropolis fight - AD/Synergy vs PB/FU/BOK battle for Zlandicar.  So many petitions it draws not one, not two, but three GM's who all stand around watching us train, zone camp, and beat the shit out of each other until ozuri (?) says &quot;This has got to end!&quot;.   Next patch the Chetari Nation agros anyone pvp'ing in DN, &quot;Yiiiii!&quot;.<br>
<br>
SR vs The Regs - South Ro to Freeport to Guk.  LOL, also affectionately referred to as &quot;Dead Pally Night&quot;.  Fight lasted for like 6 hours.  (Hey look, no fgts using books, insta-gating or popping their horses makes for long fights!  Imagine!)<br>
<br>
Fear Portal fest - Ah yes, this was a beauty.  Hours and hours of PVP with Rebirth.  Highlights here included Kurakai looting Ketov's cowl of mortality (when there were only 2 or 3 on the server), and AD/Synergy teaming to kill Cazic after PB gets pwned. ^_^<br>
<br>
Too many ToV fights to mention -  Those are mostly all a blur.  Tatami training the dragon nation, caplayca talking shit in ooc for hours, PB finally giving up after no l3wt.<br>
<br>
Karnor's Fight - Ah yes, Venril Sathir gets agro'd and decides to PVP against 90 folks beating the crap outta each other in his house!  A mad dash for the zone results in Dreadlands going down due to so many zone-outs at once.  LOL that was some funny shit.  This night also included 'The Fun in Frontier Mountains' where I Nilear chases me to Frontier Mountains, we zone over, and Yslaath is waiting with teh Hotkey.  I ninja, and walk away with one of his ub3r loots; Loam Arms maybe?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Paradigma/Seb bubble - I also rememebr a good long fight at the Sebilis bubble.  I can't even friggin' remember who and why we were fighting except I remember it was Paradigma.  I remember killing some mage's name that started with a Z, and chasing people through TT with all them ghost-things in tow.  I remember seeing Horizon and giving him a /hug, then the little son of a bitch nuked me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
