The purpose of exchanging ideas alone is worthwhile, both parties come away richer for the experience, I know I have.  Saying the same shit happens in state prisons is bullshit tomza- people in state prison have had their day in court and been convicted by a jury of their peers.  Trust me, if wide-spread abuse like this was going on in an LA county police holding cell, the Rodney King riots would look like child's play.  Oh and if we all watched Baywatch and porn the human race would soon be bac in trees flinging our shit at one another :P<br>
<br>
On to Brotherscale's remarks, didn't get a chance to read 'em before posting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As I said, I feel they must have been placed into custody for a reason.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Didn't I make myself clear?  The majority of detainees there were picked up in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>random sweeps</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  That means the only reason they were arrested is that they lived in the same neighborhood as a suspect.  A reason I grant you, but a bad reason.  Civvies having their door broken down at 3am and picked up for no better reason than living in a suspicious neighborhood isn't the best way to turn Iraqis against the insurgency is it.<br>
<br>
You say in custody for a reason.  That reason isn't disclosed to anyone, not even to the detainee after months of detention.  It could be that he just &quot;looks shifty&quot; or it might be more substantial.  If Specialist Jeremy Sivits and the other 7-8 charged deserve due process, then why don't the innocents picked up in random sweeps?  Unless you're saying everyone in the neighborhoods swept deserved to be detained without due process, I think you've failed to respond to the point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And as far as taking the US appointed CPA's statements at face value I don't know their credentials other than Paul Bremmer (and even then I am not intimately familiar).  The CPA is UN appointed as I remember as well but I may be wrong. And anything appointed by the UN is suspect in my eyes.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ummm, you might want to do your research on who is in charge of Iraq at the moment.  The CPA was appointed by the United States government executive branch.  After June 30th they will form the backbone of the largest embassy of any country anywhere in the world- over 2,000 full-time American staff employed.  As for their credentials, most of them were selected by the Pentagon.  <br>
<br>
As for what you say about the UN, it astonishes me.  Every successful post-conflict resolution in the last two decades has involved the UN (of which the US is a powerful member might I add).  From Cyprus to Sierra Leone to Bosnia to Kosovo and in Eritrea the UN has brought peace to parts of the world that had seen ethnic strife and civil war for hundreds of years.  If the UN had been on board from the beginning of the conflict as a truly international effort, I doubt the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) would be seen as illegitimate and unpopular as they clearly are now.  Prime Minister Allawi was likely appointed by the CPA because he has long-standing ties to British and US intelligence that pre-date the Saddam regime.  <br>
<br>
So when the CPA admits that most of them are civilians being combed through like plankton through a whale's mouth, you know they're being accurate.  After all, as part of a US executive government branch, it is in the CPA's best interest to maximize the number of terrorists and &quot;evildoers&quot; and minimize the number of innocents held- for PR reasons on the ground.  It wouldn't suprise me if the 70-80% figure is lower than the actual amount.  Don't forget that in the absence of Spc Darby and other anonymous sources, we might never have known about these abuses.  This administration is the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20020524.html" target="top">most secretive since Nixon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> according to Nixon's legal counsel John Dean, and he should know.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now, as to the people who you quoted as being allied with our cause.

Are you saying because we weren't there we should ignore the corroboration of people that were there?  General Taguba corroborated it in his report.  He wasn't there either, but statements from people witnessing it were in his report.  I guess he's lying huh...he wasn't there!  Suppose the defence attorneys are lying about the corroboration they have too.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And I did not make the argument in favor of torture for strategic benefit. I stated that in the case to preserve noncombatants when I KNEW the person was in possesion of certain information. Scroll back up and re-read it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well how do you KNOW if someone is in possession of certain information?  Plus, if you suspect that someone is plotting an unconventional attack, and you use brutal unconventional methods to stop them, how are you any better than the terrorist?  An insurgent might claim that he KNOWS the US will pull out of Fallujiah if a simple and brutal act forces a confrontation that the insurgency will be ready for.  That is both brutal and unconventional thinking- worse than what the US did, but using the same rationale you did.  That insurgent *knows* about US intentions of pulling out just as much as anyone can *know* whether someone is witholding information.  The abused man who is classified as a civilian detainee at the top of the statement, a designated non-combatant, are we now in the business of abusing civvies to get at information we think they have?  Stalin's secret police did much the same, many &quot;confessed&quot; fake crimes just to stop the beatings.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And again neither you nor I can know what information may have been gained. How do you know that information learned did not just save thousands of lives yet you will never hear about it due to operational security<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because if *thousands* of lives had been saved it would be a HUGE propaganda coup for the coalition and they'd milk every last drop.  I can't believe the naive drivel that people say sometimes- if Osama bin Laden was captured, we'd all know, if an attack/attacks causing thousands of casualties were foiled we'd all know, because knowing that would increase support for the war amongst Iraqis, Americans and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Plus, anyone with the vaguest knowledge of interrogation techniques knows that if you beat information out of someone, they'll likely resist, make something up, or tell you what you want to hear rather than what is really happening.  It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does not work</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Similar strong-arm techniques were used on hundreds of Vietcong detainees to gain information on the Tet offensive, history shows how useful that was :P  Not to mention if someone finds their conscience like Spc Darby and it comes out, you can kiss hearts and minds goodbye.  <br>
<br>
Cracking down so to speak will not eliminate the insurgency, it will likely increase overall public support for it.  Particularly if the majority of those detained/abused were civilians.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also as to Iraq not being a threat it was not only to hunt WMDs that we invaded.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Really?  Hate to be pedantic, but the justification for war in UNSCR 1441 was that if Iraq didn't &quot;immediately disarm&quot; its WMDs &quot;serious consequences&quot; would follow.  There was no mention in the resolution of proliferation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sadaam Husein was known to fund groups that were hostile to the West, specifically the USA. Now, lets say he were to fund one of these groups with enough <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's just the point isn't it- can you start a war with nothing more than fear, paranoia and assertions?  There's no proof of what you say because if there was it would have been presented, if not to us then to allies in closed session.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The people who made the decision to invade went forward with the information they had. And call me naive but I tend to believe they have more complete information in most ways then is available to the general public<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Then why not simply disclose it?  Just do it to the Senate intelligence committee behind closed doors like the 9/11 intelligence which contained sensitive sources.  There is no proof of it, not a shred, simply their assertions and fears of what might happen.  It's terribly hit and miss- it's war justified via Pin the Tail on the Donkey compounded with fear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My foe in this case kills noncombatants, women, children, specifically for the purpose of inflicting terror and fear<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Specifically for the purpose of ending the occupation.  That they use terror and fear for their goals is no different from you using terror and fear to achieve yours.  You claim destroying peoples' lives will save other lives, I'm sure they claim the same after seeing their families maimed and dead in the hospitals and described as &quot;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/" target="top">collateral damage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&quot;.  Both lines of thinking are barbaric.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I really am not going to have my feelings hurt, since I do not harm without good reason. But give me a good reason and all bets are off.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm sure that many insurgents will undoubtedly say exactly the same thing.  Al-Qaeda already have said exactly what you said.  It all amounts to what you or they consider &quot;good reason&quot;.  For you brutal actions are justified if you think they will end up saving lives and ending enemy life.  That is the insurgency's justification too- that brutal actions will save the lives of their bretheren and help win the conflict.  <br>
<br>
And I think both views are dead wrong.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Is it Osama and gang? well they booted to Afghanistan, and the fighting in Afghanistan gets about as much play on the U.S. news Channels as the Calgary Flames<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The Afghanistan policy has been all but abandoned- Hamid Karzai is still jokingly called the Mayor of Kabul, since his writ extends no further.  There simply aren't the boots on the ground to take the country back from the warlords running most of it.  The story died because it wasn't changing.  &quot;Karzai Still Powerless&quot;  and &quot;Warlords Still Running the South&quot; peter out as headlines.  Whereas in Iraq the issue has been forced by a war of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>choice</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and Bush has bet his presidency on its success.  Also, the casualty rate has been higher in Iraq, although they are still happening in Afghanistan.  Pat Tilman got coverage because of the stupendous sacrifice he made- but that's about it.<br>
<br>
Oh and if the Flames don't win today they'll have only themselves to blame.  They've dominated the series, TB deserved to win only one of those games and ended up pinching a second.  I lost count of the number of times TB iced the puck in the last game, that's how much Calgary dominated.  Seem a bit brittle on confidence though, took them OT to win a game they dominated.  Be nice to see a Canuck team win for a change though eh? <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

<br>
As your statement about prisoners in the US, a lot of people are jailed up without bail until their trials because they have a high chance of being a killer or fleeing (these people have yet to be commited by a trial of their peers).  They get passed around, and treated like shit, and used like rag dolls... know why anyone doesnt care? Because these men are usually the scum of society, and they dont run crying to guards, because most the guards are indifferent and dont want to get involved if not too much shit happens (major riots). <br>
<br>
(I've talked to a lot of cops about what happens - most Cops just want to live, rather than get in the middle of dangerous stuff that could be avoided) - Im not saying the guards lay a bunch of men on top of each other or something to interrogate them for evidence, Im talking about the inmate on inmate violence <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>(Juan on Juan).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As for prisoners in Iraq, even if they were innocent civilians, how many of them were are the wrong place where they shouldnt be at the wrong time - after curfew or whatever to be picked up?  <br>
<br>
Being in a &quot;war zone&quot; you think they would be smart enough to stay out of trouble, unless they were up to something.  In Vietnam (something my dad and all my relatives fought in against the Viet Cong), they told me horrible stories of the VC using any kind of dirty tactic from using women, children and other methods to kill enemies.... You think there could be a possibility that one of these &quot;innocent civilians&quot; could be scouting - for when to have the next suicide bombing?<br>
<br>
Liberals think too idealistically... when you see these things happen first hand, you would arrest those people too if they looked suspicious if it meant possibly saving lives or saving your own.<br>

Er, that's total crap, bullshit and poppycock- ask any sociologist.  Continental Europe in several countries show pornography, pretty graphic pornography on terrestrial TV channels, network TV and free to air stations.  They still care deeply about the outside world.  You can't live in a glass bubble, for reasons of international trade, relations and because terrorism has no borders.  The isolationist view is so ridiculous and retrodden I feel it does not merit a response. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As your statement about prisoners in the US, a lot of people are jailed up without bail until their trials<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Whether or not to grant bail is decided in a court-room hearing and by due process of law- you can't get away from that.  Iraqi civilians have no recourse of law to challenge their detention in any way.  That is what makes the responsibility of occupying another country fraught with policy conundrums.<br>
<br>
How is it possible to say for example, that establishing democracy is a goal if the concept of innocence before proven guilt is absent in the behavior of occupying forces?  In the occupations of Germany and Japan, the burden was shared successfully and civilians had the right to challenge their detention.  It was that successful post-war transition that allowed Germany and Japan to grow into the nations we see today.  That was a war of necessity without certainty of victory- this was a war of choice where victory was never in doubt.  Why then Tomza, has the post-war plan failed in so many key areas, and why are Iraqis innocents still bereft of fundamental rights that we promised them?<br>
<br>
No one's saying that the US troops are doing anything wrong- just that the policies are wrong, dead wrong.  But it's not the policymakers facing the bullets and bombs is it?  Only one congressman has a son in military service, neither President nor Vice-President have even smelled a war.  Yet it is their policies that have killed many of the 800+ service personnel and 10,000 Iraqi civilians.  Still, not one person losing their job over the various fiascos, where is the accountability Tomza?<br>

Also, most of the civilians were held for months, some since the prison was rebuilt.  No curfew works that way, save in brutal police states- Saddam did that sort of thing- if we follow suit even half-way to that, then our moral justification for invading begins to crumble decisively.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>after curfew or whatever to be picked up?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
See, this is why I wished people would do their research.  Most of the civilians were arrested in their own homes, there were entire residential areas where every young male of fighting age was detained.  This policy of sweeping neighborhoods and collectively punishing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>potential</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rebel sympathizers has a long history- from Nazi Germany's occupation of southern europe to Turkey's occupation of Armenia, to Russia's occupation of Afghanistan.  Not the best examples to be following.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Being in a &quot;war zone&quot; you think they would be smart enough to stay out of trouble<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If they were arrested in their own homes how are they causing trouble?  Many were too scared to go out after dark, the occupying power had failed to restore security.  Then your door gets broken down at 3am, and you get hauled off to a prison, bereft of even the most BASIC of rights.  And then held for 6 months, abused, tortured.  Put yourself in those peoples' shoes, and then it's not hard to reason out why the occupation is incredibly unpopular there and there's no shortage of ordinary people willing to fight the occupation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>they told me horrible stories of the VC using any kind of dirty tactic from using women, children and other methods to kill enemies<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not unlike the dirty tactics US citizens used to rightly throw out their occupiers.  Citizens fighting a vastly superior enemy and love their country will do almost anything to fight enemies invading their soil.  Plus Tomza you can't seriously ignore what the US did in Vietnam.  Carpet bombing, napalm, Agent Orange, destroying crops for entire regions, two million civilians killed, more bombs dropped than in WWI and WWII COMBINED...it wasn't a one-sided story by any means at all.  <br>
<br>
In one key respect, Vietnam was actually a *better* thought out intervention.  The South Vietnamese wanted the United States there, the US had allies on the ground willing to fight the enemy and help the US.  The same was true in Afghanistan (even if some of the were rather evil warlords).  In Iraq there is no local political group the US has worked with outside of the Kurds, and that is purely regional and expeditious.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You think there could be a possibility that one of these &quot;innocent civilians&quot; could be scouting - for when to have the next suicide bombing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
See, I don't think that a &quot;possibility&quot; is enough to detain a majority of innocents and torture them.  Hell, I don't think torturing any enemy achieves anything except the radicalization of your enemy.  Iraq is largely a fiercely secular country with a secular political movement.  Torturing people, innocent or otherwise and aggressively making large decisions on their behalf (privatizing their ministries, awarding Iraqi government contracts to US companies)- if the US is trying to sow the seeds for another radical chaotic theocratic state, it's going about it the right way.  Just read about Mossadeq and Iran Tomza- and think about the consequences.<br>
<br>
Plus you haven't done your research again- pretty much all of the US soldiers who have died haven't died to suicide bombs.  Al-Qaeda have targeted US-appointed Iraqis who they've called puppets- they have been targeted by suicide bombers.<br>
<br>
Most of the US soldiers have been killed by conventional guerilla warfare using conventional weapons.  IEDs, rifles and grenades, much the same technique that any country would use in the event of invasion, including the United States.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Liberals think too idealistically<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I am neither a liberal nor an idealist, those are pigeon-holes.  There is good policy and bad policy- when I see good policy from anyone I praise it, when I see bad policy from anyone I condemn it.  You can't build achievement out of ideals alone, the cornerstone has to be good policy.  The invasion was a bad policy, the post-occupation plans have been bad policy and the means of power transfer is a bad policy.  The policy failures were predictable, hell I predicted many of them and I'm a private citizen reading about this on my own.  This is beyond ideology or simple political definitions, it is simply incompetent, from any side of the political spectrum.<br>

<br>
Actually Lehammer, I dont completely believe what the US is doing right now in Iraq is right, but since the decision is made, I want to try to justify some of the things that are happening that I believe are right/ shouldnt be such a big deal because there are bigger things happening.  Its closing to election time as well, for someone to lose their job and to take time to rehire someone else would waste more time.<br>
<br>
Yea, some things are bad, and it seems like it looks like we are trying to rally up some of the &quot;innocent iraqs&quot; to an internment camp, but its being done for the safety of everyone, not just the US soldiers.  <br>
<br>
Even though of the detainee's in the high security wing of the prison where the abuse was taking place were being held on scant evidence, its being done partially for our security.  Its happened plenty of times before in history, is it right to do so? no - but there is a possibility that it could potentially harvest very important information.  Yea its sad that some died, but after some time a lot of them were released.  That is just like bail, lots of people who are deemed as violent and dangerous to the community are not granted bail, thus are imprisioned in there without a chance to leave.  These people imprisioned are believed to hold information that could be important...<br>
<br>
About me saying that the information was for suicide bombing-I was meaning to actually refering about common intelligence (where they could be holding weapon stockpiles etc)- but using suicide bombing as one specific situtation - I just speaking about it in general.  Its sad that some of the detainees were treated harshly, but its just the way things happen.<br>
<br>
Yea, it could just be finger pointing like a Salem witch trial, I wouldnt mind when this blows over either... I dont feel right about Americans being in Iraq, but I know if America pulled out early or changed it stance, our &quot;word&quot; wouldnt mean as much.<br>
<br>
I admit, I didnt really care to know precise facts about this, why? Because I understand some of the reasoning behind why they are doing it... Just look at history and the numerous times it has been done, and I dont think its ever changing. (I dont think its right, but it happens, wont change)  Plus I didnt bother to read many of the previous threads - still in the process of reading through them at this time.  <br>
<br>
Sure it gives you things to think about, but in the end, a lot of us arent in a position to be able to change whats happening... mothers, teachers, farmers, foreigners who think America is going overboard, college kids wont be able to change Bush's mind.<br>
<br>
Btw, if you were wondering, I have no strong political stance...  As you can see, the only thing I disagree with you strongly is the imprisionment of these suspects.  I did not think it was a great idea to invade Iraq and try to force something on the Iraqi's and I think there should be a greater watch on the other countries that could potentially build nuclear weapons and sell them to terrorist groups... <br>
<br>
I actually see both sides of the arguement and I do agree with some of the other view on the war, but what happened in this prison I believe was done in the best interest of a larger majority.  But I also like to think practically, there are some things that have to be done that break the rules.  If there was no eminent threat, I would be totally against any kind of detention center like this, but this is a different time.  Yea, if we werent in Iraq in the first place doing it the way we are doing, this would not even need to happen, but since we are, I feel that certain things that were being done are justified.<br>

Rubbish.  George Tenet resigned at short notice and his deputy will take over.  The DDO is resigning also, and business goes on as usual.  Standing policies are continued, there hasn't been major upheaval.  <br>
<br>
The fact that no one has even been reprimanded publicly, never mind fired sends the message that nothing has gone wrong.  That reinforces the statements of Al-Qaeda recruiters and will make life difficult for American troops and civilians long after this election.  Good government makes the right decision for the country on issues that important, irrespective of its re-election.  <br>

That's what China says about Tibet, Russia says about Chechnya and indeed what Stalin said about Caucasus dissidents held in the Gulag.  Heck, it was Saddam's justification also.  How is the way these regimes have acted/are acting reprehensible torture, and what the US is doing necessary security measures?  Supporting the reasoning of one condones the actions of all of these regimes, for their justifications are the same.<br>
<br>
I suggest you go back to an earlier post I make on this thread, and with the help of Adobe Acrobat, read the sworn statements of the abused detainees.  Read about *exactly* what happened to them, and imagine how you'd feel if you were an innocent civilian (as in the first statement) and those same things happened to you.<br>
<br>

Those refused bail had their chance to argue a right for bail in a court of law, I said that in my last post.  Can Iraqi civilians assess or challenge the reasons for their detention?  What trial do they await?  Have they been charged?  No, no and no.  It is disingenuous and specious to compare prisoners remanded without bail to Iraqi civilians detained with little or no evidence.  <br>
<br>
Due process is a fundamental prerequisite for a sustainable democracy.  In its absence what you have is a military police state.  If you're ok with a military police state Tomza, then say so clearly.  If you're not ok with such a state, then the detentions are undemocratic, unjustified and should be stopped.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yea its sad that some died, but after some time a lot of them were released<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
They were only released after the photos and sworn statements were published in tandem with the Taguba report.  It shouldn't take a scandal for the occupying power to do the right thing.  The release had nothing to do with a routine discharge, a HUGE number of people were all released a week after the scandal broke.  Remember also, the seven soldiers charged were only charged AFTER the photos were released, despite the fact that these photos were in military files and referenced in the Taguba report.<br>
<br>
There would have been no serious action taken without the photos going public.  That alone should make you question the policy.  Rather than saying they were released- look at *why* they were released *when* they were released and how many were released.  Looking at it in context, it's no longer as simple as you make it out.<br>

<br>
&quot;The possibility of potentially harvesting&quot;....&quot;are believed to hold information&quot;, is that justification in your mind for holding thousands of prisoners incommunicado for 6 months to a year and torturing them?  I've got a better idea- why doesn't the occupying authority just manage the occupation more humanely.  That way we won't have to fucking <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>torture</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it out of people, they'll come forward and willingly tell us.  <br>
<br>
Willing informants is how Qusay and Uday were tracked down, it was how Saddam Hussein was tracked down.  Indeed, the CPA has confirmed that with the exception of those who surrendered themselves, almost every other senior Ba'ath minister was captured as the result of a willing informant.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of the security information you have referred to has been accrued via willing informants and voluntary cooperation.  We shouldn't have to torture people when our best information has come from cooperative sources.  People are being told to come forward, but the fear of torture will drive many to the other side, or silence people that would otherwise cooperate.  As I said, torture means you kiss hearts and minds goodbye, do you concede that?  Or do you think hearts and minds are unimportant as long as a small-scale security goal is accomplished, by any means necessary?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but I know if America pulled out early <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I never said the US should pull out.  Although I opposed the policy of invasion, I feel it would be irresponsible to leave right now.  You said &quot;if America pulled out early&quot;.  Earlier than what?  How long should American troops stay?  &quot;Until the job is done&quot; is a much-used cliche, but when is the job done.  When a democracy is established?  It will take more than a year to train even a skeleton security force.  After security- what about the institutions of government?  They're a major part of democracy after all, and many, such as a department of labor, take years and many billions to establish.  <br>
<br>
What I am getting at is the abysmal lack of an exit strategy, beyond saying &quot;until the job is done&quot;, when no one has the faintest idea what that means.  Any more than when that big &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner hung across an aircraft carrier deck with the President standing in front of it.  Beyond a cheap stunt and political chicanery, that banner and saying &quot;until the job is done&quot; are policy equivalents.  I see no obvious or definite exit strategy nor a justification for its choice.<br>
<br>

So you're essentially saying we should all accept injustice today because there has always been injustice.  If people took that attitude then segregation and apartheid would still be around, Nazi germany would be a superpower and commercial slavery would be widespread.  <br>
<br>
That's why I find the tone of what you say there utterly repulsive to me.  Because at the time slavery was abolished in British and the Commonwealth, people with the same views as you stood up and said &quot;But there's always been slavery in history, what can we do about it?&quot;  All that is needed is for enough people to know a policy is unjust, to express it, and then to do it.  <br>
<br>
That is what democracy is, the idea of democracy cannot begin and end with the casting of a vote at the ballot box.  If it is not a continuous process of engagement with the issues, then we *will* see injustice continue.  But history also teaches us Tomza, that with enough of the right people doing the right thing, injustice is defeated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I think there should be a greater watch on the other countries that could potentially build nuclear weapons and sell them to terrorist groups<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's where I agree with you 150%.  Imagine if the massive human and budget resources poured and still being emptied into Iraq had instead been focused on Afghanistan and counterterrorism.  Just take the 87 billion dollar post-war supplemental, think what 87 billion dollars in counter-terrorism efforts would have done for American and global security.  <br>
<br>
That same security was not served by the Iraq war, but it would be served by spending the money and resources to defeat terrorism and *real* threats, not perceived threats.  Because of failed intelligence and a fanatical faith-based approach to Iraq, billions of dollars and thousands of lives have been wasted.  Perhaps if those billions of dollars and the resources they accrued had been spent on *intelligence* in the first place, the mistake would not have been made.  By intelligence I don't mean torture, but ELINT/surveillance, and HUMINT/tradecraft.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but what happened in this prison I believe was done in the best interest of a larger majority<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's exactly what the Nazis told each other about their &quot;Final solution&quot; too, it's exactly how the brutal excesses of South African apartheid were rationalized too.  Justifying brutality and oppression by declaring it in the majority interest means nothing without understanding what really happens.  Torture creates more terrorists, it alienates the local populace, endangers the lives of Americans, whether soldier or civilian and it's just plain WRONG.  None of the impacts of torture on the balance-sheet, serve a larger majority.  On balance in fact, everyone loses.  You can't justify it morally or strategically, it's a disaster in both senses.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But I also like to think practically, there are some things that have to be done that break the rules<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's another thing terrorists frequently say to justify what they do.  In fact, when devout muslims often tell terrorists what they are doing is against God's rules, they simply reply with what you said.  &quot;Practically you have to break the rules sometimes or there won't be anyone to follow God's rules&quot;.  Both arguments reek of bullshit to me.  <br>
<br>
Murder is murder, torture is torture and brutality is brutality.  You stop believing that and we might as well not be fighting terrorism.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Btw, if you were wondering, I have no strong political stance<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Without going out on a limb, I'd say that condoning the trial-free detention and torture of innocent civilians is a pretty strong political stance.  I'd also say that it is the stance of an extremist and not a moderate.  Simply because moderates seek negotiated compromise and extremists argue that there is only one violent solution.  That's what you're saying- we can't talk to local leaders or promote humane understanding, the only way you seem to believe works is to detain and torture these people.  I'd call that as extremist a view as those fundamentalists who say American power can't be reasoned with, the only way to deal with it is through &quot;glorious martyrdom&quot;.  Bullshit, and bullshit on both counts.  On a quick side note for the less informed- the word &quot;jihad&quot; does not mean holy war, it means &quot;struggle&quot; and the context of its use in Arab vernacular means a &quot;righteous struggle&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yea, if we werent in Iraq in the first place doing it the way we are doing, this would not even need to happen, but since we are, I feel that certain things that were being done are justified<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, let's draw a parallel.  Many extremist but non-militant Muslims (similar to Christian groups that support the Iraq war but refuse to serve on religious grounds)- have said the same thing about 9/11 and the attacks that follow it.  Namely that they wish 9/11 hadn't happened the way it happened, but now that the jihad has begun, they can see the way clear to justify what is being done.  <br>
<br>
You and the extremists who support 9/11 after it happened, have essentially flip-flopped on core values of morality.  You say in peacetime that you would never support such brutality, but you believe current circumstances dictate that brutality is necessary.  Many Islamic extremists say that in peacetime, the killing of innocents is utterly forbidden, but given the threat the US poses to the Islamic way of life after decades of injustice and the Iraq war, and there is a jihad, that they too have to say brutality is necessary.  Both views are repugnant to me, both emphasize fear and icy pragmatism that lead to &quot;justifiable brutality&quot; and the kind of injustice that history will judge unkindly to say the least.<br>
<br>
If our values as a society regarding trial-free detention and torture support such barbarity to greater and greater extents, then there will come a point where the defeat of terrorism won't even matter, since our moral and social fabrics are that much less distinguishable from those of terrorists.  Those who have read Orwell's book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Animal Farm</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->(1946) and understand its significance, I will now remind you of the last two sentences-<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That is what worries me most of all, that enough people with Tomza's views will tolerate torture and abuse as long as they *think* it is serving a useful end.  Either that or simply wallow in apathy saying that &quot;history proves bad things always happen so why bother about anything&quot;.  In that pragmatic and taciturn approval of brutality and barbarism, we see a far more insidious threat to democratic values- the willingness to ignore hellish wrongdoing to serve the goals of a failed policy.  Those have been the hallmarks of brutal dictators since the dawn of time- even the slightest similarity of justification should sicken us,  but the shocking extent of how similar the views are, is what I have attempted to illustrate here.<br>
<br>
Just one last point Tomza- I'm curious to know how you think torturing a majority of innocents serves the innocent majority?  If it is because they might have provided crucial information, they haven't- our best info has come from willing sources.  I can't see another reason you'd think it justifiable.  And perhaps, given that you think it's ok for &quot;imminent&quot; threats, you would consider crime in the US an imminent threat to citizen safety.  Then we could torture any innocent civilian in the US who we felt had information about a murder, rape or the drug trade.  Well if it's good for Iraqi innocents then why not American innocents?  Spread the love!<br>
<br>

PS-Abandon a confrontation, declare yourself the victor and then declare an isolationist stance and rant about nuking people.  Hey, if it worked with as an exit strategy for Vietnam then why shouldn't it work as one for Brotherscale too? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I will just make a few quick points.<br>
<br>
1.  when extremists murdered innnocent americans on the 11th september, did that make americans more or less determined to seek revenge on those extremists?<br>
2.  when americans tortured and murdered innocent iraqis, do you think that will make iraqis more or less determined to seek revenge on those americans?<br>
<br>
For the slow learners out there and those who don't like to follow the links, or read the reports, here are some things that are torture: raping young boys, beating the crap out of people until they pass out, sodomizing prisoners with batons and electric lights, forcing men to perform oral sex on other men, killing prisoners, striking broken legs until the prisoner condemns his god.<br>
I can't believe people are still fixated on these notions that this is just a bit of rambunctious good humour.  <br>
<br>
It seems that, unbelievably, it is necessary to mount an argument that torture is wrong.  It is unbelievable because america for so long as fostered noble ideas on freedom, liberty, bravery.  Why is a country so wedded to this high standing values using such base torture and why are its citizens defending it?<br>
The two defences coming forward seem to be: <br>
1. sometimes you have to play rough to get vital information to save lives.<br>
2.  these guys we are arresting are 'interogatting' are terrorists anyway.<br>
<br>
The first defence is the classic utilitarian/absolutist moral paradigm about the use of torture.  A terrorist has a nuclear bomb which will detonate unless he tells you how to disarm it. Is it legitimate to torture that information out of him to save the lives of so many people?  In this archetypal situation, people generally plump for utilitarianism - that it is better to save the most lives and we should torture.<br>
However, we aren't talkign here about a primed nuclear device.  We are talking about standard intelligence collection.  From what does the imperative to torture spring?  Do we torture muggers or thieves? What about those who drive drunk or speed their cars?<br>
<br>
The second defence makes for some nice circular reasoning.  We only arrest terrorists. You are arrested. Therefore you must be a terrorist.  The Red Cross put out a report recently that 80% of the people arrested where ordinary civilians.  How much irreperable damage does it do to your aims if you torture &quot;innocent civilians&quot;.  Justifying their torture and killing is as obscene as trying to justify killing americans in the twin towers attack.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you waht happens if you torture and kill innocent civilians.  they hate you.  they hate your country.  they join paramilitary organisations who bomb and kill your civilians.  Every time Israel demolishes a palestinian house, they create new martyrs.  Look at britain, stauch ally in &quot;the war on terror&quot;, everytime they perpetuated some atrocity on the irish, a new generation of fighters was born, sworn to kill &quot;the brits&quot;.<br>

Are you high?  9/10 of those statements are corroborated by photos, video footage and the General A. Taguba report, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>a report by the offending agent of abuse</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which corroborates the statements.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But why tell the truth when you can make the people imprisoning you look worse<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yeah, and I'm sure every woman that was ever raped exaggerated her story, I'm also sure that without the video evidence you'd have said that Rodney King was talking bullshit and exaggerating what happened to him.  Here's what I find amusing about your statement- General A. Taguba, a US army general investigating the abuse was a lot harsher in his descriptions of the happenings than the sworn statements of the abused were.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I said that I think it was sad that they were being tortured<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm sure that's of great comfort to prison suspects in all police states everywhere- that a free citizen condones torture but finds it &quot;sad&quot;.  I'm sure that Al-Qaeda and China/Russia are praying every day that more people think like Tomza- it'll continue to make the US look worse than its once high standards, and make Al-Qaeda and these regimes look less bad.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but even then, the torture they endure arent things like having your arms stretched by ropes or anything<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You admit in the thread that you didn't read any of the statements (which as I say have been corroborated)- then you say the torture they underwent wasn't that bad.<br>
<br>
In the first of the statements (corroborated by US military witnesses in the Taguba report, photographs and medical reports)- a detainee had his leg broken by guards.  Then a guard kicked it repeatedly until it fractured contiguously shouting at the inmate to renounce his religion.  In another case a prisoner was sodomized by a guard, in yet another section of the Taguba report (not prisoner statements) it says prisoners were raped.<br>
<br>
Most men or women would rather endure physical punishment to a great degree rather than rape.  I don't think you can speak so dismissively of innocent people being thrashed and raped by a foreign army.  If it was happening to innocent Americans occupied by a foreign power...I think you'd change your tune Tomza, and in a heartbeat.  I don't think that as an American you'd accept the rape, murder, beatings, crawling over broken glass and humiliation of innocent fellow citizens in the name of your security.  <br>
<br>
Now if you wouldn't accept it happening to innocent Americans on a large scale, why would you tolerate it for Iraqis?  And why would you assume they accepted it for their security- they certainly weren't asked.  Why for that matter would you assume that innocent Iraqi civilians would lie about their captors?  The Taguba report doesn't support that, and being an army report it has every incentive to discredit the detainee statements.  Instead it backs them pretty much to the hilt.  <br>
<br>
You're running out of justification for this torture.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They're lying&quot;-  WRONG<br>
<br>
&quot;It's necessary for our security&quot;- If you believe that then you must also openly condone what China does in Tibet, Russia does in Chechnya and what North Koreans do to South Korean military personnel.  <br>
<br>
&quot;If needed, certain liberties can be taken away&quot;-  When those liberties include basic human rights, innocent until proven guilty, and the removal of right to challenge detention, then there is little left that resembles a democracy.  Saying we have to act like a Saddamist dictatorship to establish democracy is also bullshit- acting like Saddam in even the slightest way will doom the policy and the occupation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a moderate, therefore it is ok for me to think this way&quot;-  I find it interesting that Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mao Tse-Tung all considered themselves moderates when asked about terrible human rights abuses.  A political pigeon-hole doesn't justify barbaric behavior.  Any more than a fundamentalist shit proudly calling himself Al-Qaeda excuses the murderous butchery that he condones.  <br>
<br>
I've explained to you that torture accrues no benefit, that there is no plausible justification without accepting the policies of a police state.<br>
<br>
Either you think torture is wrong, or you think a police state is acceptable in Iraq, even though democracy is the goal.  If the latter is your belief then state it clearly- say &quot;Stalin had the right idea, I just want to limit those brutal ideas a little for our security's sake.&quot;<br>
<br>
It'd make the exchange of ideas a lot easier incidentally, if you examined the evidence and defined your stance on brutal torture a bit better.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Read Bollix's post and agree with it totally- he has a way of crystallizing the moral questions raised that I envy.  What he says is regarding Northern Ireland is all true- Bloody Sunday had a far smaller world-wide impact than Abu Ghraib, but its eventual consequences were catastrophic for the security situation.  The same was true of the Guildford Four and the abuses at Belmarsh where *suspected* IRA civilian informants had their faces burned off with blow-torches until they &quot;confessed&quot;.  On that occasion the US stood up and said the right thing- these days, Tomza's views seem more prevalent than ever before, both in government and on the street.  What a terrible shame.  Saddam must be clapping his hands and saying &quot;That's the way lads!&quot;<br>
