of Iraqi citezens, because the fact is none were tortured.  The people who claim to have been tortured (Which has never been proven in a court of law and by which no one has been proven guilty of doing.) were not merely citezens, but suspects and in many, many cases criminal combatants as witnessed by the U.S. forces who arrested them. Due to being overwhelmed the U.S. forces were too far behind to give each criminal combatant a fair trial according to international law.  Ultimatley, the circumstances surrounding Al Ghraib led to the untimely, and might I add unjustified release of nearly all of the criminal combatants in a political &quot;saving face&quot; effort by the U.S. government.  I trust  each and every soldier who arrested an Iraqi criminal combatant far more than I believe the word of the criminal combatant they arrested.  Like someone said earlier, every person detained in San Quentin is innocent if asked.  To assume the arrested parties are innocent, because they said they were defies logic and takes away from the trust we put into our soldiers, who are, in fact, our brothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, sisters and mothers, and first and foremost Americans.  I understand many of you are not Americans and as far as your opinion goes I understand you have one, but could really give a rats ass really.  You can take your anti American bullshit and stuff it WAY up your ass or if you need help I will supply it.  I don't care what reason you have you should not talk any sort of shit about my country, government, soldiers, citezens, nada, just STFU.  I swear to God if I were face to face with any one of you liberal minded fucked up foreigners and I heard you so much as make any sort of negative comments about what YOU think my country is about I'd smack you in the God damned mouth.  It's not your place to judge us, fuck you, mind your own business and worry about whatever fucked up country you live in and why your countrymen likely sell their sisters to become American citezens and move here.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taranna>Taranna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>HiElf Snob</span><br>  Posts: 1117<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/04 5:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2705.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No one can support the &quot;torture&quot; of Iraqi citezens, because the fact is none were tortured<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hooking people up to electrical wires, raping them, breaking bones and witholding medical treatment for weeks- if that isn't torture then what is?  A little snippet taken from the Taguba report, linked just below:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;5.  (S) That between October and December 2003, at the Abu Ghraib Confinement Facility (BCCF), numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees.  This systemic and illegal abuse of detainees was intentionally perpetrated by several members of the military police guard force (372nd Military Police Company, 320thMilitary Police Battalion, 800th MP Brigade), in Tier (section) 1-A of the Abu Ghraib Prison (BCCF)&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war (GC, RTPOW- 1949) describes torture as &quot;sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuse of body and mind&quot;.  Note the striking similarity with Taguba's language- I don't for a moment believe it's a coincidence- not from a senior officer of his experience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>takes away from the trust we put into our soldiers, who are, in fact, our brothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, sisters and mothers, and first and foremost Americans<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you trust your soldiers, how about Maj. General Antonio M. Taguba, author of the already cited Taguba report?<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.agonist.org/annex/taguba.htm" target="top">Taguba report</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
You said that you don't believe what the detainees said about their treatment, you'd rather put your trust in the American soldier.  Well Taguba disagreed with you.  I draw your attention to Sections 7U, 8U and 9U of the Findings and Recommendations part one.<br>
<br>
Here they are directly cited:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;7.(U) These findings are amply supported by written confessions provided by several of the suspects, written statements provided by detainees, and witness statements.  In reaching my findings, I have carefully considered the pre-existing statements of the following witnesses and suspects&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Five of the suspects who have signed written confessions are then listed.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Confessions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Neeeedra, you talk about a court of law- I think those confessions might just stand up.  You know something else?  We'll both be around to see it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;8.  (U) In addition, several detainees also described the following acts of abuse, which under the circumstances, I find credible based on the clarity of their statements and supporting evidence provided by other witnesses &quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Eight specific types of abuse are then listed in the report.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;9.  (U) I have carefully considered the statements provided by the following detainees, which under the circumstances I find credible based on the clarity of their statements and supporting evidence provided by other witnesses:&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
All the names of the detainees who made statements are then listed- I've quoted a number of them on page 2 of the thread.  Taguba says he finds the statements credible based on their clarity and supporting evidence.  So if you trust US soldiers discharging their duty, surely you should trust this one also.  Particularly since he's the senior officer in charge of the findings with access to all involved and the pertinent facts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> (Which has never been proven in a court of law and by which no one has been proven guilty of doing.) were not merely citezens, but suspects and in many, many cases criminal combatants as witnessed by the U.S. forces who arrested them.

<br>
A question- if these forces are overwhelmed and far behind, why are the US criminal suspects being afforded fair due process when thousands of Iraqi detainees weren't?  You are essentially defending the innocence of soldiers that according to General Taguba's report have signed full and free confessions of wrongdoing.  While at the same time all but assuming guilt of the arrested parties.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Like someone said earlier, every person detained in San Quentin is innocent if asked. To assume the arrested parties are innocent, because they said they were defies logic<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I didn't say they were innocent, their military handlers did.  Yes that's right- read the prisoner classification at the top of the first statement that I quote on page 2 of this thread.  Then cross-reference the name and civilian classification with the Taguba report, linked above.  Those who have read the declassified McKinley reports about the detainees murdered at Bagram airbase know that their classification was &quot;militant/paramilitary&quot;.<br>
<br>
It seems the people who arrested the Iraqi quoted in the first statement *knew* he wasn't guilty of wrongdoing.  Both the Pentagon and the ICRC have said that 80% of the detainees were civilians picked up in random sweeps.  Nowhere will you or anyone else find incontravertible proof that these individuals were &quot;criminal combatants&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I trust each and every soldier who arrested an Iraqi criminal combatant far more than I believe the word of the criminal combatant they arrested<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So you'll trust the ones who confessed I take it?  And I assume of course you trust General Taguba's investigation and subsequent report.  Well you must do, he and all his investigative staff are soldiers doing their duty and serving their country.<br>
<br>
Or is it the case that you trust some of the soldiers but not others?  I'm curious about that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I understand many of you are not Americans and as far as your opinion goes I understand you have one, but could really give a rats ass really<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A blatant lie.  If you didn't care you wouldn't have bothered to read past the second page.  If what you said here is true, you wouldn't have written it.  You cared enough to lump everyone who disagrees with you into one category and insult them.  Be obnoxious and petty by all means.  Ignore the facts in good faith.  But don't pretend you &quot;don't give a rat's ass&quot; after saying what you did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> don't care what reason you have you should not talk any sort of shit about my country, government, soldiers, citezens, nada, just STFU<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I laughed the fuck out loud when I read this.  Why?  Because all of my sources regarding detainee abuse are US military sources.  Practically all of the media sources and criticism quoted came from Americans.  Shit, practically every critical remark of policy I made was paraphrased from statements made by US civil servants or former civil servants, civilian and military.  So I guess if what I said is &quot;talking shit&quot; you should probably gather Colin Powell, Richard Clarke, Anthony Zinni, Antonio Taguba and Norman Schwartzkopf into a room and &quot;smack them in the goddamn mouth&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's not your place to judge us, fuck you, mind your own business and worry about whatever fucked up country you live in <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If that's your position, then why did your government order the invasion and occupation of another country?  I suppose they were minding their own business and worrying about whatever fucked up country they lived in!  Turnabout's a bitch when you open mouth without engaging brain first isn't it.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, I'm not judging you or your country.  Your own countrymen are!  Half the US population polled didn't support the policy.  More than half think it's being mismanaged.  Three former CENTCOM commanders (Zinni, Powell, Schwartzkopf) all opposed the invasion.  The White house chief of counterterrorism(Richard Clarke) who served under Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton and Bush Jr. has said the Iraq war crippled the fight against Al-Qaeda.  They aren't &quot;liberal minded fucked up foreigners&quot; at all.  In fact they all served their country courageously, often putting life and limb on the line for the US.  Which is more incidentally than can be said for Bush, Cheney or Wolfowitz.  <br>
<br>
I'm saying the exact same damn thing as they all have.  In fact, I wouldn't even be thinking the way I do, if they hadn't said it.  So, if you think the ideas expressed are unAmerican- then you'd better come right out of that shell and say Colin Powell, Anthony Zinni, Stormin' Norman, Antonio Taguba, Richard Clarke, Bob Woodward and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (Mearis' link page 3) are all unAmerican.  If you believe their opinions make them anti-American liberal fucking foreigners, come right out and say it.<br>
<br>
So how if I simply repeat what they've already said- I'm a &quot;liberal minded fucked up foreigner&quot;?  That's something only an intellectually uncurious hypocrite would say.<br>

(The following appeared in the Durham, NC local paper as a letter to the editor.) Liberals claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war. They complain about his prosecution of it. One liberal recently claimed Bush was the worst president in U.S. history. Let's clear up one point: President Bush didn't start the war on terror. Try to remember, it was started by terrorists BEFORE 9/11. Let's look at the worst president and mismanagement claims. <br>
<br>
FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did. From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year. <br>
<br>
Truman finished that war and started one in Korea. North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,333 per year. <br>
<br>
John F. Kennedy started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us. <br>
<br>
Johnson turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year. <br>
<br>
Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent. Bosnia never attacked us. He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times &gt;&gt;by Sudan and did nothing. <br>
<br>
Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions. Over 2,900 lives lost on 9/11. In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has liberated two countries, rushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Lybia, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people. We lost 600 soldiers, an average of 300 a year. Bush did all this abroad while not allowing another terrorist attack at home. Worst president in history? Come on! <br>
<br>
The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but... It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records. It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Teddy Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick. <br>
<br>
It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!!

For the last time, the war in Iraq has nothing to do with terrorists, and our conflict with them.  There is not one credible link of Saddam and any known terrorist organization.  If you have an example, cite it. Equating Iraq and the &quot;war on terror&quot; simply obfuscates how little real progress we've made in combating Al Qaeda, and in turn actually making our country and the world more safe.  Warring Iraq has increased our vulnerability to terrorists, as there are more pissed off, weapons-trained men in the Middle East with no jobs, and an axe to grind with the US.<br>
<br>
Also note, the complaining about the artermath of the war is not over the length, but rather over the obvious lack of preparation for the real tasks, and the resources that would be required for those tasks.  The truly strong critiques of the post-war planning effort, and the laughable implementation of the same has come from those with impeccable conservative and military credentials.  Anthony Zinni? Taguba? Richard Clark? The Rand Corporation?  Hello?  It must make it easy for you to ignore pertinent criticism by simply lumping the critics into a nice little liberal box.  Sadly, that box does not apply to the most appplicable critiques.<br>
<br>
How did Bin Laden get his start? Thank Ronald Reagan and GB Sr and their funding of the muhjahadeen in Afghanistan for that. And then their failure to clean up after their own mis-deployed covert resource.<br>
<br>
Iran has kicked out its nuclear inspectors,and demanded recognition as a nuclear nation, free from all constraints on its nuclear programs.  The Koreans actually have nuclear weapons (according to our own intelligence).<br>
<br>
The Clinton Rose billing is a nice bit of diversion.  I'll add my own:  which administration had the most criminal investigations, convictions, and indictments for underhanded and corrupt dealings?  Reagan or Clinton?  I'll give you a hint, the man who was president during the time to which I refer did not have the initials WJC =p.  <br>
<br>
Daddy get you in the guard anyone? <br>
<br>
No bid contracts awarded to lottery companies with an officer who got bush in the guard on that company's payroll anyone?<br>
<br>
No bid contracts awarded to a company that our VP had significant entanglements with, and are now under investigation for mis-management and outright fraud? <br>
<br>
Demonizing a man studied in most of the United States graduate schools of business as a prime example of an ethical business leader because he was critical of the administration (Paul O'Neill)?<br>

I agree 150%.  Now wouldn't it be nice if we were at war with terrorism instead of at war in Iraq?  Iraq has shit to do with terrorism, Saudi Arabia is the single biggest producer of terrorists next to Afghanistan.  Their security forces are arguably one of the worst in the region, corrupt and many in league with terrorists.  <br>
<br>
I truly believe in the fight against terrorism, and I think that invading Iraq was the wrong way to go about it.  The Iraq war has created more terrorists- it has diverted crucial military resources from Afghanistan and finding the terrorist masterminds.  Read what Richard Clarke has said and then what was written in the IISS report, linked in this thread.  If you are going to somehow characterize Iraq as part of a fight against terrorism then it hasn't achieved it, it's made it worse.  The unlawful civilian killings in Fallujia a year ago that started the violence there, the Abu Ghraib scandal, the complete and abject failure to accrue intelligence of the insurgency- it's been a disaster.<br>
<br>
If people think creating more terrorists than existed before the Iraq war and orphaning 8,000+ Iraqi children is a mistake the US can afford to make, that's their lookout.  Just don't ask me to share it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Worst president in history?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I never said he was the worst president in history.  If I had to pick one, it'd probably be Pres. Hoover.  <br>
<br>
I simply said he'd mismanaged a foreign military intervention worse than any American president has.  I'll explain why.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did. From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Germany and Japan are free nations today, something was achieved.  More to the point, the success or failure of a military intervention is not dependent at all upon the number of casualties taken.  It depends upon the success of the war, post-conflict management, exit strategy and the matching of the conflict's pre-war goals (read Klausewitz for god's sake).<br>
<br>
On all of those counts save for victory in the original conflict, the Bush administration has failed miserably.  In Korea, something was achieved, South Korea is a free independent democracy.  Vietnam was mismanaged vis a vis exit strategy.  But it did have clearly designed policy goals and more to the point it had popular support on the ground from the South Vietnamese.  There was a definite border, territory was lost and gained, none of these factors characterize Iraq. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent. Bosnia never attacked us.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A blatant lie.  I think what you refer to is Kosovo- and even there you had international support under NATO's humanitarian intervention principles.  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the UNIFOR were both staunchly supported by the UN- France had thousands of troops in the original IFOR, in fact they still have over a thousand.  French soldiers fought in Kosovo- people really ought to check their information when forming arguments.<br>
<br>
  In fact the only reason Clinton didn't seek a UN resolution for Kosovo is that Putin asked him not to force a Russian vote of policy conflict.  In other words, Putin supported the intervention but couldn't vote for NATO troops invading a historic Russian ally because it threatened his then-tenuous position.<br>
<br>
Fact is, Clinton *and* Bush Sr. both got international consensus for every single one of their military interventions, all were achieved successfully and an exit strategy with them.  All I might add in the space of less than a year for both Presidents, I very much doubt Iraq will even be close to governable in that time.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
When did Iraq attack the US may I ask?  Apart from defending its own territory and the operations in Desert Storm, you can't show me a single instance where Iraq has attacked the US.  In fact, it has never used anything other than conventional force on western armies.  Never terrorism, and never WMDs.  That and given as you point out, Iraq fell over like a ripe tomato- shows that Iraq was never a serious threat.  You cannot argue convincingly that a serious, imminent or credible threat was posed by Iraq.<br>
<br>
Iran, North Korea and Saudi Arabia?  Yes, they all pose imminent and present threats, Iraq was an international pariah state with a tinpot dictator.  Saddam could barely keep control of his own nation never mind threaten another one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think you've missed every single thing I've said on the thread regarding this.  You must have so I'll say it again briefly.<br>
<br>
The US has *every* single one of the people in charge of the WMD programmes in custody.  All of the military commanders who knew of them.  Heck, Saddam himself is in custody.  All the scientists have been interviewed out of theatre and have said exactly what they did before the war.  That Iraq's WMD programme was discontinued, what little was left was left in a decrepit state or destroyed.  <br>
<br>
With every single principle instigator in custody and most of them being cooperative, if there were significant stockpiles we would have found them.  More to the point, if there were even a tiny stockpile of unusable warheads we'd have heard about it, such is the administration's desperation to justify the war.  Nothing, zip and nada.  They simply aren't there- the sooner people realize that the better.<br>
<br>
Bumraz also rightly points out that every single major critic of the war has impeccable conservative and military/intelligence credentials.  Zinni, Powell, Schwartzkopf, Clarke, Shinseki.  I find it interesting that those who have actually seen war and conflict- both success and failure, opposed the war, while deserters and cowards pushed it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>President Bush has liberated two countries, rushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Lybia, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Liberated?  Afghanistan, without a proper post-war security strategy is in chaos.  The Iraq war and departure of all but a handful of military forces there have earned Hamed Karzai the moniker &quot;Mayor of Kabul&quot; because most of the south of the country is controlled by the Taleban and most of the north controlled by warlords, particularly Rashid Dhostam.  Al-Qaeda still operate in that country.  A lot has been achieved in Afghanistan, and it was the right war to fight- but Iraq has completely fucked up Afghanistan's post-conflict resolution.<br>
<br>
Al-Qaeda isn't crippled, the IISS report shows that they are strengthened both numerically and in terms of popular support.  Iraq's proved to be the best recruiting seargent for jihadis since the Suez crisis.  The report also says that the nations fighting terrorism have had their power diluted by &quot;belligerent unilateralism&quot;- whereas the unity between Al-Qaeda affiliated groups has been strengthened by the Iraq war.  <br>
<br>
Libya, Iran and North Korea are simply being appeased by the United States right now, aid, relations and trade all being summarily improved (esp. Libya/DPRK) in exchange for a less threatening stance.  North Korea and Iran are essentially blackmailing the United States and the US is paying up.  That is what I call a serious threat, not some shitpot dictator in his own little murky pond.<br>

To all my fellow real Americans, its time for us all to wake up and smell the bullshit we've been fed.  I'm guilty too, I was asleep at the wheel til a few weeks ago.  But our country is in grave danger, and Bush/Cheney have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>increased</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that danger tremendously.<br>
<br>
Don't take my word for it please, just do a few Google searches for your self.  &quot;Bush lies&quot; for example will give about 47,000 hits.  Investigate some for yourself, people from all over the political spectrum say Bush/Cheney have continually lied to us about matters large and small.<br>
<br>
So who gives a shit?<br>
<br>
Well, nobody wants another 9/11, right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Al-Qaida isn't dead, its stronger than ever</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The rate of international incidents of terrorism has doubled since 9/11.  Al-Qaida predicted that the primary US response would be invading and occupying an oil-rich Arab state that posed no threat to us.  The organization has reaped tremendous financial and recruiting benefits as a result.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The US is NOT safer</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Our borders with Canada and Mexico are as porous as ever, our first-responder situation is no better than before.  Efforts to increase intelligence agency efficiency and cooperation have taken a backseat to invading Iraq, which is absorbing all the resources available in the war on terror.  Yet Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Multiple sources have reported that bin Laden may have acquired suitcase-sized nuclear devices</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Is it true?  Who knows?  But isn't that a fuckload more of a threat than Saddam's non-existent WMD's?  Drug dealers smuggle in tons of dope every day.  How hard would it be to walk a suitcase-sized nuke across the Canadian border, for example?  Yet we're spending all of our resources in Iraq, not destroying Al-Qaida or addressing our vulnerabilities.  3 counterterrorism chiefs under Bush have resigned in disgust and a 4th has been reassigned <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>since 9/11.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The next 9/11 could very well be multiple nukes going off near-simultaneously (simultaneous attacks being an Al-Qaida specialty) in several US cities.  And given the Bush/Cheney grab at unprecendented executive power and secrecy since 9/11, added to their recent history of destroying civil rights, we all have good reason to fear the consequences of having Bush/Cheney in office if such an attack came to pass.  I believe it would be the end of democracy in America.<br>
<br>
I'm a real American.<br>
<br>
I will not sit silent while these things happen in my country.<br>
<br>
Personally I'd rather vote for John McCain then Kerry... but Bush/Cheney are too dangerous, too irresponsible, too full of zeal and too lacking in understanding for these times.<br>
<br>

That brings me on to my second point, I really find this argument of &quot;The terrorists hate us even more&quot; fairly silly, I mean how much more than crashing 4 jets full of people into buildings full of other people killing thousands of people can you hate us? I mean before Afghanistan, before Iraq, thats when this happened. I don't think its a question of &quot;hating us more&quot; they already hate us enough to kill us. At what point do you decide to do something about it. The majority of the american politicians now crying foul during this election year are the same ones that voted FOR regime change in Iraq as a policy.<br>

So maybe existent briefcase nukes are more of a threat than non-existent WMDs, I'm sure some would argue that your Intel is as good as the administration had when it made the decision to go into Iraq but isnt that a bit of the pot calling the kettle black?<br>
<br>
I know this will be received quite comically by the Bush haters out there, but um we are slowly finding evidence of WMD, not stockpiles as of yet, but a shell (confirmed to have) a gallon of Sarin gas (one gallon by the way is capable of killing upwards of 60 thousand people, sounds mass to me) has been found in addition to banned Iraqi missle engines that are showing up in neighboring countries.<br>
<br>
Do I think the intel they had was solid? No I don't. Do I think we should have waited for better international support. Probably (but lets face it, after what 11+ years of violations and the UN not enforcing anything, who in the universe actually thought the UN was going to do anything). Do I think the overall outcome is going to be good for the Iraqi people? Absolutely, I am entirely optimistic. But only time will tell.<br>

Oh no, he fibbed about a sexual affair.  Bring out the pitchforks!  Only the most puritanical of people would argue that equivocating about a sexual affair is anything near as bad as, oh I don't know- exposing a fucking CIA agent because her husband gave a truthful report on uranium from Niger?  Or saying that Iraqis will greet Americans as liberators, shower them with flowers, undersizing the force etc?<br>
<br>
Lying about a sexual affair doesn't hurt anyone, it didn't kill 10,000 civilians in Iraq or 7,000 in Afghanistan.  Trying to say that lying about a sexual affair is in any way equivalent to the huge policy blunder of Iraq is disingenuous.  Unless of course, one happens to be a Puritan.<br>

You haven't been reading up on this then.  No one's saying the same people will hate us more, people are discovering strong evidence that there are MORE people who fall into that category as a result of Iraq.  Heck, the State department made a clumsy effort to claim that terrorism was reduced this year, and recently made an embarassing U-Turn.  Perhaps it was a genuine mistake, but it came at an awfully convenient time.<br>
<br>
I'd wager that not one person who's arguing that there hasn't been a rise in terrorism since Iraq has read the IISS(International Institute of Strategic Studies) report on the global state of terrorism.  The report directly links the Iraq war to a revitalization of the Al-Qaeda movement and its affiliates.  Anyone with a brain realizes that cracking down, invading, bombing, and killing insurgents does nothing in the long run to defeat terrorism.  Every successful counterterrorism campaign in history worked on the premise of undercutting popular support for the terrorist cause.  <br>
<br>
Via compassion, not via brutality- because brutality simply makes the terrorists look less bad.  Not to you or me, but to the people who are thinking of joining Al-Qaeda's ranks.  This is so obvious and common sense, but is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The majority of the american politicians now crying foul during this election year are the same ones that voted FOR regime change in Iraq as a policy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Show me one sentence in the Congress Iraq war resolution that said regime change.  There isn't one.  I doubt many of the politicians who voted for the resolution realized exactly what it was they were voting for.  Much like the Patriot Act, little formal debate preceded the resolution, and less than half the members of Congress actually read the resolution before its passing.  <br>
<br>
Having said that, I do think it's disgraceful that some politicians have obviously done an about face.  Much like Bush's about face on multilateralism.  Or indeed, the about face on Fallujiah, where a former Saddam general and former Saddam army troops are in charge of security, or in the south where Sistani's militia are being given police uniforms.  <br>
<br>
If one looks carefully, in fact the three regions of Iraq are beginning to split quite clearly along religious and ethnic lines.  Not in terms of demographics, but real political consequence.  Sunni soldiers of Saddam and one of his generals are being given security tasks in the Sunni triangle, Shi'ite militias loyal to the coalition battle with Moqtada al Sadr's militia in the south, and Kurdish peshmergas patrol the northern security zone.  There is little uniting Iraq at the moment, save for a massive presence of foreign troops.<br>

There is a key difference here, Lehammer hasn't called for military action.  He is simply suggesting that the focus of international pressure and diplomacy should be on the threat of proliferation.  That is, proliferation of KNOWN nuclear stockpiles, that of North Korea, and Pakistan's love affair with selling nuclear material to Iran.  Rather than chasing phantom WMDs via an ill-conceived and incompetently executed occupation strategy, why not simply engage the known stockpiles more forcefully?  The Bush administration has appeased North Korea because of its recently escalated nuclear threat.  Now nations like Iran are rushing towards a nuclear programme because they see nuclear weapons as a road to appeasement and deterrence.  <br>
<br>
The United States adopting a policy of pre-emptive war will encourage proliferation, I said that on this forum before the war.  Iran's belligerence since, and our inability to do anything about it bear out at least some of what I was getting at.<br>

Saying it has the potential to kill 60,000+ people is as misleading as saying that the flu virus has the potential to wipe out the world's population.  Both statements are true, but are fundamentally misleading scientifically.  Factually speaking it was detonated on a roadside and no one was killed despite being in close proximity.  The CPA also said that the shell was used in isolation, wasn't part of a larger stockpile and those who detonated it almost certainly didn't know what it was.<br>
<br>
Also, the shell derived from an Iran-Iraq war era stockpile, so guess who supplied it to Iraq?  I'll give you 3 guesses :P<br>

Those have been around in neighboring nations since pre-Desert Storm days.  So are Iraqi MiGs that were flown into Iran (and summarily captured) and Iraqi towed SSM launchers.  They've been there for over a decade, how are they suddenly evidence of a l33t s33krit WMD programme?<br>

I agree it's too early to say about this.  But surely the real question has to be whether the overall outcome was good for the American people.  After all, they are the ones paying for this war, in blood and treasure.  Did the Iraq war make America safer?  All the evidence says no- Lehammer is right, the wrong target is being focused on while terrorists walk free kidnapping, bombing and killing at will.  Afghanistan has been abaondoned, the masterminds are still roaming freely.  <br>
<br>
President Bush has no constitutional duty to &quot;free people around the world&quot; or &quot;respond to a higher father&quot; as he's said.  He does have a responsibility to the American people for their security- and the war didn't serve that security.<br>

<br>
I disagree, an attack now would rally Americans behind the president and move him up in the polls.  That is just the way Americans are built and it also happens to be our greatest defense against terror.  The jihadists understand this so if they want to get rid of Bush they have to resort to the next best thing(s).  They need to do what they can to break up the coalition ( eg Spain ), force the price of gas higher ( eg Saudi massacre ) and kill people for what they say is retalliation for what happened in Abu Ghraib( eg Berg ).<br>
<br>
It seems clear to me that all of these attacks are designed to aid Kerry and hurt Bush in November.  That is the main reason I am voting for Bush ( I also happen to be a conservative ) and not that red, wishy-washy liberal Kerry that will take us back to the horror of the Carter 70s.<br>

Russian war in Chechnya can be viewed as such example. I mean in theory, I agree, winning hearts of those simple and good Iraqis and arabs with candybars and McDonalds on each corner sounds appealing. However, in practice, it doesnt quite work like that. <br>
<br>
I dont understand why you discuss terrorism in connection to Iraq. War in Iraq had geopolitical objectives, not pre emptive strike against potential enemy and certainly not a goal to cut head of terrorist hydra.<br>
<br>
If USA wanted to war people that support Al Queda, USA would be warring Saudi Arabia, not Iraq.
