Previous Guild History:<br>
(I am using dates from Adepts site, since I can't really remember the timeframes from years ago)<br>
<br>
Jan 2001 - Mar 2001: Thunderblades Heroes<br>
Reason(s) for leaving: Guild Dissolved<br>
<br>
Apr 2001 - June 2001: Knights of No Remorse<br>
Reason(s) for leaving: This is where I met Cusinit initially. <br>
Well, seriously, I took a break for a few months around this time, after graduating and getting my degree/re-locating/starting new job. I think that when I returned I was the only lvl 60 left, with most members in the 40 range. So this was no longer a &quot;fit&quot;.<br>
<br>
July 2002 - September 2003: Celestial Empire (with a few month stint of not being guilded within this timeframe, which was applying to AD)<br>
 Reason(s) for leaving: I will gladly talk to you about this in game, but out of respect for CE and the many friends I still have in it I would prefer not to go into it here. While it is not anything exciting nor drama based, it could still cause some hard feelings with a few people.<br>
<br>
Jan 2004 - Feb 2004: Rum Runners<br>
Reason(s) for leaving: I created this &quot;guild&quot; with a couple of friends who were also unguilded at this time. There was never any raiding agenda, it was just mainly formed for communication between friends. The guild got ganked by Sony for not having enough members. <br>
<br>
Alternate Advancement Points Earned: <br>
Rabastad: 290, Has everything major a shaman should have...Currently working on Spell Casting Subletly Level 3.<br>
Group Leadership: Offense Enhancement Level 4 (became an attack junkie when I started my rogue)<br>
<br>
Gormli: 220, Has everything major a rogue should have...Currently working on Weapon Affinity Level 3<br>
<br>
Are you Elementally Flagged? Partially<br>
Rabastad: Missing Sol Ro flags, so not flagged for Fire<br>
Gormli: Only has flags from PoJ trial and PoDisease.<br>
<br>
Are You Plane of Time Flagged? No<br>
Rabastad: Missing Plane of Fire<br>
<br>
Are You Flagged For Kod`Taz? No<br>
Both characters have only completed the first trial.<br>
<br>
Why do you want to join Ascending Dawn?<br>
Cusinit has been a good friend of mine for years and I would like to experience the adventures that I hear about. I have grouped with a number of current members and have always gotten along well. I would also like to see content that I would otherwise never have access to. AD is the most respected and accomplished guild on the server and wearing the tag would be an honor.<br>
<br>
Play Times:<br>
<br>
Monday through Friday: 7pm CST – 11:30pm CST.<br>
Saturday: Can play anytime.<br>
Sunday: Can play anytime.<br>
<br>
Are you, and have been, the sole owner of your character? If not, please elaborate:<br>
Rabastad was my initial creation in Jan 2001. I then created Gormli in Sept 2003, when I got a 2nd computer. I have been the sole owner of these characters since they were created.<br>
<br>
What other character(s) do you own that would be beneficial to Ascending Dawn?<br>
These are the only 2 characters that I play.<br>
<br>
Do you have Kill-On-Sight (KOS) Issues with another guild(s)? If yes, please elaborate:<br>
I have no KOS issues.<br>
<br>
If you are a server-transfer, why did you transfer to Rallos-Zek? <br>
<br>
Please provide any additional, relevant information regarding yourself, Ascending Dawn, play experiences, etc:<br>
I initially applied to AD in Jan 2003, where Rabastad received his PoP flags.<br>
(can be seen here-- <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessage?topicID=370.topic)">p075.ezboard.com/fascensi...370.topic)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
But due to some RL issues, I had to pull back on my gaming and could no longer raid actively enough to be of benefit to AD, so I withdrew it. (This was the few month unguildment in my CE tenure). In the past 6 months I have leveled my rogue to 65 with 220+ AAs in less than 30 days played. Although I am listing my Shaman as my main, should there be any sort of problems such as numbers/classes of players present for a raid, I am more than happy to just play my rogue, should that be necessary, and assist in any way that is needed. And being a hearty, well fed (and drunken) Dwarf, Gormli is well fashioned to dragging even the heaviest of corpses from under the snouts of the most viscous beasts.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your consideration.<br>

<br>
He also is a very resourceful person and has attained a lot better loot and AA than many  members of larger guilds on our server, most of it on his own.  <br>
<br>
Last time around he dropped out due to rl issues and his greatest concern was that he couldnt commit to being a full time productive member. <br>
<br>
Now he has been  back awhile and since the last time has even lvl'd up a rogue to 220 aa , so I know his passion for the game is not in doubt, or his skill. He routinely solos ldons and even barindu trials, has a cleric alt as well.<br>
<br>
He is very low profile though, and many dont know him due to the fact that he really doesnt make any waves or cause a stir, and he doesnt like to ask for help when he can get things done on his own. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though he doesnt often ask for help, he is always ready to  offer it.  There are also few people I would rather have alongside during pvp.<br>
<br>
Edited to say, Rabastad the shaman will be his main if that was not clear, but he will play both as needed.<br>
<br>
<br>

Rabastad is very low profile, BUT always willing to help.<br>
While in C.E. he was a great asset, Always willing to help and explain things to the up and coming shamans. Seems he has been able to get back in game now and is ready to rumble again.<br>
I wish him the best in his app and in game.<br>

Small update:<br>
Was on the Smith Rondo event, so GoD Trials 1-4 are checked off.<br>
<br>
Rabastad now just needs Trial 5 to get into Kod'Taz. Many thanks to Strydere, Tauntank, Aulwen, and Rakizi for a successful run in Trial 6.<br>
<br>
Gormli just needs Trial 6 to get into Kod'Taz. With thanks to some of my friends in Celestial Empire(Ddensity, Farelorm, Launcealot) for a successful Trial 5. <br>
<br>
So I am real close to being able to make a Kod'Taz+ raid on at least one character before much longer.<br>
<br>
Both toons are now flagged to get into PoEb.<br>
<br>
Had alot of fun churning through some LDON with Cascia and Cilla on Saturday morning and witnessed some impressive 3-boxing by Strydere in a PoE group today.<br>
<br>
It's been a blast so far and I am looking forward to more of the same.<br>
<br>
And thanks to everyone who has been so kind with my multitude of questions  =)<br>

Last night I received a vile threat against my very existence on this server.<br>

[Fri Jun 11 19:38:40 2004] There are 5 players in Halls of Honor.<br>
<br>
** --And guess who is kiting 2 mobs in the graveyard-- **<br>
<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:38:44 2004] You begin to sneak...<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:38:44 2004] You are as quiet as a cat stalking its prey.<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:38:44 2004] You begin to hide...<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:38:45 2004] You have hidden yourself from view.<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:39:18 2004] Gormli scores a critical hit! (870)<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:39:18 2004] You backstab Lokei for 748 points of damage.<br>
<br>
** --lots of boring fight stuff, which concludes with him zoning out and I follow due to catching aggro from his former kite-- **]<br>
<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:41:00 2004] Lokei tells you, 'Why dont you go find something producive to do you iyhwm'<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:41:15 2004] You told Lokei, 'courtesy of your KOS to AD'<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:41:40 2004] Lokei tells you, 'Lol you realize you're an ass kisser right?'<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:42:15 2004] You told Lokei, 'hmm, since i am an AD recruit, their enemies are mine, do you not understand that?'<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:42:59 2004] Lokei tells you, 'Do you understand that you're not AD and you dont even know me? Do you understand that if you dont get into AD I will yckp you up every chance I get?'<br>
[Fri Jun 11 19:43:12 2004] You told Lokei, 'oh nos!'<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I still had the badwordfilter turned on on my Rogues machine, because when he said &quot;you iyhwm&quot; and &quot;I will yckp you up&quot; I doubt he was offering to make me breakfast in bed after a night of sweet, sweet undead necro style lovin', but perhaps I am mistaken?<br>
<br>
Now I fear that I must make a plea for sponsors, lest Legends will soon have a new resident =(  For, surely, this is not a threat that I take lightly, correct?<br>

Oh! And thanks to Baudwin, Grudj, Gaza, and fellow Trial6Less Takon for them spending afew hours with me last night in another attempt on Trial 6. It was so close... But maybe today! <br>
<br>
Still knocking out PoP flags on Gormli when I am able, checked off Terris Thule and Agnarr recently.<br>
<br>
See you at the event tonight, unless my Legends transfer goes through sooner than I expect!  =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaza@ascension10244>Gaza</A></span><br> Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(6/12/04 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=671.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shaman/Rogue Application</span><hr size=1> Was fun even though we didn't beat the boss after trying over and over = (<br>

But, I definately learned a lot &amp; saw a lot of new changes in that script since I won on my 2 toons. GL Getting it today!!!<br>

<br>
I finally got Gormli through Trial 6! Our group first formed at 11AM CST and we went at it for 11 straight hours...hailed the NPC in Tipt at 10PM CST. Wasn't an uber geared group, but it was people uber determined to get it done...and we did =)   Who says Rogues can't tank the boss at the end?! <br>
*Prays to the Gods of /disc Riposte*<br>
<br>
I drug ALOT of corpses in Tipt and now look forward to dragging corpses in Kod'Taz+!  =)<br>
<br>
I wish I could show my face at more raids, but I can't get into Time, unfortunately, and there have been 3 waves of Time raids in the past few weeks. <br>
BUT I have had fun at the GoD raids I have been at. <br>
Well, maybe the Uqua raid where I was the only shaman, had 1 wisdom (thanks zonewide AE) and had 10 groups to buff with fo7/sta/diaku (fo7 took about 70% of my mana pool, with having 1 wis) wasn't exactly the Websters definition of fun, but it was a new experience! =)<br>
