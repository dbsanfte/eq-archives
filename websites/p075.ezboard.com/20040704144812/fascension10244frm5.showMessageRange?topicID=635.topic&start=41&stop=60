Thanks for the threats, I can tell your about as mature as your alts, that is if you were trying to be another personality. Anyone else notice that last post she made sounded identical to all of him/her other personalities. I really do hate to have message board battles with people that have skipped out on taking their meds for several days, I almost feel guilty about it, but not quite. If you would like to try to PK me in game, that's your prerogative, good luck doing that without DT, if you are even able to get me down 75% &quot;/disc trueshot&quot;. As for the other witnesses you say would collaborate her story, I really don't see how, since when our short conversation and Giovann's surname change occurred, it was only myself, Giovann and Aeleleleoeieinaeinaei, so only two people basically. Outside witnesses only come into play after when a group of people were chasing me around PoV committing suicide with undead vassals, which I'm sure they will say I was training vassals around... so don't chase me I guess if you didn't want aggro. <br>
<br>
Now, you are right, I am from a bluebie server, and I am no expert about Rallos Zek politics, you are gifted in pointing out the obvious, &quot;You have gotten better at nothing (1).&quot; I have simply layed out the facts for readers to ponder, and they can make their own decision of what happened. You on the other hand have resorted to name calling and threats, as if killing me in game is going to break me or something. I may not have come from Rallos Zek, but, I have played this game a long ass time, and I play my character well. If you would like to attempt to kill me, do me one favor, back your stuff up, and do it yourself. Don't try to get 20 of your friends to kill me and consider that some sort of victory. The officer in MIM I spoke with sounded very reasonable and mature, I'm sure I can work things up with MIM, unlike any conversation I have gotten on or off these message boards from any of Aeleleoeioneaineeiii's personalities. I would have been more than willing to work things out with this person, even offer an apology just to make him/her happy, but, after the lie's, exaggerations, plain malice, and threats, I am no longer willing to offer any apology for any of this bullshit. This is just a simple case of someone that got pissed off cause a ranger from a &quot;blubie&quot; server PK'd him/her with ease.<br>
<br>
P.S. Is it me, or are those incriminating screen shots not incriminating. They actually back up exactly what I said. You said I told you I was one of AD's recruits, when what I actually SAID was, not ask Semmy to help PK me because I had applied to AD, you can ask Semmy about this. Not once did I use AD as any sort of a threat in any way, but rather to ask you not to ask members of a guild I'm applying to, to help kill me (Since you stated serveral times you needed no help anyway) and tried to coherse me back into PoV to fight again. And I also said this to the gimp mage that was trying to PK me and lost, not the cleric, but we recently found out that was you too. You just showed a screen shot of me saying exactly what I told everyone I said to begin with. Look at what I actually said in that screen shot, and what you said I said. Thanks for pointing out you're a liar and proving it...<br>

I really could care less about the aelilee giovann thing, what concerns me is this attitude you carry regarding the people on this server and how you are conducting yourself here. Just your attitude alone makes me throw up a brick wall toward you.

Of course I am going to defend myself and expose this person for what they really are, and this person, not me, asked for this to happen. I was ready to let it go. I was not the one who escalated this to what it is now. Let me tell you, Alalaieeie never approached me like an adult about anything, ever, she lied about that just as much as she has lied about everything else which was said. She was clearly raging and approached me in a hostile, and threatening manor, and I do not take well to that. If she at any point would have attempted to talk to me civilly. I would have returned the exact same respect. She chose to challenge me and try to scare me with threats using her guild as her tool. I am pretty sure there are other screen shots that were taken, and not being presented because they are even more incriminating for her than the one's she posted. If you'll notice, all three of those screen shots are from the exact same time and the chat is selectively moved to only show what she thought would incriminate me. Yes, I ran out to the undead vassals when they tried to gang bang me, later, I was followed, and the followers also got aggro from other undead in the area. I consider training someone to be pulling a group of mobs to an innocent person that is just standing around not expecting it. Am I not allowed to use the environment in my favor while I am being chased by a group of people?<br>
<br>
I understand I am the new guy, and I should show some humility. I have no problem being humble to mature, civil adults, that do not try to wave their brass balls in my face. Perhaps I got a little carried away with this whole thing, and for those who despise drama, I apologize for that. I have no problem withdrawing my app because of this drama and I have no hard feelings about it. This certainly wasn't a good start by any means. I can understand if this is a conflict of interest being that MIM might still have some problems with me. However if I still have a shot, I will also redo my application to the appropriate format.<br>
<br>
I hope some people will remain open minded enough to not judge me by this non-sense, because I really am not mean, or a bad guy. I only get in flame mode when it is being done to me, however childish it is, I do realize that, but, I am human and do get annoyed as well. I can offer holly cake to make amens with anyone that was annoyed by reading this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alephrzownz>alephrzownz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/14/04 4:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ranger App</span><hr size=1> 1st- i wanted to say that i am rl friends with aaelilie and veninia , and they are 2 separate women. at the moment veninia is living with aaelilie.<br>

DoZ. aaelilie zoned back in and res'ed giovann shortly after looting her corpse ( 10secs or so ) she was attacked Ghal. she was still in res effects when he attacked and instantly killed her. there was no communication in yell's, say's, ooc, auc or even tells at that point that i know of when she <br>
was attacked she said &quot;pk in group then died&quot;. aaelilie res'ed 2nd time then Ghal zoned back in and trained a 4-5 undead vassel's to the graveyard and xp killed giovann and almost xp killed me and aaelilie. i was oor or i would have helped. then aaelilie res'ed giovann the 3rd time. ghal was not in zone <br>
atm so we med'ed for about 5 mins or so then Ghal zoned back in giovann then summoned pet she then sent pet on him and he ran into forrest and trained again. then he meleed giovann and proceed a pet and killed her. then <br>
immediately attacked aaelilie so we zoned. then once we was in PoT aaelilie told him that he was going to be KoS to MiM. then he replied &quot;i will be sure to drop every MiM in every zone he is in.

Hell, you even use the same damn smilely faces in all your posts.  All that, and with the same IP Address, what do you think we are idots?  Dude get a life or something, cus your about the most pathetic MIM I've ever came across.  I cant believe they even guilded you.<br>
<br>
Ghaleonagas, I sort of feel sorry for you, that you actually had such a bad expience.  Think what Fay is trying to say is just because you you my not have been in the wrong, you just cant decide to take it upon yourself to go training and exp killing people as a result.  Two wrongs dont equal a Right.  People on this server frown on that sort of behavoir.  Also, it wouldnt have hurt to had a better additude, esp given you current situation, being new to this server, guildless and trying to make friends.  Lucky for you this moron actually posted in your favor, next time you may not be so lucky.<br>
<br>
Might I suggest the next time you run into this sort of problem, you zone to a safe zone and message an officer of that guild asap.  Think that would have bought a more favorable result for you. And screen shot your own version.<br>
<br>
Becoming KoS to MIM or any other Anti-Guilds will only pervent you from joining ANY other high end raiding guilds on this server, so it does limit your choices, in case you not aware of how things work on RZ.<br>

Ghal, you must surely realize that there is no chance that spewing bile on these boards gives you any chance with our guild or any other raiding force on RZ.  In fact every post written is simply another blow to your (nonKOS) presence on RZ.<br>
<br>
So why not talk to the relevant people in game and be reasonable.  If you don't intend to do that, then you have no business posting on a recruitment forum.  Settle down, think and then act, and in game, not on messageboards.<br>
<br>
Raiding guilds on this server, particularly ours, normally expect nothing less of applicants.  <br>

3) Ghal just shut the fuck up and write a new application. Arguing with the retarded trio from MiM will only make you look bad. Tell an AD officer your story, if you haven't already been declined and let them decide what to do.<br>
