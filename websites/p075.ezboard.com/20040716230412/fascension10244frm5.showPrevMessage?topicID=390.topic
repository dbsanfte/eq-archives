<br>
I have seen so much corruption, betrayal and inhumanity as I have on this server, but that must be what makes it so special when you meet the good people. They have to be the best of the best to maintain that balance that makes it worth while to play here.<br>
<br>
I still concur that Ascending Dawn is the best at what it does but I have to question just what it does. Meeting or knowing some of you has been a pleasure and will not change. Thank you Awfal for being kind to me when answering my questions, Praxx for always being just a good guy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Faamarkii and Markus for being helpful and kind. Evilshadows for being my friend. Cusinit for just being the good guy he has always been since KonR days. Deedlite for always being able to talk where she and I could work things out even when on enemy status, (just a cool person). Lastly but not least Suma for your kind words which I hope are not held against you.<br>
<br>
I am so sorry for having wasted Ascending dawns time. I was looking for a family and I am sure you are to your own. I have seen you forgive former kos and  give a chance to those even coming totaly unknown from a different server. But the total intolerance shown here for nothing more than a personality conflict shows me I would never be guilded with some of you. I am not assuming I was ever going to be given the chance. I am however thankful for being shown I am not big guild material because I can never forget there are real humans behind these pixels.<br>
<br>
The guilds that lead this server on their loot quests have proven to be the most inhumane of all. It is a shame this game is based more on that than people. I can go without loot forever if that is all there is to it. As kaminie so aptly put it in her post &quot;to lead is to serve&quot; The 3 world powers on this server have shown me nothing but their ability to bully and talk about one another behind their backs. Most of the people that manage to get into one of these guilds are those that wish to bury their pride for the sake of loot. Like Kaminie's post points out. When in one of these guilds we all see the corruption and cruelty and chose to look the other way for the sake of our beloved loot connection. I had truely in my heart believed that Ascending Dawn in it's quest to be the best had also become the best in these other areas as well.<br>
<br>
The first time I ever met Pyro he was a bully, he still is a bully and I have to feel sorry for whatever happened to make him only feel enpowered when he is being a bully. Especially when it is a pixel. I don't hate you Pyro you are just a child and I hope you ascent into adulthood turns you into a more tolerant and compassionate person. Your lack of maturity and pure ignorance was so blatant that it would be impossible for me not to feel sorry for you. It took more guts for Neo to ask to discuss problems with people that may have had a problem with him than it did for you to start your arrogant name calling.<br>
<br>
As for Impackt I really had no problem with you and tried to point out that you are not a random pker but you are indeed a pker. Actually a more cowardly one than a random because at least with them you know who you enemy is. Your own post bears out that you did indeed train us and then held a grudge for several months and did pk us. I am not angry about it and actually had fun with it. You claim you are one type of person when in reality you are another. Your wailing woe is me I am not a pker is a joke, what it should have said is I am not a pker when it serves my purpose but should I have a problem with you I will indeed gank you root to exp loss you or any other cowardly thing I can think of as long as I do not have to admit my own ineptness at playing this game. <br>
<br>
I wish to apologize to the Ascending Dawn Leadership and general membership for bringing this to the AD boards, it was never my intent. But as I said I do stand up for what I believe in. Neo was attacked unjustly and humiliated by a little punk who thinks running over people in pixel form makes him so good when in actuality he is nothing but pathetic. <br>
<br>
Having said all this I withdraw my application for membership.<br>

<br>
Plus the fact you want to start over with a top raiding guild,<br>
but you expect it to be easy. Like we will open our arms to 2 folks that might not even help the guild but could cause more problems. There are reasons you left your guild for another, you might want to ask yourself that questions, why? And also look at AD perspective, why do we have to accept you guys?<br>
<br>
You kinda need to be thick-skin, able to hold criticism and able to field all these questions from folks that have issues with you in the pass. If you can work out the differences, then folks might warm up to you. Being friends with a few AD members doesn't mean everyone will happy to hang with you guys. Not everyone have the same experiences (good vs bad) on this server.<br>
<br>
There's reason for this issues, you think people can forget and move on? If folks all forget and move on, there won't be anything left of this game to play for.<br>
<br>
People coming from other server wanting to have a new start might have it easier because there's no history of incidences to associate with them. That's not something we can control. AD are open to all applications, doesn't mean we have to accept and let everyone allow to be guest just cause they wrote some words on a message board.<br>

<br>
Hate to point out the obvious here- but if you're going to apply to a big guild after having just left another one, you've got to expect people voicing their concerns, and be able to deal with people who have a problem with you.  That requires having a thick skin, if a little spat on a message board deters you from a game environment, then I fear you're too sensitive for the world of the internet and online gaming.<br>
<br>

With all respect, that's utter nonsense.  Guilds have gone to war several times on RZ and this might be suprising to you- it's rarely been loot that started it or drove it once it got going.  Here's another bit of news- most of the people who joined AD, be it from Sabbat or afterwards didn't join for loot, but because of friendship.  I applied to join primarily because of friends I knew beforehand personally (Cascia, Temel, Sallox) and by reputation.  Oh there were other reasons- increased level of challenge, new content to explore etc.<br>
<br>
Simple truth though- gear outside of FT doesn't make much difference on a caster-class.  My corpse has poofed once or twice and I was able to play just fine.  We have a number of melees, two of them monks that pull on raids- who play clerics pretty darn well on their second box with absolutely laughable gear.  Heck, I've seen Warhoundt 3-box himself as main-tank, chanter on mezzes and a cleric healing rampage at difficult encounters.  The game isn't a hard one to play, what brings people back to the login screen are people and progression.<br>

That's hilarious haha...Pyro's possibly the most bullied member of AD- in jest of course.<br>

That's possibly the most ingratiating, patronizing and pontificating tone I've heard used in a while.  And I live in England, so that's saying something :P  If pontification is indeed your language though, here's some advice:<br>
<br>
Playing the victim through prevarication isn't the most credible way to approach a game.  It's ungracious and a disservice to one's enjoyment in playing it.  Simply put, you have no right to pass judgement on a person's character based on how you played a computer game with them.  Certainly not on a public messageboard.<br>
