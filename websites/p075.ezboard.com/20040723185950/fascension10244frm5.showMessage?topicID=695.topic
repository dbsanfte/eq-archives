I feel that the best way to get to know possible future guildmates is to play with them &quot;in-game&quot; so I'm going to try my hardest to do just that.<br>
     Anyone that needs a cleric for any reason, don't hesitate to send me a /tell.  If I'm available I'll come a'running.  <br>
     Looking forward to meeting you guys!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Below Is the character info&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
65Cleric<br>
Drattsab (character name)<br>
89AA's for the time being<br>
<br>
Currently I'm in Aeternus Consilium, I could not leave them at the moment until I knew for sure that I were accepted into AD after my App. because I would not want to leave them and then be denied from AD.  (It would be pretty low IMO to leave a guild for another, then come crawling back when you were rejected.)<br>
<br>
Not tagged for elementals yet (need bertoxx and mithmarr still)<br>
<br>
Not tagged for time<br>
<br>
Ive completed the 6th GoD trial but none of the others yet.<br>
<br>
Since this is not an application, I did not fill out all of your information...When the time comes I'll fill out a proper App. and post it.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys, can't wait to group!<br>
<br>
(also, if you guys need to know more about me prior to me posting the app. just ask me in game, im on after about 5/6:00 pm eastern time during the week, and usually any time during the weekends. Thanks.)<br>

I would be willing to leave them to apply for AD if it is a requirement, but I would not just /guildremove without a proper explanation, so it may take a few days.  <br>
(I feel like I would owe any guild at least an explanation.)<br>
     <br>
&lt;&lt;About the owners&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
     1: Kamaa<br>
<br>
Kamaa owned the account, and played the toon to supposedly level 51.  Then, *gave* the account to a person named Salvedor.  (I am currently speaking with Kamaa in game, as he is on my friends list)<br>
<br>
     2: Salvedor<br>
<br>
Sal leveled the toon to level 65, and got him some AA's.  About 2 months ago he decided that he was going to quit EQ.  I contacted Sal when I realized he was selling it, I made an offer on the account.  When he accepted my offer, I became the new (and final) owner of the account.<br>
<br>
     3: Me<br>
<br>
I am an experienced cleric player, and have enjoyed playing a cleric at various different times during my EQ career.  I played a warrior on quellious server, then when I *quit* EQ, or (since I'm back again) *took a break* from it, I sold it.<br>
After my return, about 10 months to a year later, I started over, with a monk.  After leveling the monk to mid 50's, I started to long for the cleric class again--and decided to put the money I had made from my old warrior, towards this toon.<br>
I'm glad that I decided to play a cleric again, because I have realized that it is by far my favorite class in EQ.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any more questions about this toon, they can contact me in game right now, I'm logging on as I type.  Its about 8:40 pm EST time so catch me online if you want.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your time,<br>
<br>
Dratt<br>
<br>
Also: I would like to meet you guys to meet me online before you think that, because I'm not the original owner, I'm not skilled at the class that I play.  I will answer any questions one-on-one so if you have any, just /tell drattsab and I'll be more than willing to take some time out to speak with any of you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rzdratt>RZdratt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(6/15/04 9:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> KOS issue</span><hr size=1>      As far as the KoS issue with CE, I am working things out with Kamaa, and making things right with him, since it seems that he was somewhat taken advantage of here.

<br>
AD doesn't simply accept people once they post an application. There is a long recruitment process.<br>
<br>
Your application will not even be considered until you leave your guild. Once you're unguilded, you can begin the recruit process (assuming you're allowed to; most people are unless they have a lousy background). You'll be an unguilded recruit for a few weeks, after which time you may be guilded... or you may be rejected based on your performance as a recruit.<br>
<br>
Leaving your guild to apply to AD is a risk you have to take. If you're afraid of being rejected then you shouldn't be applying in the first place. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/17/04 1:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dutroka>dutroka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(6/17/04 7:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KOS issue</span><hr size=1> YEAH!! what he said Ive been rejected twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Also , people who sell accounts usually end up doing it again and AD isnt in the business of investing our time and the years of success it took to reach this stage so that you can increase the worth of your character.<br>

Which is a far stretch from even being your character to begin with.  <br>

Anyway since you dont meet the requirements and this isnt an official application I will give you an unofficial denial.<br>
