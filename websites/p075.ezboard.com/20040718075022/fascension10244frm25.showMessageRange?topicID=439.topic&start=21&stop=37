Thought maybe this was a discussion/opinion thread (no flaming, just discussion). The world would be a awfully sad and boring place if everyone thought the same and all liked the same things, would it not?<br>

Oh and as for your question.....if I had a few hundred million $ to spare, maybe I woulda done just that. It's just my edjucated (bet I know the story better then J.R.R's sellout POS son Chris) that the story could have been done by the books...intact, without making half of it up and STILL would have made as much $ AND wouldn't have J.R.R rolling in his grave at the way his beloved characters were twisted into someone (and something) they werent meant to be.<br>

There were so many better fantasy books out when I tried to read LotR, Riftwar Saga, Wheel of Time, the first Dragonlance books...after reading those, couldn't trudge through Tolkein.  <br>

I think the movies do a great job of cutting out the page after page of crap Tolkein did to explain the simplist of happenings, and elevate it to Classic status.

LOL you are one bitter mofo, calling his son a sellout, thats choice.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think you would have been a good choice to make this movie for New Line. If you kept it pure to the books you would lose alot of the people who are seeing the movie now that weren't fans of the books or those that had never even heard of them to start with. They actually have to do this thing called making a profit and I think they did a damn good job representing the spirit of the book, while adding enough commercial pow to draw a crowd.<br>
<br>
I've read the books on numerous occaisions myself, and I thought the trilogy represented the spirit of the books fantastically.

Yeah, that would have drawn a lot of visitors, one gigantic 10 hour movie with a bunch of added crap like Tom Bombadil that only Extreme Tolkien fans want to see.<br>
<br>
I'm not a filmmaker, so I won't comment on what works on screen and what doesn't.  Jackson's an experienced film maker.  If he could have told the movie exactly according to the book, and still guaranteed a large enough audience and a movie that appeals to general audiences as opposed to 40 or 50,000 obsessive Tolkien fans, I'm sure he would have.<br>
<br>
There's a reason novel adaptations NEVER follow the books exactly, and that's because what works on paper doesn't always work on film. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#333333>(12/18/03 1:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> d</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I already stated that for a casual fan of the books or someone that never read the books, it would be a great movie, but a purist like myself was left wanting big time.

Movies aren't made to appease fans. They're made to make money.  This film wasn't made for Tolkien fans, it as made for a general audience.  If the Tolkien purists can shell out 1 billion dollars in ticket sales, I'm sure you guys can find someone to make a movie exactly as it occurs in the book.  Jackson can't simply do whatever he wants when he's working with the largest budget in film history.  Studio execs give him that budget, and pay him to do a job for them.  They don't pay him to be accurate, they pay him to make a great movie that millions will go see. The fact that the movies are so hugely successful AND they get good reviews, is a bonus.  <br>
<br>
I'd say about 95% of the people that saw this movie so far have been extremely content, and the movie has garnered a ton of critical acclaim.  I can't think of a single film maker who would do something different.<br>
<br>
However, I still don't see how a film can ruin the book.  Unless you can't read the book again without thinking about the movie maybe?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isil001>Isil001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(12/18/03 1:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: d</span><hr size=1> Bitter?

putting in extra stuff i don't really see the point (ie, the elves in helms deep, bringing frodo to osgiliath etc).  why was it necessary for frodo to tell sam to feck away off home?<br>

I just wish Sam reacted differently.

I've read the trilogy twice and save for a few deviances, the story was right on.  Although I really was hoping the Saruman/Frodo fight and the whole scouring of the shire chapter would make the final cut.  The scouring of the shire was an important theme in the book.<br>
<br>
BUT WTF?!?!  Who decided to make SLOTH from GOONIES the fricking ORC CAPTAIN in the battle for Minas Tirith?  Everytime I saw that one eyed freak I would laugh thinking SLOTH made it to the big screen AGAIN!  For your recollection, here's sloth...or is it the ORC CAPTAIN????<br>

Hahhaa, I thought the same thing!   Saw it yesterday and I was not disappointed.  Truly the Wizard of Oz of our time, was an amazing piece of film-making.<br>
<br>
Some nitpicks:  The &quot;Sam as spurned lover&quot; scene was a little much.  They started getting on my nerves with all the crying and shit (and I love smalls!).  Aragon singing?  Egads.  Couldn't he have just spoken in elvish?<br>
<br>
The army of the undead, &quot;The Legolas scene&quot;, catapulting of the heads, Eowyn meets the Witch King, and of course the return to the Shire were all highlights.  Very satisfying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://malhavok.50megs.com"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Malio Mourningwood</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->/<br>
