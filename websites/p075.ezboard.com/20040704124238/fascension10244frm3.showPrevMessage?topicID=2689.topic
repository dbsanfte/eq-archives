Serraghost *smile* thanks for agreeing with me...does that mean you won't pk me any more?<br>
<br>
Yes, you are correct.  Gilmour was never guilded.  I deleted him after he starved to death from no food.  Thats right...On day 1 of everquest being released you could starve to death.  I think he made it to level 5.  You asked me what my first character was and I told you.  The next 3 were never guilded.  Tohkrah is my 7th character and is the first one Ive had in a guild.  THe other's I wont mention because the asshole who bought them from me tarnished their names.<br>

Kelgar killed an ex-Curse, whom you knew to be KOS, and then killed a sold AD toon(Kainen), which I gather was a surprise.  Two possibilities: either one of your folks fought back at some point, or Kelgar killed your group for being grouped with two KOS. Grouping with one KOS could be a mistake, grouping with two would make killing your group understandable.  Did I miss something?<br>
<br>
Those two characters will remain KOS. Your entire guild will be KOS, as per AD's officers, if you don't de-guild them.  This is pretty simple stuff.  Further belligerent, semi-literate posting on your part will not change this situation for the better. <br>

<br>
as i said in another post... for someone who is from RZ and has played on RZ from day 1 you really have no fucking clue how the server works or why it works the way it does..  (which is  very hard to believe.. because i knew how it worked years ago.. when AD and their allies were fighting PB for control of the server.. - which was well before i joined AD.. or was even in range of the combatants.. i believe i was roughly lvl 30 at that time having started about 2 months before velious came out..  i didn't know anyone involved in the war, but i knew about it.. and when PB lost, i knew what it meant for the server.. victory to AD's and their allies' views on how the server should run..  those views are still around as are quite a few people who fought in that war..  it is partly because of these views and the consequences of them that another PB hasn't arisen..  <br>
<br>
what does this mean for you?  it means we take a harsh view of some types of actions.. pking being one of them..<br>
to get off kos in the past many players had to play a large amount of plat, and sac down to lvl 45..   AD isn't as harsh as it used to be...  <br>
<br>
now then, back to the issue that started the whole thing.<br>
<br>
an AD officer, on an alt character, notices 2 KOS in a single group of players.  that officer (atsuko, on the character of kelgar) attacks the two players..  your guildmates have been told to not defend 1 of the kos, but know nothing about the other kos person... this said, it would make sense for them to defend the other kos person from kelgar as they do not understand the reason for the attack.  having offered us no proof that they didn't defend one of the KOS people in group, i shall fairly safely assume that they did defend their groupmates..  however, this act of defending a person who is KOS to AD puts their own safety at risk and they become valid targets to kelgar.  you have offered no proof they didn't attack kelgar in return due to his attack on the 2 kos people.  (they probably did, but i'm not going to make an issue of it, defending the kos is enough for my point.)  (i have no proof that they did defend  the kos person/people, but you wanted logic to prevail here, and i'm showing you logic.)  kelgar seeing the group defending the kos person/people makes the decision that they are all valid targets for killing due to their actions in defense of a person/people KOS to AD.  its a rational decision that most people on the server would make.  someone defends KOS people you can kill them.. happens all the time.  your guildmates/the rest of the group got caught up in the middle... that simple.  <br>
<br>
you can learn to deal with it, or you can come here and accuse an officer in our guild of &quot;acting self righteously and out of order by killing the rest of the group&quot;  and call the action BS and say we are full of crap.  Kilyin's first response to you was rather tame, he didn't insult you, make fun of you etc... you were offended by it though and took it as him talking down to you.. so you lashed out.. - not a good idea..  the whole thing went downhill from there... it became very humorous to us, especially the &quot;10 - 4 asshole&quot; line..  <br>
<br>
you started the thread on the wrong foot..and you made the whole situation worse for yourself and guild..  now your guild is KOS because you were an idiot and flamed our officers on our message board....   here's a helpful hint.. if you want to calm down a situation and use reason, don't use phrases like &quot;10 - 4 asshole&quot;.. or make inflammatory remarks about the other person involved..  if instead you want to make the situation worse for yourself, by all means, follow the path you did  in the other post.. oh, and listen to serraghost..  always good advice coming from her mouth.... assuming you want to be thought a general idiot...  or you could take lessons from insidiot/tareslayen(however the fuck you spell it).. I'm sure you could find some helpful posts on the LV board by him..   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=99608" target="top">Daetien Beyazid</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
