I've had nothing but trouble with cyberpower and they're getting lots of posts all over the internet about their horrible service because they sell really cheap pc's and apparently a good majority of them don't work at all or don't work as intended. This is my story with them:<br>
<br>
I bought a computer from Cyberpower, INC. I got a 2.6ghz intel, 4 256mb ram sticks, 80gb hd, p4p800 asus motherboard cpu from cyberpower in mid-2003. I already had a nvidia gforce 5200 128mb video card, my own win-xp pro, creative labs extigy(usb) sound card, microsoft wireless desktop keyboard and mouse, and a softk56 pci modem which I installed on arrival. The reason I bought this computer was for online gaming. It came in and I was in HEAVEN because I had my new gaming system.<br>
<br>
I had to disable the on-board sound card because I was using the extigy. I use the on-board network with my cable modem. <br>
<br>
The problem is, when using my cable modem and playing memory-intensive online games such as everquest or warcraft3 I sometimes(often at least 20 times an hour) get a short &quot;scratch&quot; sound out of my speakers upon which I will immediately get lag in the game I'm playing. In warcraft3, it isn't very easy to tell unless the game actually pauses for your lag to go away which it does almost always, but in everquest it is much easier to tell because they have a connectivity meter which tells your ping and percent of packet loss. When the scratch sound goes through, the packet loss meter will go sometimes up to 50% and 9 times out of 10 go back to 0%. Other times, I will lose the connection completely and have to log back onto the game. <br>
<br>
When using my pci modem for dialup, I get the scratch sound often, but it doesnt necessarily coincide with the lag issues, the lag is almost constant no matter with the sound or not. I can be playing either everquest or warcraft3 and get constant lag. In WC3, I cannot even play a game because the game constantly pauses to wait on my lag to go away. In everquest, I can play but my packet loss meter is constantly jumping from 0-10%, 0-20%, 0-30%, etc. all the way until I get total packet loss and lose connection to the game, having to restart the game. One interesting note which will be followed by another is that when I open internet explorer while playing everquest( i don't do it in warcraft3 because I can barely stay in the game without being booted) the scratch sound almost immediately follows the opening of IE and 9 times out of 10 will immediately cause me to lose my connection to the game and be disconnected. The interesting part about it is how when that happens, I will lose any connection I had to the web for a sometimes short period, sometimes long, and sometimes completely resulting in having to redial and reconnect to the internet.<br>
<br>
I called the cyberpower outsourced tech support about this a few weeks after I got the computer(I'm fairly computer-savvy and tried to find a way to fix it myself or at least find the problem by looking around on the internet for similar ones) and after going through multiple trouble-shooting options, they believed it was my modem. I told them how I tried(which i did) using different modems, and in different pci slots and had no different results. After going through about two weeks of trying their trouble-shooting options(if you call them, they take a message and call you back sometimes days later, you can't get directly connected to anyone by calling, they have to call you back) they believed that it must have been my motherboard, so they had cyberpower send me a new one. I talked to them about getting an on-site technician to come, they said they would get in touch with someone in my area and have them contact me. After a week or two, I had heard from no one. I called them and asked what the problem was and they gave me a number to call for the local technician and said they hadn't heard back from him. So I called only to be told by the technician that he had replied to them telling them that their price for on-site repair was too low and that they were wanting to pay around $50/hour maximum in their email and that he replied saying it was too low because his company didn't normally do on-site jobs. I called the tech support back and told them this, they claimed to have never received a reply, so I told them what he said and they said they would get in touch with another technician in my area and call me back. After a few days of not receiving a callback, I called and asked what the problem was again. I was told they had gotten in touch with a technician to do the repair and he was supposed to call me. I got his number and called him. When I called him, he was only willing to do the repair if he could do it that day and right away. I agreed and he came to my home and did the repair, only he didn't plug something back right because the turbo light on my case doesn't light up at all anymore. <br>
<br>
Regardless, my new motherboard was installed so I was happy until I tried to play the games online and had the exact same problem as before with no improvement whatsoever. I called the tech support back and told them, they said to take all of the ram sticks out and try running the games only using one stick at a time and rotating them out to see if any of the sticks by themselves would work without the lag issues. I did this and all of the sticks had the same problem. So they said it must be my modem, insisting that because it wasn't shipped with the system and therefore wasn't included in the original testing of the system before shipping it out. (Keep this in mind...the original testing of the system before shipping it out and that they were saying my modem wasn't tested. More on this later)<br>
<br>
So I said alright, I'll go buy a new external modem and see if it works. Went immediately to office depot and bought a creative labs modem blaster external modem. Plugged it up and went to install the drivers for it, but when it was installing the drivers, the computer restarted automatically. I thought that was weird until I tried doing it again about 20 times and each time the computer restarted. I remembered reading about hyperthreading having a problem with modem drives sometimes, so I disabled hyperthreading in bios. Once again, it restarted when trying to install the drivers. I called creative labs tech support and they had me go through several trouble-shooting problems and nothing worked. Their official take on the issue after talking to several other techs was that it is a hardware problem because the system isn't allocating enough resources or is allocating them incorrectly. (I don't know much about what they're talking about at this point.) I returned the external modem to get my money back.<br>
<br>
At this point, I had exited HEAVEN and fell down to PURGATORY. Sorry, but this is a good way to describe my general feelings about the computer and cyberpower. My feelings had gone from being incredibly happy about getting my system to incredibly agitated at this point.<br>
<br>
I called the cyberpower outsourced tech support and told them what happened and they said they had no clue what the problem was because they had tried everything they knew and had never had this problem before. They told me to call cyberpower tech support. <br>
<br>
This is where I exit Purgatory and begin to pack my bags for my travel destination which is HELL.<br>
<br>
I call the cyberpower tech support and someone answers on the first ring. I was thinking how awesome they actually answer their phones with a real person and begin working with you right away. I explained my problem and how the outsourced tech support had no answer and told me to call cyberpower tech support. The tech(if you want to call them that) began to go spout off some things I should try to do, all of which had been tried before with the outsourced tech support. I told him I had already tried that and nothing worked, even had my motherboard replaced and no improvement. He began to insist that I had damaged the computer somehow and caused it to no longer work correctly. I laughed, thinking he was joking, but he was serious. I explained all the steps I had taken and he then told me that since I didn't buy the modem from cyberpower, it wasn't under warranty. I explained the problem once again for him to understand since he wasn't listening the first time apparently. He said he had no answer and he would give me an RMA number to send the computer in so they could run some tests. I said OK fine, and asked how long it would have to stay there, he said the maximum is 3 weeks. He refused to pay for the shipping to send in the computer at which point I became somewhat angry and began to get a little &quot;snappy&quot; I guess you could say. He agreed to pay for the shipping and sent me a UPS shipping label.<br>
<br>
I shipped the computer back to cyberpower and it was there for two weeks, then I called to check on it. The RMA department told me they were really busy and hadn't had a chance to check on it, I said that's fine, but you have one more week to do it because I was told that it would be there a max of 3 weeks, to which he agreed. I called back the next week and they said they had looked at my computer, but needed my permission to format the hard drive so they could install their own XP OS to test it out. I told them it was ok to do that. So i called back two days later, the end of the 3 week period and was told they had run 3dmark, a benchmark program for games, and everything ran fine. I said Ok that's cool, now what about my problem. He said the benchmark program proved I had no problem. I laughed, thinking he was joking, but apparently he wasn't. He said the computer was fine, I asked about the online lag issue, he told me and get this quote....&quot;We have no way to test online issues because we have no online access.&quot; I said what did I send my computer in for, he had no answer. I asked how he planned to test the problem of not being able to install an external modem, he said he would run more tests, I asked him what tests, but he couldn't answer me. He just told me they had replaced the ram, the hard drive, and was going to replace the processor. I said well since you can't seem to test my problem, replace the processor and send the computer back to me. He agreed to send it back within a few days, I said no, replace the processor today and send the computer back tomorrow. He said that wasn't possible. I asked why and he said he had no way to assure a product could ship out on a friday. I laughed again, thinking he was joking, but he wasn't. I said ship it friday or send me my money. He said it would ship out on friday. I asked him what kind of compensation I could receive if the computer came back un-fixed, he said that wasn't his department and that I'd have to call sales for that information. <br>
<br>
I got the cpu back a few weeks later, but did it work? No. Same problem as before. I called sales to see about some compensation for having been shipped a non-working computer 6, count them 6, months ago and it still doesnt work after having shipped it back to them. I told them that I would accept the computer and it's non-working but would like to receive some monetary compensation in a percentage of the price I paid for it, or else a full refund. They said they couldn't deal with that in sales, that I had to call the tech support line and ask for Eddie. Wait a minute, the person I talked to who told me to call sales was in tech support. I told her that and she said she had no clue why he said that, but I needed to call Eddie on the tech support line. <br>
<br>
So here goes, I called the tech support line and after calling about 30 times trying to get a ring instead of a busy signal, I finally get a ring and ask for Eddie. The person waited about 10 seconds silently and then informed that Eddie was on the phone and could only receive messages and would call me back. I told them I would hold and wait for him to get off the phone. My mistake...I was left on hold 30 minutes and no one answered. I hung up and began the ritual of trying to call as fast as possible so I can get a ring instead of a busy signal. After another 30 minutes of getting busy signals, I finally get a ring and ask for Eddie. I was informed once again that he is on the phone and can only receive messages, I asked how long he had been on the phone and the person told me about 20 minutes. I reminded her that I had been on hold for 30 minutes before waiting on Eddie and that I wasn't going to leave a message or be put on hold, that I wanted to talk to Eddie now. She said ok and about 5 seconds later, I was talking to Eddie. Funny how that works out. Anyways, I informed eddie of my proposition about a monetary compensation or refund, he said his company didn't work like that and I couldn't receive a refund. I told him how it had been 6 months and my computer still wasn't working, it didn't work upon arrival, and that I then wanted my money back in full. He said he couldn't do that and asked me to send in the computer again to let him look at it. I asked him how he planned to check on my problem if they had no online access, his reply was and this is an exact quote....<br>
<br>
&quot;We have online access to check problem. Please send computer in along with 3 or 4 games you play. We will need game CD's to check problem. If we see problem, we fix it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I informed him that if he was telling the truth about online access, then his tech support person had lied to me saying they didn't have online access. He said he didn't know why they would say that. That seems to be a common phrase at cyberpower, &quot;I don't know why they would say that.&quot; I told him to send me a shipping label so that I could ship it back charged to cyberpower and he sent one to my email. I don't have stickers to print out a shipping label sticker. <br>
<br>
6 months now and still no working computer. I've been lied to and been subject to rude company representatives. To top it off, Eddie who I found out by looking at the Better Business Bureau site is the BBB contact for disputes and the owner of the company was incredibly rude to me. He interrupted my questions almost every time by saying I needed to send the computer in again and that was it, nothing else. I thought how rude and asked him to settle down and let me finish, he replied once again saying all I needed was to send it in, nothing else. <br>

If your gonna buy a pc online I suggest buying what your gonna use on it as soon as you get it from them otherwise you deal with the &quot;it was working fine when we sent it to you&quot; <br>
<br>
As far as online lag issues, join the club online and lag go together. <br>
<br>
Next you said you disabled your onboard sound and installed a new card you already had? If your hearing &quot;a bad noise&quot; check your connections, I installed a new card in my wifes pc had the same problem, I fixed it.<br>
<br>
Another thing to do when calling any tech support, read up on what problem your having thru knowledge boards that way when you call you sound like you know what the hell your talking about and they won't try to screw you. <br>
<br>
3 guys on our squad use CyberPower as well as a server that runs 24/7. <br>
<br>
They did however not send my pc rush like I asked and I told them please credit the rush charge back to my card, they did.<br>
<br>
Goodluck. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://nomadapex.homestead.com/files/Nomad2.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dimentorz>DimentoRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clueless...</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#333333>(3/9/04 1:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't buy from Cyberpower, INC</span><hr size=1> Wow, that sucks dude.<br>
<br>
Here's what I'd do, take everything you've put on this message and go to www.bbb.org and file a complaint against this company.  Depending on which state they are based in you might have to mail the letter in, BUT, you'll get the appropriate address and such.<br>
<br>
I had similar issues with Gateway one time, filed my complaint, 1 week later I had Gateway calling me asking how to resolve the situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;IF&quot; the company cares about their BBB rating, they'll work something out with you.<br>
<br>
Overall, and I'm guessing here, I'm thinking that the CMOS/BIOS isn't entirely disabling the on board sound card and your PCI bus is freaking out.<br>
<br>
I didn't notice you stating you've tried this but I would:<br>
<br>
Remove the sound card, enable on board sound and see what happens.<br>
<br>
Remove the sound card, leave on board sound disabled and see what happens.<br>
<br>
Look for any and all PCI bus update drivers for your motherboard.  Asus has a fairly decent web site for this, so if you haven't already, hit it up.<br>

My last Dell laptop was a nightmare, doa on arrival, then needed a new motherboard, then lcd, then hard-drive in the first six months, despite hearing how great their tech support was, they weren't very nice or much help either.<br>
<br>
The best part was the extra 429.00 I spent for an onsite repairs warranty, and then being told that the problems were too difficult for onsite repair to resolve, so I had to ship it to Dell.<br>
<br>
Can't obviously build your own with a laptop, not sure who I'm going to go with on my next one, but it won't be Dell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I put about 450 dollars worth of stuff in it.  Bascially the only parts i used from my old computer were, monitor, cd rom, HD (it was small so i bought a bigger one to augment it) and floppy, although the floppy doesn't work properly :P<br>
<br>
I had an old modem and I had that sucker plugged in to the motherboard.  I was having terrible problems, I couldn't even get the sytem to boot properly, but once i removed the old modem I was gtg.  Possibly try running EQ with your modem out.  <br>
<br>
The modem shouldn't cause problems, but it could be causing some interference.  Especially if you have onboard ethernet interface.  I am not a computer wiz.  I do not pretend to have all the answers, but possibly this might help.  <br>
<br>
I like my computer working, but if its not I don't mind getting inside and fiddling with things.  It's fun for me hehe even if i don't have much clue whats going on in there :P<br>
<br>
Hope its a simple solution for ya.  Good luck on getting the comp working. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kromzaaonmimrz>kromzaa on mimrz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/04 1:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ya</span><hr size=1> well the weird thing i still don't understand is how I couldn't install an external modem...even with the pci one taken out <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=benlian>Benlian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/04 3:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well</span><hr size=1> I still dont use a modem in my computer.  I didn't bother to go and get one after I tossed the old one out.  There was never any point because dsl is pretty reliable.  <br>
<br>
If my DSL goes down, i'm not gonna waste my time playing EQ on a dial up.  I'll do one of the other million things i need to do instead hehe.  <br>
<br>
Even if the modem is not installed, just on the board or connected it could give you problems.  That was what was happening to me, not sure if its still in the case or connected, but that was just my experience with modems and integrated internet access boards.<br>
<br>
Good luck getting it fixed bro.<br>
<br>
I also, have itegrated sound, but i do not have an after market sound card.  I just use the itegrated sound and it works fine enough for me.  So as someone else suggested that could be your problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dimentorz>DimentoRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clueless...</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/04 3:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> External Modem</span><hr size=1> Well chances are that modem was connected via USB port.

All Mail orders are required to refund you your money back within 30 days. This is a Law.  And your Credit Card will do most, not all, the work for you.<br>
<br>
I bought a bad motherboard with basicly the same kinda story.  They didnt want to take it back, but after 6 months of not recieving their money, cuz I disputed it, they where forced to send Fed Ex to pick up the idem.  I didnt and refused to pay the 15% restocking fee.  Dont play games, dispute it, if they then send u a new one and your happy, you can always drop your dispute later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kromzaaonmimrz>kromzaa on mimrz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/04 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't buy from Cyberpower, INC</span><hr size=1> apparently only have 120 days to do that and my 120 days has passed already <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=2580.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=2580.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2580.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=2580.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2580.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2580.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
