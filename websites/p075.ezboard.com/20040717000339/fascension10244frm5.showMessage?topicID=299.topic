I have taken a 4 week break and this is my last shot at continuing to play EQ. Im attending college in Mass now and through my 4 years of playing eq i think you can say i changed hell of a lot, as reguards to my attitude, discipline, goals, dreams ect about playing eq. <br>
<br>
Anyway...to get onto some of my qualities that the guild might be interested in ...<br>
<br>
Im Soulwind a 60 warrior as my main and a alt 60 necro Volture...these are my two primary characters for the most part. My past history of guilds includes Paradigma and Ordo Malleus. If you wanted to go further and question members of my previous guilds please feel free, i have nothing to hide and i am confident that you shouldnt hear any negative talk about me...I fulfill all of your level requirements / gear requirements and then some.  I was OMs MT so my gear / ability is on the upper level. 60 alt points, full hot armor, primal 1h/2h, cloak of firestorm, Ring 9, Ring of the sky, and thats all i remember right now lol.(Keep in mind i havent played eq in 4 weeks and my computer is not at my dorm atm) I am highly active and RARELY miss events and now that i am at colllege i shouldnt miss any at all as i am aware that you guys raid pretty late and that is actually the best time for me. Im experienced in all zones you guys raid with the exception of vex thal and i can easily adapt to certain situations and i can listen / follow directions easily. <br>
<br>
Most importantly...i am not a loot whore, i rarely ask for items if there is someone that needs an item more. Why i want to join AD? Well aside from the fact that its the best guild on RZ, i always dreamed of being a part of the high end game and doing half of the shit you guys do. I did my best in my previous guild to keep the guild together as much as possible and strive to get to that level but unfortunatly it never happend. I am a team player and i dont join guilds for loot, i never did. I hope to develope good relationships with everyone in the guild in the event that i do get accepted... Bottom line, I am NOT joining AD for loot...<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want an active, dedicated, and loyal warrior...i'm your man.<br>
I hope i didnt talk too highly of myself :}<br>
<br>
Soul<br>

<br>
Feel free to drop me an email at congi38@hotmail.com or vcongion@wnec.edu if you want to keep in touch if my appl gets turned down.<br>

I didnt just randomly kill people but when i had my reasons i pvped. Basically i didnt like being shit on from others and i took no shit. That said...Way back i used to be much more pvp oriented untill i started joining guilds which changed my whole outlook on eq.

What can i say other than that he is a great guy and one hell of a friend.  I remember joining the guild and a few weeks later Soulwind and volture joined.  It took me a while to figure out they were the same people cuz he'd play one then log the other one on so quickly lol i thought they were brothers or something.  Anyway, we used to duo POM, SS, DN, and other places.  He really knows how to play a necro very well (he could solo those wyverns on the way to Skyshrine quest room).  But, he knows how to play a warrior even better.<br>
<br>
He is definetly a team player.  After he became an officer and i became a member again, he asked me to help him make some loot calls and help him lead a raid.  This guy needed no help.  His effort, his loyalty, and his friendlyness made ordo a better guild.  He single handedly camped atleast half a dozen mobs for us and would be the prime motivator in getting us to do things.<br>
<br>
Very great guy, and AD material IMO.  And he loves smalls so he should have the hfls' vote. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/Lunarsig.jpg" border="0">

<br>
Soulwind got us to do wtov.  He helped camp mobs in wtov as well.  He got us to do ikiatar and eashen.  (Anyone who got anything from those two or wtov, thank soulwind pls)<br>
<br>
Soulwind got us to do st key mobs.  Sure, somthor was a very HUGE help in motivating us to do them, but soulwind started the guild into getting them.  This does not mean that he simply said &quot;lets do zland and kland and try sont a buncha times&quot;.  Infact he actually was THE ONLY person to camp the mobs.  He donated nights where he had to do hw or study for a test to log on every half an hour to check zland because it was going to pop that day.  I see no evidence of whiner or crybaby-ness in that.  And considering it took him a while to get a st key, i dont consider him a lootwhore either. Dont forget he started us into doing rhag 1 and 2.  So anyone in ordo who has luclin dropped spells from ssra, thank soulwind please.   <br>
<br>
Personally Biguss, i expect you to base your opinions on more than just accounts of other peoples opinions.  It's like agreeing to something without even expressing an opinion about it.  Your whole post is irrelevant because it isnt even your opinion.  Its like saying &quot;Bob said John is bad, so he must be bad.&quot;  <br>
<br>
As for picking my friends, I pick people who are trustworthy, loyal, honest, and have a sense of humor.  Adell mentioned trustworthyness.  Where is the question in his trustworthyness?  Honestly be free and open about it because i'd love to set the record straight on Soulwind.  <br>
<br>
Any OM (former or not) knows that Soulwind sometimes was stubborn.  Sometimes he was impatient.  But goddamnit he was loyal, he was willing to help us up when we fell down, and he was willing to put his time into helping our guild get better.  If none of you see that, then you weren't paying attention in raids or had guildchat off.<br>
<br>
(Oh and for being a lootwhore, i personally delt with soulwind on calling loot one time.  Just me and him, and he was very very generous on giving something out which he wanted.  If i remember correctly he wanted a first brood talisman or something but said forget it since he had good gear and he just wanted the guild to get good things and be happy.  So we gave it to tiludan, a very deserving guy.) <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/Lunarsig.jpg" border="0">

He always cried about not getting any loot when he solo pk'd and if he did help us get a kill, he always expected the loot if it was good.<br>
<br>
I personally lent him a manastone to level that character and defending his character once...this was awhile back but he exp loss'd his own guildmate because his own guildmate took a spawn that he was supposively camping (even though he couldn't hold it down by himself).<br>
<br>
When I asked for my manastone back, he refused because he said he &quot;needed it&quot;.  So I asked for one of two items he had I was interested in, which were 1/2 the value of the manastone.  He said he needed one of the items for his druid and the other one for his level 12 warrior...and he kept my manastone.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I've pk'd him many times since.  So I've gotten my value back.<br>
<br>
Ziggun is the RL friend of the original owner of Lunar....and I believe Lunar knows the original owner as well....so I'm assuming they have ties IRL.  But rest assured, Ziggun is a loot whore.  Ziggun is a cry baby.  Ziggun still sits on his thumb whenever he can.<br>

Yes I am a former guildmate of Soulwind. I served as a guildmate of his, then I was an officer over him, and then a member under him. In all 3 spots you couldnt tell the difference, he always tried to take charge of things (and that isnt necesarily a bad thing). he was a dedicated guy always trying to push the guild forward pve wise, and also fought hard during the DoZ war (when he wasnt zoning..)<br>
<br>
Then of course you bring up when you were deguilded 98% wanted to follow. Well, I won't deny that, when I returned from my month MIA there had been a max exodus.. but, don't think it was because of your great leadership qualities soulwind, it was because of your abilities + gear as the guild's MA, and as someone who played lots during the summer, that made your loss mean less and less raids for OM at the time (at least the way I saw it), causing those that had joined the guild to raid lots to just, well.. leave. And as for the reason you were booted, its something I have talked to you about and something I talked to everyone else about, and I back Talthan on it 100%.. i think it also shows everyone a bit of your nature when you don't get your way.<br>
<br>
Soulwind is a great Warrior, a terrible loser. He is a good guy who will always backup a friend no matter what, He is a bad guildmate who will piss and scream when he doesnt get his way. He is a generous person, but it takes a lot to maintain that generosity..<br>

Dunno if this post made any sense whatsoever, hope it did.. <p>Sirdario Hokuten</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=renix>Renix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 2:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I expected this criticizm</span><hr size=1> I thought you quit and werent gonna play again <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ustringsattached.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StringsAttached</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 2:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I remember...</span><hr size=1> Volture attacking me in BB cause he wanted my dorfs.

Your pvp character was not a pk no. He was a dickhead.<br>
<br>
Lunar your friends all have histories that run much longer then yours on rallos zek. Before you vouch for people hands down on their past, you should experience it first.<br>
<br>
I was hoping to catch you with your pants down on the BBM issue Volture, but you didnt bite.<br>
<br>
Anywho, Good luck Volture!<br>
<br>
P.S. I ALMOST FORGOT!!! You whined like a summamabish in DN when Wudan took down Zland cause your guild couldnt mobilise in time for him. You claimed you were camping him for hours, but I was down at rats and had him on track with noone in zone when I let others know he was up.<br>

Or something to that effect. I will admit I am biased to all the people that left OM for &quot;better things&quot;. Mainly due to my history in OM, and in most cases (not in all cases) the people who left for better things are the people that sucked OM dry till they couldn't suck no more and left because there was nothing left to suck (hope that made sense). Examples being the loot whores that left for DoZ. Its a good thing AD has not even considered Lobus's application imo, that fucktard backstabber should go to legends and stay there. <br>
<br>
Personally I would not reccomend anyone who has left OM of their own free will. If they were kicked out well dunno if you would want them /shrug.<br>
<br>
As to Soulwind's application... He is technically what you are looking for. He is a good guy, but sometimes his mouth gets the better of him (well most times :P). <br>
<br>
P.S. Loh your right about what you said about member retention.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uaybolit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aybolit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(9/16/02 11:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebany</span><hr size=1> easy there tiger. There are people who left OM for reasons other than loot /shrug. No need trying to screw them over because you feel betrayed or something.

<br>
As far as Soulwind goes. While I was never his biggest fan I cannot deny that he did nothing but good for OM as a guild. He maybe a bit loot hungry(who isn't?) but he earned everything he got from OM and I don't think anyone in the guild has ever questioned that. Also in 6 or so months that I was in OM, Ziggun was only used to camp mobs and to PvP green pks who were trying to be annoying <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufaamarki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>faamarki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>no caps</span><br>  Posts: 479<br> <font color=#333333>(9/16/02 12:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebany</span><hr size=1> i allways liked volture.<br>

<br>
thats the word in all of these posts that i find most descriptive of him<br>
<br>
i had similar experiencs from ziggun to volture to souldwind, he could be polite, a hard worker, and a loot whore.. but the bottom line is he lies whenever it suits him and even sometimes just for kicks<br>
<br>
I remember a tell from ziggun back way way way early in the plane of air days braggin about how two of the dru only earrings had dropped (none had dropped on the server before then).. none actually dropped that day either.  Just a tale.. just like the brother stories..<br>
