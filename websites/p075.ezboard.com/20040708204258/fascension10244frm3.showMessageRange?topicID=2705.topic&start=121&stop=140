Bush of course.  You're deluding yourself if you think anything else. All Bush needs to do is to continue the cowboy routine in the middle east, and continue to ignore the situation in Israel/Palestine, and he will act as the best recruiter that Al Qaeda has ever had.<br>
<br>
You think of terrorists like a football team.  In your simplistic view, when Al Qaeda is &quot;defeated&quot; they'll all be dead, and we can all go back to roping steers.  You think you can &quot;win&quot; against a terrorist.  The reality, as shown by numerous historic conflicts (hello--the birth of our own country), is that conventional military opposition is not effective against an insurgent opposition driven by a cause or ideals.  You defeat terrorism by taking away the issues that drive people into their ranks, and marginalizing their actions in the population that would normally harbor themA.  <br>
<br>
In the case of the middle east, I'll paraphrase Anthony Zinni, who said it best &quot;The road to peace is through Palestine, not through Baghdad.&quot;   <br>
<br>
The last thing that Al Qaeda wants is:<br>
1.) truly concerted multilateral international action, including consensus building among middle eastern nations (exactly as we did when we contained Saddam)<br>
<br>
2.) A real effort made at peace in Israel, including a real effort to address the legitimate concerns the Palestinians have<br>
<br>
3.) A United States leader that makes a concerted effort at improving our image in the middle east.<br>
<br>
Thankfully for Al Qaeda, Bush presents almost zero danger of any of the above.<br>
<br>
Cutting off their funding?  Capturing their leaders?  You again mistake the nature of the beast.  All the reading I've done points to a highly flexible organization with diversified sources of funding.  Whatever funding Bush et al. have dried up, I am sure was replaced.  And Al Qaeda is an issues, not a personality driven organization.  Are you really so naive as to think that if bin Laden were killed tomorrow, they would dry up and blow away, and that we could don khaffaya's and sing Kumbaya with our Arab brothers?  <br>
<br>
Please.<br>
<br>
Let's also look down the international road a bit.  Americans need to seriously consider how we are perceived in the world, because the balance of world power is changing.  If China continues at even half of it's current growth rate, they will rival, if not outstrip us in productive and military capacity in our lifetimes.  Cooperative forms of international interaction will become more and more crucial to our national security.  It's time we all see the writing on the wall and start to act accordingly.<br>

I couldn't disagree with you more on that stance. I absolutely believe the terrorists want Bush out of office, then they can continue on with business as usual without repercussion. So I see losing funds or leadership had absolutely zero effect on them? Bullshit. It sure as hell disrupted normal operations for these jokers.<br>
<br>
What did we do when they bombed our embassy, or rammed boats full of explosives into our ships while Clinton was in office? Not a damn thing. Did that stop 9/11, hell no, it GOT WORSE. They killed 3000+ people by ramming air liners into our buildings.<br>

Grab your blinders and Rope away friend but I'm sorry I am not going to sit idly by and let them kill Americans just because you say in your &quot;simplistic&quot; view that it will all just magically get better if we ignore them.

<br>
The UN allowed Iraq to violate sanctions for over a decade without action. A great plan indeed. I'm sure terrorists are running scared thinking the UN might impose some sanctions on them.<br>
<br>
Oh hey and are you referring the IISS's report for your massively growing Al-qaeda numbers? Because you should probably read it to be sure.<br>
<br>
Let me just get to the meat of the report<br>
<br>
&quot;AL-QAEDA has more than 18,000 terrorists waiting for the order to attack targets in Europe and the United States, preferably with weapons of mass destruction. &quot;<br>
<br>
But later goes on to explain it's numbers:<br>
<br>
&quot;The IISS’s figure of 18,000 is based on intelligence estimates that al-Qaeda trained at least 20,000 fighters in its camps in Afghanistan before the United States and its allies ousted the Taleban regime.&quot;<br>
<br>
So what does that mean? BEFORE Afghanistan they had 20,000. Now? 18,000. Sounds like 2000 dead al-qaeda to me.<br>

We have done the same to Iraq.  <br>

I just hope we dont push things so far that relegion becomes a bigger part of it ane this becomes a holy war.  They have a much different outlook on things.  If they die in a holy war (which they pretty much lable any fighting) it means they go directly to heaven.  Its a 'go to heaven' free card, no matter what they have done in their lives.  Also, look at where they live.  Their lives suck anyhow.  If you were in their shoes why wouldn't  you join the crusade?<br>

That statement completely misses the point of what you replied to.  I say again- you will not defeat terrorism by &quot;cracking down&quot; alone.  The popular support for terrorism needs to be slowed to a trickle.  People need to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>want</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to stop funding and sheltering terrorists.  The number of terrorists is of course increasing, but far more worrying is the swelling of popular support for it.  As long as US policy continues along the path of pre-emptive war the size of popular support for terrorism will grow until it reaches critical mass.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You also seem to contradict yourself here by saying &quot;the shell was used in isolation, wasn't part of a larger stockpile&quot; and then &quot;the shell derived from an Iran-Iraq war era stockpile&quot; aren't you?<br>
<br>
And I suppose the weapons origins (if you are correct anyway) would negate the fact that it is a weapon of mass destruction?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To your second point- no it isn't a weapon of mass destruction.  A bucket of anthrax or a sarin shell isn't a WMD.  A sarin shell, a 105mm artillery piece specially modified, a targeting system, and a specialized release aersol dispersal unit (ADU) is a WMD.  Otherwise we might as well go around arresting every single company executive that produces the gas, every university laboratory with a stockpile, every munitions maker in the US/UK which makes shells that could be modified to carry the gas.  A WMD without a delivery system capable of dispersing the gas is about as capable of mass destruction as breaking a botulinim injection vial in a plastic surgeon's clinic.<br>
<br>
To your first point- the stockpile in question was destroyed, refer to the UNSCOM report.  The shell was probably looted, in fact the UNMOVIC statement shows it almost certainly was.  The massive stockpiles and deadly weapons that formed the platform of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cassus belli</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are still missing.  A single decrepit shell shouldn't be enough to convince anyone but the most paranoid of warmongers that Iraq was a serious threat to our external security.  Put another way, does anyone think that if before the war a single decrepit sarin shell was found the follow-up to UNSCR 1441 would have been passed?  I very much doubt it.<br>
<br>
I put it to you again- there was no serious security threat posed by Iraq, and 9/11 had nothing to do with Iraq.  If you agree with that, why was the war fought?  If you don't agree, why not?  I don't seriously think you or anyone else can argue that Iraq either posed a serious security threat or was involved with 9/11.  On the 9/11 point, read this:<br>
<br>

Oh I don't know, Slobodan Milosevic and Laurent Kabila are I would imagine ruing the day they ignored UN resolutions.  I'm curious are you an expert on UNSC resolutions all of a sudden?

Lebanon, Palestine- all serious enacted resolutions.  <br>
<br>
Blanket statements like &quot;there isn't a world power that should take a threat seriously from the UN&quot; show nothing but intellectual uncuriousity about international issues.  <br>
<br>
Plus, if you support the enforcement of this resolution, do you support Resolution 242, which guarantees Palestinians a homeland?  Why oh why if resolutions must be taken seriously, hasn't that one been?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No I am not, I am also not so naive as to believe if we ignore it all it all goes away, which is what you are suggesting.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Er, whoever suggested ignoring it?  Bumraz's proposals would probably do more to reduce terrorism than anything that has been proposed in the last 3 years.  The United States has abandoned its role as an even-handed partner in the Middle East peace process, hence the letter written by 50 former diplomats.  That, the Iraq war, specifically Abu Ghraib are the wrong way to go about it.  <br>
<br>
A brief analogy- if there's a small fuel fire in your house, ignoring it means it will spread gradually and burn the house down.  Fanning the flames by pouring petrol on it (invading Iraq etc) will mean your house burns down faster.  Containing the fire and slowly suffocating of oxygen (oxygen in this case being popular support for terror) the fire will slowly die out.  The key is snuffing out popular support.<br>
<br>
The right way to do it is to stop propping up corrupt autocracies- like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar- oil-rich states where the gap between rich and poor is so large as to be unreal.  Bush talks about spreading democracy and then is openly proud of an unrepentant Saudi Arabia, gives aid to Egypt (a billion dollars worth per annum) and cozies up to OPEC, less than 3 of whose members are democratic states and none of whose Arab members are.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I couldn't disagree with you more on that stance. I absolutely believe the terrorists want Bush out of office<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not at all, Bush in office is a blessing for them, mainly in recruitment terms.  The Bush adminstration has taken hegemonic foreign policy to new lows, by going to war in Iraq while the Saudi dictatorship benefits from new and relaxed trade rules for their monarchs.  Paul O'Neill has described this as apartheid trade not dissimilar to the relationship with the South African government.  Such inequalities breed far more recruits, informants, funders and sympathizers for Al-Qaeda.  This isn't like the drug trade with a small number of hugely wealthy supporters.  It's a sea of civilian support many giving 10, 20, 30 dinars each.  What are you going to do- arrest them all?  Bomb them all?  No, they have to stop wanting to fund Al-Qaeda.<br>
<br>
Anti-US sentiment has risen astronomically under Bush, to never before seen levels.  Ironically it had FALLEN to never before seen lows after 9/11, after the Iraq war it is higher than it has ever been.  More popular support for terrorism means it is much harder if not impossible to find them, control their funding, and choke off their recruits.  <br>
<br>
But most importantly of all, do you even know what Al-Qaeda's goal is?  Apart from global isolation of the Middle East, an important and STATED strategic goal of this loose affiliated group is to provoke a conflict with the West.  An armed conflict that invokes the crusades of old.  Bush is giving them *exactly* the kind of conflict that they want, hell he even CALLED it a crusade. <br>
<br>
That has made the prosecution of their goals that much easier.  Al-Qaeda wants that conflict because they know that terrorism has a plethora of soft targets to choose from and that every heavy-handed broad military operation will create orphans, widows and widowers that are ripe for the picking.  If not as jihadis who'll actually blow themselves up, then as civilian safe havens, funding contributers through the haldi wallahs and as agents to overthrow the corrupt and oil-fattened governments that support the United States.  <br>
<br>
They have also seen the limits of US military power after the Iraq war(as well as its operational failings in Abu Ghraib).  The United States is barely able to succesfully make a single secular Arab dictatorship secure.  Al-Qaeda's message recently has been that if a single godless dictatorship like Saddam's is bogging them down this much and overstretching their army, think what a nation of believers would do in standing up to them.  Iraq and Abu Ghraib have weakened the US image of security in the Middle East, not strengthened it.  It hasn't weakend the resolve of fundamentalism but strengthened it considerably, try reading the IISS report.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>then they can continue on with business as usual without repercussion. So I see losing funds or leadership had absolutely zero effect on them? Bullshit. It sure as hell disrupted normal operations for these jokers.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think you have a clue as to how Al-Qaeda funds and operates.  The vast majority of their fund transfers are paperless, banked funds make up a tiny fraction of their budget.  Here is how terrorist organizations (briefly) transfer funds.  Let's assume I'm a terrorist sympathizer that lives in Saudi Arabia (good odds!).  I go to a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>haldi wallah</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (money exchanger) and give him £10,000 in cash telling him I want it to go to a street-known Al-Qaeda linked group operating in New York city, and that my representative will make himself known by, i don't know, wearing a carnation in his blazer button.  A week later, said contact arrives at the New York <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>haldi wallah</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wearing a carnation and collects a different £10,000 from him.  No paper trail, not even the same bills, but it's the way terrorism is funded.  So any funds seized from banks is a pitifully small piece of the pie, the only way to stop this means of transfer is to <br>
<br>
a) dry up popular support for funding this shit (here's a hint, bombing Arab men, women and children doesn't help this); and <br>
<br>
b)Don't pour state money into beating the shit out of a dictatorship that had nothing to do with terrorism and then rebuilding it.  Spend it instead on counterterrorism and tradecraft that will stop these lines of funding.  I guarantee that if the cost of the Iraq war had been spent on counterterrorism (buying sources, purchase of information at street level tradecraft to high and sophisticated countermeasures) that we would all be a lot safer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your sophisticated multi-prong approach, like what Clinton did to terrorism during his tenure? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Last I checked, 9/11 didn't happen during Clinton's tenure.  9/11 took roughly a year to plan from Al-Qaeda's perspective and happened almost exactly a year after Bush took office.  What does that tell us?  Well it strongly suggests that Al-Qaeda knew that Bush would give them exactly what they wanted, a broad base of military action that would militarize the Islamic world, and a conflict with the West that they have been trying to provoke for over a decade.<br>
<br>
That's why I can guarantee that there won't be a terrorist attack this summer in the US from Al-Qaeda, such an attack would almost certainly mean Bush loses office.  Bush at the helm will mean heavy-handed, poorly supported military action that divides the West against itself and strengthens radicalism.  Not to mention, since Bush helped fly members of the bin Laden family out of the country, it's only right that the bastard return the favor right? <br>
<br>
How about, instead of trying to fight wars which had nothing to do with terrorism (Iraq), we actually spend that money on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>COUNTER-TERRORISM</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Golly gee, what a good idea!  Anyone on this thread who supported the war, answer me this simple question.  Do you think the money for the Iraq war and its reconstruction was better spent as it was, or on counter-terrorism proper.  In other words, on sources, training, security measures, ports and airports, internal sourcing etc.  Another important point- terrorism is a GLOBAL problem.  Alienating the very allies you need to fight terrorism is a very bad way to go about fighting it.  <br>
<br>
Warmongers sneer at France that chose to learn from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>its</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> experience with Arab nationalism in Algeria.  Without realizing of course that France has a hell of a lot to bring to the table when it comes to counter-terrorism.  Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon- these are all french-speaking Arab countries.  The DGSE (Departement-General pour Securite Externel) almost certainly has high value sources in these countries where Al-Qaeda has cells.  <br>
<br>
Do you honestly think after the abysmal diplomatic treatment they've received that they're going to share all their sources?  That's why the IISS report is so damning- it states that friendly states have diluted their resources by distancing cooperation against terror, whereas Al-Qaeda are further inspired and heavier in numbers because of Iraq- and that their affiliate groups are working more closely than ever.<br>
<br>
Here is an actual news report on it Kura, which seems to refute your &quot;fuzzy mathematics&quot; on Al-Qaeda's numbers:  <br>
<br>

<br>
Also Kurakai, don't ignore this last point of mine(although something tells me you might well want to)- tell me who trained Osama bin Laden and his mujahadeen.  Remind us all from your own mouth, who funded and radicalized him in Afghanistan in the first place.  Also tell me if you know, which President this happened under.  And do you think that if he hadn't been trained and funded in this way, would 9/11 have happened.<br>

Just a thought.. when the Brits were in Ireland and were in the news for doing something heavy-handed, did the funding from US citizens for the IRA increase or decrease? What brought about a political process there? More troops or a different approach?<br>
<br>
My father was fighting Arab terrorists in the early 50s (Aden). Then he was fighting terrorists (Mao Mao) in Kenya. I was born in a country where my father was fighting terrorists (Malaysia), I spent my childhood in a country in the Middle East where terrorists operated (Cyprus, but we were peace-keeping there). We had to cross the Kyrenia range in convoy with armoured cars and machine guns. He did several tours in Northern Ireland. I spent the latter part of the 70s in London being bombed by the IRA (7 bomb scares in one day was my record). I have lived with terrorism all my life... it's not new.<br>
<br>
Middle Eastern terrorism is certainly nothing new.. heh, the modern state of Israel was founded on it (Stern Gang et al).<br>
<br>
I can't see how anyone can believe that the war in Iraq has helped the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. <br>
<br>
In any event, the Iraq war was waged for an entirely different reason. If it was to do with moslem fundamentalism, why choose to attack the country with the most secular government in the region? /shrug.<br>

What that reason was, and what the war may or may not eventually achieve is an entirely separate question - but terrorism?
