For the last year and a half I've been the second tank for Wudan, occasionally filling in for Kadarx as MT.  This is a role I am very comfortable with.  I'm the second leading raider in Wudan (approx 98% raid attendance) - I'm online virtually 7 days a week.  My playtime ranges mostly from 4:30 EST until the days raids are finished.  When not raiding you can find me grouped with guildies, friends, XPing, helping other people with quests, shards, camps, etc.  My guildhistory includes Wudan, Dream Warriors, and Mystic Decree.  I was a member and Senior Council in The Conclave raidgroup.  Pinaduz is the only character that I play.  In RL I have a high-pressure job which sometimes requires me to work extended hours or weekends.  EQ generally has been good outlet to decompress and escape.<br>
<br>
I'm an old-school player (pre-Kunark), some might say just old.  I'm low-key, easy going, and most of the time I'm kinda quiet - concentrating on positioning mobs, taunting, and keeping my group alive or cybering the DE chick in group who I just found out was a guy, OMG - but I do make occasional jabs in guildchat or in group.  No smack talk, but when pushed I push back.  I can dish it out as well as take it.  I believe in leading by example - actions speak louder than words.  I'm a big believer in positive reinforcment (but accept criticsm well when its constructive).  I'm relatively patient and mature.  I take my role in a group and a guild very seriously, I don't take myself too seriously.<br>
<br>
I like to raid, particularly with capable and competent people.  I am not afraid to experiment and venture into new zones or accept new challenges.  I like helping friends and guildmates.  I've worked hard to develop a  good reputation on the server, and believe I am viewed favorably by most.  I have no KOS issues (except for the  usual cast of characters)  or problems with PvP.  <br>
<br>
I would describe myself as dedicated and loyal, sometimes to a fault.  Although sometimes I may have a difference of opinion with others, I believe in open communications.  I have will always support and abide by the decisions of the officers.  <br>
<br>
I believe I meet most of your minimum requirements.  Lvl 65, 216 aa's, moderately decent tank gear (6335hp unbuffed, 8955 raidbuffed, 1450ac).  All resists are over 100, most over 200 self-buffed.  I'm familiar with most zones and can travel independently self-invis.  I have all major keys, and am missing only Saryrn and RZ flags for the elemental planes.  My Magelo profile can be viewed at: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82792">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=82792</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
So why am I interested in AD?  For the last year and a half I've played at the relatively high end game.  AD offers the opportunity to continue to advance my character, experience new zones, adventure with old friends, and make new ones.  Hopefully AD will provide the opportunity to learn from those who are more experienced and skilled than myself and/or pass on some of my experience.  Moreover, I'm tired of getting spam from Taranna re:AD's latest conquest.  I realize my raid experience may be different from some of you.  While I bring my own experience to the table I'm a willing student eager to listen and learn.<br>
<br>
Why am I deguilding from Wudan, especially at a time when Wudan is advancing rapidly toward the elemental planes and making great strides forward?  Primarily for personal reasons.  I believe I am leaving Wudan on good terms with most, if not all, officers and members.  The bottom line is EQ is a game, and we are all here to have fun and enjoy.  <br>
<br>
Over the next few weeks I hope to have the opportunity to guest with you on raids get to know you  better, and learn more about AD.  But mostly lets get down to raiding and having fun.<br>
<br>
If you wish to know more pm me in game.<br>

<br>
I have nothing but positive things to say about Pinaduz, there really is nothing negative about him as a person.  Pleasant, generous and always helpful- being in a raiding guild changes some people, I'm happy to say it hasn't changed Pina one little bit as a person.  If you need company during a camp, friend to help with a flag or help with a mob, Pina's always the first to volunteer his time even if it seems impossible.  Incredibly unselfish also, as well as dedicated- as sect leader of TC he had more hours than anyone else by a long stretch, yet he held them back so others could get gear and progress- and even continued to help the sect months after he'd improved his character as much as he could with a sect like TC.  That to me, speaks volumes for his character.<br>
<br>
As a player, from the time I've known him he's focused, driven, patient and always willing to learn.  Also, I've rarely if ever seen a warrior more dedicated to improving his character and learning his class.  None of us are above the occasional gaffe (well maybe Endy &amp; a few others!) but Pina always learns from any mistakes and comes out a better warrior.  Complacency isn't something I've ever seen when playing with him, he's always motivated about events and getting things right.  An excellent voice of reason when tempers fray as well, from what I saw in TC.<br>
<br>
Pinaduz is a level-headed, generous and fantastic player.  He's one of the people who make the game worth playing- if I ever think about leaving the game at some stage in the future, it'll be the Arlenes and Pinaduz's I'd miss the most.  I unreservedly recommend Pinaduz as a player and a person, and council willing, he'd also have my sponsorship when the time comes.<br>

<br>
For me he is a fantastic friend and an everhelping guy...<br>
<br>
He is like the guy who comes up always in the right time when moral is down... he appears and sorry to say but sun begins to shine!!!<br>
<br>
I won't even say that Pina would be an asset for AD as even the worstonlystatslookingplayer can see that his AA and Equips are more than nice...<br>
<br>
Big hug to Pina and i hope Sponsors are already scribing things here!!!<br>

PS : Btw Pina ain't a Warrior, he is a EnchWarior like those AD&amp;D multiclasses... i think he has a perma rune on him as healing him constist of mostly being AFK...cheers bro <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bollixbraker>BollixBraker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 9:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=376.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pina</span><hr size=1> Pina,<br>
sorry to hear that you left wudan, but good luck with your ad application.<br>
like most have posted before, pina is a really nice guy. i have never been guilded with him, but have grouped with him and shared plenty of smack talk with him over the years. He would be an asset to any guild he joins. <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>
