<br>
To top it off, a great guild that you left(CE) is accomplishing alot and doing it while remaining cool people, and you learned that being fuckwad didnt get you jack and/or shit. Take it to heart, its a nice little lesson that some people are too stupid to learn.<br>

You ovbiously don't know a damn thing about me.  My former character Macoo got banned by a RL friend and when another RL friend talked me into coming back(wazza) i made Macoox.  I never went to legends, nice try though gimp.<br>

I had 5 copies of bliss in a guild at the time which had 2 enchanters(active).. of course i sold them for 40k when the selling was good.<br>
<br>
I invite any inquiry to my guild if they think I was jealously hoarding my wealth and spells and not sharing them. you leap to conclusions about things you know nothing about tetzou. I am in fact the source of the great majority of 63-65 spells any seekers had in the first few months of POP, on top of that i bought my own spells at great expense after repeated failure to acquire the ones i missed(c5 i bought for 70k) so i wouldnt waste any more runes.<br>
<br>
Yes i Killed pop minis, a great number of them. I killed them when BOT wass uninhabited and noone was there as competitions. When more and more people showed up I gave more and more spawns up to others as I had gotten almost all my spells and the great majority of spells most needed by my guild to progress(group nine, group fo7, group kazad, group sov, etc)<br>
<br>
Before you begin to try and slander me Tetzou , try and talk about something you have more then heresay knowledge about.<br>
<br>
Alrec<br>
<br>
PS - edit one final comment, last time I did anything with you we did Vindi and statue. Was your raid and everyhting was rolled on, you rolled on st key off vindi and so did I, I won. But who looted do you rememebr? thats right Mithanie, because we needed a shaman for ST(had only karelan keyed). This same enchanter you tried to paint in the light of a greedy farmer unconcerned or uninterested in anyone elses welfare gave the key to a shaman in guild rather then loot it himself. You should have known better based on your only contact with me what kind of person I am rather then spread lies.<br>

<br>
Alrec quite admittedly *TRADED* a few runes, when they were rare to get spells that he was missing, however, back when runes were near priceless, he personally got our guild:<br>
<br>
- My level 65 nuke, my level 65 charm<br>
- Our first 2 copies of blessing of the nine (took over 10 turn ins)<br>
- 1 Ornate Plate BP for a bard who didn't have a vindication BP<br>
- 3 Ornate Leather patterns for guild<br>
- 2 Ornate Leather leggings<br>
- 100 kpp to our MT, so he could purchase an SoD<br>
<br>
If I were to sum up all the contributions that Alrec has done for the guild, I'd probably run out of pages.  Ask anyone in SoD who BY FAR gave the most spectrals and runes to the guild, or parchments, and they will all without a question tell Alrec.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you something here... why do you think, that Alrec's reputation across the server is totally flawless, as one of the best enchanters on RZ, and one of the most generous and helpful guys, and yours as a rude jerk farms more contested mobs than anyone has ever done on RZ?<br>
<br>
All the BoT mini's Alrec and I farmed, back when we farmed Wing Mini's heavily, were back before the changes were made to the BoT key, and only Lords and one minor named dropped pieces - I think at the time, the only people who owned a BoT key were myself, Slithur, Alrec, Britetribe, Alrec's cleric, Winasben, and Shiris.<br>
<br>
Go on Tetzou don't you find it kind of funny, that on your own guild board, not a single guildmate stood up for you and said yeah, Tetzou is a good and generous guy, he isn't the type to farm gear ad nauseum for twinks and screw people.  Not ONE person has done it.  I am willing to bet, that in a few days, if this thread is still alive you still won't find a single person willing to vouch for you, or a single person willing to support your claims about Alrec.<br>
<br>
You made an ENTIRE list of arguments, that were totally proven false, including SoD bullying small guilds, SoD being given gear from you, you not trying to bully other guilds around using your guildtag, which are just hilarious from someone who admitted to bullying guilds, and being cought by Adell, being one of the biggest LW'ers ever to disgrace this server.<br>
<br>
You said you only ever farmed 'a few' Zlandicars.  Go on, tell us how many is a few, you sure you want too though?<br>
<br>
You know the reputation you have, its way too late to change it now, just hide behind the good name that your guildmates have gained for your guild, and keep smearing mud over it, leaving the cleaning up for them.<br>
<br>
For every one of Arlene's smiles, for everyone of the random nice actions that Pinaduz comits, the actions still mantain the great reputation your guild has, there's you, running down and steamrolling some guild to content that has no meaning for you, to get more items for god knows what.  I know of at least two people, that de-facto didn't decide to apply to AD sheerly because of your presence.<br>

Actually yeah, because the ST key that dropped after that, from the Statue of Rallos Zek - you didn't even random on, you just looted on Sonjah with no roll.<br>
<br>
So, the one ST key that the SoD members there got, was rolled upon, the other ST key you got you just looted - for a druid alt of all things?<br>

We followed up on statue where noone rolled on st key and you got sonjah her key which is whom you needed it for. I have no complaints about that I would do the same if  i had a toon in need and led a raid.<br>
<br>
However your first post about me came out as i was cockblocking everyone else from getting a shot at BOT minis so that I could sell runes while I ignored my guildmates who had no capabilities of getting any such spells so that i might profit.<br>
<br>
Thats what I was contesting, because its completely untrue. The experience in kael where having won the ST key myself and I had a shaman loot it so that the guild would benifit puts lie to that immage, and thats the entire reason I bring it up.<br>

So just ask Kilyin Dermel or Cusinit how much it was. also if you ask that close, i didnt even killed it one time the whole june. Also come on tell me how often you run up to kill BOT Minis? its the same thing.<br>
<br>
Why you aint doing the Stuff your Guild can do? Like all the Teir 3 Stuff. VZ / TZ all great Encounters. But indeed you are busy to worry about Zlandicar, which is infact more easy then the BoT Minis you are farming since awhile with 2 People. I also see Sont up 100% so your agrument you might use lost all weight before saying it!<br>
<br>
Also now coming to the 'wah wah - tetzou you are so mean'. Man thats really a sad excuse you are using here. Everyone in all Chat channels all over laffing about YOU (MSS / Bagdhad Bob / Mearis what every name you want to take), why you think you are getting ignored from most clerics you fucked over and over? And why i on the otherside get so many tells from your Guild / Ex-Guildies that its right to tell your ass that you can not spread out your lame ass old propaganda all over. I am so happy Adell showed you the way to the Door. Now, i can just hope you slip in those shoes and move right out. =)<br>

Ya Atsuko told me to do so.  So get the Facts straight. Atsuko and me was killing the Kael Mobs. you guys wanted to tag along, we let you and even gave you the first ST Key plus more loot on the way. even we wanted to try to do all that stuff with 2 people? You tagged along and as you say you was invited. So you join with 2-3 Members a Different raid that is already there and still asking and complaining about Loot? And even getting an ST Key? and still complaining? just tell me <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A> at: 6/28/03 10:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Powernap</span><br>  Posts: 937<br> <font color=#333333>(6/28/03 11:08 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/blizzard/fullsize/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WAAHOOO</span><hr size=1> I like to applogize to Alrec tho, I just used that post as random Oil to put in the Fire.

Tetzou is not a greedy person at all. the mobs he farms he gains nothing from, every single one that he kills.. every piece of gear that drops.. it all goes to benefit Sonjahh- not Tetzou.<br>
<br>
How you can go on insulting a philanthropist like Tetzou i shall never understand, all I can say is Tetzou definitely has the right to cross that line and do something as untactful as to relate the Iraqi information minister with a person who plays Everquest.<br>

<br>
We field roughly 25-30 people on a average raid. Peak attendance has been up to 40ish but its exceptionaly rare.<br>
<br>
So figure 30 or less people want something to do, half of them have less then thurg or skyshrine quality gear in a majority of slots what would you do? <br>
<br>
You know what we do, we kill the mobs that give teh best loot for the effort. All the loot from BOT tower bosses is no drop, why would we kill them so often if the pieces werent being used? and if the peices are being used then that means this is the level we should be at since we are going from obulus mantles to mantles of the rain maker, from tstaffs to greatstaffs of the 4 winds, and from elysian to ornate druid tunics.<br>
<br>
Once we dont NEED the BOT tower bosses you wont see us doing them. As of now tho, they provide the best upgrade path for our guild.<br>

I haven't 'camped' a wing mini in forever, I randomly kill them if they happen to spawn while I am doing experience in that particular wing.  I even specifically go out of my way to not 'camp' bosses, because wings have now become such a chesspool, with groups of 6 'strategically' splitting up to send one player on each boss spawn point to ensure it stays camped that I don't wish to dabble with that crowd.<br>
<br>
Let's see, Zlandicar spawns once every five days, BoT 'wing' mini's (I assume you are referring to those, not to the tower bosses) spawn every 6 hours, and there is four of them, of course I killed a few of them, I got over 100 AA in BoT exp'ing, but I hardly ever camped any of these 'farmable' bosses, expecially since the floodgates were open.<br>
<br>
If you are referring to tower bosses, then yes, those have been for a few weeks the main 'raid' target for my guild because of the amount of upgrades that they drop, once my guild has all the loot from them that we need, we will move on, like we did for NToV, when we saw that most of the loot there started going on twinks/lower level alts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and even gave you the first ST Key plus<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wait a minute!  Didn't you just admit, that that key was randomed on?  IF you give something away, you give it as a gift, you don't make someone random on it hoping to beat them, you didn't GIVE anything to anyone, you forced melees to random against a DRUID alt!  You realize, there were melees in your guild who still needed a key long after your druid alt had one?<br>
<br>
We did kill Avatar of War, but its not a mob we can field numbers for on a regular basis, mainly its obviously a shortage of clerics and  its very very rare indeed when including two boxers we can field around 30+ people including five clerics or so.  Comparing the difficulty in killing Seru with the difficulty in killing tier three plus bosses is ludicrous, the only hard thing about Seru is preventing the pure melees that cannot do anything that fight from running around the room and aggro'ing spawn, other than that, its a yawnfest.<br>
<br>
If and when we start fielding more players, we will move onto tougher content, but we have no intention of recruiting people just for the sake of inflating our numbers to those required by content harder than what we are doing - I am a firm believer in doing the content your guild is capable of, not making your guild capable of content that's available.<br>
<br>
However, since we are such huge 'farmers' I'll let you know, that out of all our tower kills, so far, ONE mold ever was looted by a two boxed druid, and ONE ornate mold was traded for an elemental bow - every single other loot we have gotten sits on a main character, in guild or among friends, nothing was ever sold.<br>
<br>
You realize I have lead every single ST run my guild has ever done, and Mearis still doesn't have an ST key, nor have I ever awarded myself one?  We just live in entirely different universes, in my universe, the raid leader does not loot a key so other melees may have one, including newer melees in guild, and plays whatever character can help the guild the most down there, in yours, you take a key for your druid twink to help your farming endavours down there.<br>
<br>

I think everyone on the server knows about Arlene's kindness, or how much of a nice guy Pinaduz is - by the same token, ask ANYONE in Legacy of the Fallen, Celestial Empire, Seekers of Divinity - the guilds doing the harder Velious content who they hate the most in AD, and every one will give you the same answer.  Since you have no friends, nor ever will do, you cannot understand how much it sucks to see your friends name dragged through the mud because of one asshole.<br>
<br>
I'll give you an example, I am sure Altaris and Briaar still remember.  Back in the OLD Reverant, well before you joined, when they were called Swarm of Fear still and they were farming HoT and WToV dragons, I remember noticing that Zoraan was in guild - old Swarm of Fear was mostly nice people, but everyone I think remembers what kind of a huge dick and total LW Zoraan was.  I warned several of my friends in the guild about him, who insisted on giving him a chance, in the end, he tried scamming guildmates for platinum, then ran to Stormhammer.<br>
<br>
One fucked up little child with too much time on his hands, can alone do so much to soil a guild's name, expecially when AD is looking to recruit other level 65 players a fair percentage of whom are in those guilds, and its just bad policy to have a shitty image with the guilds you are hoping to recruit from, AD are just lucky that they have a huge majority of wonderful people, so people are willing to look past Tetzou's actions more than if the rest of his guildmates were any similar to him.  Is anyone even remotely convinced, that if AD recruited 3 or 4 more players like Tetzou, their relationship with the rest of the server would be anything nearly as good as it is now?  Do even YOU believe that Tetzou?<br>
<br>
Tetzou, this thread has been up for over a week now - AND STILL nobody has come in your defense, hell Sirdario came here to mock you, doesn't that tell you something?  It should.<br>
