2nd, kringe showing up had nothing to do with it. i remember talking to adell at the time, cuz it bothered me that kringe, who has nothing to do with this was trying to get involved. she assured me he doesn't speak for AD at all, so we continued to attack since you started talking shit to Hesikih, or maybe it was Mach (both MiM officers that showed up in ME).

<br>
Neither Neo or myself went around telling anyone you were a pk but people in the zone at the times you came in and mbed Neo saw you. They also saw you root me in the middle of a quad trying to exp kill me. Those people asked what was going on and I told them you came in to pk us.<br>
<br>
This is overwith to Neo and I and on the last day when we ran into POV and mbed you (where he also did not loot you) I sent you a tell saying that the mb button works both ways and didn't you think it was about time we stopped this silliness) From that time on we have had no problem with you nor tried to cause any for you.<br>
<br>
As far as what happened in ME that day it has been long forgotten and forgiven. You are the one that came in with an axe to grind after your leave from eq. As of this moment we have no problem with you and feel that day was a misunderstanding in ME like most things are. A simple I am sorry man would have solved it then except you ooced that we stole your quad or something to that nature which was untrue. You said you tried to help after it happened. I will accept that but in future don't try to help by aggroing other mobs to the people you are helping then gate when you see all the mobs.<br>
<br>
If it will help I can say this. I do not believe Impackt is a random pker. He was simply grinding an axe he had. At the last encounter we asked him to just drop it now. From that time forward we have had no problem with him coming in and ambushing us nor have we hunted him. You were only hunted that one time because you continued to mouth off about giving Neo dirt naps and he wanted to show you it worked both ways.<br>
<br>
Actually in some of your tells you were cute and charming to a point and we understood the axe you were grinding. <br>

It doesn't help that while you were a recruit, you left and take care of RL issues, then come back for a bit, and expect to just pickup where you left off. No one have any issues with you personally, cause a lot don't even know who you are to<br>

However,<br>

Myself and Lndi were in ME zone quading with many others, as Impackt was around quading worms and skellys, bats or some toilers, for those of you who dont know that when you quad worms or skellys they pretty much agro anyone sitting, so as im medding up impackt runs by with his quad, agroing myself and Lndi. We try to get out of the way but its kinda hard with mobs on you not returning to there owner. Being so i start rooting mobs so that i dont die, where Impackt then shouts out &quot;Stop KSing my mobs.&quot; I then shout im not trying to take anything but his mobs are on us, and everythings out of control, Impackt evac's, leaving the mobs to save himself. If he came back i dont know because i was trying to save myself and Lndi from death, but i was to late for Lndi died. I would have to say i was pretty upset cus i asked him not to quad around us but it happend. Being that he was back in zone and we started a shouting battle. Where is all i wanted was something along the lines of Im sorry i will try and be more carful in the future. But instead i get &quot; I dont have to say sorry if i trained you and didnt mean to&quot; kinda odd to me for if you didnt mean to you would think you would say sorry... so then an officer in MIM comes to help and take charge of the problem to help out, seeing the word battle in shouts he kills impackt, and starts to CC him. Myself and Lndi didnt CC, we were just sitting at zone in. Heskit then asked Impackt to get his body and leave. But he wouldnt so then Heskit killed him again, I dont know where this me and Lndi CCed him came from but it was the officer that decided to take it in his hands. So then after months of this being over all of a sudden, Impackt was in PON, as im quading and just MBs me, im sorry to say but your actions now look as if you are a pker = player killer, you didnt pvp nor anything but came up and ganked me in the middle of a quad. Then the next day when i was Medding, also you then tried to root Lndi in the middle of a quad, your actions show you to be a pker, where if i was in a guild you wouldnt have taken those kinda actions to me nor Lndi. But being people in the zone see you come up on me and MB me also root Lndi in a quad you have just show to others that you are a Pker. IM sorry but Actions speak louder then words. I have wanted to put this behind us and let it go but all im asking for still is just a &quot;im sorry&quot; things could have been worked out different then strong words or Pking actions. Maybe a duel in arena or even in the zone, but to come up and gank someone without even telling the people in there party what you are doing, shows others that you may have turned to the pking side of EQ, for we all have seen it before and it wouldnt be the last. When i did come up on you in POV, i alerted your members that i believed you to be pker for the actions you have taken, and then told them i was going to be killing you. My actions show to others that i have honor and it was not to hurt there group, I attacked you also when you had no mob to not endanger your group members. <br>

Further not letting the group he migth be in know why it happens, will cause people to think of him as a PK <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
MiMs migth have shown be in the past that they do not hesitate to shoot first and ask questions later, but my experience also shows me that a level headed person can get them to admit the been faulty if that is the case.<br>
<br>
But one thing i do not understand, is why is this being posted on a AD board ? Shouldn't this just be a post in MiMs board ? <br>
<br>
and why am i replying when i am neiter a AD nor a MiM ? (god i am bored)<br>

P.S. Just because someone doesn't have  (uber guild 01) after their name doesn't mean they're not an Alt / Twink / Friend of someone who is.
