However, this time you're really slipping. Hakatri, Ruhi, and Vanessalynne's posts explain the situation perfectly, and although I don't have an opinion concerning the Kringe KOS (I'm still a recruit, and I never raided with Kringe) I can concede that the AD argument makes sense. The counter-points you have provided are, to be honest, unrelated to the points brought up by AD (AD never said Kringe didn't deserve the items, nor did they say &quot;selling makes you KOS!&quot; However, these are your main counterpoints /boggle). You may sound like a lawyer to some people, but it's fairly obvious you aren't one. [note: feel free to state my position of bias, but I assure you I've been taught to avoid that]<br>
<br>
The main reason I replied, however, is because of the irony of this statement: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once again, Malio is making assumptions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
How soon you forget that you said this in your previous post: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Im sure when Roger signed his long-term contract with the Red Sox he said &quot;I want to be a Red Sox for life&quot;<br>
<br>
Every player does that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Opposite the intended effect indeed.<br>
<br>
As for Impackt, I beg to differ; it's quite obvious you do &quot;care&quot; about the situation, because otherwise you wouldn't be here attempting to defame the guild over an altercation in which you're completely uninvolved.<br>
<br>
(To both) Learn when to admit when you're beaten, and for your own sake, don't forget to the first rule of arguing: your number 1 enemy is your own big mouth. And finally (to Impackt): the use of rl insults in a game argument is an act of desperation. Unless you're only attempting to look smart to stupid people, I suggest you stop playing that card. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 6/14/03 5:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siclid>Siclid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1256<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/03 7:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: once again</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once again, Malio is making assumptions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
When you have historical data/events/etc to make the assumption reasonable.<br>
<br>
I could list off a huge number of players who have made that statement about wanting to play their entire careers for a team after signing a long term contract.  This makes my assumption reasonable.  Furthering my assumption is the fact that Roger signed more than one contract with the Red Sox.  Obviously, this shows that he did have an intent and desire to play for them for the rest of his career.  If he never liked playing for the Sox, he wouldn't have resigned the second time.<br>
<br>
Now I challenge Malio/Hakatri/Ruhi to be able to name one person I've ever mislead, ripped off, etc in my time brokering EQ items and accounts.  I have sold probably to over 300+ people.  I have done deals where I have received over $7,000 at once.  I could have kept the $7,000 and pocketed it and ran.  I just recently had an account that I brokered about 1.5years ago taken back by the original owner.  I could have said &quot;tough luck, you knew the risks&quot;.  Instead, I spent a full day of my time getting the account back for him.  He did nothing.  And rest assured, most sellers would have done nothing or done very little.  I also guarantee you that no one could have done what I did on that day.  Yes, thats an assumption, but I know its true.  I could go on and on.  Now I challenge anyone out there--find one person who I've ever ripped off.  When you do, then start making comments about my character outside the game.  <br>
<br>
There are alot of you who play &quot;tough guys&quot; in the game.  You are all big and bad.  But you are really just an average person behind a computer.  Do I care that you play that way?  Would I judge you IRL over that.  Nope.<br>
<br>
I chose to play EQ a certain way.  That was my choice.  I picked a server that let me play that way.  I had fun.  I played that way in UO as well.  FYI, I was a founding member of The Regulators and I quit because they were getting too &quot;alliance friendly&quot;.  I played MUDs before that...and guess what, I was a PK.  I play CS now.  Sorry, I like beating other people.  Not some bugged computer driven mob.  Im not sorry for the way I play games.  That is my choice.  Judge me all you will outside the game if you want.  I won't be judging you however.<br>
<br>
Fact is everyone here doesn't know the facts.  It was made known Kringe would like to sell.  Generous offers were made on his part.  All items were returned.  There is alot more to this than just that.  Sometimes people change their mind about playing a game.  Like I've said ALL along, it is ADs choice in the end.  Its just that a few people who like to judge outside the game are making the choices.  I've recieved about 8 different reasons why the account is KOS.  None of them are true.  Mike and I both know why he is KOS.  And thats that.<br>
<br>
And if you really think all my posts were merely to try to get an account UNKOS, well, you aren't thinking outside the box again.<br>
