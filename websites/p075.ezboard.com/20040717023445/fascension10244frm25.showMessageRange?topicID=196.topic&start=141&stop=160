Comments like this are just dumb.  Do you think we are only capable of doing 1 thing at a time?   Iraq will not stop our on going war against terrorism.  Just because we have something else going on does not mean we are suddenly going to forget about and stop looking for Bin Laden and his pile of shit members.  Just look at what happened last week, we got 2 of their top guys (the brains and money behind 9-11). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=everas>Everas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AD's Iksar Monk_0354</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#333333>(3/10/03 10:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll on US Presidents speech is closed</span><hr size=1> *shrug* I tend to make broad accusations when I'm annoyed. I don't mean much by them usually... just venting. <br>
<br>
However when I make a specific accusation, for instance calling Lurker an idiot with no concept of the world outside of what hes heard from Bush's propaganda machine, I try to back that up with a solid argument.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are some people in the world who automatically hate other people no matter what they do or what they say. Be it because of their religion, race, sex, ideology, etc. Judging someone on their actions or giving them a chance doesn't seem to come into the equasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you're certainly right, there are people who hate other groups. But its not automatic, alot of it stems from irrational fears and insecurities. It's much easier for some to project their own problems onto others, hence bigotry. For instance, people are afraid of terrorism. People wrongfully equate being arab with being a terrorist. People hate arabs. Arab countries (Iraq) control resources important to our nation. It's less expensive in the long run to coerce a nation through violence than it is to negotiate on equal footing.  A convenient situation for a government willing to exploit it. Who cares if we attack Iraq and a bunch of arabs die, they were probably terrorists anyway right?<br>
<br>
But thats off topic. At the time Bush was elected I had no particular bias towards either candidate. Despite what a limited mind like yours may come up with (the, if he doesn't agree with everything Bush does he must be a leftwing nut line of thought) I'm not a democrat. Nor am I a republican. I was more than willing to give Bush a fair shot. Well he's had it, and hes shown hes willing to violate our constitution and engage in an unnecessary war with a foreign country. <br>
<br>
&quot;Labeling everyone against your position as mindless cowards is basically retarded and shows your immaturity. I would love to see anyone on this board run for President and get past the primaries, let alone win the election. It's not a easy process. Bush didn't have to steal any election. He won it. This is a free country where everyone is entitled to a vote. If your candidate didn't win, then you should of participated more in the voting process by getting more supporters to vote.&quot;<br>
<br>
And as I said above... my earlier statement was born of aggravation. Ineffective? Certainly. But &quot;basically retarded?&quot; I think perhaps you should learn what the word 'retarded' means before you continue using it.<br>
<br>
And honestly, I imagine anyone on this board could run for President if they had Bush's resources. You seem to be under the mistaken impression that Bush's accomplished anything under his own steam. Well, we can all have our petty delusions can't we?<br>
<br>
&quot;I for one don't believe 49% of America that vote for Bush is dumb. Or the 51% that voted for Gore is dumb. If your 50x smarter then half the US population and 50x smarter than our President. Then perhaps you should post your thesis on the Palestinain/Israeli Solution, solve and implement the problems on world hunger, aids, poverty, and peace. Perhaps even state the solution on the emerging North Korean problem, while translating it into Koreans so the Koreans could understand it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Frankly your next few paragraphs are abit of a mystery to me. Where on earth did you come to the conclusion that I thought I was &quot;50x smarter&quot; than half the population? While I do know for a fact my own IQ is well above our nations average, I've never accused anyone who voted for Bush of being &quot;dumb.&quot; Intelligence is a moot point where that's concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frankly I don't think you care about any of those issues. Except in a, I'm right and Bush is wrong sense. And yes, Bush will be held accountable for our troops if war happens. By the US population, by God, by his conscience. It is a great responsibility to have hundreds of thousands of people, ready to die for our country's cause. Frankly I don't think you would have the balls for making such a decision, or know when to committ troops on any situation unless you were on a bandwagon. What exactly were you doing on 9/11? Or the days after 9/11? Nothing I would guess. Perhaps back in school, at work, at friends house, or at home on the computer playing EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I think I've already established exactly where your capacity for thought ranks.  However I do care a great deal about those situations. And so should everyone else, what we do today will determine the future. I don't claim to have any absolute solution to them. However for any lasting solution we're going to have to come up with something better than &quot;Yeehaw lets send in the tanks!&quot; Does that mean military action is never the answer? No. But it should be the last option, only called upon when EVERYTHING else has failed. And we are not at that point with Iraq.<br>
<br>
Oh and lets also be honest about Bush's responsibility. The worst repercussion he'll have to deal with is the loss of an election. He's never fought in combat. Most of those in the government calling for war haven't. And you're right, neither have I. But then again, I'm also urging patience and rational thought. We're under no imminent threat from Iraq, there's no reason not to give the inspectors the time they need. <br>
<br>
But I guess if theres no war you won't be able to watch the pretty colors on CNN eh lurker555?<br>

What i was driving at was our time, money and man power can be better spent fighting other foes, or accomplishing other actions.  <br>
<br>
You cant tell me if we commit fully to fighting Iraq we will still have the resources to be sending our most skilled fighting forces out into other areas, hunting for those a$$'s.  This is the problem.  People dont take the time to understand a point of view before the rip it apart.  I have listened to people preach about pro war opinion.  <br>
<br>
And i think nothing that is said holds much water when placed under a somewhat decent microscope.  I have brought up many strong and valid points and the only one you really took from it was out of context, and missunderstood.  I dont wish to get into a flame war with anyone so i wont post any longer here, but try to broaden your view of the situation and those around it.  <br>
<br>
I can tell you are a smart person, as are all the people posting here.  You wouldn't post if you didn't have something intelligent to say (for the most part), but sometimes intelligent people to lose sight of the key facts and a high intellect can be the bane to the brightest people.  I know from experience the smarter you are, the less you want to listen to people, since you are always right hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To sum up.  Understand that others have very strong and good opnions as well.  On this i agree with the doves, because their arguments make much more sense.  As do mine i believe.  I learned long ago, you dont get very far in proving your point if you call people names or belittle their point when debating.  So lets keep this geneal please.

This seems to be the attitude of the US and UK political leadership.<br>
I would like the proponents of war to think about this. To think about it without ego or national pride getting in the way. Why is the rest of the world against this war. How can they all be so wrong, and we be so right?<br>
<br>
Here are the various excuses put forward for why all these other nations are anti war. this is my selective culling of media and political output from US / UK on why these nations are anti war.<br>
<br>
France<br>
they are &quot;cheese eating surrender monkeys&quot;. What a great expression. Borrowed i think from the Simpsons (which i suppose is another point, if political analysis comes from Homer, who isn't exactly the most astute of political observers). The reason they are anti war, is they like to surrender, they are cowards, they are disloyal to their allies. Come on please. If anyone was accused of cowardice during the WW2 it was the Italians. General De Gaulle and the Free French never stopped fighting. Vive la France! Vive la resistance! The resistance never gave in.<br>
<br>
Germany<br>
Schroder is anti war because he is electioneering on an anti american platform. We can't accuse germany of the cowardice excuse as they started the second world war against the rest of the world. So, anti american it is.<br>
<br>
Russia<br>
Not sure why we say they are anti war. They are obviously not cowards (ie WW2 again). They have their own 'anti terror' wars in chechnya, so we can't accuse them of being soft on terror.  Haven't heard them being called anti american yet. So, lets call it 'vested interests' in iraqi oil.<br>
<br>
China<br>
Again, not exactly sure why we say they are anti war. They are obviously not particularly peaceable themselves (witness Tibet and intermittent wargames in vicinity of taiwan). Probably because they are communist they are anti american and therefore anti war<br>
<br>
Pakistan<br>
Another (temporary) securtiy council member. They have stated they don't see the reason to vote for another resolution authorising war on iraq in teh security council. Its tricky for the US / UK to come up with a reason to explain why Pakistan are anti war. After all, they worked hand in glove with the US in the invasion of Afghanistan.  Maybe at heart is that they are all just &quot;towel heads&quot; who can't help being anti american.<br>
<br>
UK<br>
I know officially the UK is pro war. However, we continually are having high profile Members of Parliament stepping out against the war. Claire Short, a member of the British cabinet accused Tony Blair, her own party leader and prime minister of being reckless in this war, and said she would resign if we warred without a 2nd UN resolution. Leading opposition members (the opposition in the UK are officially pro war also) are also standing out and saying that war is not justifeied (ie Kenneth Clarke). The official line on why these people are anti war, is taht they are 'misguided'.<br>
<br>
Rest of the world<br>
The official line on why the rest of the world is anti war, and especially, anti non UN sanctioned war is a combination of:<br>
&quot;they are anti american, they just don't like us&quot; &quot;they are foolish to disagree&quot;, &quot;they are arabs / muslims&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point is two fold:<br>
1.  the more people who are against your position, the more likely it is that your position is incorrect.<br>
2.  the more people who are against your position, the more difficult it becomes to explain away their arguments as all having ulterior motives.<br>
<br>
Is it really correct to say that everyone who speaks out against the war is doing so because either:<br>
1. they are french cowards<br>
2. they are greedy russians<br>
3. they are misguided british liberals<br>
4. they are freedom hating chinese communists<br>
5. they are anti american german electioneering politicians<br>
6. they are anti western arabs<br>
<br>
Or would it be more correct to say that<br>
1. everyone who is speaking out against the war is doing so becuase the war is wrong. <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

There are legitimate concerns about this war, that it isn't the right policy, that containment + deterrence are working.  You're 100% right about Ken Clarke also, I managed to catch his speech in the commons regarding the wisdom of a pro-war policy- he spoke with force, commitment and above all reason.  When such heavy hitters as Ken Clarke and Claire Short are openly bucking the party line, one must question whether a war without UN backing is even a feasible strategy for the Blair government.<br>
<br>
Altaris, read the &quot;planned raid&quot; thread on this forum- the main reason Israel has nuclear weapons is to deter Saddam- and they've done it successfully according to Cus- and he should know.  Deterrence has worked against Iraq in the past, containment is currently working.  The only argument against it with any threat presentation whatsoever is that Saddam would pass WMDs to terrorists.  There isn't a shred of proof even leaning in that direction.  I've even pointed out that the Israeli defence minister recently dismissed Iraq as not posing a credible threat to the state of Israel.  Now if he's not convinced that a threat is posed to Israel, why is the Bush administration convinced that a threat is posed to the United States?  <br>
<br>
  You can be dismissive and conjure up any number of reasons why all these nations and individuals speak out against the war.  But what you can't prove is that containment or deterrence have failed, or that a war policy is justified <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at the present time</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  It should be a relatively simple task- if the current policy has failed, how has it failed and where is the proof?  If there is a proven threat, where is it, and where's the proof to support it?  Courage of conviction is all very well- but in the absence of a constructed argument outlining proven threats and failure of the status quo, there is no reason for war.  In the absence of a proven, identified and credible threat, why should our armed forces risk their lives?  Especially if in going to war, we alienate the international community and moderate Arab opinion that would be crucial to winning any war against terror.<br>
<br>
I've said it over and over again- prove the status quo has failed, and prove a credible threat and we have the beginnings of a case for war.  Without such a case, the UNSC will never pass a second resolution and any war without such backing would have &quot;its legitimacy seriously threatened&quot; according to UN Sec-Gen Kofi Anan.  <br>
<br>
France has categorically stated that it would use its veto, not that common for any permanent member in all honesty and especially not for France.  France has used its veto out on a limb like this exactly twice before in the history of the UN.  Such a positive stance on this issue regarding a veto from a nation that uses it so sparingly...shouldn't that give us a moment of pause at least?  Here is a brief history of the veto power and its recent uses by all permanent members:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2828985.stm">news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world...828985.stm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If so many nations, two permanent members and the UN Sec-Gen himself oppose such a policy- are all their positions chosen out of cynical self-interest?  I very much doubt it- the concerns expressed in many cases appear genuine and well-argued.  The case for war still has not been made if so many nations and people are this skeptical about the integrity of a war policy.  And it's so simple to get that support if the facts are there- to show that containment has failed or that deterrence isn't working.  Neither approach has the facts supporting it or is remotely close to being proven.  Given those circumstances, how is there a credible threat, and where is the need for war at this stage?  Nowhere that I can see at least.<br>

It's always the if I had this, if i had that senerio, isn't it Everas?  Some people are able to do things on their own and some with the help of others.  People who get elected for President accomplish something very few people ever have.  No one is automatically selected.  Each person who runs for President is in a unique and different situation.  No one every has the same set of problems, funds, resources, clout, advantage, disadvantage as you seem to think.  I think you are simplistic in your view of thinking if only I had the Bush name, education, money, political connections, or whatever other secret resources you think Bush had; then I can win the primary easy too.  <br>
<br>
Well frankly your wrong.  <br>
<br>
I am well aware and under no delusion that it takes the support and backing of a good organization to win a primary. But there is also a leader who needs to run, delegate, and organize that operation.  And let's not forget drive, motivation, and dedication.  Are you gonna say if only I had Bush's or Gore's personality makeup, I can win as well?  lol<br>
<br>
Anyone with money (aka Ross Perot) can run for President.  But I've said it before and I'll say it again.  I'd love to see anyone on this board run for President and get past the primaries, let alone win the election.  It's not a easy process.  Ross Perot didn't have it easy but he was willing to take the risk.  The process of being President is not easy as Everas would have one think.  Resources alone don't make a man sir.<br>
<br>
Of course I can't tell if your just venting now and just spewing stuff you don't mean.  That's the problem with making statements that you can easliy cast off as saying, &quot;oh i was just venting, drunk, high and didn't really mean what I said.&quot;<br>

Your immature, shortsighted, dissimive tone of what Bush might feel from the loss of troops is really sad.  Some people have evolved beyond the &quot;me me me i am the world phase.&quot; Some people actually know the consequence of holding other people's lives in their hands.  As a religious man, Bush knows full well what he's dealing with.  Even if you think he doesn't.<br>

There is no irony.  If this was the United World Countries of America, then Saddem would be given due Process.

I hereby urge the UN to submit a proposal to Saddem with the following terms:<br>

Iraq hereby promises to give up any WMD programs forever, to permit UN inspectors unconditional access to all of Iraq forever, and if found in violation of either condition, will thereby face war or regime change.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghostrhine>ghostrhine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333333>(3/11/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> s</span><hr size=1> &quot;Just look at what happened last week, we got 2 of their top guys (the brains and money behind 9-11). &quot;<br>

<br>
In the quote where everas mentions we all could run for president if we had W's resources.  Well, he means just that.  Not that everyone who runs is a special case.  He means that W did nothing special, and was born into a very powerful family.  He had such an extreme advantage over the rest of the populace that even though he is not very bright, and he was a coke head, and he didn't win the popular vote.  He was still elected.  <br>
<br>
He pored more money into his campaign than i think any past winner or loser.  If i had an ungodly sum of money i to could run for president if i cared to.  Those that win on their own merrit are the true champions.  That is the point he was making.  <br>
<br>
And stop attacking us because we play EQ.  You must have at one point or else you wouldn't even know how to find this board, grow up please, its time to put the big boy pants on and have a real discusion.  <br>
<br>
Now, show me beyond a reasonable doubt why we should go to war.  And this is the united world of america as you put it, because in america we give all people due process.  Even if they are not citizens, if we brought Osama back we would have to give him due process.  That is the way the american legal system works.  <br>
<br>
So yes you do have to prove beyond a resonable doubt that we should go to war.  You are using people lives for christ sake.  This isn't Warcraft where you just click on your barracks and build a bunch more by spending food and gold or what ever.  These are real freaking people with real familys and real friends and they really bleed and really die.  So before you start spouting off about how we are all ignorant for not getting behind this stupid war.  Think about that for a second.  And then hold that up to your reasons for the war.<br>

If it wasn't within his realm comprehension to begin with he certainly won't be able to respond to it accurately.<br>
<br>
I'll try to simplify it for him though, out of pity. When I said before I was venting I meant it, I have a tendency to get a little emotional about issues I feel strongly about. Issues like sacrificing the lives of Americans and Iraqis for political goals. If I offended anyone other than lurker I apologize.<br>
<br>
However, when I called you an idiot lurker I meant it. You've been spamming this thread with inane arguments for awhile now and you really need to learn when you're out of your league. Taranna and others have clearly and articulately explained a very logical reason for not going to war. And you've responded with the kind of poorly constructed (both logically and grammatically) arguments I'd expect from a preschooler who's been watching the news on Fox while he waits for the Simpsons to begin.<br>
<br>
And as for my dismissive tone regarding Bush's feelings, well where to even begin? If Bush really gave a damn he wouldn't be so quick to send the troops to Iraq in the first place. There's no dire threat that needs to be addressed here. No imminent danger from Saddam. Bush is a mediocre intellect who seems to have no qualms about playing puppet for a few ambitious war mongers.<br>
<br>
Incase I've lost you, and I'd be willing to bet I have, I'm neither being facetious, nor irrational, nor sarcastic. I know you seem to have a difficulty understanding that point so I'll say it again. I'm being completely serious now.<br>

<br>
Because someone disagrees with you, it does not make them ignorant nor does it make them ill informed.  The implication that his arguments are based upon broad generalizations actually subverts your own arguments.<br>
<br>
I have found many of the posts against military actions to be, on the whole, unconvincing.  More so, I think your opinions of Bush have been blatantly biased.  The same bias that you seem to attribute to those of differing ideas and of differing opinions.<br>
<br>
If you agree or disagree please attack the ideas, rather than the person trying to make a point.<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I won’t try to convince you nor anyone else.  This issue is too deeply divided to sway anyone at this point.  I won’t attack your opinion.  As a matter of fact I would appreciate any convincing argument against military action in Iraq.  But I have yet to hear it.  I suspect that the United States government is looking for the same.<br>

<br>
As for a bias against Bush... well I suppose I do have a bias against anyone who's willing to sacrifice life for political power. It has nothing to do with who he is. While I never thought he was a particularly great president (or candidate), I also wasn't against him. I agreed with a few of his early policies, but as time goes on he's drifted further and further towards a hardline rightwing policy. <br>
<br>
I think his current agenda is disgraceful and I fear the future it'll create. I don't understand how people can be willing to sacrifice the freedoms our nation claims to represent just to secure some false sense of security. And if he can maintain the atmosphere of hysteria in the country, who knows what other rights we'll have taken from us.<br>
<br>
So far throughout this thread I've read several very strong arguments urging for a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq. I think the contributers have done an excellent job of establishing their position.<br>
<br>
Perhaps there's been some misunderstanding along the way. If you'd be good enough to explain what you failed to find convincing about the anti-war arguments then maybe we could progress rather than rehash the same points time and again.<br>
<br>
And if I have a cynical view of our government, it's at least justified. Some of the things we've done over the years are truly reprehensible. And I really question whether we're about to engage in a war because our leaders believe it's necessary for the safety of our nature, or merely to further their own political goals.<br>

Further, its unlikely he'd give those weapons to groups like Al'Qaeda. Whats rarely mentioned, is that those citizens of Iraq which he's accused of brutalizing, are members of the same religious sect as many terrorist organizations.

<br>
Saddam is a dictator, not an extremist and not a terrorist. He's never made any move to attack our country... but we seem to be dead set on attacking his.<br>

Of course its also possible that he'll ignore any sound policies and do something stupid. But its also possible that he's been telling the truth and Iraq really doesn't possess the weapons we claim it does.<br>

<br>
As to the question of &quot;prove it&quot; directed at me from Taranna, the Iraqi government is not in compliance with 1441 and their cooperation has been selective at best.  Iraq needs to show STRATEGIC cooperation, which it certainly has not.  Unless a strong statement is made that forces Iraq into strategic compliance, Iraq and specifically Hussein will continue to bait the International community into believing that progress is being made.  If there is no imminent threat, then there is no need to STRATEGICALLY comply.<br>
<br>
After all, it is the goal of the Iraqis to prolong the seemingly inevitable invasion of his country.  The longer he waits, the hotter it gets.  (Yes, our forces will operate in the night to take advantage of nvg technology and cooler temperatures, BUT the forces do not simply dissappear when the sun comes up.  They still must endure the outrageous temperatures that will zap their energy and make them less effective).<br>
