I am the player of Tavil Hubris, a level 65 enchanter on Rallos Zek.  For the past year, I have been an officer and raid leader for MIM.  Due to irreconcilable differences of opinion upon how a guild should be maintained and run, I have decided to leave that post, and to seek family elsewhere.  If anyone has a question as to why I left, they may contact me in game or through private messages.<br>
<br>
I have had a very rich history while on Rallos Zek, and have had the pleasure of knowing and befriending a lot of Ascending Dawn members.  This afternoon and some times in the past, I have spoken with members about AD's atmosphere and direction.  After speaking with my friends, I believe that the atmosphere of AD is one that I could thrive in (some being old MIM members themselves).  I also believe that Ascending Dawn's form of government is how an efficient and effective guild should be run (Adell will know what I mean : P).  Family and direction are very important aspects of a guild to me, and I believe that Ascending Dawn is a very close match for me in personality and in goals, which is why one now finds this application here.<br>
<br>
My history on Rallos Zek began on EverQuest's public release date, but Tavil was not made until August of 1999.  Since then, I have been a member of four guilds (Mysterian Knights, Silent Reign, Knights of Honor, Insanity's Edge(and guilds it merged with).  The first of which was Mysterian Knights.  While in the MKs, I enjoyed running around doing the basic anti-PVP raids or the attack/defense of Freeport and Felwithe.  I was a member of the MKs for a very long while, eventually, the guild became a fragmented society in which many members would come and go, always at the cusp of becoming more, but always falling short.  I decided to join a group of friends that I had made in the Mysterian Knights and join Silent Reign.  I had a fun time in Silent Reign, but as many of you now in AD know, Silent Reign disbanded.  After Silent Reign disbanded, I rejoined the MKs with my friends, but was never content.  I had been good friends with a few people in Silent Reign who joined the Knights of Honor, I followed this group to KoH and enjoyed my time there.  Finally, inactivity and a lot of instability on Rallos Zek caused a lot of core members to leave, letting the guild fade into obscurity.  I was Rallos Zek's first 200 skill jewel crafter, and as such, had the opportunity of working with a lot of different people.  One of which was Tremor.  After speaking with him at length, I decided that the guild Insanity's Edge would be a very good fit for me.  IE was a brotherhood in which I enjoyed my time, and am still good friends with everyone in that guild.  I followed IE through every change they had, merging with Kringe's guild to form the Nephelim, and eventually into their merger with MIM.  While in MIM, I was an officer and raid leader.  I felt as though I did a fair job at it, but ideologies on leadership caused a huge rift and I became very unhappy, eventually leading me to deguild from MIM (which brings us to the present.)<br>
<br>
I have an interesting playtime due to my college schedule.  I am unable to play three days of the week (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday), but am very active on other days (5-10 hours a day).  In this time, I have made every attempt to improve my character, bringing him up to a total of 145 AA points, which include all the major raid AAs as well as some fun ones for myself.<br>
<br>
My gear is decent enough to meet the basic requirements of Ascending Dawn.  I'm able to easily achieve the required resists and instant click items.  My magelo profile may be viewed at:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60363">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=60363</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
With the introduction of PoP, flags have become an essential requirement for any guild raiding or recruitment process, I am in possession of most of the major flags.  I am flagged for HoHA, Lair of Terris, PoV/PoS, BoT, PoTactics.  With the introduction of 85% raid flagging, I should be able to keep pace and eventually acquire the other flags without significantly slowing progress down.<br>
<br>
If I have left any information out, feel free to contact me in game or on this board.  I look forward to proving myself to those members of AD that may have doubts about me or those that do not know me.<br>

I dont know much about him untill the time he merged with mim, wich was around the same time that i joined up with MiM.  When he first started he was on his ench, who he played ratherly reguarly.  He then started a monk wich he was plvling alot of times rather then playing his main, or helping at guild events.  He was awarded a Tunare loot, wich was the essence of nature he now holds.  Within 2 weeks of receiving this loot he quit his ench because he wanted to play his monk.  Stating to me he only played his ench cause mim needed them, but his true love was pulling.<br>
<br>
He then played his monk for a while, got geared up decently, w4 robe, dain belt, primal, shiny trinket of speed.  Then shortly after pop came out and he started seeing how good ench were again he quit his main yet again.  So now he is back on his ench, when questioning him about why he did it, he gave the reason, there was no groups for his monk. <br>
<br>
So we come to more present times like 1 week ago, our first VT clearing, Tavil gets awarded the Aten neck.  This being done to the dislike of many mim cause his play time in VT on that trip counted up to all of an hour of 2 out of 4 days.<br>
<br>
So now 1 week later he has deguilded from and within 12 hours already applied to another guild.<br>
<br>
If something like that doesnt scream selfish then maybe this will.  I was grouped with him once in pov, there was a few people needing help somewhere, he told the group to stick around cause he wanted exp. someone made a comment about this being kinda selfish, and he said yeah your right i am selfish.  although i stayed along with him, so i was also being selfish /shrug.<br>
<br>
He was also a very arrogant person, wich he does admit, and thats not necessarly a bad thing, but it isnt always the best.  He often times embellishes' his contribution.  And no this isnt just through my eye's, i ask others how much he has done when i think he is'nt telling the whole truth and many times they agree with me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aamon>Aamon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/03 2:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Tavil, please explain your side of this.<br>

____________________________________________________<br>
He's right, I was awarded the loot off of Tunare, it was my second loot from MIM after administrating their website begining in December of 2001.  The tunare loot was awarded in September of 2002.  My first loot was a north ToV loot, which was awarded in August of 2002.  Numia was very upset because he felt he should have been awarded the Essence.  As to my monk, I truly enjoyed playing the monk.  He was a blast, but what Numia fails to tell you is that in the timeframe I leveled my monk, MIM had 0 monks that played.  Zeirus was occasionaly used by Kattara as a puller.  I leveled the monk from 1 to 60 and 18 AA just to pull for the MIM raids.  I got zero support leveling my monk after POP came out and it was impossible to solo, so I switched back to my enchanter in frustration that the guild refused to help their main puller.  Also, at the time I switched back, MIM had recruited 4 or 5 other monks.  Numia has also left out the fact that I ALWAYS invited melee characters of MIM that could not get a group to share in my exp.  They just sat down and talked with me while I power leveled them, because I was so put out at how our melees were treated when asking for a group.<br>

Once again, I played my monk for a while.  From MIM, I got primal that was going to rot, the warder 4 robe was going to rot.  4 monks were there, 4 robes dropped.  The only items that I asked for and was awarded over someone was the dain belt and the shiny trinket of speed.  (Which comprise 2 of the 5 loots I've gotten in the year+ I've been in MIM).  I have no desire at all to play my monk.  MIM had their monks, and as far as I was concerned, no one was interested in helping me advance, I spent over 2 hours a day looking for groups.  I'd get in a group, and it would disband 30 minutes later.  That was no fun, and no MIMs would group me simply because they didn't need a monk.<br>

&quot;So we come to more present times like 1 week ago, our first VT clearing, Tavil gets awarded the Aten neck. This being done to the dislike of many mim cause his play time in VT on that trip counted up to all of an hour of 2 out of 4 days.&quot;<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
The time period on this VT landed w/in the Mon/Tue/Wed rotation in which they all know I can not play.  I was awarded the loot based upon the assumption that I earned it.  I had been very active at our raids, and had gone 3 or 4 months since recieving a loot (and in that time, I only asked for two, the neck being one of the items I asked for.)<br>

This gets into more of my reasons for deguilding, which I have made abundantly clear to the membership base of MIM after reading this post.  I've been very unhappy in MIM for over three months, the past week is when I seriously began to consider other alternatives.  Nothing was being done by our officers to help change the situation.   I spoke with a fellow officer and was advised something along the lines of, &quot;If you don't agree with our way of handling things, find a guild in which you will.&quot;  I felt that was good advice, and as such, acted upon it.<br>

&quot;If something like that doesnt scream selfish then maybe this will. I was grouped with him once in pov, there was a few people needing help somewhere, he told the group to stick around cause he wanted exp. someone made a comment about this being kinda selfish, and he said yeah your right i am selfish. although i stayed along with him, so i was also being selfish /shrug.&quot;<br>

I'm not sure what instances he is refering to, but in MIM, we had a very small percentage of active officers.  While not everything done was attributed to me, I had a very large hand in setting up the strategy for a few of our encounters, as well as leading most of our Ssra raids.<br>

I hope this sheds some enlightenment on the post.<br>
<br>
Edit:  One other point I would like to make.  Generally any leaving MIM has brought with them the same sort of accusations.  Dermel and Everas being two that I can easily think of.  I have appologized to MIM for letting them down, but they've got to accept the fact that I am not able to function in a guild or family in which the ruleset is in a major conflict to my own belief system. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tavilrz>TavilRZ</A> at: 3/2/03 2:25:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanerian@ascension10244>Tanerian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.insanitysedge.com/~teren/MIMTeren75s.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/03 3:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> /agree Moffon Man<br>

I always thought it was shady that he switched to his monk after getting Essence of Nature then gets his monk hooked up with about 6 loots in a span of a month in a half decides it's too hard to level so goes back to his ench. Then afew months down the road he gets Aten neck and guess what he is deguilds and is applying to AD. <br>
   Aside from that in Tavils eye's he thinks he did alot for MiM. Well in my eye's he didn't... he didn't raid almost any untill 4-5 months after IE merged, then he goes through the whole unsure of what main to play period. He lead afew raids but Kattara did the majority of the raid leading. I can recall him not wanting to go camp ssra for emp keys because &quot; he needed exp&quot;. I barely even remember seeing him help camp that crap. <br>
  Whenever people try and defend Tavil they always say &quot; oh well he always helps people exp&quot; well god if your class could charm a mob for 400dps and get crazy exp i would hope you would help your guildmates too. <br>
   Tavil you always say you do so much for MiM yet you did no more then the average member, so get off your high horse.<br>
Your the one that is leaving because things got hard. Your the one that isn't going to stick it out through the bad times and try and correct what YOU think is wrong. But hey i guess your the type of person to say screw it and go run off to the greener grass. <br>

Was the best thing I ever did opened up a whole new game to me basically that I wasn't aware of in EQ.  Tavil left MiM due to issues that I'm aware of and that to him were pretty important.  He was a an active officer in the guild that was trying his best to improve it.  Other officers in MiM are content with the way things were going so he made a personal choice to move on.  Do I blame him? not really I know first hand what he was dealing with but deguilding over those subjects was the most extreme thing he could do.  He felt strongly about it and decided to do what he thought would be best for him.  I wish you luck Tavil in whatever your EQ future has in store for you.

ps-  Have to say, Pyro's right.  Any old claims from the days of yore about IE have to be amended to take recent history into account.  I'm a loyal MIM member, but I still bear some scars that from my days in tB that obviously don't touch on the pure disgust I have for the backstabbing that took place with FU or Rebirth (or even DoZ v.1), but IE really did hit me where it hurt.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=81&stop=94>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=397.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=397.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
