Having been guilded with Morb for a while, I have gotten a chance to know him very well. Morb's, well charm I guess you could say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   , is indeed the fact he is outspoken. What some confuse with being an asshole, is merely him speaking his mind. Ask yourselves, would you rather someone in your guild who is quiet and secretive, or someone who is straight with you and upfront.<br>
<br>
Whatever guild Morb is in, he puts his all into, as I saw with Revered. I think not only is Morb a talented player, but an asset to ANY guild. You can count on him to help you any way he can and the occasional reality check haha. Not to mention he is endless amounts of laughs. I would without hesitation give my recommendation for him to your guild. You will not regret it.<br>

In response to Abused about &quot;the issue of the original owner of Silyana etc etc&quot; Hi, I am the original owner of Silyana, I have always paid for the account, I bought the disks.  Gonner only paid when my friends credit card got stolen and he changed it, and I simply forgot to update the info.  So Gonner paid for the account for maybe 2-3 months?<br>
<br>
K, onto the next issue.  Silyana was mine and Gonner's monk, Gonner is a good friend of mine and still is to this day.  He can verify everything I am going to say.  Anyway, after Silyana got a bit higher level, Gonner played her full time.  I had no problem with this, because Gonner was my friend and I wanted him to get more enjoyment out of the game and Gonner told me he was recently told &quot;hell no you cant apply to AD&quot; or something to that extent.  So Gonner played Silyana all the time.  I was happy playing my wizard and I was in AD where so many wonderful people are.  I had no problem with it.  I didn't even care who he gave the info to.<br>
<br>
So anyway, Gonner gives the info to Morb.  I didn't mind, because I was in Revered also, and I liked the hairy-footed little guy.  I saw Silyana online alot, and it was Morb, Gonner seemed to have went AFK for months.  Time went by, I didn't care at all that Morb was playing Silyana.  Anyway, one day I went to log on Silyana, I was curious how my monk was doing, and tired of casting spells, I wanted to punch stuff.  The info was changed.  So I logged into my wizard, and messaged Silyana.  Morb responded, told me it was him and everything, and the second I asked for the info, it seemed like I was put on ignore.  So I was not allowed to get the info for the account where I purchased the disks and powerleveled the character up, and twinked it up, and paid for it for months.  This made me a bit angry.  I always give people the benefit of the doubt.  I would just think, maybe he is busy, maybe he really can't answer me back, maybe he is LD.  So it was cold-sholdered for a couple weeks.  Eventually, Morb went AFk for a while too, so I had no way of contacting him.  And I wanted to play the monk really bad.  So I attempted the original password and it didn't work.  Had my friend call into customer service and gave him all of my EQ disks, and he had to do all this stuff.  So the GM restored the password, and I logged on finding out that the account had expired.  I fire the account back up and log in and start having fun.  Couple weeks later Morb messages me and that's where his argument begins.  I'm not sure where the fungi tunic went.  But I am absolutely certain about the first part of the story.<br>
<br>
I didn't care at all that Morb was playing Silyana.  I trusted Gonner and I trusted that he was responsible enough to trust someone responsible.  I only reacted in the way I did because Morb reused to give me access to my own monk.  I understand changing PW's on other people's accounts, maybe someone got a hold of it, or saw you typing it in.  But refusing the original owner of the character access is totally absurd.<br>
<br>
If you want to know more about this, I will gladly post more on the issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xanthala>xanthala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pussycat Extraordinaire</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/03 5:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> greedy? did you just call me greedy?<br>
<br>
Impulses of greed exist in everyone, but I know I have control over myself.  Pls stop being judgemental about me.  I have hurt no one.  You claim that I have been lying to you, and your proof is that you heard someone in AD say that I was rich.  Read that last line again to yourself and you'll see how dumb it sounds.<br>
<br>
I was rich for about 1 day, and that was the day I bought a horse.  I had the first 100k horse on the server so I could see how people would believe I was rich.  I really have no means of making money.  I was just at the right place at the right time(jinxatX2, Aeries/and his warrior, etc etc) and I collected massively during the AD/RB war.  There is my explanation of such lavish things at such an early stage of the release of luclin.  Other than that, I really had absolutely no significant amount of plats in my bank.  I had I think 20k extra, but I went AFK for a long long time, and that dwindled down by the time I got back.<br>
<br>
Greedy is not a word I would use to describe myself in the context of it actually manifesting itself into actions or underlying motives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xanthala>xanthala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pussycat Extraordinaire</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/03 5:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> I really hope, for your sake, you weren't calling me greedy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oerandunknown>Oeran dUnknown</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/03 6:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> someone let loose xanthala!!<br>

I do want to clarify, however, that I didn't &quot;ignore&quot; you, I actually told you I had valuable items on the account and I had my doubts about giving you the info. Case in point, you admit you have no idea where my fungi tunic went (even though you specifically told me in game that &quot;your friend with info must have taken it&quot;) and you promised to repay it, but you didn't. So this feeling of betrayal you mention is mutual.<br>
<br>
Either way, I've forgotten about it; you have Silyana, I have Kloral, I don't care. I simply don't think it's worth arguing anymore.<br>

<br>
Morb is a great EQ gamer, very knowledgeable of the inter-structure.<br>
<br>
Morb is loyal.<br>
<br>
IMO if both Xan and Morb agree the monk/fungi is a dead issue, he should be allowed to recruit.<br>
<br>
As for his frustration with AD, I feel it is valid, but a little misplaced.  Put yourself in his hairy feet for a second.  You put all your efforts into person after person trying to build a guild all the while those people swearing their loyalty to you just to have them leave once they gain lvl/gear.  If all the people who have passed through Revered would have stayed then there is no doubt IMO that Revered would be an AD rival this very day.  But things being what they are and people wanting to be part of what is 'The Best' at that particular second with no thought of the future and building your (the guild you belong to atm) into 'The Best' of tomorrow.  They forget their oaths of loyalty and move on to something bigger/better for their own good.  <br>
<br>
Lesson in point, It was AD's view of what 'could be' instead of what 'was' that allowed them to move from a small guild with dreams into the top guild on the server.<br>
<br>
Back to the subject, Morb is a good guy and a competent player and would bring more to AD than the average player. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xanthala>xanthala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pussycat Extraordinaire</span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/03 7:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my 2cp</span><hr size=1> Yea its a dead issue.<br>

And yes that was a threat because I really don't like to be judged based on things that are insubstantial, especially if that person is seeking my approval on certain current affairs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kadandrumtally>Kadandrum Tally</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 622<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/03 7:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my 2cp</span><hr size=1> Morb is a stand up guy foo sure.  In fact, he would make a strong addition to AD.  He knows his role and he damn well knows the game.<br>
<br>
I had two characters in Revered, Balkaar and Kad.  Morb was always willing to help others out and when the EQ-shit hits the fan, Morb is a damn dependable person to have in your corner.  If Moor wasn't out fighting a war, I know he would say the same and probably alot more.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't mind Ruhi.  He always says that stuff.  There is at least one person (might be more, not sure) in AD that when he was a recruit, Ruhi would say &quot;No way in hell is that person going to be a member.&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Take it all with a grain of salt my friend, a grain of salt.<br>
