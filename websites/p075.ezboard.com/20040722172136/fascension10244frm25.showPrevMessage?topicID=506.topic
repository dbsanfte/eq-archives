This thread is in no ways meant to provoke any kind of drama, so if you want to make blatant flames or derail it please start a new topoc called Seeknd licks balls, and refrain from it here. I would simply like an open discussion of the &quot;official guild war policy&quot; decided upon between AD/Wudan/MIM and whoever else. Recently, many of my friends from AD and Wudan were threatened with being deguilded for raiding with DoZ. Needra told people in Wudan that bitched about it that there was a guild war agreement, and that they were sticking behind it. Unfortunately it seems if there is an agreement, its very one sided, and a complete double standard. Dont get me wrong, Its not that i disagree with the top guilds making terms, and abiding by them. But atleast make it coherent so that we can all follow them. <br>
<br>
Ive heard so many different versions of this, its hard NOT to be in the wrong. First it was no raiding with ANY warring guild. This does not include grouping or exping. Then it became, you can raid with them as long as they have killed the mob b4 without help. (convienently altered when I complained about AD flagging new MIM recruits for RZTW). But recently, it seems the policy is you can raid with any guild warring DoZ.<br>
<br>
I know that some of you dont like people in doz, especially me and sadko. We are shit talkers and hardcore pvpers, which doesn't fit what parts of EQ you enjoy. Hell i dont even like Sadko. But most members in DoZ have done nothing to you, and have many friends in all guilds. All i ask is that you make a coherent policy that we can all follow, sp that we can all enjoy the aspects of EQ that we enjoy, without stepping on each others feet.<br>

This is the furthest thing from an objective post, which is what one would hope to find under a thread titled &quot;Official Guild War Policy&quot;<br>
<br>
No where in this worthless post of yours did you ever EVER state a new fact or bring anything to light that may be an insight into recent drama or anything; rather the opposite is true-- you have shadowed the lines even more with your incohesive psyco babble about double standards and conspiracy theories and all that bullshit. <br>
<br>
As I said in Gloryia's post, I seriously suggest both you and sadko ban yourselves from all EQ public message boards and prevent the animosity most people feel for you assholes from even being formed. Let me remind you-- your guild is a smalltime bunch of punks.. I'm not against that sort of thing personally but hey, I know it and you know it: You're punks. No one would even care, but instead of just doing your own rebellious thing you have to make it everyones buisness what your every action is. <br>
<br>
In closing in my clearly non-objective post, shut the fuck up, stop posting, and quit being such a little bitch..<br>

<br>
So you see, you've done something to annoy everyone. Let me say it again clearly so you can understand it: SHUT THE FUCK UP OR LEARN TO ACCEPT THE CONSIQUENCES <br>
<br>
I guess you accepted the consequences, and only bless us with your presence on message boards now. At no point did i attempt to &quot;shine light&quot; on this situation, because im ASKING A QUESTION. Not to you, but to people that actually matter and dictate policy on EQ. You know, the same people that rejected your application and told you to have a nice day. I deal with consequences, you just quit and talk smack like a true champion. The only reason i even brought this us, is because Adell wanted to kos me for attacking a new AD recruit which was RAIDING with the guild he just left a week later. I have no intention of creating any problems with AD and apologize for attacking a new recruit, even though i had 0 idea he had left Fusion.<br>
<br>
This policy really doesnt hurt DoZ since we aren't able to raid any mobs due to amount of people attempting to cockblock us. All it does is prevent our friends in these guilds from hanging out with us, under the threat of getting deguilded. In the light of people like Ealill, whom stuck up for his right to hang out with his friends, and got stripped of his leadership, and eventually left wudan, I feel its important to outline a clear policy so that other friends in these guilds know what crosses the line of this &quot;policy&quot;. <br>

Ad isn't a dictatorship, we have an elected council. Sure from time to time, things get decided without the general consensus, but not major issues.<br>
<br>
As for the mistaken attacking, sure I can see this happening. I seriously doubt I'm going to guildstat someone who is raiding with a kos guild, and was a member of that kos guild before. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately though, this still isn't an excuse, it is still your fault, but I don't believe it to be something that we should kos you over, I don't see that as being fair, no.<br>
