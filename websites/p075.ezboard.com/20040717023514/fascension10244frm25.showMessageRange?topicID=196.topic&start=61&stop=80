Also i have seen interviews wiht inspectors who talked about how they would show up at a site, be detained at the entrance for an hour or two, the whole while they can hear trucks rolling out the back before they are allowed in?(this is the initial set of inspectors mind you)<br>
<br>
About the US created the beast stuff. Well this is partially true. From what ive read and seen during the 80s there was a real fear than Iran would overrun the middle east. Iraq had teh only credible force to oppose them short of israel. We decided to help the perceived lesser of two evils based on what we knew at that time. Hindsight is 20/20. But remember Iraqs nuclear program was totally supported by the french. The built him a reactor that would give him working nukes today if Israel didnt take it out. Russia and China sold him anything and everything he asked for in the way of conventional arms. The us did provide some credit but it was a smidgen compared to the loans the rest of the middle east gave iraq.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Curious what people against disarming have to say <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Who on this thread is against disarmament?  I'm completely in support of disarmament by peaceful means- and by force <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>if necessary</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Such a use of force isn't necessary yet, it'd be premature, disproportionate and fly in the face of international law.  No one in their right *mind* is against disarmament.  Listen to what Hans Blix said today- Iraq <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cooperating, is disarming- he and the experts on the ground feel they can do their job.  Colin Powell, someone who I respect most highly in the Bush administration has a very difficult brief in front of him.  But for all that, he is neither a weapons expert nor in Iraq right now, doing the hard job of disarmament, enaging the Iraqi regime and interviewing scientists.  He has a vested interest, Blix does not, Blix is an expert on the ground, he is not.  Hans Blix and his team are the ones who should guide or policy- if not, what the devil is the point of appointing them to do a job there?<br>
<br>
You made the point on the 6-day war I was driving at Bollix- the point is not whether Israel was justified in defending itself, but whether Israel was right to occupy another nation's land to this day.  You're also right btw- the West Bank no longer belongs to Jordan under international law- it did at one stage, but now belongs to the Palestinian people under the &quot;land for peace&quot; scheme Carter started, Clinton continued and Arafat + Bush scuppered in quick succession.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been America's most potent weapon of both offence and defence since the days of Woodrow Wilson.&quot; Amen.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Brilliantly chosen quote Tyranxus, couldn't agree more.  Less legitimacy = less cooperation = more perceived injustice = easier recruitment and softer targets for terrorists.  Plain as the nose on one's face really.<br>
<br>
Now, onto the substance of the discussion, usual caveats apply.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>omg stop talking already Taranna.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you're trying to get a rise out of me Alt, I'm sorry to disappoint you.  I'd rather this didn't descend into a shouting match- it's been a rather civilised debate (if heated at times) thus far- shame that some prefer the purely confrontational aspect.<br>
<br>
To the point of your first sentence- no one's forcing you to read what I write.  If you don't like it- then just scroll down past my posts and think nothing of it.  But this is a public internet forum- unless a moderator thinks my comments trolls, barbs, vulgar or otherwise inappropriate, I'll speak my mind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is upsetting to think that someone as smart as yourself could actually believe in what you are saying,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Thanks for the backhanded compliment.  To put it bluntly- I believe in logical process against an ethical backdrop and the legitimacy of international law.  These two principles shape the way nations deal with each other, and is one almost all nations, the United States and Britain included subscribe to.  Without it no treaty or agreement signed under the umbrella of international institutions is valid or credible.  Threatening or undermining that creates even more danger for us at a time when we should unite against the real threats of terrorism and the poverty it thrives in- not shadow-box with suspicions or deal unevenly with rogue states.  If those principles cause you disbelief, then I suggest you come up with a better idea to preserve the integrity of international law, the same international law that guarantees the sanctity of your human rights no matter what country you find yourself in, the same international law that has resolved nearly every conflict on the globe since the end of the second world war.  If you have a better way for nations to be sure of each other's word with a form of legitimacy, I'm all ears.<br>
<br>
I am further discouraged by your disbelief at the idea that freedom and democracy can be defended by means that compromise its principles.  If in dealing with a despot we sacrifice the principles we fight for, then why do we abide by them in the first place?  If due process is the governing principle of the democratic process- why is it(inspections) being pressured, tampered with and threatened with termination by the US and British administrations?  I don't think these questions of policy and principle, (to pick but two examples of my arguments) should provoke disbelief.  Rather they should trigger concern and worry, that in defending freedom we ourselves become the aggressor.  And if that basic sacrifice of principle takes place, there is nothing to say the same administration that makes such a sacrifice in foreign policy wouldn't be willing to make it elsewhere.  Even the tiniest chance of that occurence should worry people Altaris, I'm a bit suprised you aren't worried about that yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I have to disagree with just about everything you have posted in this thread.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I have no problem with you disagreeing with me whatsoever- as I've already stated, I'm certainly in the minority of opinion on this message board.  Not necessarily in terms of public opinion though- a sizeable majority of opinion in the UK (and I'm told a hefty number in the US)- are dead against the idea of a war without the sanction of a UN resolution authorising it.  As regards your statement, be advised that the words &quot;I disagree&quot; constitute no case for war.  It's a statement of position unsupported by reasoning, evidence or precedent- so you'll understand if I'm unconvinced by the position as you present it there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>hard headedness(if thats a word), and unwillingness to see other peoples points of view. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hard-headedness?  The fact that I've made an objective policy judgement on a course of action makes me hard-headed does it?  /boggle.  Name-calling does little to advance the discussion- but I don't accept that I have been hard-headed or stubborn- merely passionate in the pursuit of the best policy as I see things.  <br>
<br>
As for an unwillingness to see other people's point of view- point me to a single instance in this thread where I haven't Altaris.  In refuting someone's position there is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>implicit acknowledgement</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  A simple example- people on the thread hinted that containment had failed- I asked them for proof and I haven't seen a shred yet.  Suspicions and possibilities were put to me on the subject and I answered with reasoned rebuttal backed up by evidence.  How am I ignoring their point of view if I'm directly responding to it?  If I wrote a post entirely about barnyard owls- that would be avoiding their position.  I don't see legitimate rebuttal of a position being the same thing as ignoring it.  And to be perfectly frank, when the arguments for the opposite point of view are as flimsy and unsupported as this- I don't see why I should play devil's advocate for a client lacking a case.<br>
<br>
But just in case I was playing the ol' <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>l'avocat du diable</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- here's how the reasoning for war might go, with rebuttal:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Saddam is an evil nasty man- tyrants need to be swept aside by the forces of good.<br>
<br>
Answer:  What Bollix said.  Vigilante regime change, however noble the purported claims are- is expressly forbidden by international law.  In addition, it's a war of aggression- there is no element of self-defence involved.  If the US and GB go it alone- that'd be the equivalent of a vigilante serial-killer going around the neighbourhood eliminating whoever he pleased that he deemed was a threat to his safety.  The law, whether domestic or international, does not provide for people or nations to take the law into their own hands.  Next time the US needs a trade ruling in the WTO, or wants concessions elsewhere- unilateral action threatens those interests and compromises the very ground previous agreements stand on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Regime change (for whatever reason) serves our interest.  In addition, it could well make other undemocratic nations think twice about crossing us, since they might well be next.  They might even decide that Iraq ruled by a US/UK military council would be a good reason for them to switch to democracy, sharpish, particularly countries in the region.<br>
<br>
Answer:  The big problem with regime change in terms of policy responses- is that it's applicable to a lot more countries than you might think- and administrations advocating it never look at the shoe on the other foot.  For example, consider if a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; took a look at the Bush administration and say to themselves:  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Wait a minute- he was barely elected, he got less of the peoples' votes and his administration is in power.  That administration is locking up tonnes of people in horrible conditions in Guantanomo bay, is cited in the top 20 abusers of human rights by Amnesty International.  He's pulled out of key international treaties (landmines, Kyoto, ABM, ICC, missile disarmament)- and worst of all their administration has weapons of mass destruction!  Not only that- but their government in the past has actually used the worst of these, nuclear weapons....*twice!*  How about us, a coalition of the willing, on the strength of this evidence, invade the US, depose the Bush administration and disarm the buggers?  And forget about international law and the terrorists, we can er, always worry about them later- I'm sure they'll be kind enough to keep busy while we do this&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Think that sounds absolutely utterly absurd?  Well you're right of course- except that this is exactly the structure of the case for war against Iraq.  Saddam wasn't elected, he's violated international law (UN resolutions in this case, not breaking treaties), he's used WMD in the past (not nukes though), he commits horrible human rights violations against his people.  If you applied that logic as a case for war, you could make a case to invade nearly any nation on the planet.  This is why nations are opposing it, this is why the overwhelming majority of people in most countries oppose it- and it's why 2 permanent members would veto a resolution at this stage authorising war.  And the irony is, the 9 votes for victory haven't even been secured, so the veto is irrelevant at this stage!<br>
<br>
Now, onto the mistaken notion that it would deter other rogue states.  Just as the US cranks up pressure on Iraq- North Korean fighter jets buzz an American reconaissance aircraft <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in international waters</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I think we all remember what happened when the Chinese government forced a spyplane down from international waters a while ago, the crew barely escaped with their lives.  This North Korean incident though- coming from a government that has already threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States is being played <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>down</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by the administration?  Way to deter those other rogue states guys.../midget cheer<br>
<br>
As for the idea that a democratic Iraq would start a domino effect- Egypt becoming democratic hasn't affected anyone for half a century.  Same with Turkey- it's neighbours to the east are Iran and Syria, and Turkey's been a democratic nation for ages.  Iran, Syria, who am I forgetting...Oh yeah...Iraq too!  Nice little bit of influence there eh?  Riddle me this pro-war camp:  if Turkey, a democracy since 1909, hasn't influenced Iraq to be democratic in almost 100 years...then how the hell is a democratic Iraq going to make any other nation in the region democratic?  You see Altaris- I'm not ignoring the opposing point of view or its arguments:  but if those arguments are devoid of proof and have one foot in the grave with the other sliding rapidly towards it...how is that my fault?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Containment has failed.  Because Iraq has close ties with terrorist groups, or has the means and the will to use WMD directly.  The possibility also exists that maybe Saddam will give WMDs to extremist groups that he has alleged links with, and maybe they'll slip past security and detonate it.<br>
<br>
Answer:  This is, as far as I'm concerned the only real solidly reasoned argument in the whole of the pro-war case thus far.  There's just one problem though- for this reasoning to carry with any sense of credibility- you need <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>proof</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Proof of the terrorist links, proof of the WMDs and the ability to use them proof above all, any circumstances under which Saddam might give WMD to any terror group such as Al-Qaeda (his mortal enemies).  Proof in other words, that containment has failed.<br>
  <br>
In addition- there isn't only containment being deployed here, but deterrence.  You surely admit that Saddam is a surviver, he doesn't miscalculate, nor is his regime suicidal.  Therefore he can be deterred- and 250,000 American troops, 80,000 British troops and 100+ nukes in the region is more than enough.  If the US + NATO deterred the Soviet Union, a superpower for 50 years, then surely even if containment somehow has failed...surely the US/UK can deter him for long enough that the inspectors can finish their work?  The reasoning isn't there for war, the proof isn't there, therefore the case for war itself isn't there Altaris.<br>
<br>
I have openly and directly acknowledged the clear policy directives of the Bush administration and demonstrated why they're either flawed utterly, or in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> simply incomplete and unproven, as well as openly misleading given policy on North Korea and China.  I've examined the main case for war, and picked it to pieces with little effort.<br>
<br>
You may disagree with me Altaris, but that is the main case for war as far as I can tell- and it barely holds a drop of water.  If you have disagreement with my reasoning or linked evidence that I've included in previous posts- feel free to refute them.  If you want to ignore me, that's fine- if you just want to say &quot;I disagree&quot; without presenting reasoning that's fine too.  Trouble is- you might say you disagree with me, but I can't see anything beyond suspicion, fear and paranoia that extends the case for war any further than I've examined it.  If people are ok with an agenda of suspicion, fear or paranoia driving support for government policy, then that's fine too I suppose.  Just don't ask me to jump on the bandwagon, I prefer reason and due process to regime change by executive order.  Especially if it creates the perfect environment for terrorists. <br>

<br>
The last time &quot;Euro's&quot; ignored such a dictator as Saddam.... France suddenly became a part of Germany and WWII began. <br>
<br>
Iraqi's are being suppressed just like Afgahnistan. Look at Afgahnistan now, they are working on a democracy and civil rights for woman. <br>
<br>
The US recieves 10 percent of its oil supply from the middle east. The US mostly recieves its oil from South America and Central America. <br>
<br>
Why does France Germany and Russia do not want this war to happen? Money.  All 3 have deals with Iraq for billions of dollars. Does the US want to secure the oil fields? Fuck Yes we do... you know why? because that is Iraq's only source of revenue... when this is all over, the faster the country can get on it's own feet...the faster I can come home.<br>

<br>
Personally i do not feal any sympathy for Saddam for indeed he is one of those tragic-comical dictator figures that have seized power in the third world after descolonization finished but then again Winston Churchill once said &quot;Each Country has the government it deserves&quot;.<br>
<br>
Moordred i find you're comparison of Hitler and Saddam lacks seriousness not to mention you're cartoon like comments about France and Germany which are false and offensive comming from a country whose native soil wasnt even bombed during WW2. Trully they are terribly out of place as they trivialize the suffering WW2 caused.You mention the fact US does not depend on Iraq for oil true but i personally believe aggression against Iraq is not about oil per se, it is about control of oil. Before the Iraq crisis, the U.S. imported about $18 billion of crude oil annually from the Mideast, but spent $31 billion keeping military forces there. Why? Control of Mideast oil gives the U.S. domination over Europe and Japan, which draw most of their oil from the region.<br>
<br>
Domination of the Mideast and Caspian Sea oil will assure the U.S. a permanent stranglehold over China and India, as well as Europe and Japan.<br>
<br>
Oh and Btw in case you are interested France never became a part of Germany after the armistice at Compiegne 1941; the old german provinces of Alsace and Loreine were given back to germany these two provinces have a strong mixture of both german and french culture and during the last 400 years (yes i know 400 years might sound like a daunting figure for a young nation like yours) have changed hands between the two nations some eight times basically belonging to who ever won the last war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=miradori>Miradori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/6/03 7:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tarranna...</span><hr size=1> I just wish to give you my compliments, Tarranna.

Obscure history trivia bit;<br>
<br>
U.S. native soil was bombed during world war II. The japanese tied incendiary bombs to large weather baloon like devices and floated them across the pacific. Several of them actually landed in the continental U.S.<br>
<br>
Granted while no significant, except to those whose property it landed on, damage was done it does invalidate the above statement.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there was that whole Pearl harbor thing, not sure how you wish to count that as Hawaii was not added as a state until March 18, 1959.<br>

What thing is : USA wants Iraq oil that for now French, Germ and Russia had... Yes money hehe<br>

Tho i can bet a lot of money that France, Germany and Russia will be present in case of war to have like others a part of the cake!<br>
<br>
Edit : On a side note, Saddam is a dictator, and ?? NO Governements cares of that...Watch Chavez in Venezuela, Watch North Corea, Watch Pinochet in Chilli, Watch Millosevic in Yougoslavia... and the list is long...<br>
All they want is Oil and money and influence...so as long as the cake is separated...they are all ok, if not then they start to not be<br>

'Master!' he cried 'Someone bumped into me into the crowded market place this morning, When I turned around I saw it was Death. I caught his eye and he gave me such a strange and terrifying look that I am now in fear of my life. Master, please lend me your horse so I may flee, With your help I can be far away in Samarra by nightfall'<br>
<br>
The merchant was a generous man and lending the servant a fine horse, he sent him forthwith on his way. Later, the merchant himself went to the market place and saw Death standing in the crowd. 'Why did you frighten my servant this morning and gave him such a threatening stare?', 'I did not threaten him,' said Death. 'It was a look of a surprise, I was astounded to see a man this morning in Baghdad when I have an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.'<br>

<br>
1. The blame for the  US creating this  issue?  Not bloody likely.  If i recall correctly the British (dont sue me, i believe it was them) were the ones that created the initial problem when the borders for Iraq were &quot;created&quot; it  never took into account religious regions.  Sunni, Shi'ite, and Kurds were all thrown into the mixing pot.  (you might also refer to Yogoslavia for another reference of poor border making)<br>
<br>
2. No-Fly zones are not santioned or created due to UN resolutions.  To an extent yes, to an extent no.  UNSCR 688 was created to end the repression of the Iraqi civilian  population.  The goal of the southern no-fly zone was to ensure these things did not take place.  Bombing and strafing runs were the primary attacks against the Shi'ite muslims in southern Iraq.  It isnt just the americans still patrolling the no-fly zone, it is American, Russian, French and United Kingdom aircraft doing the patrolling.  Northern watch is patrolled by US, Turkish and British with the same goals but protecting the Kurdish people.<br>
<br>
hope that clears up a couple of misconceptions.  Information is key.

Another story, Dubious in it's mixed mythology, but helpful in it's content nonetheless especially for you, Tells how God Krishna was worried about the coming influence of Saturn in his life (Saturn is the destruction is now conjunction with aquarium) He decide to escape the demanding lesson's of the old schoolteacher and, turning himself into a hippopotamus, hid in a jungle swamp, dank, smelly and dark. After a period of wallowing in the mud, he dragged himself out, cleaned himself up and change back into his divine form, He met Saturn again a little while later, 'Ha, ha!' said Krishna, 'I escaped you this time! I was hiding in a swamp, disguised as a hippopotamus.', 'I know' Saturn replied quietly. 'I thought you were having quite an unpleasant enough time and there was no need for me to even come near you.'<br>

Dresden - approx. 500 000 (30%)<br>

Ignorant nitpicking like on the post above clearly shows that Americans don't have any collective idea on what war on one's own soil is like. And before you mention 9/11, even though it was bad, read the numbers above and think again.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The last time &quot;Euros&quot; ignored a dictator, France was overrun and surrendering in less time than it takes me to prepare my income taxes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And what might be the relevance of that line with the present situation? Obviously Hitler's Germany was very strong both in military and in productivity, whereas Iraq in it's prime couldn't even win against Iran and now it's strength is a fraction of that. Granted, Saddam and Hitler may have similar personal characteristics but comparing their nations doesn't show very good judgement. Unless of course unlike Europeans, instead of rationale you're using the 'good - evil' criteria or, like increasingly nowadays, the 'us - them' criteria.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, the last time the US liberated a country, it razed it to the ground, soothed it with empty promises and left the UN to clear up the mess. And instead of working on democracy and civil rights it's more along the lines of trying not to starve or freeze to death or not to get in between of two warlords' attempts to carve their own kingdoms. Oh, and growing heroin.<br>

Thanks. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps in making Europe a better place.<br>

Seriously though, look at what your current administration has managed in a couple of years. The budget has gone from surplus to huge deficit. You have alienated many former good allies and galvanized those who had mistrust in the US. Civil rights which you seem to love so dearly have been reduced. Probably the only party who has benefited has been the US military. I watch with great interest if the US can pull a Soviet Union and arms race into bankruptcy all by itself. That however doesn't bother me in the least. Worse is that the US has practically given the finger to the rest of the world in issues that affect the whole world. Kioto environmental treaty, ABM treaty, ICC (International Criminal Court) treaty and so on. Now, in an attempt of heroic proportions, it's trying to undermine the stability of the present world order by rejecting the UN, which despite it's flaws is the only forum we have for settling issues between countries. Someone was speaking of trust to the US. I wouldn't trust the current leadership of the US to govern an oil corporation, much less to dictate how the world should be run. I believe that had the US taken a little less arrogant and much more cooperative attitude from the start (of new government), things would have gone much more smoothly, up to and including the Iraq issue. My problem is that when the US fucks up, the whole world will suffer.<br>
