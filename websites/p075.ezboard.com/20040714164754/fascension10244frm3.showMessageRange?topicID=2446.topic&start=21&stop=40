 He has no significance in the book.

I dunno, mixed feelings to it. I really felt this should have just.. ended. it had like 5 endings (left after the EXTREMELY GAY scene with Frodo waking up, i stumbled out of the theatre almost in tears) and it was really sort of ridiculous at the end.<br>
<br>
Gandalf was a joke in RotK. I really think he could have done more, i mean come on his one trick was a beam of light comming from his staff to fend off the Nazgul. He did more in Fellowship vs. Saruman than the other 2 books combined (Fellowship had the fight vs. Balrog too)<br>
<br>
Merry pissed me off. He didn't know he was riding with Eowyn until the fight (i might be wrong about this one though). I really think Peter Jackson tried to make the hobbits more important than they really were a lot of the time.<br>
<br>
That stuff was annoying but I can understand why it was taken out. What really pissed me off was the final battle-- Where was Gothmog with the mithril tunic and sting?!?! that build up and the climactic power of (once again) Gandalf calling everyone to fight was sorely missed in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Overall, eh it was ok I guess. I just really wish they had made Gandalf more powerful, as oppose to an idiot old guy fighting with a stick and a little knife (it wasnt even glowing! ITS GLAMDRING FOR FUCKSAKE)<br>
<br>
K, thats me being a tool. enjoy.<br>

well, i duno what you would want him to do more exactly..he isnt a warrior and what he did in fighting was pushing the brink of his capabilities i think as it was. His battle against the Balrog was not a fight against Sauron as much but of a devilry of Morgoth, Saurons teacher so to speak. He never realy &quot;battled&quot; with Saruman so to speak (the wizards duel was all PJ)..he merely gave council and used just a hint of his power cause he is the same thing Sauron is, a Maiar<br>

Gaydar alert was going off the instant this scene opened. Seriously this scene really mad me wanna yack in my popcorn bucket. I liked all the other &quot;endings&quot;. <br>
<br>
Forgive me for not reading the books completely, but wasnt there supposed to be some big showdown between Gandalf and The Witch King? That woulda been a wicked scene imo.<br>
<br>
The Undead Army was alittle cheesy, woulda liked to seen alittle more detail there. <br>
<br>
Overall I thought it was a great movie, definately going to see it again. This time I will know when to go take a leak during the laughing bedroom borderline midget porn portion of the film tho =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bluierz>bluie rz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#333333>(12/22/03 2:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2446.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> return of the king</span><hr size=1> I really liked the third movie.  I cannot say it is better than the other two, since I don't think they can really be compared.<br>
<br>
I liked how Arwen helped to inspire Aragorn to become the &quot;man she saw inside him.&quot;  That love story and how he stayed true to her was awesome.  Her chosing a mortal life to live with him over an eternity of life without him was so touching!  hehe<br>
<br>
I thought the part with Eowyn slaying the witchking was well ... I mean I'm all for power for women but that just cracked me up &quot;I am not a man!&quot;  It would have been tight to have a Gandalf/witchking showdown.  I think Merry knowing in advance that he was riding with her wasn't that big a give away.  You could tell she was going to go the whole time.  The only thing I was worried about was that she would hit on Aragorn more and he would succumb to her even though he had given his heart to Arwen and that wouldn't be right :p <br>
<br>
I liked the books and the scourge of the shire and all that.  I was kind of disappointed they didn't have that.  I thought maybe the crazy king scene was a little too much.  The food dribbling down his chin to the burning of his own son seemed sort of drawn out.  The only part that made it worth it was when he died by just burning and jumping off the cliff... that was hiliarious... everything else he did took so much time, even eating; but when he goes to kill himself it's like jump over, get on with the battle please.<br>
<br>
Gimli of course was awesome &quot;that still only counts as one&quot; and Legolas... Orlando Bloom must I say more?  <br>

<br>
For example the magical and lure of the ring.  I think the creation of any conflicts between Frodo and Sam would be to show just how powerful the effect of the ring is.  As a viewer you would then see Frodo acting in ways he would never act, just ways to show the burden of the ring that if you are reading you could see in other ways.<br>
<br>
You just have to leave some things out, otherwise the movie would be impossible to make.<br>
<br>
One of the best examples of writers where it is very hard to transfer their work to screen is Stephen King.  In some works he goes deep into the mind.  It very hard to put the mind on film.  My favorite is The Shining.  Not only do you have a lot of mind fucking, you have as a character, a hotel, which is evil and very hard to portray in film.  The good part is Jack Nicholson is a good actor and does a good job giving some crazy looks, so even though you can't see into his brain, you just know he is going nuts.<br>
<br>
Then you have The Stand.  They made that into a mini-series and still left out tons of interesting shiz.  Seeing how the average script is about 125 pages, and RoTK is alone what, close to 400(I can't remember), some things have to be cut out, but as someone said, DVD version may have a lot more interesting stuff.<br>
<br>
The key here is to not compare.  If you compare a book with an adaption, the original is always going to give you a more peronal and enjoyable experience.  Enjoy them both for what they offered to you.  These films so far have been amazing, but obviously if you have never read the books, then you should go out and do so.<br>

Gandalf lets Sauramon leave Orthanc with Wormtongue.  And while all the other events that take place after that event are going over Sauramon and Wormtongue go to the Shire and take over with the help of other humans and some of the more power hungry hobbits.  So that when Frodo and the others return to the shire hes completly corrupted and destroyed everything they loved about their home.  So they rally all the hobbits and Merry and Pippin become like hobbits military leaders so to speak.  They run off all the humans are take down sauramon and Frodo decides to let him go but Wormtongue turns on him and stabs and kills him then tries to run off and gets gunned down by hobbits archers. But the director didn't like that part so he left it out which really pisses me off.<br>

I'm sure 50% of the audience haven't read the books, let alone seen the previous 2 movies (from what I hear a lot of my friends didn't even see 2nd movie) ect,ect. The problem with books are the nuonces that make a ripple effect and overall affect the end of the plotline. PJ did his best trying to get the more important things in (which were still hard as hell trying to put in when you have millions of people with ideas already formed about it). While it's easy to bitch and moan about what was missing and what was too changed, it's even easier to respect it as it's own work of art. I personally enjoy books gone on film because you get to form your own ideas and then see someone else's ideas on the bigscreen. Actually, after thinking of what I just said, it must be fucking hard for PJ to put in scenes and have them portray the book, not to what he thinks, but to what EVERYONE else thinks. That's why nobody can truely read the book, form the image, and see it on the bigscreen. He had to account for SO many different views. I think the guy did a great job. <br>

I think the DVD set is going to be spectacular, there will be alot more deleted scenes and the likes. It should make even the most hardcore of hardcores happy.<br>

I liked the 3rd part alot. Some things I found notable.<br>
<br>
The gay love shit between all the hobbits was a little too much. I mean fuck off already. But what Sirgayo was saying about hobbits not being important is false! It was a hobbit that found the ring (Bilbo) and it was probably only hobbits that could have done what Frodo did. They had a strange inner strength, as Gandalf noted many times, and oddly were ignored by the rest of the world. Including Sauron and the ring itself, they were outside his plans and that was why I think they were the ones so needed to destroy the ring.<br>
<br>
I also thought it was funny how Gandalf was manhandling Denethor the whole movie. He was bitch slapping that mofa all over lolzorz. That was kinda odd though.<br>
<br>
Tom Bombadil is like the hippie of middle earth. Noone really understands him, I am glad they left him out honestly.<br>
<br>
Elrond (hello Mr. Anderson, fucking guy is ruined for me forever no matter what movie he is in) was not done right really as mentioned.<br>
<br>
I was not happy with the 2nd movie really, as Isi said he made Faramir look like a retard (oh hey Frodo almost gave the ring to the Nazgul, maybe I should let him go now!) and other changes I didn't think were necessary.<br>
<br>
Still though, this movie series is probably the most important one of my life. It is that big for me that they made this movie and so well.<br>
<br>
P.S. Hey Somthor fuck you.
