stab0r:  i mean if we try to control iraq we're going to end up withdrawing.  there will be too many casualties for the american public to support and extended operation there.  the exact details won't be identical, i think you misinterpretted what i was trying to say<br>

smawty:  you wanna talk about human rights violations, maybe you should read what the government has enabled with the Patriot Act, the new things the justice department is trying to add, the INS registration system (yah terrorists are gonna go fingerprint themselves, maybe they'll have tea with the FBI while they're at it).  jesus christ do you know what the war is going to be like?  we want to drop THOUSANDS of HUGE bombs on iraq.  do you think we're going to hit saddam?  fuck no he's gonna be chillin in an underground hideyhole (like dick chaney back when 9/11 went down)<br>

Yeah I'll call a big BULLSHIT on that.  Come on man, US government sponsoring terrorism?  You must be fucking kidding me right?  A stronger CONNECTION between the US and terrorism than Iraq?  You do know that there are credible reports of Al Qaeda operatives in Southern Iraq right?  You do know that the IRAQI government is sponsoring and training fucking civilian SUICIDE squads right?  Do you see the US training suicide squads?  I'll concede that the there probably is not the same type of Al Qaeda connection as in Afghanistan but shit man give me a fucking break here!  US sponsoring, permitting, financing terrorism against its own interests?  An emphatic no way.<br>

I understand your attempts to make intelligent and meaningful posts.  But there is a line to cross and you just did.  In fact, your far fetched ideas are beginning to make me sick.  It seems to me that you, Everas, will say anything and concoct any rediculous argument in order to garner support on this board.  You want me to wake up?  Well slap me silly baby cause if I'm asleep, then your line of bullshit makes much more sense.<br>

&quot;There are some things that need to be understood. The primary driving force behind anything a politician does in a democratic environment is to get re-elected at all costs. They really don't care about anything else. If they do some good while doing something to get re-elected well that is a by product but it was never the original intent (I know this is a very cynical view). &quot;<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Disagree totally,  Tony Blair is a primary example of this.  He's backing what he believes and i dont think he stands a snowcones chances in hell of getting re-elected based on what i have been reading about his own labor party revolting against him. He could of backed out and saved his political career but he hasnt. hes sticking to his guns so to speak.  Course I am not english but thats an outsiders view based on bbc and cnn reports.<br>
<br>
Also your suggestion that WTC should of been a wake up call to us, It was really, but not in the way that so many pacifists would like.  Look at it like this.  Some dude doesnt like the way your acting so he comes and kicks you in the nuts when you arent looking.  It hurts like hell and you suffer for awhile. you can either:<br>
<br>
A) Fight back, letting everyone see that you wont allow yourself to be walked on<br>
<br>
B)  Turn the other cheek, Sending everyone watching the message that if you want the USA to change its ways all you need to do is hit them hard enough and they will buckle.<br>
<br>
Now granted Iraq isnt the same as the Al'Qaeda and above analogy doesnt exactly apply to iraq as it does to al'qaeda but its the same concept.<br>
<br>
You and Everas seem quite content to keep telling people to look behind the scenes and to not believe what they see on TV and News reports.  Frankly I dont. I dont watch TV. i read my news on as many foreign sites as possible to try and see the way the other half thinks.  <br>
<br>
But lets get down to the real issue here, people seem to feel they are all born with the right to judge other countries that they prolly have never set foot on.  Every country has skeletons in their closet, every country has done some fucked up shit in its history. But being the big kid on the block the USA is constantly dealing with people from other countries talking down at us like their own shit dont stink. Frankly, I am sick of it. <br>
<br>
I am not french, I am not english, I am not norwegian, I am not german, italian, chinese or russian, I AM AN AMERICAN and i comment on american issues. You dont see MOST americans ragging on the policies and procedures of all the european / Asian Middle eastern countries here.  But every time we do something that offends someone over a ocean we sure get an earful of it.<br>
<br>
But its a no win situation really, we got the power, we have shown the ability to use our power, sometimes for good, sometimes its gone bad.  But like most countries we are trying to look out for #1 without pissing alot of people off along the way. I dont think anyone can really come to this board and say that any country is gonna want to do things that will harm its own country and its own future. Thats why we have france and germany trying to stop the war. IT will hurt their economy.  <br>
<br>
In many instances if we use our power we are bullies, if we dont use our power we are ignorant selfish bastards who dont care about anything but when the next episode of American idol is on. There is no pleasing the rest of the world.  We know this,  its understood, if france was the power in the world they would prolly be getting the same shit from the same countries.  <br>
<br>
But in the end I am sick and tired of all the american bashing going on. Yes our country has made mistakes, Many countries have.  however america has taken steps to  rectify our wrongs. The japanese who were interned in WW2 have been given monetary compensation. The Native Americans who everas was talking about were given considerable sums of land as reparations for the wrongs done to them during the 1800's.  We are constantly forgiving debt owed to us by foreign powers.  Stop focusing on the bad things america does, we do our share of good also.<br>

I never said the U.S. was completely innocent.  And for the record, I am 1/4 Native American( not that it matters when discussing war with Iraq ).   I also never said that we are going to invade Iraq for humanitarian reasons(  although it is a nice side effect ).<br>
<br>
As far as him not attacking for fear of retalliation...well, I wonder what the Taliban was thinking when they decided to protect Osama.  Why did they not fear retalliation?<br>
<br>
P.S.  North Korea doesn't seem to be to afraid of retalliation either.  Also, if Saddam was afraid of retalliation he would simply disarm.

thanks for the label.  i have to be a &quot;political novice&quot; because i don't agree with you?  i must have no idea what's going on in the world.<br>
<br>
iraq is a threat to world peace?  what about pakistan, india, and israel?  they are all countries with human rights violations records, stockpiles of nuclear weapons, and international delivery capabilites.  america has huge weapons of mass destruction programs.  <br>
<br>
you know bush and rumsfeld were in office back when iraq was gassing iran and the kurds, they sure didn't seem to have much of a problem back then.  OH WAIT thats right because iraq was our ally?<br>
why is it that saddam is such a threat when it is very doubtfull that he will ever develop nuclear capabilities?<br>
<br>
oh because he COULD MAYBE POSSIBLY develop weapons of mass destruction and attack the us.  war is a horrible thing.  i don't think you can possibly disagree with that.  it is NOT ok to go to war because someone could POSSIBLY attack us.  that is setting a horrible precident for international relations.  you complain about the UN, and i agree it is deeply flawed--but it is the best thing that we have for now.<br>
<br>
are you really so audacious to suppose that america should run the world?  are you really so inclined to hang off bush's every word, when he has already thoroughly trashed our country?  since you're such a political guru, do you not realize what has happened to OUR country since 9/11?

i'm not taking iraq's side, i'm simply saying that in this crucial age in humanity's evolution we simply can't set a precident of a unilateral war being initiated for self defense.  i don't understand how you think america should be able to muscle the world around as it wishes.  i think hussein needs to go, he is most definantly a dangerous person; it, however, is not our place to get rid of him without international support.<br>

Ok, thats the current spin. Now how bout a Russian perspective? <br>
<br>
&quot;That was aiding Muslim extremists, the so-called mujadeen, who were engaged in acts of terror against the former USSR.&quot;<br>
<br>
And no Kad, it doesn't surprise me that our former &quot;allies&quot; among today's modern day terrorists have turned out to be not so nice. But I sure am glad our government funded them back then. It made it so much easier for them to continue putting the skills we taught them so well against us. But I mean come on, religious fanatics always make good allies right?<br>
<br>
Oh and about the rest... check your facts. Bush has been trying very hard to prove a link. And well... its tenuous at best. <br>

<br>
So... once upon a time someone within the Iraqi government may have given Al'Qaeda some help. Well once upon a time so did we.<br>
<br>
Moving along... Moord, if Saddam could really wipe out the east coast do you think we'd dare invade him? Of course not. Just like we won't invade North Korea if they can reduce Tokyo, or LA, to a smoking pile of rubble.<br>
<br>
Now... Taliban vs Saddam's Baath party. A fanatical, hardline, muslim extremist group that managed to seize power in war torn Afghanistan, and a socialist, moderately islamic dictatorship. Well, personally I don't think I'd like to live in either country... but given a choice I think one is clearly abit less stable than the other.<br>
<br>
This about the point where EZboard decided to eat my post... so I'll try to reconstruct it.<br>
<br>
I'm an American. I'm proud of my country sometimes, and other times I'm not. Right now I'm truly disappointed with Bush and his policies. We've all see the results of Cold War politics come back to haunt us. Yet we're still willing to follow the old rule: either they do as we say, or we send in the troops.<br>
<br>
That doesn't bring any lasting stability to a region. Even the pretense only lasts as long as we leave our troops stationed there. <br>
<br>
We're arrogant. Maybe we have reason to be so. Our military and economy allow us to dominate the globe. Using either one or the other (or both) we can bend most nations to our will.<br>
<br>
But things may not always be this way. If history's taught us anything it should be that no empire lasts forever. Why believe ours will be any different? <br>
<br>
So why not use our strength to better the world while we have it? Not by promoting a cycle of violence that permeates our world, but by encouraging stability and peace. <br>

Perhaps the best description of our current situation I've read in this thread. To what do we evolve to and how do we start?<br>
<br>
In 94' our battalion set up and defended a FARP (forward air refueling point) in Rwanda, for incomming Air Force cargo planes. The Hootu's and Tootsi's had managed to kill an estimated 400,000 -HUMAN BEINGS-. I have immeasurable regret about this situation because while the world was looking elsewhere this atrocity was carried out and we all can take credit for this.  Chollera, and several other outbreaks caused secondary casualties (aka death) to the amount of 800,000 people dead. Instead of disposing of the initial corpses properly, they were dumped into rivers to become &quot;someone elses&quot; problem downstream. The war we fought in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and most of Africa was -education-.<br>
<br>
Our Air Force cargo planes were not fitted with medical equipment, food or aid workers. Instead they brought kerosene and dieself fuel to burn mountains of bodies. At this stage it was the most reasonable payload to carry and no doubt prevented this from turning into something worse (is that possible?). The word genecide and holocaust have been used in referring to this situation. Words that have not been used for 5 decades.<br>
<br>
I don't remember seeing one Frenchman/ UN representative being there to assist or even watch these mountains of bodies<br>
burn.<br>
<br>
Some people question my countries ability to take action when appropriate, but neglect to see their own short-commings. I would ask that you transcend your desire to point fingers or rather just &quot;grow the fuck up&quot;.<br>
<br>
We are not the enemy.<br>
<br>
Am I bitter, yes. <br>

In other words, the message the UN is sending to Saddam: continue to trickle to us some weapons that you shouldn't have and you will be deemed in compliance. Clearly, there is a TREMENDOUS opportunity to exploit 1441 without a timeline.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A fair and valid point Kad- but you have no one but your own government and diplomatic teams to blame for the lack of a deadline.  The resolution was co-submitted by the United States, and the terms are as stated.  Whether or not there is an opportunity to exploit the process is a matter for the inspectors, not individual governments.  The resolution is a mandate for inspectors, not for UN member states to take matters into their own hands.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Recognizing the threat Iraq's noncompliance with Council resolutions and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles poses to international peace and security,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
With all due respect Kad, that isn't even an operative clause of the resolution.  IE- it has no basis in international law whatsoever, it's a qualitative statement of intent, nothing more.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nowhere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the 14 OC's is there a timeline for compliance except to do with inspectors being allowed in.  Iraq was given 45 days to do this, and did it within 48 hours.  That, plus the significant steps taken to comply with weapons inspections convince me that Iraq is cooperating actively.  Certainly not 100%, but that's what the inspectors are there for, to report the extent of compliance.  I put it to you that no nation in the history of disarmament treaties or policies have been 100% honest.  This goes back to Cold War missile disarmament, and even before that to the disarmament of Rhodesia, more recently South Africa.  <br>
<br>
The fact that there hasn't been <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>perfect and flawless</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> compliance therefore, should come as no suprise.  Should that be a trigger for war?  Well if it is, then why didn't the United States go to war with the Soviet Union or vice versa, when both failed to honour missile disarmament treaties numerous times?  Answer- because &quot;almost-complying&quot; doesn't constitute a case for war.  So what does?  That's something the UNSC can decide based on inspectors' reports.  If nine members vote in favour and there are no vetos, then the UNSC will have been convinced that there is a case for going to war.  Now if that were to happen, I may not like the idea, but at least the war would have legitimacy, and the fact that 9 nations agree and all permanent members are happy to see the resolution pass- that fact will give me confidence in the war that I currently lack, desperately.  <br>
<br>
My reasons for lacking confidence (not in the success of action, but its legitimacy) have been well-documented in this thread.  There is no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for force to resolve the conflict, and there need be no timeline for the inspectors to disarm Iraq.  95% of Saddam's 1991 arsenal has already been destroyed, all permanent members agree and acknowledge this.  Given that it took 5-6 years to achieve that, I don't forsee the remaining 5% taking longer than 1-2 years, even with Saddam's &quot;cheating&quot;.  1-2 years of inspections will work, it hurts nothing and nobody if we wait that long to see what results are produced.  <br>
<br>
Again Kad- if the inspectors don't feel further inspections are practicable, then they will tell the UNSC and a second (termed) resolution would follow.  Currently inspectors feel that results can be accrued (and the facts support this).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But, if after reading about his human rights violations you are still confident that he will behave rationally and not want to take vengance on the U.S. for sending him packing back to his hole during the Gulf War, then I will have to assume you can see the future and are all knowing. Do they offer a degree in all-knowingness too?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Fundamentally flawed argument- the question can easily be reversed at you smawty.  How do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know that he *would* take revenge?  It's just as valid or invalid a hypothetical, put that way.  The point which you're still missing is simple- Saddam is not a fanatic, and not someone who would do anything that threatens his grip on power.  He can't afford to gamble after 1991, he can't afford to press the boundaries of containment because he knows that his obliteration would be the result.  *That* is the strength of deterrence- no matter how mad, impulsive, or hungry for revenge Khuruschev was, he still couldn't bring himself to push that nuclear button.  Even during the Cuban missile crisis, the biggest watershed of brinkmanship since the 2nd World War- even then, one of the most mentally unstable and impulsive Soviet premiers with many hundreds of times the destructive power of Iraq- was deterred successfully.<br>
<br>
When the model of deterrence has been so sorely tested and come out successfully- I ask you again- how are you so sure that such a successful and tested doctrine is flawed here?  Where the deterrence is one-sided and entirely in the hands of the UK/US?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As far as him not attacking for fear of retalliation...well, I wonder what the Taliban was thinking when they decided to protect Osama. Why did they not fear retalliation?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Goodness me- you're comparing religious extremists uncaring of their own lives to a secular dictator who's done his level best to act in the direction of self-preservation?  Ridiculous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And yes I do have a chem degree and the shit he has is pretty easy to make. But the quantities he has made would be extremely difficult to control. He has enough shit to wipe out the east coast. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And North Korea has enough WMDs to deter the United States, all the permanent members each individually have enough WMD to destroy the planet hundreds of times over- what's your point?  The fact that the weapons exist is no proof that they would be used.  To use a simple analogy that our mentally-challenged friend lurker would understand:  a loaded gun is no threat until it falls into hands that would use them.  Saddam has never been the sort of person to strike first when a deterrent existed- the reason he was so willing to use chemical weapons on the Iranians and the Kurds is that the United States and the UK <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>backed him to the hilt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  If he even suspected they would disapprove he would never have used them.<br>
<br>
  US and USSR submarine commanders and field authority to launch nuclear weapons for a considerable period of time- the fact that capability exists is no indication of a threat.  Especially not when you're dealing with someone interested in self-preservation.  Associating Saddam with extremists like Bin-Laden or the Taleban is just wrong-headed- it's part of the Bush administration's strategy to link these threats in the minds of the American people.  It's deliberately misleading, and deeply wrong in my opinion- especially when the two are about as similar as chalk and cheese.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But in the end I am sick and tired of all the american bashing going on. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Gsam m8, no one here is bashing the american people, or american values.  We're focusing on American (and indeed British) foreign policy.  The idea of pre-emption is a dangerous precedent to set, particularly when there is no proven threat.  Containment is working, deterrence is there as a safety net, and inspections are also working.  Practically every nation on the UNSC save 3 or 4 think that substantial progress is being made.  The inspectors think substantial progress on disarmament is being made- and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>they're on the ground inside Iraq</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  They more than anyone should know whether compliance is sufficient or not- political judgements from afar serve a policy goal of regime change- the inspectors have no agenda save disarmament.  If the case for war is as convincing as you claim, then why isn't anyone being persuaded?  1441 received unanimous support because it was a mandate for inspections, not because it was a &quot;final warning to Iraq&quot;.  <br>
<br>
So again- tell me why there's a proven threat great enough to justify pre-emption.  Tell me why deterrence wouldn't work, tell me why containment is failing- and prove it.  Nothing else should satisfy us of a case for war except a blatant lack of compliance reported to us by inspectors- ie, if they tell us inspections have failed.  Until then, there is no reason for war, inspections are working.  Not 100%, I concede that freely- but that isn't enough to convince me, or a majority on the UNSC that thousands have to die for disarmament.<br>

A preemptive strike only works if it does enough damage to render your enemy incapable of retaliating. For instance, massive nuclear bombardment of the united states could render us incapable of responding (that it may also kick up enough dust into the atmosphere to block the sun for a thousand years is beside the point).<br>
<br>
And that's not one nuke, thats many. Only a few countries possess that kind of destructive power, and Iraq is not one of them. <br>
<br>
Saddam may possess a whole host of chemical and biological agents. But none of them could completely disable our military. And unless he can eliminate our military, and all our ally's military, there's no way for him to launch a successful preemptive strike.<br>
