Alejos should not have been so brain dead as to go in there, even though the raid and cr were over. I also told adell that no wudan would be in zone while ad raided it. That will be a standing rule for quite a while. The intention was to prevent further issues like voltaar's initial incident.<br>
<br>
So the story is now that he DA'd before he was rez'd? thats different than it was last night when you attacked alejos.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, the story shifted constantly, and appears to still be doing so. Alejos was no doubt in zone to antagonize the situation. Even looking at the screen caps of your own people, Its obvious by their group chat your people were there for the same reason. If two people go looking for a fight, by high heavens they will find one. If AD wish to handle all issues with PvP, then we can do that. I see your point of view, and Alejos / voltaar did some serious fucking up. I also see a trend beginning in Acending Dawn in how they &quot;bring issues to the table&quot;. with regards to awfal and lohingrin. Just attack and beat people into submission...<br>
<br>
I've always been reasonable when not being bullied. Your own officers can attest to it. I react poorly to being bullied, but then I don't think I need to be bullied if someone has a valid point. When AD stop acting before talking , I'll be happy to talk. Until then, if AD acts before talking, we will act as well.<br>
<br>
I'm positive you would react in the same manner.<br>

By sitting in PoTranq?  Come on Alura do the right thing for your guild cause right now you getting spanked and there really is nothing you all can do about it.  I also think since you KNOW Moh and Kurl are not who they said they were your guild would be apt to KOSing them for deciet.  But you don't nor do you KOS Max who helps you all in PvP.  I dont quite get that either.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to know why Kendral was PvPing in HoH today, or I should say training with Moh and Max?

<br>
-Not 5 fucking minutes later Moehx magically logs in to fuck the RZ raid... Coincidence here? We were willing to say just happenstance.<br>
<br>
i was informed last night that rallos was up by an ascending dawn member, do u not expect me to show up at the most inoppurtune of times? you guys should have expected me to be there.<br>
<br>
-Bluie zones into tactics stands around goes LD.<br>
-Alejos zones into tactics Casts some spells which we have all logged...<br>
-Moehx zones into tactics, gets attacked by awfal at 100% life. He goes DA, then his life all the sudden drops from 85ish to 50ish... While he is looting his corpse, he mezzes awfal and slowly runs to the zone.<br>
<br>
first of all i zoned in invul and started to loot my corpse with awfal beating on my back, invul lasts maybe 9 seconds or so after zoning, so if my hps somehow &quot;magically&quot; dropped from 85 to 50ish, maybe you should ask awfal hhow much he hit me for, it was quite hard.<br>
<br>
-Now Aloura.... PLZ explain to me where we hid anything... We asked that Wudan not come in, they did so anyways disregarding your orders... As well as assisted Moehx... <br>
<br>
if you guys dont' realize this, i never xp died, let me state this one more time for people who have hardskulls<br>
<br>
I DID NOT EXP DIE AFTER YOU GUYS WHIPED, i had a massive dot on me i ran for zone out and got warped to the middle of the arena, knowing i was going to die, i ran to a corner, faded everything and died.  you guys are too fucking paranoid, i would not give my info out to aloura or needra, what makes you think i would give it out to alejos or voltaar.  i really don't see how any of your bull shit adds up, if i was rezzed iw ould be 40% life. my hp &quot;magically&quot; dropped bbecuase awfal hit me several times when my invul dropped, you guys wanted me and now you are crieing ? give me a break. wanting to camp my corpse till the xxp timer runs out? did not lose any xp, and i am more than fully capable of getting my corpse out of plane of tatics with even 100 ascending dawn sitting right on top of it, i don't need help from anyone, and i especially did not ask for any, although i would really love to see theses logs, considering they can't possibly add up to what you guys say.<br>

<br>
Heh, it's not like the fact that we were doing RZ was some l33t well-kept secret or anything, everyone knew we were.  That's not what I or Biguss find amazing.  What I find incredible is the timing of your entrance.  The Rallos Zek event is two hours of non-stop fighting, culminating in the fight against him in the pit.  You came in and trained at the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> moment that we were preparing to fight the final boss of the event, with a five minute window at most.  This is made all the more suspicious by the fact that Voltaar ran down into pit, aggro'd and FD + /q'd, mere seconds before you came in and trained us.  So what is more likely:<br>
<br>
-Voltaar found out that we were at the critical stage of the final event, scouted out the ground and told you;<br>
<br>
-A member of AD was crying out to be trained, exp-lossed and denied a flag and called you over to save him/her from the boredom of weeks of pvp and the chance to do the biggest event we've done thus far;<br>
<br>
-You have a better crystal ball than Miss Cleo, and mystically predicted the exact moment you'd have to come along in order to train the event.  And of course Voltaar having been FD in the zone after running down to pit is just total coincidence, as is Alejos rezzing you.<br>
<br>
Which of those is most likely?  We'll leave that one up to the thinking members of the public shall we.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>do u not expect me to show up at the most inoppurtune of times? you guys should have expected me to be there<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're right, we should have expected you to be the training, xp-lossing, cheaparse DA-box tactic-using loser you are.  We know it from long experience.  It is however, strangely gratifying to hear you admit it yourself.  Congimpulations!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>first of all i zoned in invul and started to loot my corpse with awfal beating on my back, invul lasts maybe 9 seconds or so after zoning, so if my hps somehow &quot;magically&quot; dropped from 85 to 50ish, maybe you should ask awfal hhow much he hit me for, it was quite hard.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Awfal's log and the pictures posted by members in our private section say otherwise.  And whom do you think I should believe, hmm?  A training, lying sack of shite like you from &quot;Lanys&quot;  (lol?), or an impartial log from an officer and several screenshots of you being rezzed?  Again, I'll let the thinking public sort that one out too.<br>

Whoa, first of all fuck you.<br>

Second, Synergy up until the time I retired was a finely run organization.  It didn't work because Synergy wasn't a unified single guild.  Which meant egos and pvp got in the way of pve goals.  What happened after I retired I will not comment on because frankly, it disappointed me.<br>
<br>
End of discussion, I don't want to hear another word about Synergy, especially from someone I never heard about in my heydays. <p>-A to the J, Office Linebacker<br>

Old schoolers show up and put an end to it! (Actually board trolls show up happy to see RZ has some life back in it after 1.5 years.)  Any corruption in Synergy must have happened during its freefall off of RZ, cause none of it ever existed when I was around.<br>
<br>
How bout we just start a Synergy/Sabbat war thread for all us old folk so we can post kill shots and talk trash too!  You guys seem to have lost that flame/hate/kill spark all the good wars used to have =(  It all just seems due to boredom now.<br>

War starts on Rallos, the seals get ripped off whatever tomb we've thrown all the retirees into, they come back to post flames about stuff that happened years before (que up &quot;Glory Days&quot; bards) and 'Lo and Behold the rebirth of the Ambiguously Gay Duo.<br>
