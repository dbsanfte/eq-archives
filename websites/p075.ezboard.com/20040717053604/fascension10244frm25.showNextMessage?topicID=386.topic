Let me start off by saying, i never wanted any trouble, but nocturnalist seems to be taking this into his own hands. <br>
    <br>
        It all started when I logged on today in KK,knowing that phinny was going to be up.  I saw that nocturnalist was in the zone and figured he was going to solo him.(I had watched him solo phinny a few days ago).So i went to ledge in KK and he was afk for few.So I waited and asked him if he needed any help.He then preceded to tell me and I quote &quot;If you CH phinny again this time I will kill you&quot;. Completly baffled by ignorance, I didnt know what to say. (The first time i watched him solo phinny, phinny got CHed about 4 times). I first had to explain to him that players are not allowed to heal NPCs. He then said 'phinny is a wizard, not a cleric'. I then had to explain to him that if you dont pull phinny far enough away from the pit, then the seahorse guardians, who are clerics, will CH him.  <br>
<br>
          Being in the best guild on the server, I would have figured he would have known all of this, and accusing me of trying to screw him over last time was a little rude on his part.  So anyways following that, a wizard zones in who is in guild Wudan(forgot name). He asked if we all want to kill phinny. Noct said that we all must leave the zone now. The wizzy comes to ledge and invites me to group along with noct, who rejects and wishes to go solo. After a bad pull noct FDs and me and the wizzy evac. On our way back to ledge, I get there right as noct dies from 2-3 seahorses. It is now just me and wizzy in the zone for about 10 minutes. The wizzy then did something special to get past the 1 see invis seahorse and goes down and soloes phinny. He links the loot and i see that backbone drops(the drop i was after for my alt) I rush down and loot it and succor to zone from argo. Noct is back at his corpse saying we are kos to him for ninja looting. I said that he died trying to pull stuff, and that phinny is anybodys mob now. We offered him to join us so we could make a conjoined effort to kill phinny, but noct insisted on going solo,and in doing so, died.  So he sends me a tell saying 'dont even think about looting that'. I dont understand why he thought it was his loot when the wizard in my group soloed phinny and noct was dead. He then talks to an officer in my guild(SG) and says that I will die alot and am kos for ninja looting. <br>
<br>
     I'm trying to clear this up and stay out of it. He was not KSed in any way because he had not even pulled or engaged phinny whatsoever and was sitting at his corpse medding.It was our groups kill, so we looted what we needed, I dont understand why he thought it was his loot, or us looting our kill is ninjalooting, when he died and was just getting back in the zone when phinny dropped. <br>
<br>
      Either way if someone could look into this i would appreciate it.like i said i dont want any trouble and would like to get it cleared up asap.thanks.<br>

Iyabuta was wrong to go in and solo it as he knew damn well I was there for it and I have hashed it out with him too, but at least he worked with me to get the petition cleared so I could get MY LOOT (not yours).  nothing you say will turn the page and make you not the ninjalooter in this case.

I first had to explain to him that players are not allowed to heal NPCs. He then said 'phinny is a wizard, not a cleric'. I then had to explain to him that if you dont pull phinny far enough away from the pit, then the seahorse guardians, who are clerics, will CH him. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's a free zone...you can stand on the ledge if you want, to see if the person killing the mob can actually do it.  Sounds like Noct couldn't.  Anyway, Fred didn't kill Phinny, Iyabuta did.

He is kosing you and its something you should have to deal with, its RZ there are consequences to your actions.  Its not like you were there first and Noct came in and said &quot; leave or you will die&quot; and bullied the spawn, he was there first, he told you to leave because he would know it would lead to him not getting the spine if you didnt leave.  There is nothing wrong with Noct's actions.  He told you to leave you didnt, he is stronger so now he rocks you.  This is how RZ works, It is how it has worked since day 1, same if your a single player or if its between entire guilds.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 2238<br> <font color=#333333>(11/14/03 9:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/maliosm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: d</span><hr size=1> <br>

This has been an arguement in the past, with AD being the ones to go in after. FUnny how times change and double standards exist...<br>
<br>
Rules of engagement do not reserve a mob for the day, simply for that attempt. The rules of the server may have changed, but I recall it being that way as well.<br>
<br>
Sounds like Noc was embarrased and then angry.<br>
<br>
Its a friggin normal mob, just get it next time. no need to cry over it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=391.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=391.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=391.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.threadControl?topicID=391.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=391.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=391.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p075.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Pyro's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm33">World of Warcraft</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25>Pyro's Gallery</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
