..................................................................................<br>
<br>
You Can Run, But You Can't Hide<br>
MAYHEM AND CHAOS REIGN ON EVERQUEST'S NEW PLAYER VS PLAYER DISCORD SERVER <br>
You Can Run, But You Can't Hide -- Life or Death is the Only Option and the Last Few Players Standing Win! <br>
<br>
Norrath is normally a very safe, secure land. We're changing that. As of December 19th, a new level of excitement and competition will be added to EverQuest as Discord, our new competition PvP server goes live. This new server will only be live for a few short weeks, as Sony Online Entertainment challenges our community to discover who amongst them is the fiercest wizard or warrior. <br>
<br>
Discord is a hardcore Player vs. Player server, offering players fast-paced gameplay with the thrill of eminent danger and the agony of defeat. The battle begins December 19, 2003 and ends January 12, 2004 with the highest-scoring survivors proclaimed the winners. Battles are fought to the death and the slain will not be restored or resurrected for any reason. Any character slain will be recreated as a newbie and will have to start all over again. Corpse looting is allowed, but you'd better hurry, as all corpses will decay in 30 minutes. Each EverQuest account will be allowed one character on the Discord server. Players can reach level 50 with no Alternative Advancements, while an increased experience modifier will facilitate faster paced gameplay. <br>
<br>
Points are based on the victims, not the killer. Players can only gain points from characters that are within 20 levels of them and higher level targets will earn more points. The point total is distributed evenly between each person in a group with any fraction of a point rounded up to a full point. Additionally, if your character is slain, half of your earned kill points are lost. <br>
<br>
The top six surviving players with the most kill points on January 12, 2004, will be proclaimed victorious. The six victors will receive honors that will forever remind Norrath or their strength and bravery. The victorious will be bestowed the following prizes: <br>
<br>
* A class-appropriate item will be named after each winning character in the upcoming EverQuest expansion, the Gates of Discord. As an example, a winning Ranger may have a magical bow named after their character, while a Wizard might have an enchanted staff given their name. <br>
<br>
* Each winning character will receive their named item shortly after the new EverQuest expansion, Gates of Discord, launches. <br>
<br>
* Winners will be allowed a one-time transfer of their character and all gear from the Discord server to another server of their choosing. <br>
<br>
* Winning characters will be awarded a unique title that distinguishes them from their fellow Norrathians.<br>

Hmmmm, Why now? Why not 3 years ago? Hardcore? Where? /Cackles<br>
<br>
Wait, This is Verant Server, First i understand why LoY is only included for Discord PvP, It was the worse pathetic unpopular visiting zone ever in all EQ expansion (did'nt i warned you not to rush expansion, let alone 2 expansion in a year?). There is a way, You can either Buy the Game OR Pay Subscribtion monthly. NOT BOTH. Let alone 2 expansion in a year? Game Developer would be lucky enough to realease a proper* unbugged game withing 18month onward.<br>
<br>
EQ should be availible to Gamespy or such multiplayer's local host, For instant we all know Verant is a Monopoly company using Ubisoft to try and cover up any future public's fair trading law?. Subscribtion price for any Verant Server is worth no more than $0.95 a months. where the hell is $12.95 come from? and buying the retail game? You have been ripped off.<br>
<br>
Bug .... yep BUGs! Have not even been ironed out still, that applied from Kunark era. i'm not pointing out where all the bugs i know is but i give you one verant! (Free of Charge!). Why don't you fix PoStorm mobs-stuck-in-teh-hole? It the easiest bug to fix and still it not ironed out?. Tactic Been ironed out (mostly) Thanks to Medz (Invis ******).<br>
<br>
What bug's gotta do with PvP? Hell alot! You Rushed, Multiply your problems and move on working in other things, ignoring what had'nt been finished for the sake of Shedule release, Because of that is why LoY come in Discord expansion. When someone said 'Nah that ok, we dont have enough time and it seem to be ok with me.' That Verant to me. Just fix the bugs? i repeat fix the fucking old bugs?.<br>
<br>
PvP - Well good luck on Discord and remember i'm enjoying more than one server's in EmuLand. I luv the GM in RaidAddict, cos they are friendly, helpful and altogether got a wicked sense of humour. I had some good chuckle in a day than any 4 yrs under Verant Server's of my life. GM Quest? GM /OOC constantly joking? Ah! good old EQ! is back in EmuLand~ Plus PvP Summoned? Oh god i had a belly of laugh.<br>
<br>
As state in previous topic, Discord is still a Nerfs not the Original EQ like Rallozek Harcore-before-the-nerfs mind you. It dead. And dont blab in lied using the word *Special* *Harcore* *Magic*. Furthermore all expansion is now welcome, I can't wait to play it in EmuLand ~<br>
<br>
Above all! Verant you will not have a penny more from me ever. I gave to too much and was a stupid sucker spending $250 for CharMove/AccTransfer. I fucking hate that server. It already at your death door. Monopoly fucker. <br>
<br>
'But hey i would'nt be surprise if you see a spotty verant Lead-Admin GM as a normal newb in PvP Discord as a winner.'<br>

----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And thinking they should is part of the reason why. Players have this idea that all classes should match up fairly against all other classes. Sorry, but thats just plain wrong. <br>
<br>
until a game is not afraid to balance according to class duties, there will never be a good balance.<br>
<br>
Its obvious your bitter with SOE, but dont be bitter when someone has a good business plan and you fell for it <br>

Your swimming in the shallow end of the pool when it comes to game mechanics, but let me help you out and explain why your theory of classes should be balanced, is the wrong direction.<br>
<br>
To make this simple I will try and stay within EQ terms.<br>
<br>
You suggest that PvP should be balanced so all classes can compete with all others. This is a serious misconception, and one of the true reasons pvp games have failed in the past. You state then there is no way to talk about who is best PVP'er. Honestly, you don't need anymore topics to talk about...<br>
<br>
EQ PvE has created a sense of balance based upon the fact that people/classes have a specific role. Enchanters do not tank, shamans do not nuke, warriors do not use bows. By forming a semblance of purpose for all class types, the designers for everquest are able to balance encounters to rely on specific situations. In some cases players are creative and find alternative solutions. But either way, it creates discussion and strategy to be found.<br>
<br>
Now lets take PvP as you would have it. A cleric can beat a wizard, a Mage can beat a SK, so on and so forth. To use more ridiculous terms, in SWG people feel a dancer or chef should be able to compete with a bounty hunter... This is a problem and while designers and developers typically understand how to do this right, they succumb to the pressures of people such as yourself crying on forums as to why their musician cant beat a commando(SWG)<br>
<br>
Until PvP is balanced in a similar fashion as EQ PvE, I feel there will be no true PvP balance. Players need to understand a defined role, and it allows them to excel by having a clear direction. Do PvP your way and you have the mess you see in 99% of todays games...<br>

<br>
the cleric shouldnt realy beable to kill the wizard, but he should be able to heal him/herself enough or shield themselves enough so the wizard cant kill them without Skill and a little bit of luck.<br>
<br>
Same goes for warriors who in the PvE enviroment are still woefuly unbalenced except for thier MT function on a raid.  <br>
<br>
A warrior in PvP should have enough natural MR that they would recive limited damage from a magic spell.  this is balenced by the fact Warriors cant heal them selves and casters can over TIME wear them down.  while they are sniping away at the warriros hps casters can levitaite or DMF out of melee range or jsut gate/succor/port out or away<br>
