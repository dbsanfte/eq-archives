<br>
1999 Beginning of EQ - 2000 January: Unguilded <br>
2000 February - 2000 September: Order of the Black Rose <br>
Reason for Leaving: Great rogue only guild, purpose was to teach young rogues the way of the trade- purpose fulfilled. <br>
<br>
2000 September - 2000 December: Terrorizers of Norrath <br>
Reason for Leaving: Low 30s PK Guild, we mainly had bi-daily raids on South Karana to cleanse the zone of kiting druids, Kreiger left eq and I took a break from eq shortly after. <br>
<br>
2000 December - 2001 February: Unguilded <br>
2001 February - 2001 October: Redemption <br>
Reason for Leaving: Took many steps to &quot;redeem&quot; my reputation on RZ and was #2 on server to do the burning rapier (known as rogue redemption quest). Quit to take a break from EQ and take care of IRL. <br>
<br>
2001 October - 2001 December: Tribunal of Gods <br>
Reason for Leaving: Honestly don't remember much of this guild lots of people came and left this guild and I think the reason for leaving was so that I could join a newbie raiding guild <br>
<br>
2002 January - 2002 March: Black Claws <br>
Reason for Leaving: Weren't many people in this guild, met some good friends and they convinced me to join, I was booted from this guild unfairly but we let the situation drop and made up since then. <br>
<br>
2002 March - 2003 August : Comet Nosce <br>
Reason for Leaving: Took a couple month-long breaks from EQ during my membership in CN. Great family people and decent raids, ended up deguilding so that I could take a very long break from EQ and get my IRL in order. <br>
<br>
2002 August - 2003 November: Unguilded <br>
2003 November - 2004 May: SotB/UdC/TBS <br>
Reason for Leaving: After a month long recruiting process, I joined SotB because my old CN family had all joined them. After the Sleeper incident with Stynkfyst, we moved to Umbra de Caelum temporary name until GM could give us TBS. I resigned as an officer and member of TBS for many reasons, A few reasons include 1) IRL debt/job problems 2) Lack of Raid Attendance 3) Members weren't taking mandatory goals seriously, if you would like to ask me more about this PST in game. By this time all my old family had left TBS and moved on, I felt close to only a few TBS members. I had 100% Raid attendance for the past 60 consecutive raids that counted for dkp as well as ones that didn't. When I was a recruit for sotb I was so dedicated to guild goals that I got my VT key in a week.<br>

Are You Flagged For Kod`Taz? No <br>
Currently having a hard time getting GoD expeditions, only trial 2, 4, and 5 done and stone of entry complete. <br>
<br>
Why do you want to join Ascending Dawn?<br>
Many reasons. I've been an RZ Rogue for 5 years and have seen many people come and go, I took my time getting to lvl 65 so that I could adventure and have fun. I've never really had the chance to apply to AD because I joined comet nosce when I was 50 and stayed with them till 65 and then after i took a break from eq I joined them in SotB because that's where my old CN guildmates were and my loyalty lay and at the time I did not meet AD requirements. I want to join Ascending Dawn because it's been 5 years and I'd like to join all my friends (all my oldschool ones are in AD really) as well as having great structured and high paced raids and people who take raiding and guild goals seriously and high attendance and play times. I've wanted to apply to AD for a long time as some of you may know but my loyalty to a guild is very hard to break. If all this you believe nothing, give me a shot and I won't make ya regret it.<br>
<br>
Play Times: <br>
Currenty got a Job as a Waiter so I can set my own hours around AD raiding times, pretty flexible. I play EQ a lot 50+ hours a week. <br>
<br>
Are you, and have been, the sole owner of your character? If not, please elaborate: <br>
Yes <br>
<br>
What other character(s) do you own that would be beneficial? <br>
Have access to a few, none others I own. My wife/fiancee has a 50 warrior on her own account. <br>
<br>
Do you have Kill-On-Sight (KOS) Issues with another guild(s)? If yes, please elaborate: <br>
Cursed and Lucid Vision and any other pk guild out there. I try to stay away from being kos and try to resolve the problem if I can. <br>
<br>
Please provide any additional, relevant information regarding yourself, play experiences, etc: <br>
<br>
I've got 5 years experience as a rogue on rallos zek so like anyone as old as I am, I have a history. I've indeed grouped with a lot of fellow AD and I know if Xezzt was active he'd probably sponsor me- Bellatoress too, I haven't seen Chumchum in a while but she's one of my best friends =p. I've tried to be as accurate as I could with everything I've posted (guild history). I'm very skilled as a rogue and have many connections and am very knowleadgable about Everquest and all of its expansion packs. Send me a tell and maybe some time we can reminisce on old memories =). <br>
Some people who've guilded with me say that I try too hard but I don't believe that you can ever try too hard. I always am the first to volunteer for anything rogue related (aka corpse draggin an stuff). I initially left TBS because of my IRL issues although there were many other guild-related problems. I was an officer because of my work toward the guild and always did my best but it did break a few hearts when I left so don't be surprised if you get negative feedback but like I said, give me a shot and I won't let ya down.<br>

He's a very polite guy in tells; we've talked on several occasions. His dedication and enthusiasm for his recruitment is something I've never seen before in a recruit. He's so decidated to the AD recruitment and being an upstanding guildmember (he wants to vanquish the cancerous tumors in our guild /cough Semmy). It is unfortunate I have no true knowledge of his skills as a rogue, so hopefully I'll see them eventually.<br>
<br>
Shadowspirit is one guy I truly want to see tagged as a member of AD.  <p>      Feppas Frenzy <br>

I have no remorse for this type of person. <br>
<br>
The fact alone they raided and even mentioned Stynfyst on thier applicatoin should be deny enough. I'm not being mean, I'm just stating the facts.<br>
<br>
So I think he should go fuck himself and myabe apply to the Zepplin guild... err they might have crashed and burned... but they should apply because this guy is a total fuck and I veto him on principle enough. <br>
<br>
He is general a stupid fuck, no only on principle but superb opinion. <br>
<br>
So fuck you I hope you die, get your account banned or whatever it is you fucks like todo. Toodles<br>

I'd like to re-iterate that the only reason why I joined spirit of the bamboo was because it's where my old family from comet nosce all merged to so I felt obligated to follow. Stynkfyst didn't do much as far as &quot;his guild&quot; goes, the real work and effort was made by darkleetah, even though it was his guild. Yes I was a pk in my early 30s (I was like 15 years old and wasn't one of the cool kids hah) but that was over like 4 years ago and have since then made up my reputation, I felt no need in lying or hiding this past to you and like I said a guy with 5 years on RZ is bound to have a history. <br>
Now when I joined SotB I had no idea that Stynkfyst had access to a pk character and I did not know that he would do something so stupid that day in ST. I'm disheartened that I am to pay for someone elses terrible decision.<br>
<br>
Also, Scatchalot was a great guildmate of mine and a superior friend, he also was in sotb at the time (I believe) and I noted that his application was not turned down, honestly didn't know this type of post would occur.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping in the future that perhaps we may resolve this conflict you have toward me. Maybe if you give me a chance and allow me to group with you a few times...<br>
I won't give up on joining Ascending Dawn, once I set my mind on something- I go with it to the end. Even if my application is denied I will keep trying because once again- I really want to be with my oldschool and long friends, you know who you are! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
On a side note, I'll be turning 21 on August 23rd so I probably won't be able to make the raid on that day =O <p>Sincerely,<br>

The reason why I post it that way is cuz when I first started EQ I was 15 years of age, and knowing my mom (like many of yours out there hehe) she would do anything she could to stop me from playing, those &quot;breaks&quot; for the 3 first years of EQ were cuz she kept stealin my computer away and I had to &quot;earn&quot; it back. <br>
I did take a break a while back like last year to get rid of my IRL Debt and cuz I was moving but I came back stronger than ever, and now that I live with my girlfriend (soon to be wife), both her and I can play EQ as much as we want. (I got her addicted i'm such a bad boyfriend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
When I do play EQ though, I'm hard core. Like when I was in TBS, I was a damn fine raider- when Darkleetah first started her DKP system up until my resignation, I had attended every raid (that's right I had 100% raid attendance). <p>Sincerely,<br>
