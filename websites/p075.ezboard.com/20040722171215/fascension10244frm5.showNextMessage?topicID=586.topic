I play on a regular basis of at lest 40 hours a week. I dont ave a job and i am on disabiility for life. I have always been dedicated to my ranger amd as such a ranger have always done me best to help others. I have a DSl connection to the internet and rarely go LD. i know my way to just abotu any sone and would rather run to wehre im going then to bother a druid for a port. I am actually verry nervous about applying cause i have always done bad with rejection and after reading some of the other apps and seeing them get flamed, well i guess ill find out how good my rep really is here. I think most of you know me at least a little bit. I verry much look forward to spending time with Ad and radiing with them. as i said i play 40 hours a week at all hours of the day actually i think its mroe around 60 to 80 hours a week. well here goes nothing la~ let the flaming begin..<br>

Rangers - lvl 65, 100AA, EQ, AM3, FotA3, Entrap ,<br>
and currently you are at 60? should reapply when you get the required number.<br>
Also with our new recruitment standards, i think you need to find a few people to sponser you before you can come on raids... try to make some friends outside talk to people, (you must know some as you've been on the server for sometime) and ask them to sponser you...<br>

<br>
Magelo = free.  www.magelo.com<br>

AAs = hardly meaningless, and very important.  60 is a bare minimum to be a barely-not-useless ranger.  We already have some great rangers, so give us a reason as to why we'd want to add you.<br>

Guild history = also important.  Take 5 minutes to think about what you've done and who you've done it with the past 4 years.

As this si verry important to me, I will do a beeter job on this next part.<br>
   First off i would like to respond to the so called lie. i dont lie. It is true i drop from 65 to 64 when ever i die but i return to 65 after rezz. when it gets to the point that rezzes do not bring back my lvl i start regular exp again till im 10 prct into 65. That is usally sufficient to hold me for quite a while ( about 2 months). If im raiding alot, then i would probally have to do regualr exp mroe often. You however caught me at a time when i was working on a rezz.<br>
    I would like to join Ad for several reason but most importantly i would like to join because im tired of looking for a guild after 3 months, wanting to expand my EQ horizons, and to find structure with consistency.<br>
    As i have said i been playing 4 years, and in that 4 years i have been in numerous guilds. Unfortunately my memory is nto tht great due to the amout of ths i have consumed during those 4 years. The guilds that stand out most in my mind tho were Elven Crusaders from lvl 40 to 55 serving as event officer.Guild leaders were Puzzikat and waznu. i was in doz for a few months when it was at its peak before the war. I left when war started cause i had many frineds in MiM and i choose not to fight them. Eximos for 3 months under tekas.I was also in MC for a while as a recruit officer. i left MC to try my hand at guild leader of EF. When elemtal fury was created i was an officer. shokkem decided she wanted to go back to MiM and handed leadership over to me. I enjoyed it for a time. It gave me a different perspective on the game, but was more then i could handle. I have also been in several other guilds pre 40 of which i cant even remember the names of anymore, most of which disbanded or joined another guild. But one thing that remained constant is that they were all anti. I am tired of these guilds that pop up for 3 or 4 months then disapeer. Ad is a well established guild and has been around a loong time, and I hope will be around for many years to come. and i would like to be aprt of that family.<br>
    I would like to exspand my world. I am not content to just lvl and do aa's as some others may be. I like to raid and progrees though the zones and see whats new and explore new zones. i have an adventorous spirit and i feel like im caged in a stagnet EQ life. like being at the same suck ass job for a loong tie. To me joining Ad is like getting that job you always wanted. I am on 40+ hours a day i would like to spend it with mature inteligent people.<br>
   AD is a well structured guild one that i respect verry much. i respect your recruitment policies your raid policies and your political policies. That is why i have taken the time now to write this out properly. Structure to me is the most important thing of all.<br>
   In regards to the AA's, i would just like to say that i have all my aa's that affect my dps with my archery skill. entrap ismy current aa im working on. when i said a few meaningless AA what i mean by that is the aa's that do not affect archery to me is meaningles. 95 prct of the time i will find a way to use my bow, even in a dungeon. If any of you have done aLDON with me you know I'm no lazzy ranger. it takes mroe energy and paying attn to use bow then to just stand their nad melle a mob. I prefer my bow over anyhting else. <br>
   I been meaning to work on my maeglo profile for several weeks, but as soon as I am done with this app. i will jump right on it and get it done and add a link.<br>
   Reason I should be considered:<br>
1. I like to think i have an overall good attitude.<br>
2. I know my way around . Been playing 4 years thier is not a zone i dont know how to get to. <br>
3. I have a stable dsl connection and will not be having an unexceptable amount of ld's during raids. every one goes ld occasionally.<br>
4. I follow directions well and respect officers of the guild and its members. Having been an officer my self several times I know how it can get at times. <br>
5. I understand the political side of rallos zeck and can keep my self clear of trouble.<br>
6. I bring good conversation la~<br>
7. I dont  just played eq Ilive it. to me EQ is an expansion of life. for some it is their only social outlet. and thats how it is for me. i dont go out to bars or cloubs. i enjoy making frineds and developing a trust. I know their are people i can say, Hey bud i will be passing though your town mind if i stayed with you? that is nice to know<br>
   In closing I would just like to say i have accomplished alot of quests and goals. Most importanly I have accomplished building a character that is honest trustworty and respected by those that know me. But my greatest accomplishment would be to join the most ubba l33t group of all the guild of rallos zek. In part i would just like to say EQ is not just a game. What we do, what we say and how we act is a direct reflection of who we really are., wheter people want to believe it or not. <br>
   P.S. Would like to thank AD for letting me come on tonights raid in NTOV. Now to work on maeglo. I hope you respect the time i took to write this. I would not have done it for any other guild la~ And i hope it passes the english major's seal of approval la~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galyien>galyien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/03 2:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My app</span><hr size=1> Oh well paragraph indentation didnt work lol. i don't usually wrie long essay's like that on boards la~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galyien>galyien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/03 5:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My app</span><hr size=1> javascript:view_profile(493069);<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=493069">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=493069</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galyien>galyien</A> at: 10/14/03 5:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rehoboam@ascension10244>Rehoboam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/03 10:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=582.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My app</span><hr size=1> 100 AAs, period.

I will push hard for those AA,s iiin the mean time hhows about letting me hang with you so i some of you can get to know me better so i can find those 3 sponsors. Seems the hardest task will be to get the 3 sponsors. Matter of fact im almost willing to bet 100kpp that i can probally get the 40 aa's before i can get the 3 sponsors ;p. I asked sevealr AD mebers last night about sponsoring me, seems most are unable to or are currently sponsoring someon. As I have said i do respcet your policies, I will get those 40 AA's.  Btw how does my magelo profile look?

Less talk, more AA'ing.  You don't meet the requirements to even be considered for recruitment, and it's not as if you're a Rogue/Cleric/Some other highly desired class.  We have tons of rangers which is why the standards are raised.  As it stands now, you would not be considered for recruitment until you get the required 100 AA's.  Feel free to contact any of the AD rangers either in-game, here, whatever if you need suggestions on where you should put the AA's in.<br>
