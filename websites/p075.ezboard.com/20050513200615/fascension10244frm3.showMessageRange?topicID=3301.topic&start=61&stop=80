I'd love to think that real adjustments to the AMT will be made. I'd love to believe that Republicans will really make decisions that will actually fix something egregiously wrong for average Americans, but as the repeal of the inheritance tax, and 2001 tax cut so clearly show, Republicans just aren't interested in average working class Americans--they want the benefits to flow to the political donor class.<br>

<br>
Spending <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">increased</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> about 7-8% each year, during Clinton's term, or from 2% in 1992 to 10% in 2000. An average of $88 billion more each year. The maximum increase being $198 billion in 2000.<br>
<br>
Spending decreased from 10% in 2000 at the end of Clinton's term, to -1% in 2003. On average spending has <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">decreased</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> by 3% during Bush. That is an average decrease in spending of $63 billion a year, with a maximum decrease in 2002 of $138 billion.<br>
<br>
Revenues from taxes increased around 7% each year under Clinton. According to NBER economists this resulted mostly from the economic growth spurred by new technologies, and not from Clinton's tax increases, which in their view, actually reduced total revenues.<br>
<br>
In 2002 tax revenues dropped 300 billion <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">as a result of the recession</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->(there were no tax cuts yet), but only 150 billion in 2003 after tax cuts took place. That means that almost double the deficit amount incurred during Bush's term is the result of the recession  and not of tax cuts. According to NBER economist tax cuts helped end the recession faster.<br>
<br>
Finally, the idea that lowering taxes always reduces revenues is simply ignorant, and cannot be verified by historical tax rates when compared to revenues or growth. Until the 1970's, income tax rates climbed to nearly 91% for the higher brackets, around 40% for the middle class and around 20% for the bottom tier. Right before the Reagan Tax Act reform top rates were at 70%, middle at 40% and low at about 10%. Despite the high rates, revenues as a percent of GDP had remained at around the level since WWII, but the deficit steadily increased from 1948 to 1984. After Reagan's tax cuts, the GDP more than tripled, and that is without accounting for the reduction in inflation that also took place, which would make that number higher. Since then, the deficit has been declining as revenues have increased. If you look at a graph showing Federal Receipts and Outlays as a Percentage of GDP you will notice that, during the Clinton term, the deficit went up as a percent of GDP until the Republicans took over at which point it went back down. The reverse is true for revenues. When Clinton took office, revenues went down for a while, and then back up after the Republican take over. The current deficit as a percent of GDP is lower than most other years since WWII, except in 46-48, 69, 97-01. In fact, the deficit has only had surpluses less that 10 years total since WWII.<br>
It seems clear the solution is not raising taxes and increasing spending, but cutting spending and stimulating growth, which is exactly what is being done.<br>

But you knew that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Spending increased about 7-8%<br>
<br>
Nominal dollar spending under Clinton increased at a rate of around 5%, while as a percentage of GDP it fell every year Clinton was in office.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;In 2002 tax revenues dropped 300 billion as a result of the recession(there were no tax cuts yet)<br>
<br>
Bzzzt.  EGTRRA, otherwise known as the 2001 Bush tax cut, was signed in the middle of '01, and affected the 2001 tax year, and therefore, obviously receipts in 2002. Facts are your friend.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but the deficit steadily increased from 1948 to 1984<br>
<br>
More than a bit of a distortion.  The national debt's growth from the 40s to the early 80s was steady, but it was also modest, only actually doubling from 1962-1981.  Under Reagan, our debt nearly tripled. As a percentage of GDP, the national debt climbed from 25% at the start of Reagan's term, to over 40%, where essentially it's remained(cbo.gov historical budget data).<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Finally, the idea that lowering taxes always reduces revenues is simply ignorant....<br>
<br>
Really?  Under Reagan, federal revenues as a percentage of GDP fell after his tax cuts, and didn't rise again until his &quot;revenue enhancements&quot; were passed, giving the feds access to new revenue streams (cbo.gov historical budget data).  After Bush's EGTRRA, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has fallen and not recovered.  Your little truism only applies in recent memory when comparing later inflated nominal dollar figures, to prior nominal dollar figures.  At least from the CBOs numbers, when comparing as a percentage of GDP year over year--you seem to be full of shit.  Big surprise.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;When Clinton took office, revenues went down for a while<br>
<br>
Total horseshit.  As a percentage of GDP, federal revenues rose every year Clinton was in office, without exception.  (CBO.gov).  Further, the same is true for nominal dollar revenues.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you look at a graph showing Federal Receipts and Outlays as a Percentage of GDP you will notice that, during the Clinton term, the deficit went up as a percent of GDP until the Republicans took over at which point it went back down<br>
<br>
As a percentage of GDP, the debt and the deficit both declined *every* year Clinton was in office (CBO.gov).  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The current deficit as a percent of GDP is lower than most other years since WWII, except in 46-48, 69, 97-01.<br>
<br>
That's just an out and out lie.  For the most recent year available from CBO, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 3.6%.  This is higher than all but the very first year of Clinton's presidency, and other than that single year, the only other Presidents to equal Bush's record were Bush Sr. and Reagan (CBO.gov).<br>
<br>

<br>
To amplify on what I originally said:<br>
<br>
The deficits for 2003 and 2004 as a percentage of GNP were -3.5% and -3.6% respectively.  The only years with greater deficits were 1976, 82-86(Reagan), and 90-93(Bush I, and one year of Clinton). Put another way, for the period from 62-04, the last two years' deficits have exceeded the deficits of all but 10 of the years of that period. Care to wager on the direction the deficit will take in '05?<br>
<br>
Totally unlike you.  I expect you to put your own slant on things, seeing only what you want.

For the period for which the CBO publishes numbers, prior to Reagan, deficits averaged -1.6%. Under Reagan, deficits averaged just over -4% of GDP, nearly a 300% increase. By contrast, deficits under Clinton averaged -.76% of GDP.  Under Bush, so far, that's doubled to -1.8%. I've no reason to expect that the deficit will be less for '05. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=undinerz>UndineRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#333333>(4/19/05 10:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Estate tax repeal pending in the house--grats Wealthfare</span><hr size=1> I love skimming over each of your well thought out and researched posts.  Just think...if you guys all spent as much time trying to figure out how to make a fortune you could experience the tax bite first hand!  (And Bum..the mortgage business is not driven by the write off you get on your taxes, the driving force is usually either the desire to have your OWN home, or to create wealth through the appreciation of the property.)<br>
<br>
Taxation in today's market (in a nutshell):<br>
<br>
   -You're paid....you're taxed.  <br>
        1) Federal  (approx 33% min currently)<br>
        2) State/City  <br>
   -You buy clothes, food, furniture, cars....you're taxed  on    your taxed money. (6%)<br>
   -You buy gasoline....you're taxed on your taxed money.<br>
   -You go out to dinner/movies/date...you're taxed on the taxed money. (6%)<br>
   -God forbid you have the sense to invest...<br>
        1) You make a profit...you're taxed.<br>
   -You buy a home.....you're taxed. (1-3%)<br>
   -In some areas you buy a car....you're taxed annually. (1-3%)<br>
   -You're self-employed...you're taxed double (FICA)<br>
   -You die...you're taxed.*<br>
<br>
Now if someone that paid taxes on all this crap throughout their lifetime wants to give the money to their kids, why the hell shouldn't they?  If they don't want the kids to have the money, let them decide where to donate it.  <br>
<br>
I'll give you a specific example of how someone can inherit and still be admirable.  I have a good friend who's father made a ton of money on Wall Street.  My buddy is a good athlete and a great guy, but really isn't the sharpest tack in the box.  If he had to live on what he could generate himself I think he'd spend his entire life &quot;just getting by&quot;.  The character trait I admire of him is his recognition of his budgetary constraints.  He doesn't have a mortgage because he doesn't want to pay the interest, he has investments that increase in value.  He lives within his means and doesn't expect anyone else to pick up the slack.  His father through the inheritence created a self-sufficient, productive and happy member of the human race.<br>

<br>
I pay taxes thanks, and a substantial amount of them. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;the mortgage business is not driven by the write off<br>
<br>
You mistake me.  The mortgage business isn't *driven* by the mortgage tax reduction.  Certainly all the motivations you mentioned come into play when one decides or doesn't decide to purchase real estate. The mortgage deduction, is, however, indisputably a subsidy both to the mortage industry, and to individual borrowers.  <br>
<br>
And Undine, the problem with repealing the estate tax, or really any federal tax right now, is that there are much larger looming problems with the tax system, specifically:<br>
<br>
1.) Bush's tax cuts combined with his penchant for growing government, and the concomitant funding shortfalls therefrom. Those tax cuts are due to expire, and indeed all current projections by the CBO depend on those tax cuts expiring, for a return to fiscal sanity. If those tax cuts don't expire, we face a very, very grim fiscal picture over the next 25+ years.<br>
<br>
2.) The soon to be massive expansion of the AMT.  No one seriously believes that this will remain as is.  The AMT will affect too many people to remain unchanged.  And unless I miss my guess, many of those affected by the AMT probably also fall into the &quot;regular voter&quot; category.  AMT, however, is the ballast that is keeping the Bush deficit balloon from soaring into the stratosphere.<br>
<br>
3.) Given that Bush will likely try to keep *both* his tax cut, and some kind of fix to the AMT, we're left holding a very empty revenue bag.  Cutting another tax, particularly one that applies to so few in the country, just seems irresponsible, unless there is corresponding talk of some kind of revenue replacement to go with it.  The thinking shown by Bush and those in Congress on this so far is like Nero playing his harp as Rome burns. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=undinerz>UndineRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#333333>(4/19/05 11:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Estate tax repeal pending in the house--grats Wealthfare</span><hr size=1> Egads....I'm actually responding same day and not a month down the road.  <br>
<br>
Traditionally Republicans have not been into &quot;growing government&quot;, however this focus has flip flopped a couple of times in the history of American politics with each party alternating their sad turn gorging at the public trough.<br>
<br>
What I would expect of a government that holds &quot;a very empty revenue bag&quot; is to reduce their expenses before they slop up to the trough again asking for more.  Unfortunately in this day and age our elected class is increasingly out of touch with reality with all the perks associated with the life of a member of congress.<br>
<br>
Given all that, you still don't address the points I made, which are we are being taxed at an ever increasing rate with no reason to believe it will stop.  When taxes on my house rise due to a reassessment does the government lower the mill rate so I don't pay a higher amount?  In affluent communities they do...in less affluent and traditionally democratic communities they take the surplus and spend it (plus a few hundred thousand) and increase the burden.  <br>
<br>
If you look back in history our parents and grandparents paid on average 13% for income tax.  That has now escalated to nearly 50% when everything is factored in.  If you look at the demographics of families we have increasingly become 2 income families paying someone else to raise our children.  That is a sad commentary on how the business of government is being run.....by BOTH parties.<br>
<br>
Your response about mortgages was well put though...in your original statement you blanket covered the topic in a way that I thought was misleading.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bumraz@ascension10244>Bumraz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1625<br> <font color=#333333>(4/19/05 12:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Estate tax repeal pending in the house--grats Wealthfare</span><hr size=1> What Bush and his buddies are proposing isn't &quot;slopping up the the trough to get more&quot; but rather throwing out food you have being delivered to the barn, when you can't feed the hogs you already have.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Given all that, you still don't address the points I made, which are we are being taxed at an ever increasing rate with no reason to believe it will stop.<br>
<br>
Economies grow, prices go up over time, so will taxes.  It's inescapable.  Taxes can't stop growing unless government does.  So far, no one has a realistic proposal that will accomplish that.  <br>
<br>
As far as the property tax thing--I really don't know what your particular situation is.  In my county, all property, in every community, is reassessed yearly, assessments pegged (at least theoretically) to market value.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That has now escalated to nearly 50% when everything is factored in.<br>
<br>
Sorry, while no one wants to pay more than their share, but 50% is just not true. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/american_income_taxation.htm">www.rationalrevolution.ne...xation.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> has arguably the best treatment on this I've seen.  The reality is that while the wealthy pay more *income* taxes, but all the little taxes (fuel tax, property tax, cigarette tax, yada yada) for that selfsame group consume, proportionally, much less of their income. When all taxes are taken into account, tax rates in this country are roughly proportional to the amount of the income &quot;pie&quot; each earning  bracket receives.  There has been some shift of the tax burden away from the wealthy in the last 20 years, but it's not been huge, and has been mostly (and soon to be increasingly) borne by the middle and upper middle classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p075.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=symgharyl>Symgharyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1412<br> <font color=#333333>(4/19/05 2:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p075.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3301.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Estate tax repeal pending in the house--grats Wealthfare</span><hr size=1> If they just pass the Three Person Limit Kill law, this country would be out of debt and the best place in the world. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Symgharl Val`Sharess</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
The Tax Foundation has a pronounced agenda, and massages numbers to make its point.  <br>
<br>
Quick questions that should guide you:<br>
<br>
1.) Why are the calculations of the &quot;average tax rate&quot; and so-called &quot;tax freedom&quot; day inaccurate, as done by the Tax Foundation? Big hint in next question!<br>
<br>
2.) Why does the rate paid by the median taxpayer tell us more than TF's average tax rate? Hint: progressive tax rates!<br>
<br>
3.)  When calculating income, when one excludes capital gains income from base income calculations, but includes tax paid on said gains, do you think that you get an accurate calculation of tax rate? <br>
