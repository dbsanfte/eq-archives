      We all know that when it comes to pissing off one's 'whiney' customers, nobody in the business can top Sony. Now I'm gonna rant... it's gonna be long, it's gonna be gay. Read it if you like, I don't give a fuck either way.<br />
<br />
First I will show you a pretty picture to lull you into compliance.<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/images/Coirnav.jpg"><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/Coirnav.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A><br />
<br />
Now that I have your attention.<br />
<br />
I. Blowable spawns suck. We learned this when? Anyone? Anyone? We first learned this with the Avatar of War and then later learned to hate it again with damn near 50% of the end game content in Luclin. Now, if you search your records, you will find that you do in fact have a method to counter blowable spawns. For the sake of this argument, we will call it a <b><i>NON</i>-blowable spawn</b>. <br />
<br />
You guys know what this is right? You did it with Rallos Zek so every dipshit gimp and their mother could get 5,000 shots a day in with 400 trained chimpanzees hurling their poop at the poor fucker until he collapsed in a stinky pile of agony and defeat. <br />
<br />
What I'm gonna ask for is something you are unfamiliar with - BALANCE. Something in between the ridiculous opportunities that the RZ trigger presents (not to mention the even more ridiculous respawn time after a win of 48 hours) and the absolute absurdity of the Coirnav encounter. <br />
<br />
"But Furor..." shut the fuck up I'm not done. I realize that both the Fennin Ro and Coirnav encounters have mini-bosses that net out loot. (1) Is that your only damn problem? (2) Or are you really just assholes who enjoy creating self-cockblocking content which in turn causes grief and strife among the player base? Solution to follow if you fall in category one, also known as comatose or totally brainless.<br />
<br />
Remember the Emperor? Remember the Blood of Ssra? Remember how people would farm him for his loot? Remember when you made any Blood spawns after the original to be mundane lootless PHs with the same ability as the real Blood? I'm not gonna spell it out for you Corky because when you figure it out I want you to feel a sense of accomplishment. You guys can throw around a high-five and practice tossing donuts around each other's cocks and then see who can eat the other guy's donut-cock-ring-thing the fastest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Itemization sucks. Itemization may actually suck more than the actual blowable event scenario because most of the shittiest itemizations are on said blowable events. So when you manage to overcome the sheer stupidity of the blowable event, you are slapped in the face with shit like the loot shown above. I mean give us a fucking break. I'm not the only guy 'whining' about this crap. Make the loot WORTH looting, i.e. Xegony loot. Not crap that we can get with far less effort off far easier mobs. While you are at it, if you are at it, the drop rate on Chain Legs specifically is horrible. For the most part, most uber guilds I have spoken with agree with me - the rate is FAR too rare. This is more than just a coincidence, it's straight up broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
III. Before you decide you need to nerf things like enrage, AE rampage, etc... look at who is throwing in the complaints. Realize you will either have to compensate for the massive nerf you have planned by upping the mobs power considerably, causing even more whiners to vocalize, or you will be stuck with more lame duck/sitting duck Gods that Zerg Guild #592 will just plow through on their way to Plane of Time. If anything 90% of the mobs in elemental planes need substantial upgrades.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IV. Find the guy responsible for the Wood Elf Illusion Crown Quest and beat the fuck out of him. There's nothing I enjoy more than taking a twink to Guk, doing a /who and seeing 18 lvl 65 players AEing the fuck out of the dead side while little fucking Timmy the lvl 42 paladin and his stalwart group of adventurers are left with dick in hand, crying their little eyes out. While you are beating the stupid fuck that made this quest, just remember little Timmy. It'll fuel the rage. You turned a fantastic exp spot into a fucking shitpool. What's next? The Ogre Illusion Cock Ring that requires positive faction with the gnomes in Sol A? What a stupid fucking idea compounded by stupid fucking quest implementation. Make the faction its own damn faction that can only be obtained deep in sebilis or some shit... I know Krup's and above in Sebilis are giving Frogloks of Guk faction, you're on the right track, now change that faction to something else entirely so the shitheads can vacate Guk. Remember Timmy assholes...<br />

      You may have noticed something absent from several guild's web pages in the past month or so - that being their previously touted Xegony kills. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned in an old update, Xegony was pitiful. She was putting out about 300 dps with an anemic AE and no adds that had to be dealt with before she was face down, sucking dirt and handing over her goods. In short, it was like killing a glorified Diaku Scout.<br />
<br />
Enter Xegony v2.0. Just a MEAN mother fucker. So for a month or so nobody has been doing shit with her... until today. We have been honing our strategy for a couple of days. Finally, today, everything clicked and BAM!<br />
<br />
Xegony 2.0, welcome to FARM STATUS BITCH.<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/images/Xeg2down.jpg"><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/Xeg2down.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A> <br />
<br />
I'm really oversimplifying everything here, but my guild pulled off an amazing victory. People that have dealt with this new Xegony can vouch for her 'beefcakedness.' This encounter brought back a feeling I hadn't felt in EQ in a VERY LONG time. My heart was pumping every second of every minute of this battle. It was TRULY epic in that manner, which makes it sad to kill a God like Fennin Ro now, who is so ridiculously underpowered in comparison. Looking back at all these encounters since we've faced them all, I think it's safe to say that Fennin really does need to be upgraded to be more in line with the other members of the Pantheon.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I highly reccommend this encounter to anyone that enjoys a straight up challenge.<br />
<br />
ETA to Time, damn soon...<br />

From the looks of things, we'll be waiting until the second and third string guilds on Veeshan catch up to us so we can throw 500 people at this ring and maybe pull out the big 'W' and then all float into the Plane of Time, holding hands and singing <i>Kum Ba Ya</i>...<br />

After a grueling six hour festival of "dildo" jokes, the Fires of Heaven finally entered the Plane of Earth, Part B <i>aka</i> the place that both Siegfried and Roy would not be allowed to enter on grounds of 'not being gay enough.' No, not even if Roy strapped Richard Simmons onto his back and carried him around like Chewbacca did C3P0 in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i><br />
<br />
When I asked Sylvos what his professional opinion of the zone was, he answered "this is an as of yet undiscovered form of gay." Guildmembers were left awestruck. Not because of the zone itself so much, but that Sylvos had actually discovered a new form of gay. This warrior can't say his butthole didn't pucker up just that much tighter when he heard those comments. Truth be told, I brought out the sewing kit - IRL. It's like shitting through a spaghetti strainer - it's money.<br />
<br />
I wasn't about to stand idly by and be sucked in by this homosexual vaccuum. I picked up the damn batphone and rang Commissioner Gordon - I had to get to the bottom of this, and fast. What you are about to see is a top secret transcript of a recording made of a conference between the current Everquest producer and the lead and associate designers, respectively.<br />
<br />
Producer: I suppose you are both wondering why I've called you in today?<br />
<br />
Lead Designer: We've done your bidding, Master. <br />
<br />
Associate Designer: Perhaps you want to tie us up and use our testicles as Ben-Wa balls again, Master?<br />
<br />
Producer: We'll get to that later. *Meow* I have a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately.<br />
<br />
*The designers perk up* Yes Master, what is it?<br />
<br />
Producer: I need gay. There are people getting into the Plane of Earth B.<br />
<br />
Lead Designer: Plane of Air gay?<br />
<br />
Producer: Gayer...<br />
<br />
Associate Designer: Plane of Water gay?<br />
<br />
Producer: Gayer x 10...<br />
<br />
Lead Designer: Master, the estate of Little Richard sued us when we went Gayer x 10 and made the Plane of Earth A.. and Little Richard isn't even dead yet.<br />
<br />
Producer: We have more money than Jesus and we need to retain that status. Lawsuits be damned. I want you to go Liberace Squared.<br />
<br />
Designers: It's just not possible.... It... It cannot be done.<br />
<br />
Producer: It can and will be done. Go back to your roots. Think fools.... Think.....<br />
<br />
Thus is born a zone that requires hours upon hours upon hours of ring events done in PERFECTION (i.e. NO FAILURE) to gain entrance to another zone via a key - a NON SOUL BOUND KEY. A Zone that has NO ZONE OUT that you can only ZONE INTO WITH A KEY. The same key that is NOT SOUL BOUND. Is this shit sinking in yet you fucking morons? Do you understand how pissed off someone would be if say, oh I don't know, they zoned in to the Plane of Earth B with their keys and say, oh I don't know, DIED? Just what the fuck do you expect people to do? Does anybody in that place have a goddamn brain? So now we have collective amnesia? We forgot about Sleeper's Tomb? We applied the principles of keyed dungeons via old Sebilis before Soul Binding but this time with 500,000 times the risk? With 5,000,000 times the PITA? I'm speechless... and Liberace is fucking pissed off.<br />

55 dead idiots and one dead Goddess.<br />
<br />
I don't really know what to make of this encounter. Most of you don't know, but the entire Plane of Air is essentially designed via a blueprint of what Thott wanted Everquest to be... i.e. a haven for retards and retarded mobs. <br />
<br />
See, several mobs in Plane of Air mem blur themselves - CONSTANTLY. So what this does is allow us to completely gimp the fuck out of content. You don't even need a monk to make splits! It's fabulous - just run around long enough with mobs on your ass and shit just kinda wanders off, back to its spawn point, leaving you with whatever mob you want to bring into your group. You then rape a severly underpowerd mob that couldn't actualy kill a single person if it tried, so instead constantly mem blurs itself during the fight, jumping from target to target. Huh? Exactly.. no clue...<br />
<br />
I guess any idiot that got in a fight that was armed with a freshly printed copy of the LA Times and had a severe mental disorder would fight like this... that is, jump from person to person hitting them ALMOST hard enough to hurt them but not really hard enough to do much else. Bard tanking is born! GG dipshits... <br />
<br />
The Plane is <b>R</b>etarded with a capital fucking R.<br />
<br />
Anyways, after we were done with this pussy encounter, we had a desire to actually fight a mob that did more melee damage than a Sir Lucan Dlre.<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://fohguild.org/news/Bootupass.jpg"><img src=http://fohguild.org/news/Bootupass.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A><br />
<br />
As you can see by the positioning, this boy was straight up assraped. Instead of anybody dying, we actually GAINED a few new players during the fight. I don't even know how but we now have a new 65 Beastlord in the guild and a new 65 Enchanter. Just appeared out of thin air when he was at 30%. Oh yea, check out my new pants. Cha Ching baby... Feel free to use this as your new wallpaper - I know I'm a pimp, no need to tell me...<br />
<br />
For you people that enjoy lore and whatnot, I stumbled upon this book when I was scoping out Xegony's island. Check it out...<br />
<br />
<img src=http://fohguild.org/news/XegBook.jpg><br />
<br />
Anyways thats enough for this update. Hopefully we'll be seeing another God dead up here real soon...<br />
