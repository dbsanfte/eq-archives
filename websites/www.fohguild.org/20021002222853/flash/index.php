Now, to some of you, this is just a mass of non-sensical text/numbering. Unfortunately, to those of us that play in VT, this is a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Somehow, VT on Veeshan is COMPLETELY bugged (I mean bugged more than normal). Warders are not disappearing when they are supposed to, people are going linkdead for no apparent reason, and worst of all, mobs are receiving UNPRECEDENTED hit points and regenative abilities.<br />
<br />
The mob represented in the chart is what we call an Aten Blob, one of two. This Blob had, at our best estimates, around 10,000,000 hit points. The damage shown in the chart above was just MELEE damage over a period of 1:39 minutes. That's right folks - a mob that usually takes 20-30 minutes to kill -MAX- took 66 Fires of Heaven members one hour and thirty nine minutes to kill. <br />
<br />
After we killed the Blob, we went to test out the other side to see if his brother was also bugged. Boy were we unpleasantly surprised to see the answer was 'YEP!' Needless to say, we called the raid and everyone left in disgust.<br />
<br />
Why do I make this post here?<br />
<br />
A few reasons. Firstly, when I petitioned one of the Super Smart Verant GMs about bugged warders, their response was that they cannot respawn or mess with the spawn of any warders after the Sleeper had been released. OK!? <br />
<br />
Secondly, I've never fought anything for almost two hours straight... wait for it... I have heard of mobs in PoP having up to and maybe beyond ten million hit points. Let me just say that if any single boss encounter ever lasts this long again in any expansion, I can guarantee you people at Verant that everyone that aspires to reach this level of gaming in Everquest and everyone thats already at this level will leave. I would rather play Minesweeper while a rabid chimp gnaws at my testicles than go through another fight like the one we had yesterday. Nobody that I know that participated disagrees with me, and if anybody else ever has to go through this, I assure you they will feel the same way.<br />
<br />
With Much Love,<br />

         Scheduled Downtime     <br />
       <br />
 Re-scheduling of this weeks patch.<br />
Due to a need for more thorough testing, the EverQuest patch scheduled for August 28th at 3AM PDT has been postponed for a week and has been tentatively rescheduled for September 4th at 3AM PDT. The EverQuest Operations Team<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brief Patch Scheduled for all EverQuest Servers.<br />
On Wednesday, August 28th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 3 hours. This takes place of the maintenance originally scheduled for Aug 21st. The EverQuest Operations Team<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
We, the people that play this game, understand that the majority of your developers are busy pumping out content and design for the Planes of Power. <br />
<br />
We also know that there has been a VT item revamp in the works for over two months now; yet every patch that has come live has NOT included this absolutely necessary update. <br />
<br />
Now I am not going to go into the sociological or psychological impact of loot in the game of Everquest. I would hope that after working at Verant and playing Everquest for as long as some of you have, you would understand the importance of keeping the 'carrot' dangling. <br />
<br />
With all that being said, let me just say one more thing: YOU HAVE DROPPED THE FUCKING BALL. There is simply NO excuse for VT to be as bugged out and continue to have total crap drops for as long as it has - ZERO EXCUSE. The DB retooling would take ANY experienced EQ PLAYER (not designer mind you) 45 minutes to fix. <br />
<br />
I'm done ranting, I'm just pissed off about this (and I'm sure that brings a smile to your faces) as are the 35 other guilds that are crawling through VT every day. <br />
<br />
Just THROW US A BONE and do a mini-patch with just the promised item upgrades. Continuing to push back patch after patch is just bad business. <br />
<br />
We don't want huge buggy patches that allow players to equip NON-EQUIPPABLE items, or crash zones, or dupe, or myriad other things you've introduced in the last 3-4 patches; not to mention after this patch, the next patch will probably be rolled out around the same time PoP SHIPS. <br />
<br />
Hello? Hello? Is there anybody in there?<br />
