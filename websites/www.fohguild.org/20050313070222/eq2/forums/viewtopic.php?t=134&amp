- Act as a Mentor for your lower level friends with the new Mentoring system!
<br />
- When you right click a lower-level group member, you will see an option to Mentor them.
<br />
- Selecting "Mentor" will set your level to that of your lower-level friend, and you will operate at the same effective level as your group mate.
<br />
- The Mentor and Apprentice will receive experience, loot, and quest credit as if the Mentor were the same level as the Apprentice. Mentors, be sure to revisit any of those quests or locations that you may have missed along the way!
<br />
- The Apprentice will receive an experience bonus while under the guidance of a Mentor. Up to five other players can act as a Mentor for a single player at the same time (each increasing the experience bonus).
<br />
- Mentors receive experience and advance toward their actual level while mentoring; the rate at which they receive XP depends on the level of their Apprentice. Mentoring someone below level 20 will earn very little XP for the Mentor, while taking an Apprentice that is level 25 or higher will earn a greater percentage of experience for the Mentor.
<br />
- The effectiveness of your gear will scale down in level. You don't need to go out and get different gear to Mentor friends of different levels.
<br />
- While you are Mentoring, you can use any of your abilities that you would normally have available at that level.  
<br />
- The Mentor's skill values equal those of a character with 80% XP toward their next level.
<br />
- You can select "Stop Mentoring" if you wish to cease acting as a Mentor to your ally.
<br />
- If the Mentor or Apprentice leaves the group or exits the game, the Mentor will return to his or her original level. 
<br />
- When one player starts Mentoring another, all maintained spells will be dropped from the Mentor. 
<br />
- A player who is being Mentored is not allowed to Mentor someone else.
<br />
- You cannot turn off Mentoring while you are dead. If the group (or the Apprentice) disbands while you are dead, you stop Mentoring but remain dead until you release from your corpse or are revived.
<br />
- Mentors will only gain combat XP when they are within reward range (50 meters) of their Apprentice.
<br />
- Mentors will only gain XP if their Apprentice also gains experience.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** Solo and Small Group Loot Improvements ***
<br />

<br />
- All solo and small group encounters in the following zones now have the chance to drop improved treasure: Antonica, the Commonlands, Nektulos Forest, Thundering Steppes, the Orcish Wastes, the Enchanted Lands, Rivervale, the Feerrott, Everfrost, and Lavastorm.
<br />
- It will be easier to collect sets of armor and accessories from certain types of creatures. A solo creature that drops a given armor type is likely to drop additional armor pieces of the same type. A creature that drops accessories is likely to drop more accessories.
<br />
- More loot! You will now see more items of various levels drop than ever before.
<br />
- There is now greater variety in the volume and type of loot that normal solo creatures and advanced solo/small group encounters will drop.
<br />
- Encounter drops are now separated by the high and low levels for each zone. For example, level 12 solo encounters in Antonica will drop level 10-14 appropriate gear, spells, and recipes. A level 16 solo encounter in Antonica will drop level 15-19 items.
<br />
- Progressive solo population has been added to the Enchanted Lands, the Orcish Wastes, and Thundering Steppes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** Increased Solo and Small Group XP ***
<br />

<br />
- Solo and small group experience has been increased again to further enhance the solo/small group game. Players over level 30 will especially notice an increase in solo and small group XP rewards.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** New Zones ***
<br />

<br />
- New Level 50 Raid Zone: The Deserted Mine can be entered from the Orcish Wastes. Protect the Coercer you find within, or who knows what might happen!
<br />
- New Solo Instance: Valley of the Rogue Magi can be found in the Commonlands near Matthias Siegemaker. Encounter elementals, gargoyles, skeletons, zombies, and more foul creatures within.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** Looking for Work (/lfw) ***
<br />

<br />
- Artisans can now let other players know they are willing to take crafting requests with the /lfw command.
<br />
- Using /lfw works much like the /lfg (looking for group) tag. Players can perform a "/who lfw" command and find artisans willing to take crafting requests.
<br />
- Players can also search for a specific profession, such as "/who carpenter" for a list of Carpenters who are online or "/who lfw alchemist" to get a listing of Alchemists currently flagged as looking for work.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** The Bloodline Chronicles ***
<br />

<br />
- The Hand of Marr and Brethren of Night have moved their camps deeper into Nektulos Forest as they continue their research into the strange affliction plaguing the people of Freeport and Qeynos.
<br />
- The grinnin that remain in the forest have moved further downstream.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** Gameplay ***
<br />

<br />
- We have reduced the percentage of XP debt shared by group members.
<br />
- Improving your Swimming skill now increases the speed at which you swim.
<br />
- Encounter behavior has been changed such that if an encounter breaks and would have reset (and respawned the same encounter), it will now check if it was overpowered or overmatched and, if not, it will instead unbreak and become a viable target for a short period of time.  If the encounter is defeated successfully during that time, players will receive all of the original encounter XP bonus and some portion of the loot.
<br />
- The time required to camp out has been reduced from 30 seconds to 20 seconds.
<br />
- If a player was kicked from a guild while offline, their spendable guild status points will no longer be lost once they rejoin a new guild.
<br />
- Encounters should no longer break if your pet lands the final blow on a wild dog in The Sprawl.
<br />
- All group members in the same zone when a guild is created should automatically receive an invitation to join it.
<br />
- A pop-up message will now let players know that they must use their boat tickets before camping or leaving the zone.
<br />
- Flying mounts should no longer have a random orientation when they first start flying.
<br />
- Fixed an issue that was sometimes preventing an encounter from ever resetting after being broken.
<br />

<br />
- Characters who have more than 100% XP in their current level but have not gained a level due to a hallmark restriction (such as their class quest) will no longer be prevented from entering zones tied to those quests.
<br />
- Experience earned through questing is no longer affected by Mentoring, Vitality, or any other XP modifier (except for paying back XP debt).
<br />
- If an aggressive opponent would con red to the lowest-level member of the group but instead cons gray to the group because of its average level, the NPC will remain aggro and attack all the members of that group. A normally aggressive creature that will not aggro should no longer have a red border around its name. In short: grey mobs that have a red border will attack your group; grey mobs without a red border will not.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*** Housing ***
<br />

<br />
- Items marked No Trade can be placed in a house by trustees or the owner.
<br />
- All No Trade items placed in a house remember who placed them and can only be picked up by that character. 
<br />
- The house owner and any Trustees can move any No Trade items placed in the house.
<br />
- The house owner can destroy No Trade items not owned by them.
<br />
- No Trade items already placed in houses before the update are treated as follows:
<br />
  - If items with identical names are found in the house, the first four items of the same type are set to No Owner.
<br />
  - No Owner house items cannot be picked up until they are claimed. The "pickup" menu item is replaced with a "claim ownership" menu item for these items.
<br />
  - After the first four identical items are set to No Owner, all subsequent items of the same type are automatically owned by the house owner.
<br />
  - If the Owner of the house wishes to claim all No Owner items, that character can use the command /house_own_all to do so.
<br />
  - If the Owner of the house uses the "Collect Contents" button, they will NOT pick up No Owner items, they must explicitly claim those items using the right click menu or /house_own_all.
<br />
  - Example: A house contains three "Know your Gnolls" books and twelve Simple Forges.  All three "Know your Gnolls" books become No Owner and can be claimed by any trustee or the house owner. Four of the Simple Forges become No Owner and can be claimed by any trustee or the house owner. Eight of the Simple Forges are automatically owned by the house owner and can only be picked up by that character.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- Skeletons on the Isle of Refuge should now be solo encounters, except for those in the graveyard itself.
<br />

class="postbody">Sorry to hear about the 'Zerkers, but all in all this is one hell of a patch.  I would've like to see more high-end loot consistancy rather than low-end loot consistancy, but a new zone is a very welcome addition.  Unfortunately it sounds like one large Escort Mission, and those have never been buggy... 
<br />

<br />
It was smart to roll out Mentoring before the first Adventure Pack.  I'd like to think they did it because they didn't want anyone regardless of level to not purchase it, but hell, Mentoring is too damn cool, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt  <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" />  Now I'm in a pickle, I rolled a Troubador specifically to see all the content I missed, and I like it far more than my ShadowKnight.  If only they allowed us to change class once I'd be set.    <img src="images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /></span><span
