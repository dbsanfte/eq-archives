      <p>
      Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting up with Tigole and company at Blizzard Headquarters for a pre-E3 sneak peek at the World of Warcraft. This was my second time meeting up with Tigole in a year and after the last showing and tour I was given, I was extremely anxious to see what all was going on over there at Blizzard HQ.<br />
<br />
The first thing on the agenda was to check out the new work area for WoW. Tigole pointed out that they had moved the whole team to the larger side of the building to accomodate their new staff members and larger work force. You could tell right off these guys were not messing around. I'm talking a veritable army of people pouring their hearts out to put this game together. Even with quite a few of them already away for E3, the buiding was a hive of activity. <br />
<br />
I was introduced to quite a few people, zone populators, quest builders, artists, AI developers, you name it, I even met the guy who designs items - perhaps a mistake on Tigole's part! I KNOW WHERE YOU WORK BUDDY! Watch those nerfs :) Everyone I met was just amped about the game, which got me even more excited about the whole damn thing. <br />
<br />
So we finally reached Tigole's office and I sat down for the demonstration. Now mind you, when I went to visit last year and saw the build they had then, it looked READY to roll out. Remember, I'm an EQ player so I'm used to being fed unfinished crap. WoW at that point, however, looked more polished and ready than EQ ever was/has been. I was ready to consume WoW just from what I saw then, unfortunately, someone didn't get my $12,000,000 donation, Alpha evaded me! <br />
<br />
So as I was saying, I was thinking to myself, "How can this get better than it was?" Boy was I in for a surprise. Aside from the gameworld being way, way more developed, this time they showed me their UI, Quest Engine, Tradeskilling Engine, you name it, it was rolled out... All those complaints we've had in Everquest, and other MMORPGS were addressed. Essentially, you could look at the game and see that this game was built by people that LOVED to game. People that had faced the same damn frustrations we face and have faced daily. No more carpal tunnal syndrome tradeskilling. No more 45 hour Jboot camps. No idiotic quests, instead quests with meaning and meaningful rewards starting at lvl 1 and moving onward. To top it off, an intricately designed combat and spellcasting engine that didn't look and feel like absolute crap. Even PvP seemed like something people would WANT to participate in - something I had previously deemed impossible for an MMORPG to combine into a PvE oriented world with success.<br />
<br />
I was shown all the classes, including the new Druid (more on this one later). The basic methods of tranportation were shown to me, including Griffin rides. Now this one really stuck out at me. Tig clicked on the NPC and a mini-map came up, he clicked on where he wanted to go (he had have to have been there before this destination was even available to him btw), paid his 50 pesos, and he was off. Now the thing is, as you're being taken to your destination on these Griffins, you can pan around all over the place and see the world around you. The AMAZING thing, however, is that you think you're looking at a damn painting as you fly overhead because it looks so damn amazing, but you're looking at the actual gameworld. You can see NPCs and players fighting below you, hell they can see you flying overhead. I got a really great feeling flying over what I was told was 'a really dangerous area,' imagining that one day, I'd be fighting down there while newbies flew overhead 'ooooing and aaaaahhing' at the amazing things going on below them - an incredibly, incredibly immersive and awe inspiring feeling.<br />
<br />
The level and attention to detail that had been shown to every aspect of this game was evident. You are an alchemist? You need to forage herbs? Click on the forage button, your player actually begins to walk MUCH slower and looks down at the ground, meanwhile the overhead map directs you to hot spots where the rare herbs you need may be spawned. This was just ONE aspect of Tradeskills. Perhaps you are a blacksmith? When you are experienced/skilled enough, you may be able to craft the "Unholy Vorpal Blade of Uberness," but WHERE you craft the item would be of utmost importance. To craft such a fine blade, you would have to forge the blade itself in the depths of Blackrock Spine. These guys just don't miss a DAMN beat. I never thought I could get excited about a damn tradeskill, but just hearing something like this just wowed me (no pun intended), being shown these things, just freaked me out - a game that wasn't all talk? That lived up to a legacy it had built up for itself over the years from its RTS incarnation. Amazing.<br />
<br />
So aside from the classic three classes, Warrior, Mage, and Shaman, I was shown the Hunter and the Druid. I was also told that there was more to come, but I was warned that should I gain such knowledge, people with bamboo sticks and a large burlap sack would be knocking on my door in the morning - I didn't wanna take any chances so I didn't press the issue. <br />
<br />
The Hunter you could liken to the prototypical Ranger. They are masters of ranged attack, whether through gun (dwarf with shotty reloading T2 style is a sight to see) or bow, these guys put out some hurt. But the coolness factor of them being able to tame various animals in the gameworld, name their pets, and even level them up in power, is what gives them that extra Blizzard touch. Watching them in action was pretty bad ass, and this is guaranteed to be a popular class.<br />
<br />
By far and away, though, the Druid was the most bad ass of the classes I was shown (IMO!). Now it was funny, because when I looked at the character selection list I saw this big bad ass looking Night Elf and then under his name I saw 'Druid.' I gave a little chuckle under my breath, then they loaded him up. This ain't your momma's druid! A Druid is a shapeshifter. At different levels they gain the ability to shapeshift into different animals, and these animals have different abilities/pros/cons. The second I saw the shapeshift to the panther, I knew it was ON. After that I saw the shapeshift to the bear and then finally the hawk. Yes, you can fly. Heh... insanity. They can also 'dopplegang,' I guess you'd call it, into various forms of animals that are in the area they inhabit. Which would obviously make for a great ambush attack, as I hide in the bushes as a little harmless bunny wabbit and someone insolent, like I don't know, Parv, rolls around and I own him 'Bear Stylie.' What did Miggs tell you Parv??? That's what I thought... <br />
<br />
I assure you, I am leaving out so much, but I don't think you want me typing for the next three hours about WoW. Wait for all the incredible reviews it is guaranteed to get this E3 - and guys, I'm sorry if I forgot any details or even muddled up some details, it was information overload combined with being mesmerized for an hour and change. I'm only human! <br />
<br />
Thanks again to Tigole and Blizzard for having me and letting me get a peek at this insane and incredible game. After all the crap I've had to put up with these past four to five months, it really helped just cool me down and feel good about this genre again... great works guys. <br />

      You have 14 Days. If after that time the Plane is not properly tuned, I am deleting my characters, and cancelling all of my accounts. The rest of my guild will follow suit, as will several other guilds and people that play Everquest.<br />
<br />
To be brief, I did not work my ass off, jumping through your idiotic hoops with my friends and guildmates, so I could go to a zone where only groups of 18 could enjoy the content. EVEN if past these initial moronic events I can finally get my entire guild in to raid with me, FUCK YOU GUYS. Seriously, FUCK YOU.<br />
<br />
I cannot believe this... right now I'm just so pissed off. I am sitting here in the Plane of Time, and 3/4 of my guild is just sitting around while a group of 18 is repeatedly trying to beat one of the mini ring encounters. Don't you people have ANY FUCKING DECENCY? SMEDLEY WHY DON'T YOU STOP COUNTING YOUR MONEY AND START ISSUING ORDERS? <br />
<br />
The tragic irony of creating the ultimate cockblock encounter in the form of the Rathe which requires 80 people to defeat and then to limit encounters in the Plane of Time to 18.<br />
<br />
14 Days.... after that this site will change from the most popular EQ fan site on the internet to the most popular World of Warcraft fan site on the internet. I'm done playing ball with you useless fuckers... it's my turn.<br />

      Do you have at least 8 toes and an IQ above 45 and below 98? If so, we can use you! All that we require is the following:<br />
<br />
Able to take orders from those 'higher up,' than you on the 'Totem Pole' and not ask any questions. For example, if we tell you to break an encounter, never ask us why. We'll kill you and rape your pets. We'll do it too... We aren't fucking around.<br />
<br />
We will also require that you fuck up something that has to do with class or game balance EVERY single patch. We fully expect you to exploit it on live servers with your play character until you are all sploited out and then we'll fix the bug. <br />
<br />
Sound good so far? There's more!<br />
<br />
We will nerf encounters based on WHAT you and your guild are capable of doing. Coirnav too hard? No fucking problem - we'll take out our massive nerf sticks and make the encounter doable for your average 90 man zerg gimp force. <br />
<br />
What do we want you to do then? It's simple really. We have a lot of broken doors in the game world and at least 100 Level 4 Gnome Paladin and Shadowknight quests that are not properly functioning. As you may have guessed, this is fucking up our game world something awful. You'll be tasked to fix the newbie Gnome quests and while you're at it, fix the goddamn doors. We will also ask that you bring along your third grade teacher to help you correct the 1,094 instances of us completely butchering the English language in game. Anything from basic NPC interactive dialogue to the most complex of stories, most of which are found in the level 4 Gnome Knight quests. Our last 3 designers never fully understood the difference between 'LOSE,' and 'LOOSE.' To tell you the truth, we don't either but the Boss's 13 year old son was complaining. Care for some poop on a stick? Unf Unf... What?? Humping is a sign of affection, ok?<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
What do we have here? <br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/images/RatheGoddamnit.jpg"><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/RatheGoddamnit.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A> <br />
<br />
What we have here is an encounter that has been broken for MONTHS. The very same encounter blocking about 10 guilds from enterring the Plane of Time. Coincidence? Must be, Sony would never intentionally break content and keep said content broken to prevent its loyal player base from being happy. Although, I have to wonder why the SIX non messable Rathe Councilmen were not summoning the first week this encounter was tested on live servers and then suddenly started to summon after an impromptu patch on Earth B. I get more curious about this change when I put together the pieces of this encounter with the help of this guy:<br />
<br />
<img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/TheTruth.jpg><br />
<br />
And realize that this one simple change they made is what completely and totally broke the encounter. I blaspheme, though, this must all be a happy coincidence.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Below is the highlight of my EQ gaming experiences of the past four months.<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/images/Vicarcocksucker.jpg"><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/Vicarcocksucker.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A><br />
<br />
This last patch made it so you can aggro and kill NPCs in PoK, Nexus, wherever you coudn't aggro/attack NPCs before. Naturally, I kept my promise and the first piece of shit I killed was this son-of-a-bitch. I think anybody responsible for spell turn-ins for their guild can feel me on this one. Every single time I turned runes in to this guy, I would vow that one day, when I had the opportunity, he would fucking pay the ultimate price for his insolence. That kill was for 100 Yaulp VI and Mark of Righteous turn-ins.<br />
<br />
So yea, Vicar Cocksucker is the highlight of FOH's kills in the past four months. Exciting, no?<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Lastly, check out this picture, I think it perfectly encompasses my feelings about Earth, and Everquest in general. Thanks for this...<br />

      We all know that when it comes to pissing off one's 'whiney' customers, nobody in the business can top Sony. Now I'm gonna rant... it's gonna be long, it's gonna be gay. Read it if you like, I don't give a fuck either way.<br />
<br />
First I will show you a pretty picture to lull you into compliance.<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/images/Coirnav.jpg"><img src=http://www.fohguild.org/images/Coirnav.jpg border=0 width=320 height=240></A><br />
<br />
Now that I have your attention.<br />
<br />
I. Blowable spawns suck. We learned this when? Anyone? Anyone? We first learned this with the Avatar of War and then later learned to hate it again with damn near 50% of the end game content in Luclin. Now, if you search your records, you will find that you do in fact have a method to counter blowable spawns. For the sake of this argument, we will call it a <b><i>NON</i>-blowable spawn</b>. <br />
<br />
You guys know what this is right? You did it with Rallos Zek so every dipshit gimp and their mother could get 5,000 shots a day in with 400 trained chimpanzees hurling their poop at the poor fucker until he collapsed in a stinky pile of agony and defeat. <br />
<br />
What I'm gonna ask for is something you are unfamiliar with - BALANCE. Something in between the ridiculous opportunities that the RZ trigger presents (not to mention the even more ridiculous respawn time after a win of 48 hours) and the absolute absurdity of the Coirnav encounter. <br />
<br />
"But Furor..." shut the fuck up I'm not done. I realize that both the Fennin Ro and Coirnav encounters have mini-bosses that net out loot. (1) Is that your only damn problem? (2) Or are you really just assholes who enjoy creating self-cockblocking content which in turn causes grief and strife among the player base? Solution to follow if you fall in category one, also known as comatose or totally brainless.<br />
<br />
Remember the Emperor? Remember the Blood of Ssra? Remember how people would farm him for his loot? Remember when you made any Blood spawns after the original to be mundane lootless PHs with the same ability as the real Blood? I'm not gonna spell it out for you Corky because when you figure it out I want you to feel a sense of accomplishment. You guys can throw around a high-five and practice tossing donuts around each other's cocks and then see who can eat the other guy's donut-cock-ring-thing the fastest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Itemization sucks. Itemization may actually suck more than the actual blowable event scenario because most of the shittiest itemizations are on said blowable events. So when you manage to overcome the sheer stupidity of the blowable event, you are slapped in the face with shit like the loot shown above. I mean give us a fucking break. I'm not the only guy 'whining' about this crap. Make the loot WORTH looting, i.e. Xegony loot. Not crap that we can get with far less effort off far easier mobs. While you are at it, if you are at it, the drop rate on Chain Legs specifically is horrible. For the most part, most uber guilds I have spoken with agree with me - the rate is FAR too rare. This is more than just a coincidence, it's straight up broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
III. Before you decide you need to nerf things like enrage, AE rampage, etc... look at who is throwing in the complaints. Realize you will either have to compensate for the massive nerf you have planned by upping the mobs power considerably, causing even more whiners to vocalize, or you will be stuck with more lame duck/sitting duck Gods that Zerg Guild #592 will just plow through on their way to Plane of Time. If anything 90% of the mobs in elemental planes need substantial upgrades.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IV. Find the guy responsible for the Wood Elf Illusion Crown Quest and beat the fuck out of him. There's nothing I enjoy more than taking a twink to Guk, doing a /who and seeing 18 lvl 65 players AEing the fuck out of the dead side while little fucking Timmy the lvl 42 paladin and his stalwart group of adventurers are left with dick in hand, crying their little eyes out. While you are beating the stupid fuck that made this quest, just remember little Timmy. It'll fuel the rage. You turned a fantastic exp spot into a fucking shitpool. What's next? The Ogre Illusion Cock Ring that requires positive faction with the gnomes in Sol A? What a stupid fucking idea compounded by stupid fucking quest implementation. Make the faction its own damn faction that can only be obtained deep in sebilis or some shit... I know Krup's and above in Sebilis are giving Frogloks of Guk faction, you're on the right track, now change that faction to something else entirely so the shitheads can vacate Guk. Remember Timmy assholes...<br />
