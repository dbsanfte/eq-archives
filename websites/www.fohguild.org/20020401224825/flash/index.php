      So remember the other day when I was telling you about the Emperor and how he had the special power of being invulnerable to melee? Yea, well, we found the weapons you need to use on him - sadly, it's just another huge time sink in the most disappointly fucked up expansion since Nino's failed penis enlargement surgery.<br />
<br />
Let me break it down for you people, 'cause I know how some of you are just straight up morons. In order to kill the Emperor in Ssra, you have to get keys for everybody in your guild. The process of camping keys is about as much fun as passing a kidney stone, only more time consuming. So once that is done, sometime in 2003, you have to concern yourselves with getting all of your melee geared up with this shit:<br />
<br />
<img src=http://fohguild.org/news/CSWSsra.jpg><br />
<br />
So what's the problem? I'll tell you what the fucking problem is - the component you need to make this sword drops off ONE mob who happens to be a RARE spawn who also just coincidentally happens to have TWO other drops, the ore that you need being the *drumroll please* EXTREMELY RARE drop. Coincidence? I think not... if it is, somebody call Ripley's, cause I got more shit to lay out.<br />
<br />
High End Content in Luclin? Let me tell you about the High End Content in Luclin - it fucking sucks. Luclin, dear readers, is one gigantic gaping wound. One huge, flaming fuck of a timesink. <br />
<br />
You want to kill Lord Seru? Have fun camping the items you need for Serubane weapons. That camp makes camping for Keys + Shissarbane weapons for the Emperor look appealing. It's only taken us two months to equip our whole guild. How long will it take you? I'll tell you what, since you have jack shit of a clue on how to get them, I'll estimate you'll see Seru dead sometime after Hayley's Comet rolls around. Did I happen to mention he isn't killable? May have slipped my mind...<br />
<br />
So you want to go visit the other half of Acrylia? Do you really? Are you ready for another FIVE Ring Events? Yes folks, count them - five - not including the shit that may be near The Master. Not only are there FIVE FUCKING RING EVENTS back there, they are FIVE RING EVENTS built for 100-200 people. Did I mention you need ONE key per person to get back there and each key takes one week to get and also requires you to participate in a 10th Ring Style War on Steroids (PER KEY)? May have slipped my mind...<br />
<br />
So you want to enter Vex-mother-fucking-Thal and kick some ass? Guess what? You'll be playing in the Planes of Power before that happens. Why Animal Mother? WHY?! I'll tell you why. Because to get in Vex Thal requires the completion of a Key Quest, the likes of which makes the aforementioned time sinks (combined in one massive mound of monkey cum and whale piss) look like a "quickie" between you and Shakira.<br />
<br />
What's that you say? You're still killing shit in North TOV? Hahahahahhaah... have fun skipping this expansion then you fucking jackasses, cause you ain't seeing shit of it now. PoP is right around the corner and by the time you people that are stuck in a whole 'nother expansion realize what the fuck is going on, PoP will be on store shelves.<br />
<br />
So you see, not only are the "Uberguilds" getting shafted in Luclin, the sorry bitch guilds that like to piss and moan about the "Uberguilds" are also getting shafted. Cause I guarantee you if we're being denied content, guess who suffers? The average Joe guy on the street. The same poor schmuck who always suffers. Yea, YOU DUMBASS. Call your congressman.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, this shit died.. woopey<br />

      So we were in Ssra tonight with our sights set on killing this fool:<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://fohguild.org/news/BloodoSsr.jpg"><img src=http://fohguild.org/news/BloodoSsr.jpg border=0 width=400 height=300></A><br />
<br />
So with a mighty force of 25 Keyed FoH, we got this clusterfuck of a design error under control and killed this queer. After said queer was killed, Emperor spawns... now believe me, I WAS NOT expecting anything out of this encounter, I basically assumed he would be retardly designed, what I witnessed actually SURPASSED my expectations. <br />
<br />
NOT only does he have this fantastic power which is the designer's way of telling us, "We are not very creative, we give up, you win, we suck, die please":<br />
<br />
<img src=http://fohguild.org/news/Empgay.jpg><br />
<br />
He also had this l33t power, only seen on one or two other uber mobs, the Bag of Supplies in Kael, those two gay invis mobs at zone in of ToV that people sit and hit for hours on end, and Lord Seru - only one of those mobs has been killed, and I'll tell you it wasn't the Bag of Supplies.<br />
<br />
<img src=http://fohguild.org/news/EmpSsra.jpg><br />
<br />
Now seriously, even I have my limits... this encounter actually managed to surpass the "Gayness Quotient" that I am able to withstand. There is only one man with a higher "Gayness Quotient" on this earth, and he doesn't play EQ, often.... so what to do?<br />

      Which is what I am demonstrating in this super picture. Notice my buttocks? Harder than diamond...<br />
<br />
As you can see, we gave the Ring of Thule another go - results? Shit dead! <br />
<br />
I must say, this ring is quickly turning out to be the l33test of all the rings, followed by the Ring of Crushbone and Ring of Mooto (Misty).<br />
<br />
Since we nerfed ourselves by getting those CrAzY Focus Items toned down, we ended up having to hire a 300 man army of Rogues and Monks to get this far - either that, or our core of kick ass Wizards/Magicians/Enchanters/Necros did the impossible (as per the horde of know-nothing-level-54-gimps on Graffe) and proved themselves useful! <br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://fohguild.org/news/RoCT.jpg"><img src=http://fohguild.org/news/RoCT.jpg border=0 width=400 height=300></A> <img src=http://fohguild.org/news/FIBCTR.jpg> <img src=http://fohguild.org/news/DCCTR.jpg><br />
<br />
We spanked Dread first, then Fright, then were unfortunately overwhelmed when Terror was released - some loot was obtained, yea, its not the greatest loot, but it's only the first of many loots to come from this ring *shrug* - more importantly, we had a pretty kickass time. 	  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      Aside from dumbing down the game another few levels, bringing the actual difficulty of killing any "Killable-Non-Intentionally-Cockblocked" Mob in the game down to the level of a flaming bus full of retarded hermaphrodites, we had this fantastic shit to look forward to:<br />
<br />
Now mind you, I had to wade through quite a bit of shit to find this, but BY GOLLY IT WAS FUCKING THERE and you cannot say it wasn't! <br />
<br />
"** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Changed safe spot in Kedge Keep to actually be a safe spot <br />
- The Beastlord trainer in Firiona Vie is now more friendly to Beastlords of all types <br />
- Vyzh`dra the Cursed has been adjusted to help balance the risk versus reward associated with the encounter <br />
<br />
Now we all know I don't give a shit about the change to the safe spot in Kedge Keep, and neither does FoH. While I DID masturbate after I read the line about the Beastlord trainer, the line that caught my eye and the eyes of other people across the servers was the last line: VYZH'DRA THE CURSED was adjusted to help balance out the Risk vs. Reward.<br />
<br />
Now hold on there, some of you are going to tell me, "Animal Mother, you are full of shit - My guild went down to the Basement in Ssra today after the patch, we killed the Glyphed, we killed the Exhiled (Both in record time *Thanks MORE POWA VI!*) and then we came face to face with the Cursed and NOT A DAMN thing was changed." To you I say, WRONG. I have pictures to prove how he was "adjusted" to be more in line with his RvR - Peep this shit:<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://fohguild.org/news/NewVyzh.jpg"><img src=http://fohguild.org/news/NewVyzh.jpg border=0 width=400 height=300></A><br />
<br />
Now many of you don't know this but Verant Developers are into this Zen Buddhism shit or something and it shows in game. If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Same fucking philosophy here - Mezzdat didn't really die, nobody heard it, he lived and enjoyed a prosperous and kinky life as a homosexual midget herder. Case closed...<br />
<br />
Now onto the Ring of Cazic-Thule... Not too much I can say here, we got pretty damn far, managing to spawn both the Avatar of Dread and Avatar of Fright without one fucking Rune dropping but that bastard in the far corner fucked us... Yea I'd say if we had another ~100 level 60s with Warcry, Bandage Wound (Maxed), and Turn Undead (Maxed), this ring would be NO PROBLEM. Did I mention the skill "TAUNT" doesn't work here? At all? Let me guess... "Working as intended?" Will the revamp of Najena disable beneficial spells cast upon other players? Only time will tell...<br />
<br />
<A HREF="http://fohguild.org/news/AoDoom.jpg"><img src=http://fohguild.org/news/AoDoom.jpg border=0 width=400 height=300></A><br />
<br />
So ends another day in the expansion that should have been named "The Great Cockblock in the Sky."<br />
<br />
This lemming is out! See you all next update - stay l33t...	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
