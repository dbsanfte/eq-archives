        <strong>April 03, 2003</strong><br>
        NToV is cleared! Tonight, we finished clearing the remaining dragons for 
        our rotation. This was an exciting time for many of us to finish this 
        area of the zone. Drops were:<br>
        <strong>Jorlleag:</strong> ?<br>
        <strong>Nevederia:</strong> Nevederia's Horn [Maxist CT], Nevederia's 
        Claw [Alone CT] (both were likely to rot)<br>
        <strong>Lord Vyemm:</strong> Vyemm's Left Eye [Gargamesh OC], Gaudralek, 
        Sword of the Sky [Stien CT]<br>
        <br>
        Grats to all winners, and we are all looking forward to our next rotation 
        slot! We are also working out plans to attempt Vulak himself.<br>
        <br>
        After NToV, about 3 groups decided to pay a visit to the Plane of Mischief. 
        We explored quite a bit of the zone and marveled at all the special features 
        and rooms (Alice in Wonderland area, the Chess set, the Puppet Show, and 
        more). The zone is pretty wild and it looks like a lot of work went into 
        this. A few of us plan on staying for a couple days just to play around.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>April 02, 2003</strong><br>
        The Cazic-Thule server has always been quite cooperative with <a href="http://www.samaonline.com/secondage/portal/FORUM.asp?FORUM_ID=1&CAT_ID=7&Forum_Title=General%2BChat">rotation 
        agreements</a> because they save everyone an enormous amount of time. 
        Tonight, due to a guild going rogue in NToV, per rotation rule #11, we 
        alerted all other NToV rotation guilds of this transgression. Rule 11 
        states:<br>
        <br>
        <em>11) Should a &quot;rogue&quot; guild decide to try and interfere with 
        the set rotation, instead of attempting to cooperate with it, there need 
        to be a means set in place to stop them from doing so. In such a case, 
        all guilds/allies in the rotation will be asked to come and fight for 
        NToV as one large alliance, to force that rogue guild to compete with 
        200+ people, hopefully forcing that rogue guild into cooperation.</em><br>
        <br>
        Within 15 minutes, over 250 people from the rotation guilds of Crimson 
        Talon, Obsidian Coven, Exhumed, The Dragon Alliance, Legacy of Darkness, 
        Second Age, Blood Guards, and Council of Grey were in the zone! After 
        discussions with the GM's, the rotation agreement and enforcement stands. 
        A special thanks to all the other guilds that showed up.<br>
        <br>
        More dragons fell:<br>
        <strong>Carx'Vean:</strong> Silent Fang Necklace- Tronsmang (OC)<br>
        <strong>Lord Kreizenn:</strong> Silver Disk- Dovan (OC), Verlekarnorm's 
        Horn of Disaster- Brewall (CT) <em>only CT bard present, wins by default</em><br>
        <strong>Zlexak:</strong> Windraider's Belt- Ippit (CT) <br>
        <strong>Cekenar:</strong> Blackstar, Mace of Night- Sveva (OC), Meljeldin, 
        Bane of the Giants- Machedor (CT) <br>
        <strong>Sevalak:</strong> Axe of Resistance- ?</p>
      <p>Also, Brewall has posted his map drawing for the Dulak's Habor along 
        with a cleaned-up TXT file (30k) and an additional overlay file with grid/coordinates 
        (3k). These will be made public in a few weeks.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>April 01, 2003</strong><br>
        Per the NToV rotation agreement with other guilds on the server, CT/OC 
        began its turn. As our first clearing of the area, we are still learning 
        quite a bit, but are quickly making our way through the zone. We slaughtered:<br>
        <strong>Eashen of Sky:</strong> Claw of Lightning- Teenii (OC), Ring of 
        Sky- Ippit (CT) , Twisted steel bastard sword?-? <br>
        <strong>Aaryonar:</strong> Whitestone Shield- Tico (CT), Hand of the Master-? 
        <strong>Nir'Tan:</strong> Shield of Fury-Tigerbane (OC)<br>
        <strong>Quellod Earthenspirit:</strong> Melodic Charm-Brewall (CT) <em>only 
        CT bard present, wins by default</em><br>
        <strong>Vyldin:</strong> Bow of the Silver Fang (rotted)<br>
        <strong>Lord Feshlak:</strong> Staff of Silent Star-Porcha (OC), Sky Watchers 
        Monacle #1-Shyr (CT), Sky Watchers Monacle #2-? <br>
        <strong>Dagarn the Destroyer:</strong> Wurm Claw Pauldrons-Tarrask (CT), 
        Boots of the Destroyer-Sveva (OC)<br>
        <br>
        Also, Brewall has posted his map drawing for the Gulf of Gunthak along 
        with a cleaned-up TXT file (70k) and an additional overlay file with grid/coordinates 
        (4k). These will be made public in a few weeks.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 30, 2003</strong><br>
        Grats to Sabretta for reaching 65!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 28, 2003</strong><br>
        Avatar of War goes down again to the forces of CT/OC. Another flawless 
        victory resulting in: Ring of Destruction [Zimmerts &amp; Denor] and a 
        War Bow of Rallos Zek [Machedor].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 27, 2003</strong><br>

        <strong>Mar 18, 2003</strong><br>
        NToV was FFA this evening, so we decided to make our first trip deep into 
        the zone and to kill as many dragons as we could. We weren't dissapointed!<br>
        <strong> Mazrien:</strong> Shield of the Protector [Hawkien].<br>
        <strong> Koi:</strong> Trident of the Deep Sea [Runehammer], Ancient Pirate 
        Eyepatch [Chadmoe], and Helm of the Deep Sea [Nantuil].<br>
        <strong> Zlexak</strong>: Dragon Skin Bracelet [Proetus] and Baton of 
        Flame [Bruise]. <br>
        <strong> Cekenar</strong>: Frosted Iron Spike [Teeni] and Maljeldin, Bane 
        of Giants [Sabretta].<br>
        <strong> Sevalak</strong>: 2 Axe of Resistance [Jollander and Tarrask].<br>
        <strong> Jorlleag</strong>: Earring of the Icecrasher [Lathrim], Crown 
        of Resistance [Chiun], and a Facesmasher [Wynndy].<br>
        <strong> Lady:</strong> 2 Cloak of Thorns [Teranick and Windarii].<br>
        A lot of new encounters in a new area!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 16, 2003</strong><br>
        Ventured into Grieg's End this evening to kill Grieg himself. Our tactics 
        and execution were flawless resulting in our first ever Grieg kill!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 15, 2003</strong><br>
        Looking for some things to kill, we decided on hitting WToV. Killed Gozz: 
        Shovel of the Harvest [Chiun] and Rekeklo's War Sword [Sabretta]. Then 
        Telk: 2 Circlet of Suffering [Proetus &amp; Physst] and a Lance of Thunder. 
        Then Lend: Talisman [Brewall].</p>
      <p><strong>Mar 14, 2003</strong><br>
        We are all very thankful as a guild to be made up of players that like 
        to play EQ as a game and treat each other like family. As we have progressively 
        climbed up the encounter difficulty ladder, we remember where we came 
        from and how long we have played together. Cherishing our friendship, 
        we stay together, and look forward to the next new encounter and challenge. 
        In just the last month, we have taken on and killed: The Statue of Rallos 
        Zek, the Avatar of War, Aaryonar, and the 10th coldain ring war. NToV 
        and other new encounters are coming up as well. <strong>Next!</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 13, 2003</strong><br>
        An epic day today as a few groups were able to slay long-outstanding mobs 
        that have a horrible habit of never dropping their epic items. Sabretta 
        was able to obtain the Essense from the Ashenbone Drake in hate, the hand 
        of maestro for Dakatsu, and a Magi kill for Fluteria. After countless 
        empty kills, they all managed to drop what we were looking for! <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 12, 2003</strong><br>
        We made a raid into VP again this evening after tearing it up the last 
        three weeks. It seems the zone was bugged though with a few things that 
        made it virtually impossible to move into the zone. Chanters could not 
        mez or charm ANY mob in the zone (huge nerf to enchanters if this was 
        intentional) and there were numerous mobs with absolutely insane regen. 
        Regen on some mobs was so high you could beat on it and see its health 
        ticking back up after a wizard nuke that would barely dent it. In the 
        end, we took our fustrations out on another zone...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 11, 2003</strong><br>
        Another successful joint raid with OC on the Avatar of War and his henchmen. 
        Drops were very generous: Chestplate of Vindication [Tigerbane], Hammer 
        of Battle [Kynlore], Reaver [Tico], Iron Scroll of War [Kridak], Blade 
        of Carnage [Cmgal], Helm of Rallos Zek [Trast]. After that, we went on 
        to kill Sontalak for our very first time and took him down flawlessly: 
        Sontalak's Talisman [Tigersbane], Circlet of Silver Skies [Justan], Rekelos 
        War Sword [Dexuran], and numerous spell drops. The West ToV dragons fell 
        shortly after that.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 10, 2003</strong><br>
        Eigth shawl quest for Skylynn this evening. Protected the General and 
        Skylynn is now the proud owner of the 8th Coldain shawl congrats!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 09, 2003</strong><br>
        PoI factory raid which was followed up with finishing the 8th shawl for 
        Brewall. Probably one of the few bards that has this item and this may 
        have spurned all the casters into finishing it as well.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 08, 2003</strong><br>
        Off to kill the Avatar of War again, and we weren't disappointed. Another 
        flawless kill resulting in: Flayed Barbarian Hide Leggings [Ashant, Wynndy], 
        Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask [Kitpoke], and a Helmet of Ralos Zek [Kynlore].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 07, 2003</strong><br>
        We stormed into Fear with our friends in OC to kill Cazic Thule. After 
        clearing the zone, we sent our bards out to pull him into our trap netting 
        us: Groteque Girdle [Zionmaster], Crimson Robe of Aledine [Satashi], Pauldrons 
        of Ferocity [Shinlae], Cloak of the Fearsome [Bruize], and a Bile Etched 
        Obsidian Choker [Riverwake].<br>
        <br>
        We also killed the Kael statue with loots of: Breastplate of Eradication 
        [Kilwean], Shard of Hsaga's Talisman [Chiun], Cloak of Falling Stars [Jonasin], 
        and 2 Reavers.<br>
        <br>
        Tormax also fell to us for a first time kill! Drops were: Shard of Hsaga's 
        Talisman [Tico], King Tormax's Head, and 4 count'em 4 White Dragon Scale 
        Sashes [Tribul, Bimie, Kandye, and Fayluna].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 6, 2003</strong><br>
        Ringwar! Tonight, the forces of CT and OC combined to fight our first 
        tenth coldain ringwar. Fenik turned in the orders and the war was on. 
        Lasting just a tad over two hours, we slayed wave after wave of giants. 
        In the end, our forces prevailed and we reveled in our victory over the 
        giants. All of the coldain heros were kept safe, adding to our loot bounty. 
        Grats to Fenik on the ring and to OC for the lance and crown.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 5, 2003</strong><br>
        Brewall has posted maps of all LoY zones in the guild only area of the 
        site. Still has to do drawing versions, but at least the in-game cartography 
        should work for those who download the files.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 4, 2003</strong><br>
        We went back to Veeshan's Peak tonight and just plain tore the place up.<br>
        <strong>Hoshkar</strong> was very generous to us tonight [Grey Suede Boots]x2 
        Maxist, Altus. [Feverblade - Bane of the Shissar]x2 Dreamthief, Kitpoke<br>
        <strong>Silverwing</strong> dropped some craptastic loot [Scimtar of Lifestealing] 
        Kitpoke, [Robe of Smothering][Dragon Spine Staff][Lyran's Mystical Lute](we 
        couldn't give them away).<br>
        <strong>Phara Dar</strong> gave us a new loot tonight [Crown of Rile] 
        Khandrahcir, [Claw of Phara Dar]x2 Kitpoke, Dakatsu<br>
        <strong>Xygoz</strong>[Smoldering Cudgel] Klaminar, [Frozen Zweihander]x2 
        Maxist,rot.<br>
        <strong>Druushk</strong> gave a new toy [Sarnak Summoners Staf] Immolar, 
        [Maelstrom] Romell, [Skullcrusher of Kragg][Katana of endurance]craptastic.<br>
        <strong>Nexona</strong> has to be the hardest dragon in the zone, to pull, 
        to fight, we lose more people fighting this mob than any other in the 
        zone as well as the pull team a few times. [Nightfall] Kitpoke, [Robe 
        of Adversity] Sardilaav (BG), [Star of the Guardian]rot.<br>
        We completely cleared the zone in right at 3 hours of fighting, our first 
        single night clearing of all of the dragons in VP<br>
