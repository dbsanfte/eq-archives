        <em>Last update: 04 January 2002</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <span class="s2cA"><br>
        Greetings all. I've written this guide to explain how a textbook Naggy 
        raid is done. This is the compilation of my observations on both good 
        &amp; bad raids and numerous &quot;guides&quot; that I have found that 
        were often lacking. For many players, dragon hunts are their first foray 
        into large scale raids and if you have never done one before, this guide 
        will explain a lot of what is going on, and what you need to do. Most 
        of all, be patient. Pulling off a large raid can take a bit of time, especially 
        if the raid is short of certain classes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT YOU NEED</b><br>
        1. You should be between levels 45 and 52. Clerics as low as 39 (with 
        complete heal) are also useful.<br>
        2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Fire Resistance of 100. The 
        higher the better.<br>
        3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will 
        be used for beneficial spells. <br>
        4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HOW TO GET THERE</b><br>
        1. Closest Druid portal: Lavastorm<br>
        2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of Nekulos Forest<br>
        <br>
        <b>IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER</b><br>
        1. Naggy is a level 55 Dragon Warrior.<br>
        2. Naggy's most deadly weapon is his AE fire breath and AE fear spell. 
        Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, 
        even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
        3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 
        2xEarring of Fire Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at Lavastorm gypsies), Gold 
        Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10 MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald 
        Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging 
        (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok 
        King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
        4. Many of the mobs in Solusek have high fire resist - including Nag, 
        use cold based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
        5. In order to cast any spell on a dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HIS MELEE 
        RANGE.<br>
        <br>
        <b>STAGING PHASE</b><br>
        1. When you are in Lavastorm or Solusek, report in to the raid leader.<br>
        2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check 
        with friends if asked.<br>
        3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
        4. The raid leader, pullers, and group leaders will use shout channel. 
        All other communication should be on the OOC channel.<br>
        5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and 
        the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical 
        areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers).<br>
        <br>
        <b>ASSEMBLY OPTIONS</b><br>
        1. Assemble in Lavastorm and fight en-mass through giants or meet at stone 
        spider room.<br>
        2. Single late comers may need to be CoH if past giants. If multiple people, 
        they can form temporary groups and fight back to staging area outside 
        Nag Lair. If need be, spiders can be pulled to assembly area to keep path 
        free.<br>
        <br>
        <b>KILLING GIANTS PHASE</b><br>
        1. Once enough people are present, final groups will be assigned.<br>
        2. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay back.<br>
        3. The main and secondary assists will be named. Create a hotkey for each.<br>
        4. The raid leader and backup leader will be named. Take instructions 
        from either leader.<br>
        5. Form into final groups. Write down all members on paper for future 
        reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target someone 
        with a mouse, so just use the &quot;/target [name]&quot; command).<br>
        6. The pullers will begin pulling the giants to the groups. This phase 
        is often tricky and the puller may die. All these mobs are on an approximate 
        8 hour timer. When the last giant is killed, the groups will move to the 
        safe spot in the hallway near Nag's chambers. Once this phase starts, 
        please do not go go AFK.<br>
        7. Nuking casters will bind in the camp spot, so that in death, can mem 
        critical spells and jump back into the fight. In the past, players sometimes 
        left a couple coins on the ground to prevent empty corpses from vanishing 
        if dying again. An alternate approach was to have everyone in group create 
        a &quot;/split 0 0 0 6&quot; key, which can be used prior to someone coming 
        back into the fight.<br>
        8. Raid leader should go through the entire attack plan and buffing information 
        at this point.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BUFFING PHASE</b><br>
        1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff 
        number.<br>
        2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to 
        minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).<br>
        3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.<br>
        4. Once stripped, all buffers &amp; all bards will disband from the groups. 
        Temporary buffer groups will be formed. Suggest that you do 2 buffing 
        stations inside the dragon skull room. Do station #1 at left pot and station 
        #2 at right pot. If 3 is possible, do it near the teeth. Clarity should 
        be kept on all buffers and teamed with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, 
        keep chloro and bard singing mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana). 
        Groups with magicians and necros should be buffed last to allow them to 
        feed mana longer.<br>
        5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should 
        move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step. 
        Give a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.<br>
        6. The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.<br>
        &nbsp; #01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold)<br>
        &nbsp; #02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
        &nbsp; #03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease, strength)<br>
        &nbsp; #04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision)<br>
        &nbsp; #05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
        &nbsp; #06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
        &nbsp; #07 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
        &nbsp; #08 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)<br>
        &nbsp; #09 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
        &nbsp; #10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
        &nbsp; #11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
        &nbsp; #12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
        &nbsp; #13 druid - circle of winter - group FR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
        &nbsp; #14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
        &nbsp; #15 open - for bard resist song<br>
        7. Once buffed, the group should disband, OOC done, and camp out.<br>
        8. When back at the server selection screen, go to the chat area, and 
        go to the server chat (Cazic-Thule in my case). Wait here until someone 
        gets on and says everyone should log back.<br>
        9. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary buff groups will form 
        groups of 5, buff themselves, and recover mana.<br>
        10. Someone will camp and tell the chat room that the attack will start 
        momentarily. Give group leaders a 30 second head start.<br>
        11. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Nagafen will cast fear, and it 
        is best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and he fears you, you 
        may wind up in lava.&nbsp; <strong>Note:</strong> VI changed this code, 
        when feared you will always move at a set speed, therefore, it no longer 
        does any good to turn on walk.<br>
        12. Reform final groups.<br>
        13. Any class that has a pet should summon one.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ASSAULTING NAG</b><br>
        1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. 
        Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
        2. [RL: Prepare for attack on the count of 3!]. Bards should start to 
        play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 
        71CR, and 71FR).<br>
        3. [RL: Group 1 and 2 attack]. The main tank groups will rush Nag, activate 
        disciplines (if you have them), and attack. Bards will not attack with 
        hand-to-hand (insignificant melee damage and Nag ripostes can cause significant 
        damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below stomach 
        near his hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian 
        Rhythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
        4. Goal is to push Nag from the bridge to the back wall. This creates 
        more distance from the lava in case someone is feared, and allows clerics 
        to heal from bridge without being in AE range.<br>
        5. [RL: Group 3 and 4 attack]. If a lot of melees are present and you 
        have 4-5 groups, two more groups can be sent in once Nagafen is slightly 
        back from the bridge and there is a little more room to work with.<br>
        6. Once Nagafen is on back wall, surround him on 3 sides and keep him 
        there.<br>
        7. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the bridge.<br>
        <br>
        EARLY INTO FIGHT<br>
        8. [RL: Debuf now].&nbsp; Shamans should immediately begin to attempt 
        to slow/debuf Nag and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, 
        etc). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt 
        to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may consider adding a debuf to 
        twist (1 does cold resist, 1 does magic resist).<br>
        9. Necros should avoid spells that turn Nag into a skeleton. This makes 
        it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
        10. Healers should remain back at the bridge until needed. If there is 
        only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back 
        to the bridge and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of breath 
        range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come 
        to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is on the bridge 
        outside breath range.<br>
        11. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their 
        group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of AE fire damage, 
        and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only 
        class that will not come back to the bridge for healing if they are the 
        only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
        12. Healers/Paladins should call out in OOC any LoH or CH.<br>
        13. Necros should pump mana to clerics.<br>
        <br>
        AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
        14. [RL: Pets attack now]. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
        15. [RL: Tash now]. 1 enchanter should Tash and should OOC &quot;Tashed&quot; 
        if successful. If Nag agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should 
        not be healed (hate will be transferred to healer and healer will die). 
        Heal the enchanter if they live.<br>
        16. Enchanters will have hard time landing any damage spell on Nagafen. 
        Best use may be to cast rune on Nagafen's current target.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        AT 50% HEALTH<br>
        17. [RL: Nuke now]. Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get 
        within melee range or your spell will not land. Nuke until Nag is dead.<br>
        18. [RL: Reserves Attack now]. Any melee groups held in reserve should 
        attack.<br>
        19. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All 
        rezzes will be done when Nag goes down.<br>
        20. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move away 
        from Nagafen and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (dragon targeted) 
        for 300+ damage.<br>
        <br>
        AT 20% HEALTH<br>
        21. [RL: Wizards Nuke now]. Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
        <br>
        <b>NAG DEATH</b><br>
        1. Nag's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after he dies.<br>
        2. The group leader of the killing group should inspect the body and tell 
        the raid leader which items are present.&nbsp; Some raids will have a 
        trusted member lock the corpse until the raid leader can get to the corpse.<br>
        3. No one else should inspect the body. The raid leader will loot and 
        distribute items.<br>
        4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups 
        may be assigned with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time. <br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        Ah, dragon loot. What tank doesn't want haste? Who wouldn't want a 100% 
        weight reduction 10-slot bag that holds XL items? Or listen to cheers

        <b>LOOT RULES</b><br>
        1. Depending on the raid, loot rules can differ widely. Be sure to check 
        before joining the raid. Some items may be claimed by the raid leader 
        or hosting guild.<br>
        2. Typically, each class eligible for an item is assigned a number and 
        a random is performed to award the item. If eligible, raid leaders and 
        group leaders should state which numbers they have prior to the roll.<br>
        3. Although some items are all/all, some should be restricted to benefit 
        the classes that could use the item the most - as opposed to being up 
        for sale at the EC bazaar minutes after the fight ends:<br>
        a. Cloak of Flames: Melees / Hybrids<br>
        b. Gauntlets of Firey Might: Monks<br>
        c. Red Dragon Scale: Bards &amp; Warriors for epic quest.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES</b><br>
        It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Nag fight, 
        but it is moderated by getting expelled by Nag (other than buffs prior 
        to a fight). If you get placed on his hate list, you will be expelled.<br>
        1. Casting a spell on Nag will cause you to get expelled. The spell may 
        or may not land. Spells that cause waves of damage appear to work - subsequent 
        to the first wave.<br>
        2. Healing people fighting Nag will result in an expulsion. The heal will 
        generally take, lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to 
        cast more than one prior to expulsion.<br>
        3. Getting too close to Nag may result in an expulsion.&nbsp; The agro 
        radius is quite large.<br>
        4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Hero) to heal people. Since CoH 
        wipes a persons hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, 
        and return to the fight. Since the hate list was cleared with the CoH, 
        the healer is not placed on hate list.<br>
        5. Some raids have used 53+ characters to keep any adds from bothering 
        the raid group.<br>
