font-family:Verdana"><strong>JUN 05,
            2001<br>
            </strong>*Redid dragon schedule based on patch. Check dates above. Dragons are definitely
            FFA and unlike guilds, I'm at a disadvantage of having to advertise intentions. Definitely
            some competion now, so dates may fluctuate (or raids missed due to someone else killing).
            Most raids seem to be done by twinks of bigger guilds that want mobs dead:Naggy for
            Ragefire. I'll see if I can work out some Naggy raids, bigger guilds just want him dead,
            and they can use time to kill bigger stuff with their mains...<strong><br>
            <br>
            JUN 04, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Went over to Lavastorm to do battle with Eejag for monk epic pieces. First time,
            many of us had ever intentionally jumped into lava - don't try this in real life. Battle
            was interesting, but incredibly hard to see. Can definitely kill him with melee approach.<br>
            <strong><br>
            JUN 03, 2001<br>
            </strong>*In the morning, killed Venril and got stone [Tomwin] and other items. In the
            afternoon, raided City of Mist. Unannounced in-law visits ruined my Sun raiding times.
            Don't have details on raid results.<strong><br>
            <br>
            JUN 01, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Brewall led the Crimson Talon, allies, and other adventurers in a fourth raid
            against Vox, and won yet again (now 4-0). Her loot was liberated for the fourth time in a
            row, no paladin books. Grats to Immolar for kill shot. Loot was: WDS [Brewall], WDS
            [Cris], Runed Bolster Belt [Tico], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Lazuli], Staff of Forbidden
            Rites [Scoff], and Ice Comet [Aridican]. Loot rules were changed to reflect status change
            of WDS (all four bards from original raid have won), bards will have higher odds, but
            casters are now in on roll. High level bards may offer a cloak for trade if caster wins
            and if same or better than a WDSC, I will enforce the trade.<br>
            <strong><br>
            MAY 31, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Grr. Emergency patch on Thursday. Should have scheduled Vox raid 4 on Wed and
            then hoped for another patch, three kills in three days would have been really nice
            (although 2 in 4 isn't bad either). Will try to plan more around this in future.<strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 30, 2001<br>
            </strong>*New message board is up and is advertisement-free. Please use the new message
            board, I'll leave the link to the old one up for a few weeks. I'm also working on moving
            the CT site from Tripod to Grooveit's servers at Gleinig.com. Will be completely banner
            free then.<br>
            <br>
            *Raid on Kedge last night, but Phin had been killed earlier in the day. Tomwin managed to
            get a piece for epic off the Corrupted Seahorses. Get ready for some upcoming raids on CoM
            and to get more Seblis keys.<br>
            <br>
            *Also clarified some areas of Vox rules &amp; raid points that I got some feedback on. One
            change I made in how raid leader can use points on items that normally only use 1 number
            (that they can use). I tried to balance my motivation of hosting raids versus
            excluding/limiting new people that could potentially compete for the item. Think this
            strikes a good balance and still avoids the trump card of reserving items.<br>
            <strong><br>
            MAY 29, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Vox is killed yet again on Tuesday night. Amazed that the word has gotten out,
            and I was shocked at how many people showed up. Once again, pick-up groups of random
            people can prevail against the beast if they are well organized. Were it not for the pit
            mobs, the fight would have been much easier (why people don't listen to instructions is
            beyond me-stay there and die!). This would have been certain failure for a smaller raiding
            party, but neverless, we prevailed. Brewall raids are now 3-0 against the beast, and
            although no paladin books have dropped (0 on 3 kills), three bards have a WDS necessary
            for epic quest. See links above for full write-up and raid points.<strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 28, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Decided to take on the Kael Drakkal arena tonight, and killed many guards,
            spectators, and a number of named mobs. Drops were fairly sparce, but very nice:
            Gladiator's Chain Leggings (lore no-drop ac17 str2 cha4 wis6 hp20 mr10 0.0wt
            war/clr/pal/rng/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm all) [Savardar] and a Gladiator's Chain Sleeves (lore
            no-drop ac16 str9 dex5 hp20 cr2 dr2 fr2 mr3 pr2 7.0wt war/clr/pal/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm all)
            [Muscled]. Definitely need to return and spend more time in this spot.<br>
            <br>
            Added some screenshots and fixed a couple external links.<strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 26, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Big guild news today, the Halcyon Coherence guild has merged with Crimson Talon.
            &nbsp; This finalizes the alliance between the guilds and the numerous raids we have
            conducted together. All the people I know from HC have been great players, and I know I'm
            not the only one to say welcome. With current guild size, we can definitely go after some
            bigger raids. <strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 23, 2001<br>
            </strong>*We were assembling at the Hole and noticed that several other groups were
            planning on raiding the zone as well. We decided to form a small army and Altus lead us on
            a crawl through the dungeon. Other groups were excellent companions and payed close
            attention to Altus's instructions. We laid waste to all that we encountered (screenshots
            in scrapbook).&nbsp; Among the drops were: Imbued Granite Spaulders (ac20 resists10
            wt19.4) [Brewall], Ranger Epic Piece [Rutgereos-his last piece! congrats!], Shaman Epic
            Piece [Khallin], Enchanter Epic Piece [Greymask, Zhyr, Mysyn, and Saleel], and Loam
            Encrusted Lined Shoes (ac4 agi8 cha8 dex8 mana15 pr10 0.4wt) [Greymask].&nbsp; I'm certain
            we will returrn again soon to help the other shaman's who were with us that needed their
            epic items. <br>
            <strong><br>
            MAY 20, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Vox dies again at the hands of Crimson Talon, allies, and comrades- in-arms. A
            hearty group of adventurers braved the cold of Permafrost Keep and dispatched Lady Vox.<strong>
            </strong>Drops were: Dragon Bone Bracer [Ciladin], Dragon Bone Bracer [Riverwake], Pouch
            [Brewall], Horn [Ensis], and Eyepatch [Aprisle]. Perhaps next time, Vox will grace us with
            books &amp; scales (she is overdue on those books). Congrats to Chadmoe for kill shot.
            Special thanks to all buffers and Atlus for pulling. Full write-up of event, loot numbers,
            and raid points, can be found on links in section above.<strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 19, 2001</strong><br>
            *Vox was definitely scared of the dragon hunting party that assembled outside her lair
            last night. Already overdue for a spawn (last kill was Fri at 10:31pm EST), with 7 days +
            random 24 hours expired, she should have been up. By midnight CST, Brewall called the raid
            off.&nbsp; By 7am CST she had spawned in her lair and was waiting to be killed. &nbsp; All
            attendees were credited with 1 raid point and will try again on Sunday at 10pm EST. It
            appears that the spawn time is a random 7-10 days after death.<strong><br>
            <br>
            MAY 17, 2001</strong><br>
            *If anyone was looking to complete a quest in Kael Drakkal last night, they were out of
            luck. Crimson Talon decided to set up residence inside the quest givers area and proceeded
            to take out all the giants. Lots of unusual and different items dropped: Silver Dragon
            Tattoo (ac2 str4 wis4) [Skylynn], Helm, Greaves, Axe, Dragonhide Belt (ac6 sta10 wt0.0),
            and a Mask of Malediction (wis-4 int+5 mana+10 fr-5 cr-5 wt 0.2). <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 16, 2001</strong><br>
            *HS raid on north wing to restock some keys. A nice little raid in an empty dungeon. Only
            odd thing of the evening was a bug that caused Altus to get stuck in a wall. At least we
            now know that safe-spot for corpses is at zone in. Numerous spell drops were collected and
            added to guild vault.<br>
            *Also, be sure to welcome Malvado to the guild.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 15, 2001</strong><br>
            *Raid on the Hole. Definitely getting better at hunting in here, and we were able to make
            it further back than ever before. Several loam pieces dropped and were divided out.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 14, 2001</strong><br>
            *Grats to both Greymask and Immolar on their AC rings.<br>
            <strong><br>
            MAY 11, 2001</strong><br>
            * A glorious day for the Crimson Talon on two fronts. Lotera got help from the Divine
            Alliance and is now the proud owner of the rogue epic &quot;Ragebringer&quot;. I don't
            have any screenshots, but as soon as I get some in, I'll post on the site.<br>

            *While Lot was killing in Kithicor, Brewall led a successful raid against Lady Vox
            herself, and the first time she has been slain in several months.&nbsp; Although he did
            not win a coveted white dragon scale (a victim of his own idealistic open looting rules).
            A full write-up on the raid, attendees, and loot numbers can be found with this <a href="raidvox20010511.htm">link</a>. I only managed to take one screenshot of the event;
            with an electrical storm outside my house, a dead cable-modem, and a 42k connection, I was
            paranoid of lagging out. I'll post more shots if people send them in.<br>

            <strong>MAY 08, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Phinigel Autropos met an untimely death this evening at the hands of Crimson
            Talon and other alliance members. Expert pulling by the monks brought him to us solo,
            where he went down with a muted gurgle. Loots were Robe of the Kedge [Lotera], Blue
            Crystal Staff [Grooveit], Wand of Mana Tapping [Jarheuu], and a second Wand of Mana
            Tapping [Greymask]. The MT wands will come into great use against Vox.<br>
            <br>
            *Lotera is extremely close on finishing the Rogue epic, and needs just one more mob - the
            general in Kithicor. Details and a guide for the raid on Sat May 12 can be found on the
            message board.<br>
            <br>
            *Sphiffy is looking for some help in Permafrost for some items needed for the warrior
            epic. Let's all plan to hunt there on Thursday night (prior to Vox raid on Fri) and get
            Sphiffy his items. Could also camp the weight reduction BP while we are there and stock up
            on some CR bracers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 06, 2001<br>
            </strong>*Howling Stones proves again to be worth the effort of getting the keys. Among
            the drops were numerous spells (see Guild Stash in message board area) and a Sash of the
            Dragon Born (ac2 0.1wt 22% haste. fyi- FBSS is 17%) [Lotera won roll].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 03, 2001</strong> <br>
            *The guild welcomes Greymask (48 enchanter) to the guild.&nbsp; Greymask is Brewall's
            real-life brother.<br>
            <br>
            *New thread started on message board regarding the status of everyone's epic quest. Once
            enough people post, we will try to work out some raids and get some items.</span><p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

            </strong>*Dead frogs everywhere. The froglok hunter and forager died so many times, it was
            difficult to not step on one of their corpses.&nbsp; Other named spawns appeared as well,
            including Sigra who was nice enough to drop a Silken Cat-Fur Girdle (ac5 str9 dex13 wt1.5
            all/all) [Brewall won roll]. Everyone in guild should now have keys to Seblis.</span></p>

            </strong>Another successful Howling Stones raid last night, as the guild conquered the
            South wing from start to finish. Numerous spell drops, several pieces of kylong armour,
            and a veil [Madmat won roll] dropped. Tomorrow night (May 01), the guild will hunt the
            named spawns in Trakanon for key pieces and other items.<strong><br>
            <br>
            April 29, 2001<br>
            </strong>The guild raided Howling stones last night and obtained a haste sash from the
            Crypt Spectre. Altus is its new proud owner and has gratiously passed down his FBSS.
            &nbsp; We return again tonight to this excellent, and often empty, dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>April 27, 2001<br>
            </strong>The guild decided to raid Kedge with Halcyon Conherence.&nbsp; Phiny was away on
            business yet again, but was excellent practice for kedge-newbies. Excellent pulling by the
            monks spaced out the guardians perfectly, and had Phin been up, he would be swimming with
            the fishes.</span></p>

            </strong>The Talon decided to raid Kedge on Sunday and made its way to Phiny's Lair.
            Although the master of the seas was away, the guild claimed many of his henchmen as
            victims.&nbsp; At the end of the raid, we decided to take out the shark Cauldronboil and
            got a nice Sharkjaw Cutlass (Tomwin won roll).<strong>&nbsp; <br>

            </strong>Time to start making out your wishlists! One of the greatest advantages to
            belonging to a guild is working together to get equipment.&nbsp; Pooling our resources and
            hunts, we may be able to help out multiple people in the same raid.&nbsp; My suggestion is
            that everyone go to <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">everquest.allakhazam.com</a>,
            register your character, enter all your equipment, and then use the upgrader option to
            find better stuff.&nbsp; This is an incredible tool, just remember that some dungeons/mobs
            are too difficult for us right now (dragon necropolis). Put your list together and post in
            the message board.</span></p>
