      DEC 30, 2001</strong><br>
      Eager to punish Hate again today, we restarted our raid. Drops: Cleric Gauntlets 
      [Awll], 2 Cleric Bracers [Ceeni-guest, Aorthin], Cleric Shield [Rezzie], 
      Cleric Arms [Lumpey]. Rots: Shaman legs, Warrior gloves, bard arms, rogue 
      arms, rogue spear.&nbsp; Within a couple hours, we managed to clear the 
      first floor yet again, even with a minor crew and the decided to leave Hate 
      for a while.<br>
      <strong><br>
      DEC 29, 2001</strong><br>
      Another day in Hate and completely cleared the first floor of every single 
      mob. Cleared almost entire second floor, except for Inny himself. Best part 
      of raid was whacking the Evangalist upside the head to stop the spamming.&nbsp; 
      Loots were beyond incredible: 2 Warrior BP [Valstorm, Uggabugga], Bard BP 
      [Kilwean-guest], 2 Rogue BP [Muscled, Zoranna], Druid BP [Dunskye]. SK bracer 
      [Sylvanna]. Theologian Claymore [Ryaku]. Enormous number of rots as well: 
      Cleric Helm (3), Cleric Shield, Mage Boots, Shaman legs, Enchanter BP, and 
      a Warrior BP. This is on top of bd/d that were quickly turned into resist 
      gear and distributed.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 28, 2001</strong><br>
      Broke into Hate again tonight to clear out all the mini-bosses. Loot drops 
      were very nice: Bard: Imbrued Legs [Brewall], Necromancer: Innoruuk Eye 
      [Fenik], Essense of Vamprire [Mysyn], Warrior Legs [Lisner], and over 25 
      bd and almost 20 d.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 27, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on hate again. This night Dodja got hate stone for ranger epic! Chiun 
      also got uber monk haste item and passed down his RBB.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 23, 2001</strong><br>
      Impromptu raid on Hate.&nbsp; 15 of us decided to head up to Hate for a 
      couple days. Managed to get some nice drops: Cleric Legs [Johansmith], Cleric 
      Arms and Gloves, Warrior Bracer [Uggabugga], Cleric Shield [Aorthin], and 
      5 blue diamond/diamond.&nbsp; Will be returning on the 24th for more killing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 22, 2001</strong><br>
      Congrats to Dodja for making 60!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 21, 2001</strong><br>
      Numerous raids all over the planet and on the moon as well.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 16, 2001</strong><br>
      After two solid days of raiding, the only thing left standing in the plane 
      of Fear was Cazic Thule himself.&nbsp; Crimson Talon did two flawless break-ins 
      on both Saturday and Sunday losing only two people total on both attempts. 
      We proceeded to demolish the zone completely, killing off all of Cazic's 
      minons.&nbsp; Incredible number of drops, including a necro robe [Fenik] 
      and many many others.&nbsp; We also got critical item for Zionmaster's wizard 
      epic and were able to kill the Sshisar for Greymask to complete our first 
      enchanter epic!&nbsp; We are definitley working our way up the epics, and 
      cleric and bard epics are looming in the near future.&nbsp; With our precise 
      break-in tactics, we can now raid this hated plane any time with relative 
      ease.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 12, 2001</strong><br>
      Both the Prince and Overking of Chardok were killed this evening.&nbsp; 
      This raid was our second prince killing and our first king, and it was also 
      our first large scale raid that mixed standard pulling and AE tactics.&nbsp; 
      Grats to Mysyn for getting enchanter epic piece and to Skylynn for getting 
      to within a Ragefire of a cleric epic!&nbsp; We are very close to having 
      two more class epics within the guild. Other drops this evening were Argent 
      Defender [Lisner] and a Palladium Axe [Valstorm].<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 09, 2001</strong><br>
      Attack of the killer Groovs. Today was practical joke time on our resident 
      Sorcerer Groovit.&nbsp; About twelve of us made HE wizards with names similar 
      to Groovit's including: Groovite, Groovism, Groovitsold, Groovstyles, Groovikat, 
      Groovinacht, Gagrgov, Groovitsego, Groovdawg, Groovycajones, Groovieluv, 
      Groovtastic, and Groovthaag.&nbsp; We sent Groov a message over guildchat 
      that Al'Kabor was in Felwithe and needed the assistance of a powerful sorcerer.&nbsp; 
      Groov quickly loaded up port and rushed to GFay as quickly as he could to 
      try to get in on the event.&nbsp; As soon as he ported in though, the 'Groovs' 
      began to spam him with stupid questions and OOC'd/shouted Groovit's typical 
      hotkey setups.&nbsp; Took him a couple minutes to realize that he had been 
      had and even though the real Al'Kabor was not present, a fun time was had 
      by all.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 08, 2001<br>
      </strong>A number of guild raids have taken place over the last several 
      days in numerous zones on the moon. The Grey, Akheva, Mermaid's Eye, Fungus, 
      and The Deep.<br>
      <br>
      In the private area of the bulletin boards, Brewall has posted some high-quality 
      maps he has done of: Grimling, Tenebrous, Katta, Twilight, Scarlet, The 
      Grey, Dawnshroud, and Netherbian Lair.&nbsp; Each day, another map or two 
      is added. Check the thread for updates.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 05, 2001</strong><br>
      For those that have SoL working, it has been a time of exploration.&nbsp; 
      Numerous hunting and expedition trips have been made to Maiden's Eye and 
      as far as Twilight to the north. &nbsp; Last night, we slayed many a vampyre 
      in Tenebrous, and were the only ones in the zone for hours on end. Sanctus 
      Seru is a risky place to visit, if you are evil, some of the guards will 
      attack you. There are also guards that are part of the eye, that could attack 
      you at any time, also, don't drink in this town around the guards.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 02, 2001</strong><br>
      Started the morning off killing Faydedar for Dunskye's epic. Excellent fight 
      and agro management, and we were able to pull it off with no deaths for 
      the second time in a row! &nbsp; After the fight, we headed off to Seblis 
      to get some spells, and then followed that up with Chardok to help Chiun 
      camp the pipe. After many an hour, the mob never spawned, and everyone vowed 
      to return and kill the yellow-bellied mob.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>DEC 01, 2001</strong><br>
      Many in the guild got to witness a GM event where Al'Kabor appeared and 
      needed some assistance.&nbsp; Many within CT helped the famous wizard, and 
      our own Tippe was given the title of &quot;Tippe of the Nexus&quot;. Grats 
      Tippe!&nbsp; This evening, we camped Codfisher in TD waiting for him to 
      spawn so we could finish Dunskye's epic. Hawkien even put some dwarf bait 
      out, but no luck. Two hours past spawn time, we called it a night.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 30, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on royals in Chardok. This time, we were able to slay the prince [Greymask 
      now 1 item from enc epic].&nbsp; Still learning this zone, and this was 
      our furthest push ever into the royal area.&nbsp; Next time, we will kill 
      the king and queen and put ourselves within reach of cleric and warrior 
      epics!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 29, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on Kael to push into King's area for some armour drops. Decided to 
      kill Dlammaz Stormslayer (100k+ HP that quads 500s, flurries, rampages, 
      etc) and one of toughest mobs we have ever faced as a guild. We slayed him 
      with only a few deaths, and fought him again later that evening with zero 
      deaths. CT is getting stronger as a guild, which combined with our smart 
      playing is a lethal combination. Drops this evening were: Plate Bracer [Hawkien], 
      Leather Bracer [Tippe], and 2 Cloaks of the Malestorm [Zoranna, Chadmoe]. 
      In addition to Dlammaz, we were easily able to slay Sentinel Drag / Yeljorn 
      / Demek.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 28, 2001</strong><br>
      Joined KoT raid for Dragon Necropolis. Very late start this evening&nbsp;minimized 
      ability to get deep within the zone.&nbsp; Although, killing at zone-in 
      did allow us to pick up a Phase Spider Carapace [Barelil]. Numerous spell 
      drops as well; if you need spells when they drop, just call for them.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 27, 2001</strong><br>
      Crimson Talon dove deep into the heart of Siren's Grotto for our first major 
      guild raid on that zone. We were able to slay many a mermaid and walrus 
      within the main chamber at the bottom of the well, and held the camp for 
      several hours.&nbsp; We came away with several nice gems and some BP quest 
      gems. Now we just need to get some armour to drop in Kael! &nbsp; Other 
      drops were some netted kelp armour, conch horn [Brewall has McVaxious (much 
      better) and will hold in guild vault], and a walrus skin drum [Brewall has 
      Selo's (much better) and will hold in guild vault].<br>
      <strong><br>
      NOV 26, 2001<br>
      </strong>Hit Howling Stones a second night in a row hoping for more haste 
      belts. Set up multiple camps within the zone and even did some AE style 
      clearings. This is the first time we have combined both tactics on a raid 
      and it definitely has future use. Came away with a Bloodpoint dagger, a 
      set of nice int bracelets, and numerous other loots. We are going to hit 
      a number of different zones in the coming days prior to SoL release next 
      week.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 25, 2001</strong><br>
      Major raid on Howling Stones this evening.&nbsp; Set up three different 
      camp spots within the zone and killed everything in sight.&nbsp; Grats to 
      Valstorm for winning the Dragon Sash, a nice upgrade from his FBSS. Also 
      came away with some Kylong items that were randomed out. Randomed out some 
      other loot from prior raids: Tribal War Boots [Aorthin] and Spider Fur Collar 
      [Hawkien].<br>
      <br>
      Dunskye also got the last item she needed from the corrupted seahorses for 
      druid epic, and is now ready for Faydedar.&nbsp; Another epic is close at 
      hand!<br>
      <br>
      Grats to Chadmoe for getting a shiny new BP from Fear.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 24, 2001</strong><br>
      Chardok raid.&nbsp; Raid on the royal area, but repawns and roamers appeared 
      at last possible moment.&nbsp; Although we were unable to kill the royals 
      on this raid, we learned a lot and will make a second attempt soon.<br>
      <br>
      Be careful with triggered mobs on the server.&nbsp; DA/SS were waiting for 
      Trakanon to spawn and were a bit bored.&nbsp; They were exceedingly gracious 
      to offer to kill a spawned Trakanon for Brewall to finish his bard epic.&nbsp; 
      Brewall turned in the mystical lute head to the undead bard, who babbled 
      about it being nice to hold the power one last time, returned the lute head, 
      de-spawned, enraged form spawned and agroed on the group, and upon his death 
      -- Trakanon did not spawn! Everyone was completely baffled as to why the 
      script did not work.&nbsp; Trakanon should definitely have spawned at this 
      point, and everyone was ready for the kill.&nbsp; I have also heard that 
      other triggered mobs, such as the giant war (4x the number of giants spawned!) 
      have not been working properly either. &nbsp; Hats off to DA/SS for taking 
      the time to help, even though the spawn was bugged.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 22, 2001</strong><br>
      The forces of Crimson Talon came together to kill General V'Ghera and his 
      thugs in the Kithicor Woods this evening.&nbsp; Grats to Zoranna for completing 
      the rogue epic and obtaining a Ragebringer!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 19, 2001</strong><br>
      Helped Fenier (KoT) complete druid epic with another Faydedar slaying. Grats 
      to Fenier for obtaining an epic!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 16, 2001</strong><br>
      Grats to Greymask for finally getting an Essense of Vampire. Took an incredible 
      number of clearings to finally get one.&nbsp; Also killed the Maestro, who 
      dropped monk mask [Altus].&nbsp; Finally left Hate this evening, but will 
      return again soon to work on some other epics. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 15, 2001</strong><br>
      Hate again. Managed to kill Magi on second floor, but no magician epic piece.&nbsp; 
      Cleared all the Rev's for the fifth time and still no vampire essense, which 
      is beginning to tick-off the epic-hungry crowd. Still, we were able to get 
      a few gems and other items:<br>
      <strong>Shaman</strong>: <u>Rune Etched Greaves</u> [Barelil]<br>
      <strong>Warrior</strong>: <u>Hand of the Maestro</u> [Lisner] <br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 14, 2001<br>
      </strong>Vowing to get an epic piece for our enchanters or magicians, we've 
      decided to stay in the accursed plane of Hate before leaving.&nbsp; Gave 
      away a lot of items to other groups in the zone due to duplicates. Hit the 
      second floor again, and aside from junk FS weapons, the loot was very stingy. 
      Among our drops were:<br>
      <strong>Cleric</strong>: <u>Ethereal Mist Gloves</u> [Skylynn]<br>
      <strong>Enchanter</strong>: <u>Insidious Gloves</u> [Mysyn]<br>
      <strong>Mage</strong>: <u>Apothic Gloves</u> [Immolar]<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 13, 2001</strong><br>
      Another night in the Plane of Hate. Started the night with about 18 people 
      and eventually headed up to the second floor with just 14. We are definitely 
      a guild that is able to kill with finesse instead of zerg-type tactics. 
      Great smart-playing and teamwork by everyone! Cazic-Thule is also a great 
      server in that the various guilds up in Hate last night gave-away unneeded 
      loots instead of letting them rot. Helmets off to everyone. Drops last night:<br>
      <strong>Cleric</strong>: <u>Ethereal Mist Vambraces</u> [Skylynn, Aorthin]<br>
      <strong>Enchanter</strong>: <u>Insidious Greaves</u> [Greymask]<br>
      <strong>Mage</strong>: <u>Apothic Boots</u> [Immolar], <u>Apothic Bracer</u> 
      [Immolar], <u>Apothic Crown</u> [Immolar]<br>
      <strong>Rogue</strong>: <u>Woven Shadow Greaves</u> [Zoranna]<br>
      <strong>Warrior</strong>: <u>Culler</u> (2hs 31/37 war rng 4str 4sta 8.9wt) 
      [Maxist] <br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 10-11, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on the Plane of Hate. Throughout the weekend we cleared the zone several 
      times, including parts of the second floor. A list of non-rotting drops 
      is below:<br>
      <strong>Bard</strong>: <u>Imbrued Platemail Breastplate</u> [Random bard 
      in zone], <u>Imbrued Platemail Vambraces</u> [Jammen-TdS]<br>
      <strong>Cleric</strong>: <u>Ethereal Mist Greaves</u> [Skylynn], <u>Ethereal 
      Mist Vambraces</u> [Corrak-KoT], <u>Ethereal Mist Gloves</u> [Corrak-KoT], 
      <u>Ethereal Mist Bracer</u> [Rezzie]<br>
      <strong>Druid</strong>: <u>Sandals of Harmony</u> [Windarii]<br>
      <strong>Enchanter</strong>: <u>Insidious Halo</u> [Nefertari-KoT], <u>Insidious 
      Sleeves</u> [Greymask]<br>
      <strong>Mage</strong>: <u>Wand of Swords</u> [Immolar]<br>
      <strong>Monk</strong>: <u>Tempo of Likato</u> [Ikana-LD]<br>
      <strong>Paladin</strong>: <u>Trueheart Shield</u> [Hawkien]<br>
      <strong>Rogue</strong>: <u>Woven Shadow Helm</u> [Zoranna], <u>Woven Shadow 
      Vambraces</u> [Bergin-TdS], <u>Woven Shadow Boots</u> [Bergin-TdS], <u>Woven 
      Shadow Gauntlets</u> [Mizuno-KoT], <u>Woven Shadow Vambraces</u> [Mizuno-KoT]<br>
      <strong>Shaman</strong>: <u>Rune Etched Helm</u> [Jalelina-KoT], <u>Rune 
      Etched Vambraces</u> [Barelil]<br>
      <strong>Warrior</strong>: <u>Indicolite Boots</u> [Maxist], <u>Indicolite 
      Vambraces</u> [Dynter-KoT], <u>Indicolite Bracers</u> [Dynter-KoT], <u>Indicolite 
      Greaves</u> [Hayashi-KoT] <br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 08, 2001</strong><br>
      CT &amp; KoT descended upon the Kael arena and slayed many foul-smelling 
      giants. Had a few armour drops and they were randomed out to the attendees.&nbsp; 
      A very smooth raid that will happen again in the near future followed with 
      a return trip to kill dragons in WW.<br>
      <br>

      </strong>Our resident sorcerer, Groovit, completed the Wizard Epic quest 
      last night to receive his Staff of the Four! Since the patch yesterday lasted 
      longer than normal, Venril was still up when most of us logged on, and it 
      became a mad scramble to mobilize and kill him.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone 
      that came! VS dropped Groovit's final item and he finished the quest. Stats:

      This brings CT up to 15 epics in 5 months and our 11th epic in just the 
      last 2 months! Grats to everyone for working as a team to help each other

      Wakening land was decimated by the forces of the Crimson Talon in a biltzkreig 
      rampage to complete Hawkien's quest for the Nature's Defender. Killed corrupted 
      faun (level 55 hits for 250), corrupted panther (level 55 hits for 250), 
      corrupted unicorn (level 55 sk that hits for 400).&nbsp; With the previously 
      looted item from the corruptor in Hate, Hawkien turned in the items to receive 
      his Nature's Defender. Stats: 2hs 28/46, 45ac 10str 10dex 10wis 25hp 25mana

      First guild raid into the Western Wastes. Guild is pro-dwarf / pro-dragon 
      faction, but we decided to slay some oversized wurms in this tundra and 
      fix faction at a later time. &nbsp; A few friends and allies showed up and 
      we began our fights.&nbsp; Had a bad agro from a wanderer at the start, 
      but as our first time in the zone, we made a few adjustments and started 
      again. We warmed up with Glati, followed by Vraptin, and then finished off 
      with Guardian Kozzalym.&nbsp; We will definitely return and add to our list 
      of victims. Drops were: Great Dragon Head [Brewall holding], Vraptin Talisman 
      (5ac 4stats 4resists 20mana 20hp) [Immolar], Form of Bear [Barelil], Aegolism, 
      Gem from Guardian [Chadmoe].<br>

      Faydedar was completely owned by Crimson Talon this evening. Took a while 
      for everyone to make their way to Timorous Deep, but was good to see everyone 
      in the guild working together. After a complete buffing, we proceeded to 
      own Faydedar. Zero deaths and excellent job by everyone for smart playing 
      and controlling agro.&nbsp; Grats to Windarii for completing the druid epic!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 23, 2001</strong><br>
      Killed Renux today to put Klepta to within 1 item of rogue epic.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 20, 2001</strong><br>
      Fear raid. Raided fear for about six hours today. Managed to come away with 
      a few upgrades.<br>

      </strong>Physst becomes the 12th member of the Crimson Talon to get an epic. 
      The guild lay waste to the remaining mobs for Physst to finish the monk 
      epic quest for the Celestial Fists. Grats Physst!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 17, 2001</strong><br>
      First guild raid into the Dragon Necropolis. We had an excellent time crawling 
      through this empty dungeon in search of adventure and loot.&nbsp; We managed 
      to fight our way deep into the caverns slaying many beasts. Among the loot 
      drops were: 2 Phase Spider Carapace [Lisner, Aorthin], Light Velium Claidmore 
      [Valoria], an axe [Silvercaster], numerous junk weapons, and quest gems 
      &amp; spells. I'm sure we will return to this dungeon soon.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 16, 2001</strong><br>
      The Qeynos badge quest is perhaps the most interesting and complex quests 
      I've ever seen in the game.&nbsp; For the first badge, you control an NPC 
      pet, have him give you items, summon guards, and watch him interact with 
      other NPCs. The second (get confession document before you leave Qeynos) 
      is even better, you get to interrogate an NPC with a little fist-persuasion. 
      Third step blew me away: you turn in item to spawn a gameboard and you then 
      play othello using rats, diseased rats, and items you looted from an evil 
      necro (see screenshot). Absolutely the most different quest you will ever 
      do and I encourage people to try it out. Only problem with the quest is 
      if you mess up, you have to start all over.<br>
      <br>

      Grats to Altus for finishing the monk epic quest!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 13, 2001</strong><br>
      Big raid on Chardok. Camped bridge area for hours on end to get Altus his 
      monk pipe and a few other new drops.&nbsp; Lot of interesting new mobs up 
      on track. Just when we were about to give up, the pipe mob showed up.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 11, 2001<br>
      </strong>Raid on Faydedar. Hammered the dragonfish into submission in a 
      quick battle for Tippe's epic. An excellent battle and overall slaughter.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 10, 2001</strong> <br>
      Physst gets closer to monk epic with Chardok pipe. Trying for a hat-trick 
      in the coming days for our other monks.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 06, 2001</strong><br>
      Long camp in Karnors to kill Drolvarg Pawbuster for Altus's pipe. After 
      seeing every other rare spawn and drop, the dog finally made an appearance. 
      Among the drops in the long camp were cleric boots [Skylynn] and even a 
      Harmonic Dagger [Brewall].<br>

      <br>
      <strong>SEP 25, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on the Hole with KoT. Crawled down the dungeon getting some needed 
      epic pieces. Made it all the way to the bottom and decided to take on Nortlav 
      the Scalekeeper for the first time.&nbsp; Grats to Valstorm on the red dragon 
      scale and to Bar for the spaulders. An excellent raid overall and we learned 
      a lot.&nbsp; Definitely the way the game was meant to be played with a crawl 
      and killing a tough mob at the end.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>SEP 24, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Second raid in this zone was rewarded with a 
      few items. Definitely need a few levels or a bigger group to deal with ratmen. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>SEP 22, 2001</strong><br>
      Return to the arena in joint raid with KoT. Managed to stake out some pulls 
      even though 150+ people were in the zone. Not many giant lovers on our server.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>SEP 19, 2001</strong><br>
      Raid on Kael arena, managed to get a couple pieces of armour on our joint

      Congratulations to Dainin for finishing the monk epic quest! It is the first 
      monk epic in our guild and about 3 groups killed mob after mob throughout 
      the evening to finish it. Started with a quick trip to the Plane of Air 
      to kill Gwan on second island, trip to Nurga to slay Trunt, and finished 
      up in the lake of ill omen against Vorash, Deep, and Xeneverash. Celestial

      10 Days, 3 epics. Tonight, we raided City of Mist and finished Zulon's epic 
      for the shaman Spear of Fate. A few other members are close to finishing 
      their epics and more raids coming up in the coming weeks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SEP 14-16, 2001</b><br>
      Raid on the Plane of Hate. Late start on Friday due to login server snafu 
      that prevented many of us from logging in. Throughout the weekend we cleared

      Raided City of Mist this evening, and Barelil got final item needed for 
      shaman epic. Grats to Barelil! May try for Zulon's if we can take of some 
      unfinished wizard epic business first.<br>
      <br>

      Lady Vox dies for the sixteenth time to Brewall led raid (24-0 versus Nag 
      &amp; Vox). Late night. Were short on clerics and enchanters (1 &amp; 0 
      respectively) until raid members got friends to come. Lair pulling still 
      very difficult with Vox agro changes.&nbsp; The inevitable only pushed back 
      so long and Vox perished slightly after midnight. Drops were Frost Book 
      [Merril], McVaxious Horn of War [Tegerien], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Ammene], 
      and Warhammer of Divine Grace [Draconai].<br>
      <br>
      <b>SEP 08, 2001</b><br>
      Descended upon the Hole once again for another long crawl of the dungeon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SEP 07, 2001</b><br>
      Hole raid. Alone got last item for epic and now has Swiftwind! Quite a bit 
      of other loot dropped as well including Imbued Granite Spaulders. Returning 
      again Saturday night.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>SEP 06, 2001</strong><br>
      Site was down while it was moved to another ISP. Lost a couple days worth 
      of messages on the boards. Sorry for technical problems, but short notice 
      couldn't be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>SEP 05, 2001</strong><br>
      Howling Stones raid. Took out Drusella Sathir, the boss mob, once again. 
      Will have to take out her still-living husband Venril sometime soon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AUG 30, 2001</b><br>
      Vox dies for the 15th time last night to a Brewall led dragon raid. Everyone 
      was still in blood-lust mode from last night's server problems and were 
      eager to return. Lair still tricky to pull with agro changes. Buff stations 
      now at the bottom of the ramps, and did not have Vox attack us this time 
      (see Map in updated Vox raid guide). Buffs were very quick, and the entire 
      raid was done in well under 3 hours. Vox managed 1 CH, but died neverless. 
      Drops were: Book [Tico - 19 time attendee], Kayrul's Mystical Pouch [Roobee], 
      Crystalline Spear [Banamana], and 2 Ice Comets [Seviriyn, Zeretul]. Now 
      23-0 versus Nag and Vox.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AUG 29, 2001</b><br>
      Absolute Vox raiding mess last night. Were very close to clearing the lair 
      out, when the servers decided to come to a grinding halt. The raiding party 
      was down to just 12 people, and many decided to give up&nbsp; after trying 
      for 30+ minutes to get back on. Without critical mix of classes, Brewall 
      postponed raid until Thu night.<br>
      <br>
      Updated all the dragon raiding guides for Vox, Nagafen, and Faydedar.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AUG 27, 2001</b><br>
      Lord Nagafen falls yet again to another open attendance/open loot raid led 
      by Brewall. Now 22-0 versus Nag and Vox. Nagafen fell quickly and deaths 
      were minimal. Loots were: Torn Burnt Book [Ciladin], 2 Selo Drums of the 
      March [Cask, Corus], Red Dragon Scales [Venswayla/Rado], Bladestopper [Tico], 
      Blight, Hammer of Scourge [Krazus], Jacinth [Physst], and a Diamond [Guuma]. 
      Also got to clear out giants in the process, drops were: Crown of King Tranix 
      [Faedilsong], Mithril Greaves [Iversen], and Polished Mithril Mask [Tularane].<br>
      <br>
      <b>AUG 26, 2001</b><br>
      Venril Sathir's remains were up and we quickly mobilized to take him out. 
      Definitely getting better at these quick raids and it is great to see everyone 
      helping each other. Both Dunskye and Dodja now have items needed for druid 
      and ranger epics.<br>

      After over a month of planning, Crimson Talon did its first in-house (with 
      friend invites) raid on Fear. Spent Friday night breaking the plane and 
      giving ourselves some breathing room. As our first break, we did pretty 
      well, and learned a lot. Sat morning, we got back on and proceeded to clear 
      it out. On a whim, we decided to take on the enraged golem (150k of hit 
      points), and WON! Only suffered 4 deaths during the 16+ minute fight. Groovit 
      is now just 1 item away from the wizard epic (staff from VS)! Drops for 
      the weekend were: Thorny Vine Leggings [Udian &amp; Klaminar], Carmine Gloves 
      [Groovit], Carmine Leggings [Groovit], Carmine Robe [Groovit], Oil from 
      Enraged Golem [Groovit], Umbral Breastplate [Sylvanna], Vermiculated Arms 
      [Azenyth], Cryosilk Sleaves [Jaade], Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt [Barelil], 
      Rune Etched Boots [Barelil], Amy Whip [Lumper, Valstorm, Devaberiel], Rogue 
      Bracer [Zoranna], Eyerazza [Zoranna, Dreamthief], Shiverback Leggings [Chiun], 
      Girdle of the Diligent [Ghoem], Thorny Vine Gauntlets [Klaminar], Umbral 
      Leggings [Sylvanna], Vermiculated Leggings [Windarii], Umbral Gauntlets 
      [Sylvanna], Indicolite Gauntlets [Lumper], and Valorium Vambraces [Savardar].<br>

      <strong>AUG 22, 2001</strong><br>
      Three words: &quot;Permafrost was changed&quot;. The mobs, mob placement, 
      roamers, and timing are all a bit different in Permafrost. Not big changes, 
      just enough to make pulling more work than ever. Vox agro range is a lot 
      bigger than before as well. While we were finishing up buffing the buffers, 
      Vox suddenly appeared in the hallway and started killing people. Took a 
      while to get her moved back into the lair and get everything back on track. 
      For all the trouble, Vox had the last laugh dropping: 2 Kayrul's Mystical 
      Pouches [Kauf, Sventhal], 2 Crystilline Spears [Cask, Brewall], a Dragon 
      Bone Bracelet [Nieche], and Ice Comet [Silvercaster]. Just for clarification, 
      Nieche came with monk &amp; a 50 enc, wanted to play with monk, but I was 
      desperate for enc, I let him roll as monk - this was all set in stone prior 
      to groups being announced. I have never turned away a 48+ enchanter from 
      a Vox raid, seive is too important.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 21, 2001</strong><br>
      Udian finished the first sword of the ranger epic, Swiftwind (1hs 13/21 
      str15 sta10 dex10 mr5 fr5 cr5 pr5 dr5 hp50 2.0wt w/ Swift Spirit: 40% haste 
      &amp; atk40). Needs only a Shattered Emerald of Corruption from Hate mini 
      bosses/Inny to get the other sword, Earthcaller.<br>

      <strong>AUG 20, 2001</strong><br>
      Descended upon the Swamp of No Hope to kill Ulump for another part of Tippe's 
      epic. Was the first time we were able to take him out with no deaths at 
      all, a very clean fight. Tippe is now just a sea horse and a sea dragon 
      away!<br>

      <strong>AUG 19, 2001</strong><br>
      The forces of Crimson Talon gathered in the Burning Woods last night to 
      slay Ixiblat Fer. Spent a little time setting up buffs and then Tomwin pulled 
      the mob all the way to the Skyfire zone for the battle. A short fight later, 
      Ixiblat lay defeated. Grats to Skylynn for another part of her epic and 
      Wyntyr for winning the Circlet of Fire (Head 20mana 15fr w/ 5 charges supernova).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 18, 2001</strong><br>
      Late night activities in the Eastern Wastes as Hawkien finished his fifth 
      Coldain ring quest. A small group was on-hand to kill Scarbrow and the other 
      orcs.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 16, 2001</strong><br>
      The six day killing-spree on dragons has ended with 2 dead Nagafen's and 
      2 dead Vox's. &nbsp; Brewall was hosting his 20th open-attendance/open-loots/no 
      reserved items raid last night against Vox.&nbsp; With just one lone enchanter 
      on the raid (other than 53+ buff enchanters), the fight was going to be 
      a long one. The battle was of epic length and Vox managed to get off two 
      complete heals, but it was for naught. Great job by all attending keeping 
      her off the walls and continuing to relentlessly beat her into submission. 
      Drops were: White Dragon Scale [Woodsing],&nbsp; Dragon Bone Bracelet [Ferdinand], 
      2 Crystalline Spear [Klaminar, Corus], Kayrull's Mystical Pouch [Olwe], 
      and Warhammer of Divine Grace [Aenlador]. Aenlador left prior to the roll 
      and Brewall still has item, you have 1 week to come claim it. Brewall raids 
      now 20-0 versus Nag/Vox.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 15, 2001</strong><br>
      Patch day, and another dragon falls. This time Nagafen, the dragon cursed 
      by clerics everywhere. Plenty of people on hand, and at least 15 were turned 
      away. Buffs went quickly and the battle in Solusek began. Nagafen fell quickly 
      and was only able to claim a few victims. Loot was plentiful, but paltry 
      (no CoF or Books): Heirophant's Crook [Windarii], 2 Gauntlets of Firey Might 
      [Zypheaal, Namffoh], Prayers of Life [Sarduakar], Bladestopper [Ciladin], 
      Treasure Hunters Satchel [Kathandros], Ruby Crown [Infernostar], and a Diamond 
      [Hawkien]. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 14, 2001</strong><br>
      Patch day moved from Tue to Wed, and the network outage today did not reset 
      any dragons, so raids are pushed back one day.<br>
      Greymask spotted Tangrin (aka King Kong) over in Field of Bone and we quickly 
      mobilized to take down the big ape. Greymask is now within four items of 
      the enchanter epic!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 12, 2001</strong><br>
      Lady Vox kills now at a dozen. Must be some anti-raid leader code in the 
      AI that moves the person shouting most to the top of the hate list, because 
      at 30 percent, she decided to agro on Brewall (if anyone wonders why bards 
      don't have Taunt skill - we don't need it!). Had to turn a number of people 
      away, and interest in dragon killing is still high. I think this has to 
      do with open nature of attendance and open loot rules. Last night, I counted 
      people from over 20 guilds on the raid.<br>
      <br>
      Vox managed 1 CH, but she went down quickly after that. Drops were: Torbin's 
      Mystical Eyepatch [Cilden], Crystalline Spear [Tegerien], Dragonbone Bracelet 
      [Kuryl], and 2 Ice Comet [Jacestar, Olwe]. Now 12-0 versus Vox, 6-0 versus 
      Naggy, and 1-0 versus Faydedar. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>AUG 11, 2001</strong><br>
      Lord Nagafen falls again. One of the longer raids to date due to shortage 
      of casters at the start. Turned away quite a few people, but took more than 
      usual since there were only 2 clerics.&nbsp; Drops were: Cloak of Flames 
      [Brewall], 2 Prayers of Life [Physst, Alquilas], Orb of Tishan [Jammen], 
      Crown [Ardath], and Diamond [Ciladin]. Brewall led raids now 17-0 versus

        Raided Seblis this evening based on information that the undead bard was 
        up. Unfortunately, sometime between 4pm CST and 8pm CST, the undead bard 
        despawned and the real Trakanon showed up. Shahmat came to help with the 
        bard/epic spawned Trak, but it was all for naught with the real Trak up. 
        Nothing like having a Trak raiding crew ready and the wrong Trak is up! 
        Brewall will try for his epic another time when the Undead Bard is up. 
        Appologies to Shahmat who were gracious enough to take their time to come 
        to Seblis. &nbsp; Wound up laying waste to D1/Pickler/D2 wing. Drops were 
        Tolan Bracer [Klaminar] and Seblis Scale Coat [Devaberiel].<br>

        Multi-day raid on Chardok.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>AUG 03, 2001</strong><br>
        Lady Vox was catching up on some late-night reading when the dragon slaying 
        team swarmed into her lair last night. She finally graced us with a few 
        books to make up for the absolute lack of drops recently. No enchanters 
        were present at the raid to seive, so made due with bards singing mana 
        drain.&nbsp; The plan worked perfectly, and Vox went down with not so 
        much as a whisper.&nbsp; Loots were: 3 Frost books [Ixnus, Tularane, Rizzhogg] 
        and Ice Comet [Infernostar]. 41 book points gone in one kill and thins 
        out the numbers considerably for the other long-time paladin attendees.<br>
        <br>
        I appoligize to anyone that was turned away. It is difficult to get everyone 
        into each raid with so much demand for dragon killing out there.<br>
        <br>
        Brewall led dragon raids now 17-0 (11-0 on Vox, 5-0 on Nagafen, and 1-0 
        on Faydedar).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>AUG 02, 2001</strong><br>
        Lord Nagafen falls for a fifth time to a Brewall led dragon raid. Interest 
        in dragon raids remains high and at least 15 people were turned away. 
        All those that did not make raid are given an attendance point to make 
        it easier to get into future raids.<br>
        <br>
        EL cleared out the giants prior to the raid, dramatically shortening the 
        total raid time. &nbsp; Lot of new buffers this evening and took a little 
        bit to get all the kinks out. Excellent job pushing Nag to back of lair 
        and grats to Tularane for the kill shot. &nbsp; Loots were: Cloak of Flames 
        [Lumper], Gauntlets of Firey Might [Chiun], Treasure Hunters Satchel [Kirby], 
        Orb of Tishan [Niewlut], Orb of Tishan [Brewall], Prayers of Life [Lisner], 
        Fire Emerald Ring [Alianora], and a Diamond [Azumar].<br>
        <br>
        Brewall has also posted his Guide to Fear in the &quot;Raid Information&quot; 
        section of the site. Please read it over and give feedback prior to our 
        upcoming raid.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 31, 2001</strong><br>
        Two words, absolutely bizarre. Raided CoM this evening to get a few epic 
        items. We believed someone ninja looted a jade reaver during our fight 
        with the golems (petitioned a GM to investigate).&nbsp; Then, during the 
        assault on Lord Rak'Ashiir with 4-5 fire pets and at 50% health, the pets 
        pushed him into the water somehow. Rak'Ashiir vanishes along with a couple 
        of the pets and continued to fight somewhere out of sight within the zone. 
        Pets eventually die and Rak'Ashiir summons a couple people and just when 
        are beginning to evac, he pops right in the middle of the raiding pary 
        and kills a bunch of us with his 2000AE dmg spell (petition again regarding 
        the pathing and lost epic piece). Perform corpse recovery, but a couple 
        summoned bodies are hopelessly stuck in walls (petition yet again). GM 
        comes by after a while, gets corpses, ignores questions on ninja looter 
        and Rak'Ashiir pathing. Instead, he decides he has nothing better to do 
        than to change the name of a 57 wizard in our guild from &quot;Gooveit 
        Allnight&quot; to &quot;Groovie&quot;!?! He would not respond as to what 
        naming rule was violated. Grooveit has 7 days to get his name fixed, and 
        hopefully, he can get his original name back. Absolutely bizarre, no resolution 
        on ninja looter or the pathing problem and loss of epic piece. We have 
        very rarely ever petitioned anything and this was a truely horrible experience.<br>
        <br>

        Our rampage on the aristocracy of Kunark continues. Tonight's victim was 
        Korocust, the prince of Chardok. Was our first large-scale guild raid 
        on the dungeon and went off very well. Will definitely have to return 
        and do another crawl of this often-empty dungeon.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 28-29, 2001</strong><br>
        Exp hunting time. Groups in Velk, Karnors, and few other spots. Numerous 
        dings around the guild including Tomwin (56) and Greymask (54).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 27, 2001</strong><br>
        Killed Venril Sathir's remains early in the evening [Laurax]. Decided 
        to move on to his undead wife and teach her a lesson in manners. Demolished 
        her private guards one-by-one leaving Venril's wife to ponder her fate 
        for a moment, until we dispatched her as well. Dropped Rod of Obulations 
        (1hb 6/27 mana60 fr10 cr10) [Skylynn].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 26, 2001</strong><br>
        Raid on Howling Stones numerous spell drops and another haste belt. Tomwin 
        claims to have overheard ds trash talking CT, going to have to show her 
        a lesson.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 25, 2001</strong><br>
        Lady Vox met an untimely demise this evening to a determined group of 
        dragon killers. Interest from melee/hybrids is higher than ever, but the 
        lack of frost book drops (just 1 in 10 raids), has clogged a lot of spots. 
        There are currently 16 50+ paladins on the raids with 5+ prior raids. 
        12 of them are 52 and have been stuck at that level hoping for their epic 
        book. On most raids, this basically fills 3 full tank groups (out of 5). 
        I appologize to those that did not make the raid, but all were given an 
        attendance point for coming.<br>
        <br>
        Vox was indeed in the hallway again, but the first two tank groups did 
        an excellent job dislodging her. She did manage to get off 1 CH, but it 
        did her little good.&nbsp; Was the first raid with 3 wizards, and the 
        quick damage at the end was very impressive. Also thanks go out to those 
        that stuck around to help recovery corpses from the pits. My advice: never 
        fall in the one near buffing ramps, it leads into a room with 6 mobs. 
        Read my Vox raiding guide, I clearly show all the pits...<br>
        <br>
        Drops were: McVaxious Horn of War [Ferdinand], Dragon Bone Bracelet [Sintosa], 
        Ice Comet [Grimstaff], Kayrul's Mystical Pouch [Irrenne], and 2 Staff 
        of Forbidden Rites [Sardaukar, Saltz].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 24, 2001</strong><br>
        Lord Nagafen's blood cools the lava streaming within his lair again tonight. 
        He perished at the hands of an eager dragon hunting group. Unfortunately, 
        many people had to be turned away again from the raid. I was able to work 
        in all 4+ attendees and all 50+ pal/war/brd with epic items at stake.&nbsp; 
        Raid was off to slow start with SL clearing the FG. Originally I was told 
        that they were <u>just</u> after FG's, and since they had beaten us to 
        them, I honored their attack. At the end, however, I was told they were 
        really after Ragefire. Cost both us and them time waiting for respective 
        mobs in the end. Instead of Nag being dead around the usual 9:30 cst, 
        it wasn't until 11:30 cst that he was killed. If this happens again on 
        a patch day, may either just push through or simply switch to Vox that 
        night and hit Nag the next day without having to wait - this won't be 
        popular for clerics wanting RF to spawn though. If this sounds like a 
        flame, it is not intended to be one, I just have to have raids that move 
        in and kill dragons as quickly as possible. Keeping a raid of 40+ attendees 
        from 20+ guilds under control is no easy task, the longer it goes on, 
        the more difficult it becomes. I lost almost 1 full group during the wait 
        and was crushed with tells for an extra 2 hours because of this delay, 
        making this one of my more physically exhausting raids ever. The inane 
        comments from some of the people in SolB didn't help either, and insulting 
        tells didn't endear me to some individuals who are now on my ignore list 
        - hope you never want in on one of my future raids...<br>
        <br>
        Loots were: Orb of Tishan 2 [ Greymask, Kathandros], Blight Hammer [Sabore], 
        Prayers of Life [Morgx], and 2 gems [Aalthur, Ardath].<br>
        <br>
        I suggest that Greymask go out and buy a lotto ticket today, use numbers 
        1, 3, and 13. On 1st item roll, Greymask won Orb with roll of 3. Then, 
        when rolling for gems, 13 came up - Greymask - can't win again. Roll over: 
        3 -Ardath wins. Roll again for next gem - 13 - Greymask again! Yet another 
        rollover:&nbsp; 1 - Aalthur wins. The numbers 1 and 3 were strangely common 
        - Believe it or not!<br>
        <br>
        Brewall dragon raids now 9-0 vs Vox, 4-0 vs Nag, and 1-0 vs Fay.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 23, 2001</strong> (report from Khallin / Brewall)<br>
        Great night all around. The evening started out with Greymask getting 
        another enchanter epic item off shaman mob, and then moved on to Howling 
        Stones, where the drops were incredible. Cleared several wings again tonight 
        and among the drops were: 2! Sash of the Dragonborn (ac2 ~26% haste / 
        FBSS is ~21%) [Madmat &amp; Dodja], Golden Bracer (ac5 str7 int7) [Mysyn], 
        Blood Point (prc 10/20 str5 cha-5 pr10 dr10) [Sventhal], Kylong War Helm 
        (ac12 hp20 mana20 mr7 pr4) [Cerritus], Enshrouded Veil (ac7 wis2 int2 
        hp30 mana30 fr10) [Riverwake] and numerous spell drops. Tenara also gave 
        the Mask of Obtenebration to Brewall from the prior night's HS raid (a 
        'fun' illusion item, but stats actually inferior to DE illusion mask most 
        brd/rog get in their 20s). Tried out in WFP and was inspected no less 
        than 6x in 5 minutes. Never seen an erudite bard :)<br>
        <br>
        Moved up Vox raid to Wed night. Might as well maximize kills and hope 
        that VI has to patch again. Also frees up Fri-Sun for non-dragon raiding.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 22, 2001</strong><br>
        Lady Vox perishes in the frosty wastelands of Permafrost this evening. 
        Unbelievable number of people present wanting to kill her, but only so 
        many spots. Tried to accomodate 1 extra group over the 42 I normally do, 
        but that wound up being a huge problem. At least 8 people went LD during 
        the assault (including myself). Everyone has now seen what happens with 
        too many people, so please be understanding if you don't make raid. I 
        prioritize based on minimum classes needed: shm(2), brd(5-6), clr(4-5), 
        enc(4), dru(2); and then raid+attendance points. Anyone not making list 
        gets an attendance point which helps get into future raids.<br>
        <br>
        To date, <strong>250+ different people have attended my 12 dragon raids!</strong> 
        These raids are truely the most open on the server (or any other server 
        for that matter). With 20+ different guilds on any given raid, I am looking 
        at the people, not the 'tags'. If you are mad you didn't get on list, 
        just think of time wasted trying to get a group for sometimes hours on 
        end. I try to determine final list of raid people within 1 hour of start.<br>
        <br>
        For 45's - 50's melees, your odds of getting on raid is rather low right 
        now. There is a backlog of people with 5+ raids still hoping to get items 
        (some people have 10+ raids). As they win, they tend to float off (loot 
        is still and always will be random). My advice: Show up to 1 raid, get 
        an attendance point, and watch raid from zone-line to familiarize yourself 
        with process. Then use time to get some good resistance gear and get a 
        couple levels. If you come to a later raid saying you are 49 with unbuffed 
        cold/fire resistance at 130+, witnessed a couple raids in past, and have 
        at least 1 attendance point, you are in pretty good shape. This is better 
        than just coming to each raid getting attendance points.<br>
        <br>
        Drops were: RBB [Ciladin], Eyepatch [Milennia], Hammer [Irrenne], and 
        DBB [Cowabunga won, but donated to Punchen]. Grats to all.<br>
        <br>
        Going to send a note to VI asking if 1 book in 9 kills is an acceptable 
        drop rate for an epic item.<br>
        <br>
        Trojar, don't come to any future dragon raids I host or any other CT raid 
        for that matter. This was your first dragon raid and when you didn't make 
        the list, spamming me &amp; the zone with cursing was unacceptable. I 
        included anyone on this raid with 1+ prior attendance, an extremely open 
        raid.<br>
        <br>
        Now 13-0 against dragons. Vox 9-0, Nag 3-0, Faydedar 1-0.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 21, 2001</strong><br>
        Raid on Howling Stones. Did a complete crawl of North and West wings of 
        the dungeon. Among the drops were: Dragon Sash [Tenara, did random of 
        FBSS and Sventhal won], numerous spell drops, and a few other items. Working 
        toward killing the boss mob in East wing who was overheard trash-talking 
        us...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JUL 19, 2001</strong><br>
        Lord Nagafen falls again to a determined group of adventurers seeking 
        to slay the foul fire wyrm. Attendance and interest was very high and 
        many people were turned away. Excellent job by all listening to instructions 
        on the fire giants and during the dragon battle. Drops were: Red Dragon 
        Scale (2) [Brewall, Ralio], Selo's Drum (2) [Ferdinand, Tresten], Bladestopper 
        [Tularane], Saphire Necklace [Barelil]. Giant drops were: &nbsp; Polished 
        Mithril Torque [Tico], Mithril Greaves [Tularane], and Rokyl Channeling 
        Crystal [Tadyan]. Paladins need to clease their karma and do good deeds, 
        book drops have been exceptionally light. <br>
        <br>
        With the red dragon scale, Brewall is now just a spawned Trakanon guts 
        away from his bard epic! And to answer everyone's question, yes, Brewall 
        plans to lead more dragon raids on both Vox and Nagafen.<br>

        Decided to raid Kael Drakkal last night, and since there was already a 
        group at the arena, we decided to hit the SW corner of the zone. Drops 
        were: Giant Scalemail Arms [Syncere], Corroded Plate Gloves [Hawkien], 
        Bow of the Huntsman (2) [Udian, Kaiser]. &nbsp; An Axe of Frost also dropped 
        and was sent to the merchant dumpster. <br>

        Faydedar fell tonight to a well prepared group of adventurers determined 
        to slay the dragonfish.&nbsp; Brewall worked out the groups, final strategy, 
        and the attack based on some excellent first-hand Fay killing information 
        from Aamaeb of the Talons. &nbsp; Faydedar never moved within a foot of 
        the main tank group and went down with little difficulty, and just a couple 
        deaths. Thanks to all that attended the fish fry, and Tomwin is now the 
        proud holder of the druid epic!<br>

        The dragon wurm, Lady Vox, perishes again in the frozen tundra of Permafrost. 
        Brewall led his eigth successful raid against her (10-0 now versus Vox 
        &amp; Nag). Once again, all items were open rolls with no reserved items. 
        Had near catastrophe at start when Vox wedged herself near the opening 
        rock. Took almost a minute to free her from the spot and get her into 
        the lair.&nbsp; With just one enchanter, she was able to get off no less 
        than 2 complete heals, but died neverless. Drops were: Crystalline Spear 
        [Borq], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Cellwin], Dragon Bone Bracer [Cowabunga 
        -&gt; donated to Jevrulle], and McVaxious Horn of War [Brewall (on the 
        \random 1 5, I rolled a 1. Note that I had same odds as all other bards 
        on raid)].<b> </b>Grats to Sabore for the kill shot.<br>

        <b>JUL 12, 2001</b> (report from Tomwin)<br>
        HATE! Our first guild raid of Hate went off very well. We broke into Hate 
        to find The Taken already there, and they were kind enough to let us stage 
        at SS before we moved to the NE corner. Successfully cleared the entire 
        NE side of zone without a major catastrophe. Will definitely have to return 
        again sometime soon. Drops were: Rogue legs [Klepta], Mage legs [Immolar], 
        Cleric shield [Syncere], Paladin epic item [Savardar], Enchanter gloves 
        [Saleel], Paladin epic item [Kenaf] (Taken did not need), Shadowknight

        Cursed by clerics everywhere, Nagafen met an untimely death this evening 
        at the hands of another Brewall led open raid. Hopefully, some lucky cleric 
        will have another rez stick in the coming days. An incredible number of 
        people showed up, and regretfully, some had to be turned away. The foul 
        beast died quickly at the hands of the well-prepared group. His drops 
        were: Cloak of Flames [Altus], Red Dragon Scale [Karamur], Heirophant's 
        Crook [Aprisle], Gold Plated Koshigatana [Rado], Gauntlet's of Firey Might 
        [Physst], Diamond [Niewlut], and 2 junk items (jacinth and a word). Giant 
        drops were: Polished Mithril Torque [Ciladin/Cilden] and Polished Mithril 
        Mask [Cerritus]. I know everyone was confused with Ciladin/Cilden, but 
        he always rolls as a paladin, his enc alt helps with buffs (or with Vox, 
        seiving), I keep all this straight in my spreadsheet.<br>

        Raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Made it to top level of the tower 
        and stayed there for a while reveling in the long trip to the top. Quite 
        a few spell drops along the way: Tumultous Strength, Turning of the Unnatural,

        Moved Vox raid from WED Jul 11 to THU Jul 05 to take advantage of fresh 
        Vox from the patch. Would have moved it even earlier, but had made RL 
        plans. Waiting on BG Naggy raid date before I schedule him, should be 
        around the 11th or 12th.<br>

        Killed numerous mobs in Skyfire Mountains last night looking for some 
        spell drops. Much easier to get here with the changes to the port spells.

        Lord Nagafen meets the same fate as Vox just three days after her death. 
        It was Brewall's first time leading a raid on Nagafen and the very first 
        pick-up raid. Getting enough people was very difficult, but managed to 
        get enough to defeat him. Loots were: Cloak of Flames [Pysst], Heirophant's 
        Crook [Jacklenut], Blight Hammer of Scourge [Zulon], Selo's Drums of the 
        March [Brewall], and a Star Ruby Earring (no stats) [Jacestar]. Giant 
        loot was randomed off as well: Polished Mithril Mask [Baldimar].<br>

        Vox perishes for a sixth time at the hands of another Brewall led raid. 
        She went down quickly and everyone did excellent job of surrounding her 
        and keeping her in middle of room. Sorry to all of you that were turned 
        away from the raid (at least 12 people). Loots were: Frost Book [Kanine], 
        Rune Bolster Belt [Dainin], Karyrul's Mystical Pouch [Nandarr], and Staff 
        of Forbidden Rites [Immmolar].<br>
        <br>

        The master of the deep, Phinigel Autropos, was resident in his lair last 
        night and Crimson Talon decided to pay him a visit. Drops were: Staff 
        of Elemental Mastery [Immolar], Kedge Backbone [Brewall], Wand of Mana

        Lady Vox slain again this evening by a hearty band of adventurers led 
        by Brewall of Crimson Talon, who is now 5-0 versus the beast.&nbsp; Loots 
        were perhaps the worst to date: Runed Bolster Belt [Chiun], Staff of Forbidden 
        Rites [Altus], Ice Comet [Eiyre], Ice Comet [Guldaenya], and a rune (junk). 
        Ice Comets were open rolls, as no wizards were present on the raid. Perhaps 
        the most annoying factor that night were number of people that did not 
        have peridots or any platinum to pay for peridots.&nbsp; In the future, 
        if you do not have peridot/platinum, you will not receive these buffs.<br>

        Many members of the Crimson Talon attended a Lord Nagafen raid hosted 
        by Ixnus of Jedi Praxium. Loots were: Red Dragon Scale [Cris], Red Dragon 
        Scale [Krukak], Cloak of Flames [Grenack], and a Heirophant's Crook. Amazingly 
        enough, Ragefire spawned within an hour of Naggy's death. Biggest problem 
        was that many in the raiding party still recovering from rez effects and 
        were killed by trains brought by people rushing to kill Ragefire. I realize 
        it can be a race to kill him, but would be nice for guilds to shout that 
        they will get rezes resulting from the trains and who to send names to.&nbsp; 
        Liked some of the buff techniques and will be making some tweaks to my 
        process. Next Vox will have 2 buff stations, one at first landing other 
        at second landing, also will do shaman buffs after junks.<br>

        Once again, Crimson Talon raids the Hole. Another excellent dungeon crawl 
        through an empty dungeon. Drops were: Imbued Granite Spaulders [Zypheal] 
        and Withered Leather Bracer [Skylynn]. Zypheal then lottoed up the shoulders 
        that were replaced Obulus Death Shroud [Tippe]. Killed the ranger epic

        Agreement with Bloods Guard to rotate on Vox spawns. They took Vox Thu 
        Jun 7, and Brewall's open raid will hit her on Sat Jun 16. From there, 
        it will alternate between the BG closed raids &amp; CT open raids. In 
        the event of a patch, the guild with next spawn has 2 days to kill her, 
        otherwise, that spawn is FFA and the rotation resumes as normal upon her 
        death. Both raid leaders will share information regarding time of death 
        &amp; warn of any respawn. Goal for both raids is to maximize kills. BG 
        will also not be killing Naggy Wed/Thu next week leaving it open. Ixnus 
        of Jedi Praxum is leading this raid (signup on Everquestraids) and Brewall 
        will assist Ixnus in any way possible (but is not leading raid nor is 
        raid using Brewall's raid points). An organized dragon schedule is a lot 
        more preferable than a FFA system that can lead to a lot of fighting and 
        one-upmanship by guilds &amp; players. CT is made up of ex-big guild players 
        seeking to avoid this type of play style, hence our NGB, open loots, and 
        public disclosure.<br>
        <br>
        Night not a complete loss, since raid cancelled early in evening and a 
        few different epic mobs were slain for enchanter (Grats to Greymask for

        Redid dragon schedule based on patch. Check dates above. Dragons are definitely 
        FFA and unlike guilds, I'm at a disadvantage of having to advertise intentions. 
        Definitely some competion now, so dates may fluctuate (or raids missed 
        due to someone else killing). Most raids seem to be done by twinks of 
        bigger guilds that want mobs dead:Naggy for Ragefire. I'll see if I can 
        work out some Naggy raids, bigger guilds just want him dead, and they 
        can use time to kill bigger stuff with their mains...<br>

        Went over to Lavastorm to do battle with Eejag for monk epic pieces. First 
        time, many of us had ever intentionally jumped into lava - don't try this 
        in real life. Battle was interesting, but incredibly hard to see. Can 
        definitely kill him with melee approach.<br>

        Brewall led the Crimson Talon, allies, and other adventurers in a fourth 
        raid against Vox, and won yet again (now 4-0). Her loot was liberated 
        for the fourth time in a row, no paladin books. Grats to Immolar for kill 
        shot. Loot was: WDS [Brewall], WDS [Cris], Runed Bolster Belt [Tico], 
        Staff of Forbidden Rites [Lazuli], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Scoff], and 
        Ice Comet [Aridican]. Loot rules were changed to reflect status change 
        of WDS (all four bards from original raid have won), bards will have higher 
        odds, but casters are now in on roll. High level bards may offer a cloak 
        for trade if caster wins and if same or better than a WDSC, I will enforce 
        the trade.<br>

        Grr. Emergency patch on Thursday. Should have scheduled Vox raid 4 on

        Raid on Kedge last night, but Phin had been killed earlier in the day. 
        Tomwin managed to get a piece for epic off the Corrupted Seahorses. Get 
        ready for some upcoming raids on CoM and to get more Seblis keys.<br>
        <br>
        Also clarified some areas of Vox rules &amp; raid points that I got some 
        feedback on. One change I made in how raid leader can use points on items 
        that normally only use 1 number (that they can use). I tried to balance 
        my motivation of hosting raids versus excluding/limiting new people that 
        could potentially compete for the item. Think this strikes a good balance 
        and still avoids the trump card of reserving items.<br>

        Vox is killed yet again on Tuesday night. Amazed that the word has gotten 
        out, and I was shocked at how many people showed up. Once again, pick-up 
        groups of random people can prevail against the beast if they are well 
        organized. Were it not for the pit mobs, the fight would have been much 
        easier (why people don't listen to instructions is beyond me-stay there 
        and die!). This would have been certain failure for a smaller raiding 
        party, but neverless, we prevailed. Brewall raids are now 3-0 against 
        the beast, and although no paladin books have dropped (0 on 3 kills), 
        three bards have a WDS necessary for epic quest. See links above for full 
        write-up and raid points.<br>

        Big guild news today, the Halcyon Coherence guild has merged with Crimson 
        Talon. &nbsp; This finalizes the alliance between the guilds and the numerous 
        raids we have conducted together. All the people I know from HC have been 
        great players, and I know I'm not the only one to say welcome. With current

        We were assembling at the Hole and noticed that several other groups were 
        planning on raiding the zone as well. We decided to form a small army 
        and Altus lead us on a crawl through the dungeon. Other groups were excellent 
        companions and payed close attention to Altus's instructions. We laid 
        waste to all that we encountered (screenshots in scrapbook).&nbsp; Among 
        the drops were: Imbued Granite Spaulders (ac20 resists10 wt19.4) [Brewall], 
        Ranger Epic Piece [Rutgereos-his last piece! congrats!], Shaman Epic Piece

        Lady Vox. Drops were: Dragon Bone Bracer [Ciladin], Dragon Bone Bracer 
        [Riverwake], Pouch [Brewall], Horn [Ensis], and Eyepatch [Aprisle]. Perhaps 
        next time, Vox will grace us with books &amp; scales (she is overdue on

        Vox was definitely scared of the dragon hunting party that assembled outside 
        her lair last night. Already overdue for a spawn (last kill was Fri at 
        10:31pm EST), with 7 days + random 24 hours expired, she should have been 
        up. By midnight CST, Brewall called the raid off.&nbsp; By 7am CST she 
        had spawned in her lair and was waiting to be killed. &nbsp; All attendees 
        were credited with 1 raid point and will try again on Sunday at 10pm EST.

        Lady Vox herself, and the first time she has been slain in several months.&nbsp; 
        Although he did not win a coveted white dragon scale (a victim of his

        The guild decided to raid Kedge with Halcyon Coherence.&nbsp; Phiny was 
        away on business yet again, but was excellent practice for kedge-newbies. 
        Excellent pulling by the monks spaced out the guardians perfectly, and 
        had Phin been up, he would be swimming with the fishes.<br>

        Decided to raid Kedge on Sunday and made its way to Phiny's Lair. Although 
        the master of the seas was away, the guild claimed many of his henchmen 
        as victims.&nbsp; At the end of the raid, we decided to take out the shark 
        Cauldronboil and got a nice Sharkjaw Cutlass (Tomwin won roll).<br>

        Time to start making out your wishlists! One of the greatest advantages 
        to belonging to a guild is working together to get equipment.&nbsp; Pooling 
        our resources and hunts, we may be able to help out multiple people in 
        the same raid.&nbsp; My suggestion is that everyone go to <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">everquest.allakhazam.com</a>, 
        register your character, enter all your equipment, and then use the upgrader 
        option to find better stuff.&nbsp; This is an incredible tool, just remember 
        that some dungeons/mobs are too difficult for us right now (dragon necropolis). 
        Put your list together and post in the message board.<br>
