        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: May 11 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Let it be said, that Lady Vox died at the hands of 
        Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle.&nbsp; 
        Vox had not gone down on the server for several months and it was time 
        for her to feel cold steel in her belly.<br>
        <br>
        As a first time dragon raid leader, I would certainly say that the raid 
        went very well. There were approximately 12 no-shows from the everquestraids 
        list, but fortunately, enough extras showed up to bring the total raid 
        attendence to 39 (1 dissapeared just prior to buffing, so final was 38). 
        It took about an hour for everyone to arrive, clear Vox's guards, and 
        create the groups. This is definitely the time of the raid where 
        everyone is wondering what is taking so long, but in fact is the most 
        hectic for the raid leader (forming final groups, determining buff groups, 
        coordinating with pull groups, arranging ports to get late comers there, 
        telling level 20's that they can't attend, telling people how to get to 
        the king area, and the list goes on). Luckily, I had created 40+ social 
        keys with instructions (which I'm going to tweak) and had built a spreadsheet 
        that helped form groups and determine loot numbers. <br>
        <br>
        Almost 80% of the attendees had never been on a dragon raid, and almost 
        90% had never been on a successful one (or ever done a buff line). Vox 
        is definitely harder than Naggy, and it takes a lot more work to pull 
        off a good raid. I foresee the next raid going even smoother and 
        quicker than this one, and if enough people arrive on time may be able 
        to push the time well below 3 hours. The raid was completely finished 
        at 11:30pm CST, a 3.5hour total duration. Out of the 9 raids I've been 
        on, this was one of the fastest (average time 4+ hours). Buffing 
        took a little longer than I would have liked, but we only had 1 cle and 
        1 enc that had 2 of the critical buffs. I did tweak the line, midway through 
        and it did speed it up a little more.<br>
        <br>
        May have also been a bit easier if I didn't have a huge thunderstorm outside 
        my house at the same time that took out my cable modem and caused me to 
        lose power twice (thank goodness for my UPS).<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus (CT guild leader) for his excellent pulling 
        of the Ice Giants and Vox's guards. And to the buffers that evening as 
        well: Ceeni, Combatt, Khallin, Greymask, Milennia, Morgynn, and Treesa. 
        If any of you are out any plat for the peridots, let me know and I will 
        reimburse you.<br>

        <b>THE KILL</b><br>
        Vox did manage to get off 1 Complete Heal during the fight, but went down 
        neverless (next time I'll shout stun and seive more!).<br>
        Group 4 (Brewall's) got the kill and Aunoa got the kill shot.<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        Loot was:<br>
        1 White Dragon Scale - won by Moonflower<br>
        1 White Dragon Scale - won by Ensis<br>
        1 Kayrull's Mystical Pouch - won by Darias<br>
        1 Warhammer of Divine Grace - won by Bolgor<br>
        1 Wing of Xenogy (common Magician research item (probably a PH for Ice 
        Comet)<br>
        5PP &amp; No Gems - Not exactly D&amp;D level here.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. The shout commands will be tweaked a bit for clarity. Especially the 
        buff line instructions (no buffs when entering line). Will probably 
        have 1 person at start responsible for stripping buffs. Also overall instructions 
        on when/where we will do buffing.<br>
        2. Enchanters will be teamed up with more bards singing mana song / split 
        enchanter spells during buffing. Did my initial calculations based on 
        Rune IV, but with Rune V available, didn't realize that spell became the 
        critical path.<br>
        3. Will leave junk loot (wings of xenogy, runes, words) on Vox so the 
        body stays around a bit longer for screenshots :)<br>
