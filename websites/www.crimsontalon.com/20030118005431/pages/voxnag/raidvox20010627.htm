        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: June 27 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies yet a sixth time at the hands of Crimson Talon 
        and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle. Interest in 
        the raids is very high, and I had to turn away no less than 12 people. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at 
        how many people showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee 
        that you will have a spot, nor does it indicate the exact starting time. 
        Quite a difference from a few weeks ago when I had cobbled together just 
        38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people are showing 
        up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit attendance 
        otherwise things are out of control, people start getting immature, and 
        people don't listen to my instructions.<br>
        <br>
        The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting 
        the hang of it. Great opportunity for capitalists to sell peridots. Always 
        seems to be people around without them.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. Sending 6 more tells won't help. 
        I try to accomodate long-time attendees and work in classes I'm short 
        on, and try to be as fair as possible. <br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle 
        of room was very well executed and excellent job surrounding her. Vox 
        did not manage to get off any CH, great job seiving and stunning!<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus and Physst for pulling of the Ice Giants 
        and Vox's guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and 
        I certainly appreciate their efforts. And to the buffers that evening 
        as well: Khallin, Barelil, Kauf, Vyce, Galadriad, Bolgor, Mysyn, Cilden, 
        Saleel, Guldaenya, and Nandarr (and to the bards, necros, and magicians 
        doing the feeding too). For all the first time buffers that were there, 
        great job!<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees. As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight and to all the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
        Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Immolar<br>
        <b>Runed Bolster Belt</b> - won by Dainin<br>
        <b>Frost Book</b> - won by Kanine<br>
        <b>Kayrul's Mystical Pouch</b>&nbsp; - won by Nandarr<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap Vox at 45 and Nag 
        at 40, and keep a few spots open for classes the raid is short on. Hate 
        to tell people no, but going to have to do it. Server gone from 0 kills 
        in 2 months to 6 kills and the word has gotten out that my raids work. 
        Going to be especially tough on Naggy, he is a lot easier than Vox.<br>
        2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        3. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are 
        continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may 
        be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.</p>
