            <span class="s2cA"><b>LADY VOX IS DEAD</b><br>
            <br>
            Vox dies yet a sixth time at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers who
            joined us in battle.&nbsp; Interest in the raids is very high, and I had to turn away no
            less than 12 people. <br>
            <br>
            Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at how many people
            showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee that you will have a spot,
            nor does it indicate the exact starting time. Quite a difference from a few weeks ago when
            I had cobbled together just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people are
            showing up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit attendance
            otherwise things are out of control, people start getting immature, and people don't
            listen to my instructions.<br>
            <br>
            The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting the hang of it.
            Great opportunity for capitalists to sell peridots. Always seems to be people around
            without them.<br>
            <br>
            If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, just keep some
            things in mind:<br>
            1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse than having Vox
            agro and start summoning people from goblin king area to their death - and I've seen this
            happen on one bad raid I was on. If it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
            2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have to do groups,
            buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp group, find out if any are new
            attendees and help them along if you can, explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow
            helps a lot.<br>
            3. If I say raid is full, it is full. Sending 6 more tells won't help. I try to accomodate
            long-time attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. <br>
            <br>
            Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle of room was
            very well executed and excellent job surrounding her. Vox did not manage to get off any
            CH, great job seiving and stunning!<br>
            <br>
            Special thanks go out to Altus and Physst for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's guards.
            This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly appreciate their
            efforts. And to the buffers that evening as well: Khallin, Barelil, Kauf, Vyce, Galadriad,
            Bolgor, Mysyn, Cilden, Saleel, Guldaenya, and Nandarr (and to the bards, necros, and
            magicians doing the feeding too). For all the first time buffers that were there, great
            job!<br>
            <br>
            <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
            Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the loot numbers next
            to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone can see which random number(s) they
            had for each item. Gaps in the numbers reflect raid points, and the number listed is the
            max number that person has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle
            had #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

            Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, final. All raid
            points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. I still like raid points and
            think they are a lot more democratic than other raids that give items to the 'most
            deserving' person (usually the level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random
            and attending more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
            <b><br>
            THE KILL</b><br>
            Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
            Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the fight and to all
            the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
            Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
            <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Immolar<br>
            <b>Runed Bolster Belt</b> - won by Dainin<br>
            <b>Frost Book</b> - won by Kanine<br>
            <b>Kayrul's Mystical Pouch</b>&nbsp; - won by Nandarr<br>
            <br>
            <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
            1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap Vox at 45 and Nag at 40, and keep a
            few spots open for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people no, but going to have
            to do it. Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 6 kills and the word has gotten out that
            my raids work. Going to be especially tough on Naggy, he is a lot easier than Vox.<br>
            2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ everyone should
            be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good habit to get into, if you accept
            less from guildmates/friends, that is your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp
            in peridots for those that don't carry them.<br>
            <br>
            <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
            3. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open up once the
            original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping last night and did not have
            my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. On the next raid, the WDS will be open to
            casters with the following conditions:<br>
            -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply each bard's
            raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor so that the collective numbers
            that bards have is approximately 40%-50% of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So
            bards have a 50% chance of winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that
            have won are continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may be
            that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.<br>
