            Vox dies a third time at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers who
            joined us in battle.&nbsp; Vox had not gone down on the server for several months and the
            last three Brewall lead raids have eased the oppression of this cruel dragon over the
            lands of Everfrost, as well as, liberated more of her property.<br>
            <br>
            Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I was absolutely shocked how many
            people showed up. Less than two weeks ago, I had cobbled together just 38 people, and felt
            lucky to get that, now, tons of people are showing up. Next raid will have a limit on
            people.</span><p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Definitely going
            to change way people make the list, and it will be better for everyone involved if I do.
            Too many people causes a lot more work (and time) to do a raid and almost results in mob
            mentality, and instructions not being followed. I know it can be dull at start during
            setup, but pullers and myself are hard at work. I average 1 tell every 10 seconds AND I'm
            trying to work out groups, buffers, tactics, and other things.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">From now
            on, when people arrive in zone, they will need to send me a tell, AND receive a message
            back from me that &quot;YOU ARE ON LIST&quot;. It may add to my tells, but I was actually
            getting people just arriving in zone claiming they had been there for a long time (I wrote
            down every name when I first logged into Perma) - I turned some away for this reason.
            Trust me, I don't like turning anyone away, but just going to have to do it next time. I
            also turned away some below 45 that were on last raid, but this time we had plenty of 45+.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Vox was
            definitely tough this time on pulling guards. Hate it when she agros and then summons the
            pullers, and I'm sure the pullers do to. This next time, I'll include a message that Altus
            is puller, will use shout, and everyone should help him in any way he asks.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Two line
            buffing worked out better than I anticipated time-wise, but it still seems that some
            people are missing buffs. Seems like I can lead an ogre to a beer but can't make him
            drink. I thought the way I ran through each line and then did a recap was a good format,
            but next time, I just will just jump to a recap messages and make people write it down. No
            excuse for not getting 14 buffs.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Absolute
            biggest problem of the fight was that someone did not listen to instructions, got feared
            and pulled back a ton of mobs from the pits. If I could figure out who they were, they
            would not be welcome on additional raids. I had planned to use reserve group 5 to take out
            any respawns (I thought maybe 1 up) and instead they were decimated by the pit mobs. Then,
            the bears wiped out a couple enchanters, allowing Vox to retain mana for CH. To top it
            off, the bear AI must then have looked for person doing most shouts, because I had 4 on me
            and couldn't get them off. Needless to say, with 75hp left, I did my last shouts, did a
            suicide AE 350hp dmg to all the bears and promptly died when Vox was at 20%.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Special
            thanks go out to Altus (CT guild leader) and Physst for pulling of the Ice Giants and
            Vox's guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly appreciate
            their efforts. And to the buffers that evening as well: Sileguy, Aorthin, Rekinom,

            max number that person has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle
            had #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

            Note 1: Lazuli gave me choice at start of fight for which char, and I chose Enc for rune,
            allowed to roll on desired item.<br>
            Note 2: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, final. All raid
            points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. I still like raid points and
            think they are a lot more democratic than other raids that give items to the 'most
            deserving' person (usually the level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random
            and attending more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
            Note 3: Persecutis, please send me tell/leave msg. Have 1 prior raid listed (2b), you told
            me two, but I checked my records for all prior raids and can't find you in any group I
            made.</span></p>

            <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
            1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap at 40, and keep a few spots open
            for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people no, but going to have to do it.
            Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 3 kills in 2 weeks and the word has gotten out.<br>
            2. Rule #2 is going to be: don't ever bring a mob back from pits. Rule #1 is to keep Vox
            off walls.<br>
            3. Will kick &quot;BOOK DROP&quot; button. Vox 0-3 on book drops and I'm really feeling
            sorry for paladins. Almost as bad as me hosting 4 raids and not winning a scale yet...<br>
            4. If multiple scales drop, I will automatically recieve one, others all up for random
            (vox drops 0-3). Already, 3 bards that I had never met before I started the Vox raids have
            won, and will definitely ease the loot presure on me. With many more bards in attendance
            (only 4 on 1st raid), I will also increase my own raid points to still allow for chance
            someone else may win, but my odds get no worse than this last fight. And, yes, even after
            I win a WDS, I will continue to host raids.<br>
            5. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ everyone should
            be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good habit to get into, if you accept
            less from guildmates/friends, that is your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp
            in peridots for those that don't carry them.<br>
