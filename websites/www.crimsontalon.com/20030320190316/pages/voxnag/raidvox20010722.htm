        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: July 22 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies for a ninth time at the hands of Crimson Talon 
        and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle.<br>
        <br>
        To say that people are interested in killing dragons is an understatement. 
        More and more people show each raid and it's difficult to pick those that 
        make the raid list. These are truely open attendance raids, there 
        are typically 20+ guilds in attendance, and usually only 5-6 from Crimson 
        Talon, as many are now beyond the 52 dragon cap.<br>
        <br>
        Tried to include some extra people on the raid, but will not be able to 
        do this in the future. At least 8 people went LD during the fight, including 
        myself. Now that everyone has seen what happens with too many people, 
        please be understanding when I have to turn you away. Anyone turned 
        away gets an attendance point which helps you get into future raids. It 
        may take a few raids for spots to free up, but it will happen.<br>
        <br>
        Also, <b>Trojar</b>, don't bother coming to any of my future raids. With 
        no prior attendances, you show up expect to be on raid, and then start 
        spamming with me with cursing when you don't make list. Too bad, since 
        I try to accomodate 50+ paladins for epic reasons with 2+ prior attendances, 
        you could have made list in a couple raids, no chance now. You are on 
        my ignore list and marked as undesireable on any of my future raids or 
        Crimson Talon raids for that matter. A trustworthy and holy knight you 
        are not.<br>
        <br>
        Three buff stations at this last raid. Abundance of bards made this a 
        lot easier.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too 
        late. Sending additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time 
        attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. 
        Sometimes, I just can't add people and keep things going smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job listening to instructions (until I went LD that is).<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees. As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: Cilden / Ciladin always rolls as paladin. Enc character is an 
        alt that helps with buffing.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:00.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch </b>- (54) Won by Millennia<br>
        <b>Rune Bolster Belt</b> - (25) Won by Ciladin<b><br>
        Warhammer of Divine Grace</b> - (3) Won by Irrenne<b><br>
        Dragon Bone Bracelet</b> - (1) Won by Cowabunga. (donated to Punchen)<b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. People need to report in when I shout for names. If you do not send 
        in your name, you are not even on my radar to be assigned to a group. 
        It takes me a while to go through tells, and I rarely miss someone.<br>
        2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        3. Hard limit on attendees. Can't risk LD like this last raid. Was actually 
        worse having more people.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        4. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are 
        continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may 
        be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.</p>
