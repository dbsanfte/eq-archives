        <em>Last update: 14 March 2003</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <span class="s2cA"><br>
        Greetings all.&nbsp; I've written this guide to explain how a typical 
        Trakanon raid is done.&nbsp; Raids could be done differently than what 
        I've detailed here based on equipment, levels, and classes, but it should 
        give you a good idea of what is required.<br>
        <br>
        Hopefully, many of the players on this type of raid are experienced dragon 
        hunters and are familiar with large scale encounters. If you are thinking 
        of trying such a raid and would like to paractice, the dragons of Western 
        Wastes offer ample opportunities.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>SPAWN TIME</strong><br>
        Trakanon spawns every 3 days +/- a random number of hours.&nbsp; Once 
        killed, the Undead Bard will spawn within 0-18 hours.&nbsp; The undead 
        bard will respawn every 0-18 hours upon death, until Trakanon spawns.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT YOU NEED</b><br>
        1. You should be between levels 55 and 60.<br>
        2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 100 and a Poison Resistance of 100. 
        The higher the better.<br>
        3. Bring peridots. Guilds will typically supply these for Trakanon raids. 
        If an open raid, bring one for cleric and one for enchanter. <br>
        4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed. Alliance-type 
        guild raids should work out how loot will be split prior to the raid, 
        especially teeth.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HOW TO GET THERE</b><br>
        1. Trakanon's lair lies deep in Old Seblis. You should already have a 
        key to Seblis.<br>
        2. Melees should bind on Kunark and casters should bind outside Seblis.<br>
        3. Recommended that the leading guild have mules/pp ready to supply coffins 
        in the event of a failed raid.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DETERMINING IF TRAKANON / UNDEAD BARD IS UP</strong><br>
        Because Trakanon's lair lies deep in Seblis, it is only possible to track 
        him from a few locations:<br>
        1. Rangers can track him from D1/D2/Crypt/Fungi King room<br>
        2. Druids can track him from Fungi King room<br>
        3. Bards can track him near bridge area to lair<br>
        4. It is no longer possible to do the /target Trakanon and interpret the 
        visible/not visible message, VI changed that in mid 2001.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>TRAKANON INFORMATION</strong><br>
        1. Trakanon is a level 65 Dragon Necromancer (no pet) with 32,000HP.<br>
        2. His most deadly weapon is his AE poison (75000 HP in 5000 ticks = 1500 
        HP per minute). The DoT adds 9 poison counters and has a range of 300ft.&nbsp; 
        He will cast it every 35 seconds. The poison will hit you even if you 
        are on the bridge outside his lair. It is possible to use obstacles to 
        block the AE.<br>
        3. He will also cast Blindness and a 1500HP lifetap.<br>
        4. Every 45 seconds, he will cast Trakanon's Touch, which will teleport 
        someone into the mushroom area.<br>
        5. Trakanon hits in the 600's and has an immense range. He will not run 
        around much when agroed, he will claw you from wherever he is standing.<br>
        6. Trakanon does not use AE fear.<br>
        7. Trakanon does not dispel.<br>
        8. Trakanon has high MR and PR resists. He is weak against FR and CR.<br>
        9. If Trakanon gates, he will reappear at spawn point in lair and will 
        regain approximately 5k HP. I do not recommend that anyone fights him 
        in bridge area due to a few bad spots where he might repop back into lair 
        regaining HP.<br>
        10. As with other larget encounter fights, once the fight begins, no one 
        should sit.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>UNDEAD BARD / SPAWNED TRAKANON INFORMATION</strong><br>
        1. The spawned Trakanon is exactly the same as a regular Trakanon, except 
        for loots. Some people regard the spawned Trakanon slightly easier because 
        he will not have Tupalumj's enchanter buffs.<br>
        2. The undead bard is neutral to everyone and drops no loot.<br>
        3. The spawned Trakanon will always drop no-drop guts needed for bard 
        epic and 1 random BP.&nbsp; It is possible to MQ the guts.&nbsp; He does 
        not drop any teeth.<br>
        4. To spawn Trakanon, a bard with a Mystical Lute Body, will give the 
        item to the Undead Bard.&nbsp; The Undead Bard will return the Lute Body 
        back to the bard and will then despawn and an agro version will attack.&nbsp; 
        Once the Undead Bard has been killed, Trakanon will spawn.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SETUP PHASE</b><br>
        1. Once a CoH mage has arrived, the raiding party will begin fighting 
        down to the lair. As new people arrive, they will be CoH'd down to the 
        main raiding party.&nbsp; It is suggested that the group leader remain 
        at zone-in until just prior to buffing.<br>
        2. The raiding party will make its way through the dungeon and stay at 
        the bridge area until everyone has arrived. This is an excellent opportunity 
        to get 55+ kunark spells.<br>
        3. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to 
        minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).<br>
        4. Set up &quot;I'm blind&quot; and &quot;I'm poisoned&quot; hotkeys.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BUFFING PHASE</b><br>
        1. A list of casters will be named and will be told what buffs to do.<br>
        2. Unlike Nagafen and Vox, where it is possible to create buff groups, 
        buff, camp, and log back in, Trakanon buffing must be done on-the-fly 
        due to constant attacks from guardians.<br>
        3. Trakanon does not dispel; the buffs can be done in any order. With 
        Planes of Power, there are considerably better spells that could be done, 
        but a good pre-PoP buff list was:<br>
        #01 shaman - talisman of kragg [365hp] (375mana - 72min) <br>
        #02 shaman - talisman of shadoo (group buff) [45pr] (150 - 36min) <br>
        #03 druid - protection of the glades (group buff) [450hp 24ac 6mana] (1200mana 
        - 100min) <br>
        #04 cleric - bulwark of faith (tanks only) [38ac] (350mana - 81min) <br>
        #05 cleric - naltron's mark (group buff) [446hp] 1 Peridot per group (500mana 
        - 54min) <br>
        #06 wizard - spellshield [700magic absorb] Peridot (350mana - 110min) 
        <br>
        #07 enchanter - rune V [700dmg] Peridot (350mana - 110min) <br>
        #08 enchanter - group resist magic (group buff)[55mr] (200mana - 36min) 
        <br>
        #09 enchanter - sshisar (epic) <br>
        #10 enchanter - gift of pure thought (group buff)[group clarity 2] (300mana 
        - 33min) <br>
        #10 necromancer - dead men floating [70pr] (375mana - 12min) OR dead man 
        floating<br>
        #11 shaman - potion of greater purity [25pr] <br>
        #Range Slot - magician - get a &quot;Shard of the Core&quot; [15pr 15cr] 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>ASSAULTING TRAKANON</b><br>
        1. Cure poison and cure blindness should be memmed.<br>
        2. Put mage in same group as positioning group in case they get teleported.<br>
        3. Once attack has started - no one should sit!<br>
        4. Groups will rush up the ramp in order of: (1) Positioning group (2) 
        Melee and (3) Caster. Casters should stay back to give melees room.<br>
        5. First group will rush in and try to pull Trak deep into lair. Either 
        to NE or E. Once in position, they will attack. The first person who attacks 
        Trak will be teleported deep into the mushroom area. Normally, monks are 
        sent in and then they are CoH'd back. The goal is to kill Trak before 
        he ports the next person.<br>
        6. While Trak is being positioned, melee group should stay behind rock 
        wall to shield themselves from AE. Casters should stay slightly further 
        down ramp.<br>
        7. Other melee groups will rush in as soon as Trak is positioned.<br>
        8. Melees should use disciplines to generate as much damage and taunt 
        as possible.<br>
        9. If Tupalumj was up, Trak could be dispelled to remove enchanter buffs 
        (grm and haste minimum)<br>
        10. Clerics and paladins should cast group heals.<br>
        11. Let tanks beat Trak down to 80 and then open up nuking.<br>
        12. If Trak gates, remain in the lair.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>CLEAN UP</strong><br>
        1. Cure DoT as soon as you are done. Nothing worse than winning and then 
        dropping dead from poison.<br>
        2. Get anyone who was shroom ported. Ideally, it was just the initial 
        monk attacker who was CoH'd back.<br>
