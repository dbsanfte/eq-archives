            <span class="s2cA"><b>LADY VOX IS DEAD</b><br>
            <br>
            Vox dies for a eigth time at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers who
            joined us in battle.&nbsp; Interest in the raids is very high, and I had to turn away no
            less than 10 people. <br>
            <br>
            Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at how many people
            showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee that you will have a spot,
            nor does it indicate the exact starting time. Quite a difference from a couple months ago
            when I had cobbled together just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of
            people are showing up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit
            attendance otherwise things are out of control.<br>
            <br>
            The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting the hang of it.
            Great opportunity for capitalists to sell peridots. Always seems to be people around
            without them.<br>
            <br>
            If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, just keep some
            things in mind:<br>
            1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse than having Vox
            agro and start summoning people from goblin king area to their death - and I've seen this
            happen on one bad raid I was on. If it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
            2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have to do groups,
            buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp group, find out if any are new
            attendees and help them along if you can, explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow
            helps a lot.<br>
            3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too late. Sending
            additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time attendees and work in classes
            I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. Sometimes, I just can't add people and
            keep things going smoothly.<br>
            <br>
            Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out from the hallway was
            tough, but was happy to see people back off and then surround her in the lair. Vox managed
            two CHs, but did her little good.<br>
            <br>
            Special thanks go out to Cowabunga for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's guards. This is
            an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly appreciate his effort - even if
            he pulled almost all of them at once. And to the buffers that evening as well: Khallin,
            Sabore, Kauf, Evelyn, Galadriad, Loen, Greymask, Cilden, Windarii, and Guldaenya. For all
            the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>ATTENDEES</strong><br>
            Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the loot numbers next
            to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone can see which random number(s) they
            had for each item. Gaps in the numbers reflect raid points, and the number listed is the
            max number that person has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle
            had #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

            Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, final. All raid
            points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. I still like raid points and
            think they are a lot more democratic than other raids that give items to the 'most
            deserving' person (usually the level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random
            and attending more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
            Note 1: Cilden / Ciladin always rolls as paladin. Enc character is an alt that helps with
            buffing.<br>
            <strong><br>
            THE KILL</strong><br>
            Excellent job getting her out of hallway. Takes a lot of discipline, but was necessary.<br>
            Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
            Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:00.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>THE LOOT</strong><br>
            <strong>Crystalline Spear </strong>- (1) Won by Borq<br>
            <strong>Staff of Forbidden Rites</strong> - (9) Won by Cellwin<strong><br>
            Dragon Bone Bracelet</strong> - (1) Won by Cowabunga. (donated to Jevrulle)<strong><br>
            McVaxious' Horn or War</strong> - (1) Won by Brewall<strong><br>
            </strong><br>
            <strong>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</strong><br>
            1. People need to report in when I shout for names. If you do not send in your name, you
            are not even on my radar to be assigned to a group. It takes me a while to go through
            tells, and I rarely miss someone.<br>
            2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ everyone should
            be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good habit to get into, if you accept
            less from guildmates/friends, that is your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp
            in peridots for those that don't carry them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>OLD INFO ON WDS:</strong><br>
            3. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open up once the
            original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping last night and did not have
            my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. On the next raid, the WDS will be open to
            casters with the following conditions:<br>
            -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply each bard's
            raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor so that the collective numbers
            that bards have is approximately 40%-50% of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So
            bards have a 50% chance of winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that
            have won are continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may be
            that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.<br>
