            </span><span class="s2cA"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
            The Plane of Fear is a level 46+ zone that normally requires a raid to complete. It is the
            home of the god Cazic-Thule and his minions, including Dracoliche, Fear, Dread, and
            Terror. This guide covers everything needed to successfully raid Fear, please read it all
            before attending a raid.<br>
            <br>
            The information in this guide is a compilation of numerous guides I have read along with
            my observations of both good and bad Fear raids. <br>
            <br>
            <b>MAP</b><br>
            <a href="http://www.everlore.com/geography/default.asp?mapID=14380"><u>Everlore Map</u></a><br>
            <br>
            <b>SETTING UP</b><br>
            The Plane of Fear can be accessed through a tunnel in Ferrot located in the South-West
            corner of the zone. The entrance itself is hidden on the zone wall, but can easily be
            found by starting in the zone corner and running east along the hill.<br>
            <br>
            Fear is well-known for break-in difficulty and getting the raid started. Break-in will
            take quite a bit of time and will involve numerous deaths. Once the raid has started, it
            is very important that everyone know exactly what to do. Wipe outs are very common if
            people are not paying attention.<br>
            <br>
            Tanks should bind just inside Ogguk at the entrance. Someone should have an extra
            character there that can SoW or give out SoW potions to anyone that has died so they can
            run past the bouncers. This character will also need to be able to cast ultravision or
            infravision for night-blind tanks.<br>
            <br>
            Casters should bind by the rock outside the Fear portal. This area has no wandering mobs.<br>
            <br>
            Note: Cyndereela is a necro that guards the portal and is of little direct danger. The
            biggest problem she poses is that she sees invis and an attack from her will strip you of
            invisibility that you need when entering Fear.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BREAK-IN OPTIONS</b><br>
            There are three major theories on the easiest way to break into fear. Each balances length
            of run to camp spot versus numbers of mobs. The longer run / higher risk break-ins should
            only be done with experienced Fear players, just one person who brings a big train can
            wipe out a lot of staging work. <br>
            1. Start at west camp. This guide covers this process. Short run from portal, but have to
            clear more mobs. Two different methods.<br>
            2. Start at southwest camp. Longer run from portal, but fewer mobs to clear. Run W, then
            run S high on wall.<br>
            3. Start at north camp. Longest run from portal, but fewest mobs to clear. Run W, then run
            N high on wall.<br>
            <br>
            <b>PREPARING TO ENTER - The Scouts</b><br>
            Break in begins with two people that can feign death. One will enter the zone and feign
            just outside the portal to the west! Feigning slightly to the west will make it easier for
            people zoning in to orient themselves on which way to run. When the area is clear, the
            second scout will enter, turn west, run down the hill, and feign at the bottom near the
            wall. This is where the initial battle will take place, this is often called the
            &quot;West Camp&quot; or &quot;WC&quot; for short. Ideally, these monks will have
            rez-sticks in event of catastrophic event during the raid (e.g., server reset in middle of
            a raid).<br>
            <br>
            <b>PREPARING TO ENTER - Groups</b><br>
            Break in groups are usually formed at this time and should consist of tanks and clerics.
            These groups are not built to share experience, just to break into the plane. Once the
            raid is going, groups can be redone. There are numerous suggestions on break-in groups and
            tactics:<br>
            1. 2 tank groups: 5 tanks &amp; 1 cleric || 5 tanks &amp; 1 cleric<br>
            2. 2 tank groups: 5 tanks &amp; 1 cleric || 4 tanks, 1 cleric, &amp; 1 enc <br>
            3. 2 tank groups: 5 tanks &amp; 1 cleric || 2 tanks, 2 cleric, &amp; 2 enc <br>
            4. First wave of all FD classes to WC. They quit to eliminate any residual agro. They
            return and FD in camp spot and await main groups of tanks. Second wave of 2 tank groups
            #1-3 from above is then sent in.<br>
            5. Have casters duel outside portal area. Get a couple coins upon death and mem biggest
            nuke spells.<br>
            <br>
            <b>PREPARING TO ENTER - Buffs</b><br>
            Everyone about to enter Fear should consider the following buffs:<br>
            1. Talisman of Altuna (shaman)<br>
            2. Stamina (shaman)<br>
            3. Invisibility or Superior Camo<br>
            4. See Invisibility<br>
            5. Symbol (cleric)<br>
            6. Resolution (cleric)<br>
            7. Shield (cleric)<br>
            8. Levitate or Dead Man Floating<br>
            9. Haste or Clarity<br>
            10. Rune<br>
            11. Magic Resistance<br>
            12. Spirit of Wolf (deactivate upon reaching WC)<br>
            13. Chloro<br>
            14. Damage Shields<br>
            15. Str/Dex/Agi buff&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            <b>FIRST BREAK IN - &quot;FIGHT AND DIE&quot; APPROACH</b> <br>
            This is the most common tactic to breaking into fear. It features breaking in, fighting
            (killing a couple mobs), dying, rebuffing, and repeating). Once groups are set up and
            buffed, the first rush to the West Camp will begin. Goal is to get a strong beach head in
            the zone and clear out roaming mobs near the WC. There are about 12 roamers that will need
            to be killed, and this does not include other roamers near the portal or the adjacent
            areas. Agro ranges in Fear are absolutely huge.<br>
            1. The two FD monks will give all-clear. These monks will not fight during any of the
            break-in attempts.<br>
            2. Raid leader will have all extra monks and shadow knights zone-in and run to the WC.
            They will FD at the WC and then quit to avoid any residual agro. Wait a couple minutes and
            come back on. Remain FD at the WC for the main assault groups. Their job is to help with
            initial fights, and FD when badly injured.<br>
            3. When all clear is given again, the first two groups will zone into Fear.<br>
            4. When you zone in, you turn yourself west (orient yourself with the FD monk who is lying
            west of the portal) and run straight over them to the west zone wall to the WC.<br>
            &nbsp; a. If you are attacked on the way to the WC, stay there, fight, and die. If several
            of you are attacked, get on the same mob.<br>
            &nbsp; b. Critical that you do not bring mobs to the WC. Do not run to camp if you are
            attacked. You can be pulled to SS for a rez sometime later.<br>
            &nbsp; c. Do not run around the zone if you are attacked. This can stir up the zone with
            chain agros and it may take a long time to get your corpse back.<br>
            &nbsp; d. If a scareling teleports you away from the camp, get your bearings on the camp.
            If you are agroed in any way, stay there (get a loc). If you are clear for 15+ seconds,
            slowly make your way back to the WC. Never bring a mob with you.<br>
            5. Everyone needs to stand extremely close to one another in the WC. Do not stray more
            than 1-2 steps from anyone else. Need to occupy as little space as possible to avoid
            wanderer agro.<br>
            6. Eventually a wandering mob will agro and will attack the WC camp. Goal is to kill as
            many of these mobs as possible. Each one killed makes subsequent attempts easier. Everyone
            needs to attack the same target.<br>
            7. Once you are in WC, turn on walk and turn off SoW in the event that a turmoil toad
            attacks and fears you.<br>
            8. The raid leader may then wait for all clear again and send in naked nuke casters as a
            second wave.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SUBSEQUENT BREAK IN'S - &quot;FIGHT AND DIE&quot; APPROACH</b><br>
            It is exceptionally rare that the first break-in attempt succeeds. There are simply too
            many mobs to be killed and too many things that go wrong.<br>
            1. Anyone that dies should make their way back to the portal and get buffed again. Best to
            keep a magician outside that can summon basic weapons, 5 food, and 5 water. Someone also
            needs to have extra gems for cleric and enchanter buffs. Extra SoW person in Oggok makes
            this much quicker process.<br>
            2. With enough people assembled, wait for the all-clear and repeat the attack.<br>
            <br>
            <b>FIRST BREAK IN - &quot;FIGHT AND FLEE&quot; APPROACH</b><br>
            This tactic is not a widely practiced break-in method. It features breaking in, fighting
            &amp; nuking, and then evacing. Goal is to kill roamers and adds one at a time.<br>
            1. One FD monk near the portal and is responsible for telling everyone when to zone. A
            second monk will be located on the west wall. Everyone should have a hotkey set up to
            assist this monk to make target selection easier.<br>
            2. 2-4 groups, all with an evac person and mezzer, will zone in at once, run to west wall
            with any adds. Everyone should stay extremely close to one another. Kill 1 mob, while
            enchanters chain cast AE mez. At first sign of trouble evac or when 1 mob is killed - a
            train is coming - get out before it arrives!<br>
            3. Repeat process of damage/kill, evac, damage/kill, and evac. Can never evac too early
            for first few mobs while it is still crowded. Repeat until portal mobs are dead, then work
            on west side.<br>
            4. For those that die, see &quot;Subsequent Break In's - Fight and Die Approach&quot;
            above.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE WEST CAMP</b><br>
            Once the 11-13 wanderers have been killed near WC, the plane is effectively broken, but it
            will still be risky for a while. Scouts should give all clear when portal wanderers are
            away and additional groups can move to the WC, rez, and begin clearing the rest of the
            plane.<br>
            <br>
            With everone in the west camp, you have made past the first stage, but the raid is still
            extemely risky. There are still a lot of wandering mobs just outside this area. Everyone
            needs to remain very close to one another. Snare is extemely important at this time.<br>
            1. Stay in WC for about 30 minutes killing any wandering mob that is nearby.<br>
            2. If there is another mob close to camp while puller is further out, the closer mob
            should be killed first.<br>
            3. Pullers should clear any wandering mobs that are near the portal area.<br>
            4. Pullers should clear any wandering mobs that are between WC and the SW corner.<br>
            5. Camp will move to the SW corner to add some space so that people don't need to be
            standing on top of one another.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE SOUTHWEST CAMP &amp; Killing Dracoliche</b><br>
            1. Any remaining nearby wanderers are killed.<br>
            2. Wanderers near the Fetid Fiend house to the north are pulled.<br>
            3. Fetid Fiend house is pulled, and then any wanderers to the north of the house.<br>
            4. Pull east along the south wall. Best to chain-pull this area.<br>
            5. Pull the area past the portal area to get the tentacle terrors.<br>
            6. Have everyone rebuff and pull Dracoliche.<br>
            &nbsp; a. Summon pets if you have them<br>
            &nbsp; b. Critical buffs are save disease, save poison, and magic.<br>
            &nbsp; c. Biggest weapon is AE Fear and Rotting Flesh (poison based) DoT.<br>
            &nbsp; d. Cazic will be agroed when Draco is attacked. It is important to kill Draco as
            quickly as possible because Cazic will continue to death-touch people every 30 seconds
            throughout the battle. When battle is over, log out. Someone from kill group should check
            corpse first.<br>
            &nbsp; e. Undead spells will not work on Dracoliche.<br>
            7. Pull from far north, but not past the fire wall.<br>
            8. Pull from east. Pull any wanderers, then the gorgons, the frightfinger house, and check
            again for wanderers.<br>
            9. Move camp to South Camp<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE SOUTH CAMP &amp; Killing Dread, Terror, and Fright</b><br>
            1. Pull Dread and his 2 Amy knights/warriors.<br>
            2. Pull Terror and his 2 Amy knights/warriors.<br>
            3. When Cazic-Thule moves away, pull Fright and his 2 minions.<br>
            4. Pull remaining mobs on south wall.<br>
            5. Move camp to Southeast Camp.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE SOUTHEAST CAMP</b><br>
            1. Pull wanderers on East wall.<br>
            2. Pull static spawns on East wall.<br>
            3. Move camp to Northwest Camp.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE NORTHWEST CAMP &amp; Clearing the Temple</b><br>
            Pulling the temple takes quite a bit of planning, but with the zone virtually empty of all
            other mobs, there is a large area to the south for kiting mobs.<br>
            1. Get highest level necro available to go to the portal area and&nbsp; cast a fresh SoW
            on them. They should then cast harmshield upon themselves, run into the temple to agro
            every mob (harmshield will absorb the harmtouches), run to South wall (with a huge train
            of mobs), and then gate out as quickly as possible.<br>
            2. Once mobs start returning to the temple, have a freshly buffed person kite some of the
            stragglers around the portal hill.<br>
            3. While they are being kited, and all the other mobs have returned to the temple, have a
            puller grab a couple and bring them back to the camp. Repeat this until all kited mobs are
            dead.<br>
            4. When the kited mobs are all dead, repeat the agro process from step 1. Hopefully, all
            the harm touches have been expended with the initial necro clearing. If in doubt, repeat
            necro process from step 1, if no harm touches are left, someone else with SoW can re-agro
            the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            5. Repeat until temple is clear.<br>
            6. Have rangers check zone for any remaining mobs other than Cazic.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CAZIC-THULE</b><br>
            1. Remove all buffs and get 4 junk buffs.<br>
            2. Get shaman, druid, cleric, &amp; enchanter&nbsp;buffs.<br>
            3. Get levitate or dead man floating last.<br>
            4. Leave spot open for bard resist magic song.<br>
            5. Select someone to eat the first death touch. Have them hail or cast on Cazic.<br>
            6. As soon as Cazic is attacked, he will summon all remaining mobs in the zone to his aid.
            Enchanters should charm these mobs and use them as pets to attack Cazic.<br>
            7. When the sacrifice is killed by the first death touch, the tank groups should rush in
            and attack.<br>
            8 Cazic dual hits in the 300s-400s, grav-fluxes almost constantly, will dispell buffs, and
            will death-touch every 30 seconds.<br>
            9. At 50%, casters will nuke hard, and with Cazic's low magic resistance, will have an
            easy time.<br>
            10. Everyone needs to stun, bash, and slam Cazic as much as possible to disrupt his
            casting.<br>
            11. Cazic is vulnerable to fear spells. Fear him as much as possible during the fight and
            DoT him heavily.<br>
            <br>
            <b>LOGGING AND ZONING</b><br>
            1. The only exit from Fear is porting or gating. There is also a portal in the middle of
            the temple that will take you out of the zone.<br>
            2. Melee characters may want to have a gate potion for emergencies.<br>
            3. Once the zone is clear, the raid leader may instruct everyone to log at: Ferrot camp,
            SW corner, or N camp (usually called the SS).<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE MOBS</b><br>

            <b>Scarelings</b> - Rouge. 400hp backstab, shadowstep you, and run at SoW speed. Extremely
            important to kill these as quickly as possible. Drops rogue rapier .<br>

            <b>Shiverbacks</b> - No special skills. Drops Shiverback armour (MNK).<br>

            <b>Tentacle Tormentors</b> - Lifetap, throwback, AE debuf. Keep back to wall when fighting
            these and stun as much. as possible.&nbsp; Thorny Vine Armour (RNG) &amp; druid belt.<br>

            Turmoil Toads</b> - Fear. Drops turmoil warts and shaman belt.<br>
            <b>Worry Wraiths</b> - Damage shield. Need to be dispelled quickly. Drops nothing.<br>
            <br>
            <b>CLASS NOTES</b> <br>
            <b>Bards</b> - Able to charm any mob. Bards should not be in pull group or they will die
            from any adds that come back. Keep MR song ready for Gorgons, Nightmare, Scareling,
            Tentacle, and Toad fights. Keep DR song ready for male Fetid Fiends. Mez song works well
            to interrupt casting mobs and to place mobs that are pushed into trees during fights where
            people aren't listening.<b><br>
            Druids</b> -&nbsp; Animal charm is powerful tool to get a hard hitting level 50 mob as an
            ally. Important to snare mobs. Nuke Scarelings hard to kill them quickly.<br>
            <b>Enchanters</b> - Able to charm any mob. Group Resist Magic is vital buff to keep up.<br>
            <b>Magicians</b> - Key to early part of raid with summoned items. Call of Hero can be used
            to rescue those that were teleported away from the camp.<b><br>
            Necromancer</b> - Undead charm is powerful tool to get a hard hitting level 50 mob as an
            ally. Fear works well on mini-bosses and on Cazic (need to be snared first). Many fights
            are long and DoTs are very useful.<br>
            <b>Rangers</b> - Important to snare mobs.<br>
            <b>Wizards</b> - Do more casting on dangerous mobs, such as Scarelings and Tentacle
            Tormentors that teleport party members away from camp area. These mobs need to be killed
            as quickly as possible. <br>
            <br>
            <b>PULLER NOTES</b><br>
            1. Chances of death are very high if you have little experience pulling in Fear. If you
            don't like dying, don't pull.<br>
            2. Mob agro ranges are huge in fear and pathing is quirky. Most good pullers are patient,
            they move out and wait a bit for any wanderer to agro. If within 30 seconds, nothing comes
            they move further out.<br>
            3. Get as much MR as possible. Gorgons stun, Knights harmtouch, and Toads can fear.<br>
            4. If you think you may have a lot of agro, quit out. Better for raid to wait for you to
            come back than to have Cazic start death-touching people.<br>
            5. 51+ monks with stonestance will die far less frequently. Use it when FD fails and
            multiple mobs are on you.<br>
            6. Don't turn spell effects off. Turn on lowest setting if you need to. Much easier to
            spot some of the smaller mobs that cast.<br>
            7. No one should cast a spell on you unless you are back at camp. If they do cast on you
            while you are out and a train of mobs come, they should run away from the camp and die. Do
            not have a bard in pull group; if multiple mobs come back, they will head straight for the
            bard because of song taunting.<br>
            8. Be certain you have gotten all wanderers before you move the camp.<br>
            9. If things are going very smoothly and people are getting bored, bring back 2-3 mobs
            each time.<br>
            10. Don't train the camp. Far easier to just get you rezzed than having camp wiped out.<br>
            11. Chain pull wherever possible. Especially so with the scareling tower.<br>
            12. May want to get item to allow you to permanently see infravision or ultravision in the
            event your nighvision buff is dispelled.<br>
            13. Keep 3-4 junk buffs to protect good buffs from being easily dispelled.<br>
            <br>
            <b>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES</b><br>
            1. In the event of a wipe-out, like any other raid, get a couple FD scouts there first,
            followed by cleric to rez, enchanter to clarity, bards (as many as possible, mana song
            stacks), and then start main rezzing everyone else. If mobs attack during this process,
            bards should protect clerics while they camp.<br>
            <br>
            <b>LOOT RULES</b><br>
            Full Loot List: <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/itemzone.html?zone=51">Allakhazam's
            List</a><br>
            1. Loot rules vary widely on plane raids. Before joining one, check what the rules are.
            Rules could vary from completely closed loot, unneeded items only are open, all items but
            BP/epic/god are open, to all items are open.<br>
            2. Some multi-guild raids take turns at loot based on how many groups each guild brought
            other raids just may have all the classes do a random. If random is done, I suggest
            setting seed at start of raid and having each person set up a hotkey with the random roll
            to keep things going faster.<br>
            3. Some raids have loot coordinator that will track items you have won and limit number of
            items for the raid until everyone else has won. Sometimes winning a BP/Epic/God item will
            limit your ability to win additional items that raid.<br>
            4. Some raids give points for every hour you are on the raid to increase odds as items and
            carry-over time from prior raids.<br>
            5. Most raids will have a gem collector that should receive all gems to cover costs of
            peridots used for buffing. Good gems (blue diamonds/diamonds) can be randomed off at the
            end of the raid, or made into jewelry and randomed off.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
