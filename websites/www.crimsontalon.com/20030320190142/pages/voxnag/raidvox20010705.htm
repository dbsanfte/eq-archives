        <em>Raid Date: July 05 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies for a seventh time at the hands of Crimson 
        Talon and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle.&nbsp; Interest 
        in the raids is very high, and I had to turn away no less than 15 people. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at 
        how many people showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee 
        that you will have a spot, nor does it indicate the exact starting time. 
        Quite a difference from a month ago when I had cobbled together just 38 
        people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people are showing up. 
        To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit attendance 
        otherwise things are out of control.<br>
        <br>
        The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting 
        the hang of it. Great opportunity for capitalists to sell peridots. Always 
        seems to be people around without them.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too 
        late. Sending additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time 
        attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. 
        Sometimes, I just can't add people and keep things going smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle 
        of room was very well executed and excellent job surrounding her. Vox 
        managed one CH, but did her little good.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's 
        guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly 
        appreciate his efforts. And to the buffers that evening as well: Khallin, 
        Zulon, Kauf, Galadriad, Loen, Lilcure, Mysyn, Cilden, Larea, Aprisle, 
        and Laurax. For all the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees. As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight and to all the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
        Vox was dead by 10:00pm CST and loot completely finished by 10:30.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>White Dragon Scale</b> - (8) won by Persecutis<b><br>
        White Dragon Scale</b> - (130) won by Greymask. Lovern (58 bard) had Heirophant 
        Cloak. Trade enforced.<b><br>
        Rune Bolster Belt</b> - (103) won by Sintosa<br>
        <b>Dragon Bone Bracelet</b> - (2) won by Chiun. (first roll was a 4, but 
        Sintosa had already won)<b><br>
        Kayrul's Mystical Pouch</b>&nbsp; - (35) won by Rizzhogg<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. Hard cap of 42 attendees for next Vox raid. People have been upgrading 
        their CR and getting much better at attack. Rumors of 'Vox upgrade' I 
        had been hearing were false. She is no harder than before.<br>
        2. Going to have better method for doing bards offering trades. Made mistake 
        this time by missing Lovern (alt is Larea) on the first roll. Appologies 
        to Kauf, but by including raid points in ability to make trade, stand 
        excellent chance the next time a caster wins.<br>
        3. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        4. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are 
        continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may 
        be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.</p>
