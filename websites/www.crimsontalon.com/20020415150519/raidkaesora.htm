            Brewall Rainsinger - Bard - Cazic-Thule<br>
            Kaesora is an excellent dungeon for parties level 30-40. This dungeon is a mix of live and
            undead mobs. The one way nature of some of the passages means increased risk of death, but
            that is more than made up for with the high experience modifier for the zone. If your
            group is low 30&#146;s, you need a well balanced, full group. Higher 30&#146;s and low
            40&#146;s characters can get away with a lesser group. If possible, bring a group gater.<br>
            <br>
            For all of its danger, Kaesora is an incredibly fun zone, with very high experience and
            loot rewards. Now, with the new bind point immediately outside the zone, this dungeon is
            an attractive place for melees to fight without having to worry about long corpse runs.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Faction</b><br>
            There are some mobs in Kaesora that give negative Venril Sathir faction hits, which is the
            faction of the evil outpost in the Overthere. This is a concern if you are going to bring
            along any evil characters to Kaesora. Any type of spider will give negative VS faction.
            There are a few ghost type mobs that will also give negative VS faction hits, but these
            are very much the exception. Generally, evil races can fight in the undead areas without
            taking VS faction hits. The library can be reached without taking VS faction hits by using
            one of the 2 pits that take you to the back of the Library. This route avoids the VS
            factioned spiders. Unless you have a group gater, ou will need to fight spiders on the way
            out however.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Mobs</b><br>
            There are 4 basic types of mobs in Kaesora: skeletons, ghosts, spiders, and raveners
            (sperm). Skeletons and raveners will not run, but the ghosts and the spiders will. The
            wandering mobs are strathbone healers, skeletal warder, and occasionally you will find a
            ravener wandering. All of these except for the ravener are healers.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Spiders</b><br>
            Bristleweb Spider &#150; warrior spider about level 29-36<br>
            Briarweb Spider &#150; warrior spider about level 32-36<br>

            Strathbone healer &#150; cleric spider always level 29-30<br>
            <br>

            <b>Navigating</b><br>
            Kaesora is a dungeon full of pits and one way passages. To hunt here successfully, you
            need to know how to get around. Once you drop down into the dungeon you can not leave the
            way you came in. Raveners can sometimes see through both invis and invis to undead. Some
            of the caster spiders can see through invis. Move slowly and carefully until you reach
            your destination.<br>
            <br>
            Eq Atlas (www.eqatlas.com) has a very good map of Kaesora. I recommend looking at that map
            while reading this.<br>
            <br>
            Upon entering Kaesora, you will find yourself in a small room that contains a single mob
            (a ghost) and 3 exits. This is a good spot for recovering after a CR and for buffing and
            preparing to go further in. From the entrance to the zone, there is a passageway to the
            right which brings you to a ledge that you cannot get up. This is how you get out once you
            have traveled further in. Straight out from the zone, there is a pit which takes you to
            the Runelord deep inside the dungeon. To the left of the zone is a small drop that takes
            you to the first level of the dungeon. This is the usual way to get into the dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            Upon dropping down, you have 4 options, depending on where you want to go.<br>
            <br>
            To the left is a passageway that leads to a room with some spiders and raveners. There is
            also a pit which will drop you down by the Reaver of Xalgoz spawn in the undead area. This
            is one way to get down to the back of the library without taking VS faction hits.<br>
            <br>
            Directly in front of you will be a pit that will take you down behind the library. Go down
            this and you are now in the undead area. This is another way to get to the back of the
            library, also with no VS faction hits.<br>
            <br>
            To the right is the Frenzied room with 3 static spawns, usually spiders but sometimes
            raveners. This room is the spawn point for the Frenzied Strathbone. There is a closet that
            contains 2 spawns, who will often join in if you engage the 3 spiders in the Frenzied
            room. The left wall of the closet is a secret door that will take you down to the library.
            Once past this secret door, you are in the undead area.<br>
            <br>
            There is a passageway leaving the Frenzied room. This passageway goes right by the pit
            that is straight in from the zone This is your corpse dumping area for CR (covered later).
            The passageway turns to the left into a small room with a single healing spider. If you
            are going to camp the Frenzied room, keep this spider killed. When mobs flee from the
            Frenzied room, they path right to this healer, then go deeper into the dungeon. If it gets
            a heal off on your fleeing mob, find a convenient place to die. ;) Beyond this small room
            is the Broken Floor room. To go farther, you must drop down to the level below.<br>
            <br>
            There are 2 exits from the bottom of the Broken Floor room. The one to the right and
            slightly back goes down to the Church and the Runelord areas. The one directly ahead takes
            you up some stairs, around, and back out. There are about 5 static mobs to fight on the
            way out, 3 in the room with the spiral stairs. You will pass a ledge on your right, this
            drops you off by the Frenzied room again. Do not go down this ledge unless you really want
            to start over again. Continue going up and the only way to go further is to drop down a
            ledge to the right which takes you to the entrance room.<br>
            <br>
            If you take the passageway down to the Church and the Runelord areas from the Broken Floor
            room, you will come to a crossroads. Going right will take you to the Runelord. Going
            straight will take you into the 5 towers area, and eventually down to the church. Once you
            go straight at this intersection, you are in undead territory.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Main Areas in Kaesora</b><br>
            Areas in Kaesora are broken up into spiders and undead. An area will contain all spiders
            or all undead, but not both. The ravener type mobs can be everywhere, but most mobs are
            either spiders or undead. NOTE: when a description for an area says it is all undead, keep
            in mind that the raveners can spawn anywhere, and are the exception to this rule.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Library</b>: The library is full of skeletons and ghosts. There are about 5 or 6
            warders that wander around down here, and they will buff and heal any mobs they come
            across. The library itself contains the Failed Crypt Raider, the Tortured Librarian, and
            the Spectral Librarian. A coin for the bard epic can also be found on the raider who roams
            near the library. All the mobs in this area are undead. To the right of the Library is
            what is commonly called the Burnt House. This is a small area with a hut and a few spawns,
            one of which is the Hungered Ravener. There are many nice drops in this area.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Runelord area</b>: A collection of passageways full of spiders and the Strathbone
            Runelord. All the mobs in this area are spiders and raveners. The room that contains the
            Runelord is packed with spiders. Approach with care.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The 5 Towers</b>: Directly above the church, this area is a maze of skeletons and
            ghosts. All the mobs in this area are undead. This is a large area which offers many
            spawns that are fairly spread out. Wandering healers throughout.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The Church</b>: Numerous skeletons and ghosts, and arguably the best experience in the
            zone. This is home of Xalgoz, the boss of the zone. Approach this area in general, and
            Xalgoz in particular, with caution. An enchanter is recommended when fighting in the
            church area, but not required. All the mobs in this area are undead. I have never seen a
            ravener type mob spawn in the church area. Xalgoz drops the fang needed for the Howling
            Stones key quest.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <b>Corpse retrieval</b>&nbsp;<br>
            CR can be an art in Kaesora, but one simple step can make it much easier. Directly out
            from the zone in is a pit. There is an opening on the other side of the pit down by the
            Frenzied room. If you need to run, get to this pit and die right next to it. Someone from
            above can pull your corpse up to the entry room, making CR much easier. If you have a
            rogue or monk, they can haul corpses to this spot from deeper in, allowing them to be
            /corpsed up to the entry room. The chances of you successfully escaping to the zone out
            are very slim unless you know the way very well and are close to the top. Moral of the
            story: if you are going to die, die in a convenient place to pull your body from above.<br>
            <br>
            <b>General Strategy</b><br>
            Paladins are excellent scouts and pullers in this dungeon, especially in the undead areas.
            Use Invis to undead while scouting and you can then check around the mobs and see if any
            wandering healers are close by. This is also an excellent way to bypass undead mobs you
            don&#146;t want to fight. Do not get complacent with invis to undead, there will on
            occasion be raveners in the undead areas, and they will see through ITU.<br>
            <br>
            The wandering healers in this dungeon pose the biggest threat. The strategy on these mobs,
            like all casters, is to stun and bash to interrupt. Expulse Undead will come in handy as
            well to burn them down quickly.<br>
            <br>
            Most rooms contain 3 static mobs, except for the large open areas. If your group can
            handle 2 at a time, you are set. Target one of the mobs and root it. His 2 friends will
            come running, and he will be out of the fight until root wears off. Re-root as necessary
            to keep the number of mobs down to 2 at most. Most rooms are separated enough to allow
            this.<br>
            <br>
            Always schedule enough time to fight your way out. If you are down in the Library and the
            casters are making noises about leaving in a bit, leave NOW. The library is a long way
            from the exit and it will take at least 15-20 minutes to fight your way out.<br>
            <br>
            Once you are about level 35, you should have enough hp to use invis to undead to get
            yourself as close to the zone as possible, then run for it. You absolutely have to know
            the way out by heart, or you will never make it. If the chances of surviving the run out
            are not good, it is better to die at the pit by the Frenzy room. You corpse will be in an
            accessible area instead of deep in the dungeon, making CR much easier.<br>
