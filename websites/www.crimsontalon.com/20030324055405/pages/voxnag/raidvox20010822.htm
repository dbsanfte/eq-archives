        <em>Raid Date: August 22 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty 
        adventurers who joined us in battle.<br>
        <br>
        One of the most interesting nights ever. Mob placement, mob types, pathing, 
        and roamers are all different now. Physst has pulled from the lair 10+ 
        times and realized that things were a lot different this time around.&nbsp; 
        On top of that, Vox agro range seems to have changed as well. This made 
        pulling that much more difficult and resulted in Vox appearance in the 
        buff area. Took a while to get her back into the lair and to get people 
        rezzed. Still, we were able to kill the beast in the end.<br>
        <br>
        To say that people are interested in killing dragons is an understatement. 
        More and more people show each raid and it's difficult to pick those that 
        make the raid list. &nbsp;These are truely open attendance raids, there 
        are typically 20+ guilds in attendance, and usually only 5-6 from Crimson 
        Talon, as many are now beyond the 52 dragon cap.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too 
        late. Sending additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time 
        attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. 
        Sometimes, I just can't add people and keep things going smoothly. Adding 
        too many to raid risks huge LD problems.<br>
        4. I cap Vox attendance at around 48 people. With 70+ people wanting to 
        go, I have to pick and that can take a while. This is not the time to 
        be asking how to get to Permafrost, I'll take the person standing right 
        next to me first.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: Kauf rolls as bard.<br>
        Note 2: Nieche rolls as monk. Gave me option of mnk or enc for raid, and 
        we needed another 48+ enc.<br>
        Note 3: Venswayla rolls as warrior. Alt is Rado. Always need clerics for 
        raids as well.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Vox was dead by 11:00pm CST and loot completely finished by 12:00.<br>
        ==&gt; Last night, I was keeping group 8 in reserve just in case VI threw 
        another surprise. I was very cautious with the fight. Next time, I'll 
        call in the casters much much sooner. I know it isn't glamorous being 
        a reserve group, but I try to mix these up a bit and it is still important.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <strong>Kayrull's Mystical Pouch</strong> (21) Kauf<br>

        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. People need to report in when I shout for names. If you do not send 
        in your name, you are not even on my radar to be assigned to a group. 
        It takes me a while to go through tells, and I rarely miss someone.<br>
        2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        3. Definitely have limits now on people and enforced them last night. 
        No LD and lag was quite reasonable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        4. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each 50-52 bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it.<br>
