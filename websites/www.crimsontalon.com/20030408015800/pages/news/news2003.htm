        <a name="Feb"></a><strong>Feb 27, 2003</strong><br>
        Tonight, the <strong>Idol</strong> was up and needed some company in Kael. 
        So, we gathered the forces of CT/OC and killed him and once again slayed 
        the <strong>Avatar of War</strong>. Congrats to all of the winners, what 
        a busy week our alliance has had. [Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings] Physst, 
        [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Runehammer(OC), and [Helmet of Rallos Zek] 
        Valstorm.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 26, 2003</strong><br>
        We are starting to like it when small patches happen and the servers are 
        brought down. <strong>Aaryonar</strong> Is apparently the mob that you 
        have to kill to get a spot in the NToV rotation. It spawned, it died. 
        [Amulet of the Dreadgazer] Chiun, [Rocksmasher] Sparty(OC) [Reapers Ring] 
        Whosane(OC).<br>
        <br>
        This has secured our spot on the NToV rotation which is after BG/CoG and 
        currently due to start our week on March 19.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 25, 2003</strong><br>
        What a busy week we have had. Tonight once again we killed <strong>Vindi</strong> 
        [Chestplate of Vindication] Barelil, <strong>Idol</strong> and <strong>AoW</strong> 
        [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Teeni (OC), [War Bow of Rallos Zek] Klaminar/Jollander(OC) 
        with Obsidian Coven.<br>
        <br>
        After that we moved over to NToV for a few quick kills and got <strong>Eashen 
        of the Sky </strong> [Twisted Steel Gauntlets] Maxist, [Twisted Steel 
        Bastard Sword] Cmgal(OC). And <strong>Ikitar</strong> which was kind enough 
        to drop [Ancient Wyvern Leggings] Tigerstorm, [Cloak of Venom] Fenik.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 24, 2003</strong><br>
        Tonight we went to WToV and took out <strong>Gozzrem</strong> [Bracelet 
        of Protection] Klaminar, [Shovel of Harvest] Altus, [Rekelo's War Sword]. 
        After that we moved over and did an instapull to clear everything around 
        <strong>Lendiniara the Keeper</strong> [Truesight Helmet] Hawkien, [Velium 
        Maul of Superiority] Kitpoke, [Lendiniara's Talisman] Khallin.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 23, 2003</strong><br>
        Another successful raid with Obsidian Coven. Cleared fear in about 2 hours 
        and proceded to kill Cazic-Thule himself.<br>
        <strong>Cazic-Thule</strong>: [Brain of Cazic Thule] Xern (OC), [Halo 
        of the Enlightened] Gish, [Bile Etched Obsidian Choker] Bronx (OC)<br>
        <br>
        We then went over to Cazic-Thule and gave the Ring of Fear a try. For 
        those of you who haven't done this event, man it's fun. We learned a lot 
        killed mobs like <strong>Avatar of Dread</strong> [Dread Coronet] Polyneices, 
        and the <strong>Avatar of Fright</strong> [Mantle of Paralyzing Fright] 
        Teranick (OC). The <strong>Avatar of Terror</strong> got the best of us 
        however. But next time it will definitely be a different story...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 20, 2003</strong><br>
        After some talk with Obsidian Coven, The forces of CT and OC decided to 
        do a joint raid to see how things would work out. Man did it work out 
        well.<br>
        <br>
        On our first attempt ever and first time to team up, we went to Kael Drakkal. 
        <strong>Vindi</strong> died easily, and the <strong>Statue</strong> spawned 
        so we gave it a go. What a chump, he dropped fast. So we then went ahead 
        and killed the <strong>Idol</strong> and <strong>AoW</strong> spawned. 
        With around 65 people there few gave us a shot at taking out AoW but...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Avatar of War</strong> has been slain by Maxist!<br>
        <br>
        Congrats to all of the winners. [Chestplate of Vindication] Denor, [Sleepers 
        Tomb Key] Gish, [Swiftblade of Zek] Dakatsu, <strong>AoW</strong> loots: 
        [Blade of Carnage] Valstorm, [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Brewall, Congrats 
        to OC for the Cloak of Falling Stars, Iron Scroll of War, Hammer of Battle, 
        Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask, and Helmet of Rallos Zek.<br>
        <br>
        After that CT went over and killed <strong>Trakanon</strong> again and 
        got [Donal's Chestplate of Mourning] Ceeni, [Singing Steel Breastplate] 
        Brewall, and 4 teeth.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 19, 2003</strong><br>
        After a slight problem in Plane of Air going after the Warrior epic part. 
        Our forces ran over to West Temple of Veeshan to kill some dragons.<br>
        <strong>Gozzrem:</strong> 2x[Rekklo's War Sword] Tico/Dakatsu, [Bracelet 
        of Protection] Klaminar.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 17, 2003</strong><br>
        EQMaps has just posted 4 of Brewall's maps and 2 revised maps. These maps 
        have been available within the guild for quite some time and are just 
        now being released to everyone. As Brewall rises in PoP, more maps will 
        be created. Among the maps are:<br>
        *Plane of Storms (Map 1) <br>
        *Plane of Tranquility (Map 6) <br>
        *Plane of Justice (Map 2) <br>
        *Plane of Disease (Map 1) <br>
        *Plane of Knowledge (Map 5 redone) <br>
        *Tenebrous Mountains (Map 1 redone) <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 13, 2003</strong><br>
        Hey, anyone wanna kill a dragon? Sure, lets go kill Telkenor in WToV. 
        Flawless victory!<br>
        <strong>Telkenor:</strong> Neclace of Nightstalking [Czad], Pauldrons 
        of Blight [Stien]<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 12, 2003</strong><br>
        Veeshan's Peak falls to Crimson Talon! After two hard fought nights and 
        a few months of working on our strategy, Crimson Talon cleared all of 
        the dragons of Veeshan's Peak.<br>
        <br>
        Alot of hard work and effort has been put in by our members to get keyed 
        up. In all it took us two years or so to get our keys done and we still 
        have a few people still needing to finish their quest. Some guilds have 
        completed the Kunark expansion faster than we have, but most haven't done 
        VP at all! WTG Crimson Talon<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Nexona:</strong> Nightfall [Dreamthief], Sprinkler of Suffering 
        x2 [Aorthin, Bormer], Robe of Adversity [Fenik]<br>
        This completes our conquest of Veeshan's Peak and the Kunark expansion.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 11, 2003</strong><br>
        Veeshan's Peak was under heavy attack this evening by the forces of Crimson 
        Talon. Many dragons and their ilk fell to our swords and magics:<br>
        <strong>Hoshkar:</strong> Grey Suede Boots [Kuriosity], Sword of the Shissar 
        [Dreamthief], Shissar Protection Staff [Skylynn], Green Dragon Scales, 
        Emmissary of Thule<br>
        <strong>Phara Dar:</strong> Robe of Azure Sky[Zionmaster], Shield of Elders 
        [Tico]<br>
        <strong>Xygoz:</strong> Left Eye of Xygoz [Silvercaster], Razor Fang of 
        Xygoz / Frozen Zweihander [Valstorm], Torpor, Sunstrike<br>
        <strong>Druushk:</strong> Veridix's Swortsword [Klaminar], Sarnak Summoners 
        Staff [Fluteria], Maelstrom [Dodja], Sarnak Summoners Staff [Fluteria], 
        Skullcrusher of Kragg [Valstorm]<br>
        <br>
        Numerous excellent spell drops as well.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 08, 2003</strong><br>
        Toured the PoI factory today killing everything in our path. Our first 
        raid in this area and even with a minimal crew, we came away with a number 
        of very nice items: Cog Encrusted Epaulets [Aorthin], Double Wrapped Wide 
        Belt [Azenyth, Proetus], Polished Smoothmetal Torque [Dunskye], and Sharp 
        Ended Broken Lever [Greymask, Hattrick].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 04, 2003</strong><br>
        Returned to Veeshan's Peak tonight, but before we got there we killed

        Cloak of Flames - Romell<br>
        Red Dragonscale, 2 shields of the Red Dragon <br>
        <br>
        After entering VP we buffed up and started slaying dragons in what was 
        our best run in this zone to date.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>Jan 20, 2003</strong><br>
        Our first foray into North ToV, and we easily handled everything thrown 
        at us. At one point, we took on two flurry drakes and another mob at one 
        time with only a few deaths. Excellent guild turnout for this groundbreaking 
        event. We resisted the temptation to enter the Plane of Mischief, although 
        many of us took the chance to look at the tiny house. Drops were: Ikatiar's 
        Stinger [Yakkai], Ancient Wyvern Hide Boots [Chiun], Ancient Wyvern Hide 
        Legs [Proetus], and an Ancient Tarnished Bracer [Tico].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 17, 2003</strong><br>
        Once again we returned to Veeshan's Peak for a scheduled raid. <br>
        After gaining a few levels on us, Hoshkar finally decided to go to sleep.<br>
        Sword of the Shissar - Sabretta<br>
        Blade of Falling Stars - Alone<br>
        Grey Suede Boots - Physst<br>
        Robe of Burning Rage rotted.<br>

        <strong>Jan 15, 2003</strong><br>
        Light on tanks, Goratrix assembled a few groups to help protect the dwarf. 
        After having Groovit agro the dwarf on virtually every ambush and having 
        battle clerics tank the giants, we were able to finish the quest with 
        ease. Grats Goratrix on the shawl!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 11, 2003</strong><br>
        Another shawl quest this evening. Gish assembled a few groups to help 
        protect the dwarf and we were able to finish the quest with ease. Grats 
        Gish on the shawl!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 10, 2003</strong><br>
        With a few recent mini raids on PoS giants and the PoI dragon with folks 
        from SA, we decided to familiarize ourselves with one another a bit better. 
        What better way than to use the command that every guild leader has been 
        itching to try. Yes. Drumroll.... <strong>\GUILDWAR!</strong><br>
        <br>
        The forces of Crimson Talon will take to the battlefield against the forces 
        of Second Age. The clash will be in WC, EC, NRo, Oasis, and SRo. The war 
        will be judged based on confirmed kills and/or the death of the guild 
        leader. SA will defend SRo and CT will defend WC. Guild leaders will remain 
        in these zones.<br>
        <br>
        The war will be an entertaining event for all of us and should be an all-around 
        entertaining event. Win-or-lose, this Jan 16th should be an exciting time.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 09, 2003</strong><br>
        Went up to Hate this evening to bash Inny once again. Complete and utter 
        decimation is an understatement. Inny was killed so cleanly by our top-notch 
        raid force that we didn't lose a single person. Odd racial loots as usual, 
        but we also came away with an eye.<br>
        <br>
        Grats to Lumper for reaching 65!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 08, 2003</strong><br>
        Altus, our guild leader, was interviewed by Planet Everquest. Check out

        Quite a few nights working on trials, BoT keys, and experience. Lot of 
        things going on in the guild and nice to have everyone back from the holidays.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Jan 06, 2003</strong><br>
        Royal raid in Charok. This time to finish Lisner's epic. We summarily 
        killing the prince, king, and queen without breaking a sweat. Grats to 
        Lisner on completing his epic!<br>
        <br>

        A long overdue return to Hate to finish epics. This time, for Riverwake,

        epic collection and now has a Swiftwind and an Earthcaller! </span></p>
