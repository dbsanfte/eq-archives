        Nagafen </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: July 19 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
        Lord Nagafen felt the cold grip of death tonight as 
        a band of adventurers led by Brewall descended into his lair.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally scheduled for Wednesday, Lord Nagafen decided not to return 
        to his lair that night, and instead sent Ragefire. Perhaps the two got 
        into a time conflict and that is why Nagafen was late. In any case, he 
        had spawned by Thursday morning and needed to be slain.<br>
        <br>
        Large numbers of people were present and ready to join the raid. I appologize 
        again to anyone I turned away, but it is impossible to include everyone. 
        I tried to be as fair as possible picking people, and I do this by taking 
        everyone's name and then going through the list and prioritize people 
        who have been on a lot of raids and then necessary classes. I turned away 
        11 people in Sol B and even more as the raid progressed.&nbsp; The 11 
        people I turned away at the start were given an attendance point which 
        helps you get into future raids. Keep trying to get in and your persistance 
        will pay off, a lot of prior attendees level past 52 are are unable to 
        attend.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Collecting everyone's name takes a while. I never know who is going 
        to show up and I have to enter all this into my spreadsheet.<br>
        2. I take extra time and double-check level when epic items are at stake. 
        This is important for Paladins (50+ requirement for book) and Bards/Warriors 
        (50+ for red dragon scale).<br>
        3. Once names entered, takes little while to work out who is needed. I 
        work out all the groups and adjust if we are short in critical areas. 
        This means I might take a first-time shaman, enchanter, cleric, or druid 
        over a multi-attendee melee if we are short in these classes. It is exceedingly 
        rare that I ever turn away shm, enc, clr, and bards, since all help the 
        raid go faster and more successfully.<br>
        4. I don't lock the list until critical class mixture is met. If cannot 
        get these classes, I take additional people to compensate. So, the 36 
        number is ideal, but could be higher or lower based on what classes show.<br>
        <br>
        When in a temp group, find out if anyone in your group is new. Help them 
        along and answer their questions and tell them how raid generally works. 
        Saves them from sending me tells. Find out where they heard about raid 
        and if they have read loot rules and the dragon guide.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions, especially during giant 
        pulls. If you have never done a dragon, pay attention to those that have, 
        there is a reason for everything.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus and Dainin for coordinating the Giant pulling. 
        This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly appreciate 
        their efforts. And to all the buffers that evening as well: Khallin, Barelil, 
        Evelyn, Kauf, Lheal, Aorthin, Cilden, Tadyan, Svenia, Windarii, and Dunskye. 
        For all the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>

        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. If Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, Aprisle would 
        have #1, Aridican would have #2 and #3 on rolls).<br>

        <br>
        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: Ciladin = Cilden. Main is Paladin and rolls as a paladin, plays 
        enc alt during buffs (which helps enormously) and for Vox, does seiving. 
        Always rolls as a paladin, regardless of loot. He gives me option each 
        raid, but with lots of tanks and constant need for enc, I let him pick 
        how he would like to roll prior to fight.<br>
        Note 2: Talvar = Tadyan. Has clr and enc characters. Rolled as an enc 
        this raid.<b> <br>
        Note 2: Roll for Polished Mithril Torque is PAL, RNG, SHD only. </b>Mnk, 
        Brd, Rog could also use, but don't need wis/int, so are excluded.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job pushing Nag to back of room.<br>
        Thanks again go to all the clerics for doing the rezes and the porters 
        that took everyone out.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>

        <b>Bladestopper</b> - 10 won by Tularane<b><br>
        Saphire Necklace</b> - 4 won by Barelil<br>
        Also dropped: Sulfer (massive junk) and Enchanter page (junk)<br>
        <br>
        <b>OTHER LOOT</b><br>
        <b>Polished Mithril Torque</b> - won by Tico<br>
        <b>Mithril Greaves</b> - won by Tularane<br>

        <br>
        <b>OTHER NOTES</b><br>
        * I am awarding Windarii an extra point for taking time to shuttle at 
        least five times to get everyone out of lair. <br>
        * Next time, I will be more careful with buffers to specify their buffs. 
        Was missing a lot of regular buffers this fight and some groups got sub-optimal 
        buffing.<br>
