        Nagafen </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: July 11 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
        <span class="s2cA">Lord Nagafen felt the cold grip of death tonight as 
        a band of adventurers led by Brewall descended into his lair.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally scheduled for Saturday, VI's patch on Tuesday created another 
        opportunity for dragon killing. If it's patch day, chances are, Brewall 
        will be killing a dragon somewhere.<br>
        <br>
        Large numbers of people were present and ready to join the raid. I appologize 
        again to anyone I turned away, but it is impossible to include everyone. 
        I tried to be as fair as possible picking people, and I do this by taking 
        everyone's name and then going through the list and prioritize people 
        who have been on a lot of raids and then necessary classes. I turned away 
        13+ people before the fighting even started and even more later on as 
        people getting on later would send me tells.&nbsp; I do track those that 
        tried to attend and although you don't get a raid point, it does get factored 
        in when I pick people.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Collecting everyone's name takes a while. I never know who is going 
        to show up and I enter all this into my spreadsheet.<br>
        2. I take extra time and double-check level when epic items are at stake. 
        This is important for Paladins (50+ requirement for book) and Bards/Warriors 
        (50+ for red dragon scale).<br>
        3. Once names entered, takes little while to work out who is needed. I 
        work out all the groups and adjust if we are short in critical areas.<br>
        <br>
        When in a temp group, find out if anyone in your group is new. Help them 
        along and answer their questions and tell them how raid generally works. 
        Saves them from sending me tells.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions, especially during giant 
        pulls. If you have never done a dragon, pay attention to those that have, 
        there is a reason for everything.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus and Physst for tremendous job pulling the 
        Giants. This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly 
        appreciate their efforts. And to all the buffers that evening as well: 
        Khallin, Kauf, Galadriad, Greymask, Aprisle, Zulon, Cerritus, Loen, Ciladin, 
        Azenyth. For all the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>
        <br>
        Small note on this raid: Because I was so swamped with people at start 
        of raid, I sorted the 53+ buffers to bottom of spreadsheet to make it 
        easier for me to see people on the raid who I had not assigned to a group 
        (I use a column on my sheet called &quot;priority&quot;, when I collect 
        names, I assign a &quot;1&quot;, buffers are &quot;8&quot;, and final 
        attendeees are &quot;9&quot;. I use 2-7 as workspace to separate people 
        out as I do final list. Normally, I resort buffers back into the main 
        list of attendees prior to loot (changing the 8's to 9's), but forgot 
        to do it prior to loots. Buffers were included in on loots, just looked 
        funny that they were at bottom. I usually 'freeeze' the loot calculations 
        once I do final groups and do a few tests to verify that it is working 
        correctly. So, you will see the last person, Zulon, and then see the 53+ 
        buffers: Cerritus, Eolyn, Greymask, and Khallin. Should make sense if 
        look at &quot;Diamond&quot; numbers that was open roll. You can see all

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: Ciladin = Cilden. Main is Paladin and rolls as a paladin, plays 
        enc alt during buffs (which helps enormously) and for Vox, does seiving. 
        Always rolls as a paladin, regardless of loot. He gives me option each 
        raid, but with lots of tanks and constant need for enc, I let him pick 
        how he would like to roll prior to fight.<br>
        <b>Note 2: Roll for Polished Mithril Torque is PAL, RNG, SHD only. </b>Mnk, 
        Brd, Rog could also use, but don't need wis/int, so are excluded.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job pushing Nag to back of room<br>
        Thanks again go to all the clerics for doing the rezes and the porters 
        that took everyone out.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>Cloak of Flames</b> - 21 won by Altus (loses all points)<br>

        Also dropped: Jacinth (junk) and Words of Odus (junk)<br>
        <br>
        <b>OTHER LOOT</b><br>

        <br>
        <b>OTHER NOTES</b><br>
        * I am awarding Ixnus a point for showing up for raid and then stepping 
        out so that another paladin needing a Book could get a shot at it.<br>
        * I am awarding Nhadya a point for taking time to shuttle at least four 
        times to get everyone out of lair. <br>
        <b>* Gauntlet's of Firey Might</b> is specified in my raid rules as monk-only 
        roll. The item COULD be used by melees &amp; hybrids, but the 10ac makes 
        it inferior to virtually all Kunark, Plane, and even Solusek Ro quest 
        armours. The resists would be nice for dragons and special occasions, 
        but isn't an everyday item. For monks, it has decent AC compared to their 
        Kunark armour and it is 0.3wt. Therefore, for monks, this is an everyday 
        fantastic item, for everyone else, something that is either sold or put 
        in bank for special raids. I think my decision to do monk only is very 
        rational. If you can make a strong case how your class could use the item 
        just as well, please start a discussion on the bulletin board.</span><br>
