            Patch day moved from Tue to Wed, and the network outage today did not reset any dragons,
            so raids are pushed back one day.<br>
            Greymask spotted Tangrin (aka King Kong) over in Field of Bone and we quickly mobilized to
            take down the big ape. Greymask is now within four items of the enchanter epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 12, 2001</strong><br>
            Lady Vox kills now at a dozen. Must be some anti-raid leader code in the AI that moves the
            person shouting most to the top of the hate list, because at 30 percent, she decided to
            agro on Brewall (if anyone wonders why bards don't have Taunt skill - we don't need it!).
            Had to turn a number of people away, and interest in dragon killing is still high. I think
            this has to do with open nature of attendance and open loot rules. Last night, I counted
            people from over 20 guilds on the raid.<br>
            <br>
            Vox managed 1 CH, but she went down quickly after that. Drops were: Torbin's Mystical
            Eyepatch [Cilden], Crystalline Spear [Tegerien], Dragonbone Bracelet [Kuryl], and 2 Ice
            Comet [Jacestar, Olwe]. Now 12-0 versus Vox, 6-0 versus Naggy, and 1-0 versus Faydedar. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 11, 2001</strong><br>
            Lord Nagafen falls again. One of the longer raids to date due to shortage of casters at
            the start. Turned away quite a few people, but took more than usual since there were only
            2 clerics.&nbsp; Drops were: Cloak of Flames [Brewall], 2 Prayers of Life [Physst,
            Alquilas], Orb of Tishan [Jammen], Crown [Ardath], and Diamond [Ciladin]. Brewall led
            raids now 17-0 versus Nag&amp;Vox.</span><p><span class="s2cA"><strong>AUG 10, 2001</strong><br>
            Raided Seblis this evening based on information that the undead bard was up.
            Unfortunately, sometime between 4pm CST and 8pm CST, the undead bard despawned and the
            real Trakanon showed up. Shahmat came to help with the bard/epic spawned Trak, but it was
            all for naught with the real Trak up. Nothing like having a Trak raiding crew ready and
            the wrong Trak is up! Brewall will try for his epic another time when the Undead Bard is
            up. Appologies to Shahmat who were gracious enough to take their time to come to Seblis.
            &nbsp; Wound up laying waste to D1/Pickler/D2 wing. Drops were Tolan Bracer [Klaminar] and
            Seblis Scale Coat [Devaberiel].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 06-08, 2001</strong><br>
            Multi-day raid on Chardok.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 03, 2001</strong><br>
            Lady Vox was catching up on some late-night reading when the dragon slaying team swarmed
            into her lair last night. She finally graced us with a few books to make up for the
            absolute lack of drops recently. No enchanters were present at the raid to seive, so made
            due with bards singing mana drain.&nbsp; The plan worked perfectly, and Vox went down with
            not so much as a whisper.&nbsp; Loots were: 3 Frost books [Ixnus, Tularane, Rizzhogg] and
            Ice Comet [Infernostar]. 41 book points gone in one kill and thins out the numbers
            considerably for the other long-time paladin attendees.<br>
            <br>
            I appoligize to anyone that was turned away. It is difficult to get everyone into each
            raid with so much demand for dragon killing out there.<br>
            <br>
            Brewall led dragon raids now 17-0 (11-0 on Vox, 5-0 on Nagafen, and 1-0 on Faydedar).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 02, 2001</strong><br>
            Lord Nagafen falls for a fifth time to a Brewall led dragon raid. Interest in dragon raids
            remains high and at least 15 people were turned away. All those that did not make raid are
            given an attendance point to make it easier to get into future raids.<br>
            <br>
            EL cleared out the giants prior to the raid, dramatically shortening the total raid time.
            &nbsp; Lot of new buffers this evening and took a little bit to get all the kinks out.
            Excellent job pushing Nag to back of lair and grats to Tularane for the kill shot. &nbsp;
            Loots were: Cloak of Flames [Lumper], Gauntlets of Firey Might [Chiun], Treasure Hunters
            Satchel [Kirby], Orb of Tishan [Niewlut], Orb of Tishan [Brewall], Prayers of Life
            [Lisner], Fire Emerald Ring [Alianora], and a Diamond [Azumar].<br>
            <br>
            Brewall has also posted his Guide to Fear in the &quot;Raid Information&quot; section of
            the site. Please read it over and give feedback prior to our upcoming raid.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 31, 2001</strong><br>
            Two words, absolutely bizarre. Raided CoM this evening to get a few epic items. We
            believed someone ninja looted a jade reaver during our fight with the golems (petitioned a
            GM to investigate).&nbsp; Then, during the assault on Lord Rak'Ashiir with 4-5 fire pets
            and at 50% health, the pets pushed him into the water somehow. Rak'Ashiir vanishes along
            with a couple of the pets and continued to fight somewhere out of sight within the zone.
            Pets eventually die and Rak'Ashiir summons a couple people and just when are beginning to
            evac, he pops right in the middle of the raiding pary and kills a bunch of us with his
            2000AE dmg spell (petition again regarding the pathing and lost epic piece). Perform
            corpse recovery, but a couple summoned bodies are hopelessly stuck in walls (petition yet
            again). GM comes by after a while, gets corpses, ignores questions on ninja looter and
            Rak'Ashiir pathing. Instead, he decides he has nothing better to do than to change the
            name of a 57 wizard in our guild from &quot;Gooveit Allnight&quot; to
            &quot;Groovie&quot;!?! He would not respond as to what naming rule was violated. Grooveit
            has 7 days to get his name fixed, and hopefully, he can get his original name back.
            Absolutely bizarre, no resolution on ninja looter or the pathing problem and loss of epic
            piece. We have very rarely ever petitioned anything and this was a truely horrible
            experience.<br>
            <br>
            Numerous updates to all three dragon raiding guides. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 30, 2001</strong><br>
            Our rampage on the aristocracy of Kunark continues. Tonight's victim was Korocust, the
            prince of Chardok. Was our first large-scale guild raid on the dungeon and went off very
            well. Will definitely have to return and do another crawl of this often-empty dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 28-29, 2001</strong><br>
            Exp hunting time. Groups in Velk, Karnors, and few other spots. Numerous dings around the
            guild including Tomwin (56) and Greymask (54).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 27, 2001</strong><br>
            Killed Venril Sathir's remains early in the evening [Laurax]. Decided to move on to his
            undead wife and teach her a lesson in manners. Demolished her private guards one-by-one
            leaving Venril's wife to ponder her fate for a moment, until we dispatched her as well.
            Dropped Rod of Obulations (1hb 6/27 mana60 fr10 cr10) [Skylynn].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 26, 2001</strong><br>
            Raid on Howling Stones numerous spell drops and another haste belt. Tomwin claims to have
            overheard ds trash talking CT, going to have to show her a lesson.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 25, 2001</strong><br>
            Lady Vox met an untimely demise this evening to a determined group of dragon killers.
            Interest from melee/hybrids is higher than ever, but the lack of frost book drops (just 1
            in 10 raids), has clogged a lot of spots. There are currently 16 50+ paladins on the raids
            with 5+ prior raids. 12 of them are 52 and have been stuck at that level hoping for their
            epic book. On most raids, this basically fills 3 full tank groups (out of 5). I appologize
            to those that did not make the raid, but all were given an attendance point for coming.<br>
            <br>
            Vox was indeed in the hallway again, but the first two tank groups did an excellent job
            dislodging her. She did manage to get off 1 CH, but it did her little good.&nbsp; Was the
            first raid with 3 wizards, and the quick damage at the end was very impressive. Also
            thanks go out to those that stuck around to help recovery corpses from the pits. My
            advice: never fall in the one near buffing ramps, it leads into a room with 6 mobs. Read
            my Vox raiding guide, I clearly show all the pits...<br>
            <br>
            Drops were: McVaxious Horn of War [Ferdinand], Dragon Bone Bracelet [Sintosa], Ice Comet
            [Grimstaff], Kayrul's Mystical Pouch [Irrenne], and 2 Staff of Forbidden Rites [Sardaukar,
            Saltz].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 24, 2001</strong><br>
            Lord Nagafen's blood cools the lava streaming within his lair again tonight. He perished
            at the hands of an eager dragon hunting group. Unfortunately, many people had to be turned
            away again from the raid. I was able to work in all 4+ attendees and all 50+ pal/war/brd
            with epic items at stake.&nbsp; Raid was off to slow start with SL clearing the FG.
            Originally I was told that they were <u>just</u> after FG's, and since they had beaten us
            to them, I honored their attack. At the end, however, I was told they were really after
            Ragefire. Cost both us and them time waiting for respective mobs in the end. Instead of
            Nag being dead around the usual 9:30 cst, it wasn't until 11:30 cst that he was killed. If
            this happens again on a patch day, may either just push through or simply switch to Vox
            that night and hit Nag the next day without having to wait - this won't be popular for
            clerics wanting RF to spawn though. If this sounds like a flame, it is not intended to be
            one, I just have to have raids that move in and kill dragons as quickly as possible.
            Keeping a raid of 40+ attendees from 20+ guilds under control is no easy task, the longer
            it goes on, the more difficult it becomes. I lost almost 1 full group during the wait and
            was crushed with tells for an extra 2 hours because of this delay, making this one of my
            more physically exhausting raids ever. The inane comments from some of the people in SolB
            didn't help either, and insulting tells didn't endear me to some individuals who are now
            on my ignore list - hope you never want in on one of my future raids...<br>
            <br>
            Loots were: Orb of Tishan 2 [ Greymask, Kathandros], Blight Hammer [Sabore], Prayers of
            Life [Morgx], and 2 gems [Aalthur, Ardath].<br>
            <br>
            I suggest that Greymask go out and buy a lotto ticket today, use numbers 1, 3, and 13. On
            1st item roll, Greymask won Orb with roll of 3. Then, when rolling for gems, 13 came up -
            Greymask - can't win again. Roll over: 3 -Ardath wins. Roll again for next gem - 13 -
            Greymask again! Yet another rollover:&nbsp; 1 - Aalthur wins. The numbers 1 and 3 were
            strangely common - Believe it or not!<br>
            <br>
            Brewall dragon raids now 9-0 vs Vox, 4-0 vs Nag, and 1-0 vs Fay.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 23, 2001</strong> (report from Khallin / Brewall)<br>
            Great night all around. The evening started out with Greymask getting another enchanter
            epic item off shaman mob, and then moved on to Howling Stones, where the drops were
            incredible. Cleared several wings again tonight and among the drops were: 2! Sash of the
            Dragonborn (ac2 ~26% haste / FBSS is ~21%) [Madmat &amp; Dodja], Golden Bracer (ac5 str7
            int7) [Mysyn], Blood Point (prc 10/20 str5 cha-5 pr10 dr10) [Sventhal], Kylong War Helm
            (ac12 hp20 mana20 mr7 pr4) [Cerritus], Enshrouded Veil (ac7 wis2 int2 hp30 mana30 fr10)
            [Riverwake] and numerous spell drops. Tenara also gave the Mask of Obtenebration to
            Brewall from the prior night's HS raid (a 'fun' illusion item, but stats actually inferior
            to DE illusion mask most brd/rog get in their 20s). Tried out in WFP and was inspected no
            less than 6x in 5 minutes. Never seen an erudite bard :)<br>
            <br>
            Moved up Vox raid to Wed night. Might as well maximize kills and hope that VI has to patch
            again. Also frees up Fri-Sun for non-dragon raiding.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 22, 2001</strong><br>
            Lady Vox perishes in the frosty wastelands of Permafrost this evening. Unbelievable number
            of people present wanting to kill her, but only so many spots. Tried to accomodate 1 extra
            group over the 42 I normally do, but that wound up being a huge problem. At least 8 people
            went LD during the assault (including myself). Everyone has now seen what happens with too
            many people, so please be understanding if you don't make raid. I prioritize based on
            minimum classes needed: shm(2), brd(5-6), clr(4-5), enc(4), dru(2); and then
            raid+attendance points. Anyone not making list gets an attendance point which helps get
            into future raids.<br>
            <br>
            To date, <strong>250+ different people have attended my 12 dragon raids!</strong> These
            raids are truely the most open on the server (or any other server for that matter). With
            20+ different guilds on any given raid, I am looking at the people, not the 'tags'. If you
            are mad you didn't get on list, just think of time wasted trying to get a group for
            sometimes hours on end. I try to determine final list of raid people within 1 hour of
            start.<br>
            <br>
            For 45's - 50's melees, your odds of getting on raid is rather low right now. There is a
            backlog of people with 5+ raids still hoping to get items (some people have 10+ raids). As
            they win, they tend to float off (loot is still and always will be random). My advice:
            Show up to 1 raid, get an attendance point, and watch raid from zone-line to familiarize
            yourself with process. Then use time to get some good resistance gear and get a couple
            levels. If you come to a later raid saying you are 49 with unbuffed cold/fire resistance
            at 130+, witnessed a couple raids in past, and have at least 1 attendance point, you are
            in pretty good shape. This is better than just coming to each raid getting attendance
            points.<br>
            <br>
            Drops were: RBB [Ciladin], Eyepatch [Milennia], Hammer [Irrenne], and DBB [Cowabunga won,
            but donated to Punchen]. Grats to all.<br>

            Going to send a note to VI asking if 1 book in 9 kills is an acceptable drop rate for an

            <br>
            Trojar, don't come to any future dragon raids I host or any other CT raid for that matter.
            This was your first dragon raid and when you didn't make the list, spamming me &amp; the
            zone with cursing was unacceptable. I included anyone on this raid with 1+ prior
            attendance, an extremely open raid.<br>

            Lord Nagafen falls again to a determined group of adventurers seeking to slay the foul
            fire wyrm. Attendance and interest was very high and many people were turned away.
            Excellent job by all listening to instructions on the fire giants and during the dragon
            battle. Drops were: Red Dragon Scale (2) [Brewall, Ralio], Selo's Drum (2) [Ferdinand,

            Polished Mithril Torque [Tico], Mithril Greaves [Tularane], and Rokyl Channeling Crystal
            [Tadyan]. Paladins need to clease their karma and do good deeds, book drops have been

            his eigth successful raid against her (10-0 now versus Vox &amp; Nag). Once again, all
            items were open rolls with no reserved items. Had near catastrophe at start when Vox
            wedged herself near the opening rock. Took almost a minute to free her from the spot and
            get her into the lair.&nbsp; With just one enchanter, she was able to get off no less than
            2 complete heals, but died neverless. Drops were: Crystalline Spear [Borq], Staff of

            McVaxious Horn of War [Brewall (on the \random 1 5, I rolled a 1. Note that I had same

            the NE corner. Successfully cleared the entire NE side of zone without a major

            the coming days. An incredible number of people showed up, and regretfully, some had to be
            turned away. The foul beast died quickly at the hands of the well-prepared group. His

            with Ciladin/Cilden, but he always rolls as a paladin, his enc alt helps with buffs (or

            Comet [Guldaenya], and a rune (junk). Ice Comets were open rolls, as no wizards were
            present on the raid. Perhaps the most annoying factor that night were number of people
            that did not have peridots or any platinum to pay for peridots.&nbsp; In the future, if

            [Grenack], and a Heirophant's Crook. Amazingly enough, Ragefire spawned within an hour of
            Naggy's death. Biggest problem was that many in the raiding party still recovering from
            rez effects and were killed by trains brought by people rushing to kill Ragefire. I
            realize it can be a race to kill him, but would be nice for guilds to shout that they will
            get rezes resulting from the trains and who to send names to.&nbsp; Liked some of the buff
            techniques and will be making some tweaks to my process. Next Vox will have 2 buff

            Agreement with Bloods Guard to rotate on Vox spawns. They took Vox Thu Jun 7, and
            Brewall's open raid will hit her on Sat Jun 16. From there, it will alternate between the
            BG closed raids &amp; CT open raids. In the event of a patch, the guild with next spawn
            has 2 days to kill her, otherwise, that spawn is FFA and the rotation resumes as normal
            upon her death. Both raid leaders will share information regarding time of death &amp;
            warn of any respawn. Goal for both raids is to maximize kills. BG will also not be killing
            Naggy Wed/Thu next week leaving it open. Ixnus of Jedi Praxum is leading this raid (signup
            on Everquestraids) and Brewall will assist Ixnus in any way possible (but is not leading
            raid nor is raid using Brewall's raid points). An organized dragon schedule is a lot more
            preferable than a FFA system that can lead to a lot of fighting and one-upmanship by
            guilds &amp; players. CT is made up of ex-big guild players seeking to avoid this type of

            unlike guilds, I'm at a disadvantage of having to advertise intentions. Definitely some
            competion now, so dates may fluctuate (or raids missed due to someone else killing). Most
            raids seem to be done by twinks of bigger guilds that want mobs dead:Naggy for Ragefire.

            Bolster Belt [Tico], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Lazuli], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Scoff],
            and Ice Comet [Aridican]. Loot rules were changed to reflect status change of WDS (all
            four bards from original raid have won), bards will have higher odds, but casters are now
            in on roll. High level bards may offer a cloak for trade if caster wins and if same or
            better than a WDSC, I will enforce the trade.<br>

            Grr. Emergency patch on Thursday. Should have scheduled Vox raid 4 on Wed and then hoped
            for another patch, three kills in three days would have been really nice (although 2 in 4
            isn't bad either). Will try to plan more around this in future.<br>

            Raid on Kedge last night, but Phin had been killed earlier in the day. Tomwin managed to
            get a piece for epic off the Corrupted Seahorses. Get ready for some upcoming raids on CoM
            and to get more Seblis keys.<br>
            <br>
            Also clarified some areas of Vox rules &amp; raid points that I got some feedback on. One
            change I made in how raid leader can use points on items that normally only use 1 number
            (that they can use). I tried to balance my motivation of hosting raids versus
            excluding/limiting new people that could potentially compete for the item. Think this
            strikes a good balance and still avoids the trump card of reserving items.<br>

            Vox is killed yet again on Tuesday night. Amazed that the word has gotten out, and I was
            shocked at how many people showed up. Once again, pick-up groups of random people can
            prevail against the beast if they are well organized. Were it not for the pit mobs, the
            fight would have been much easier (why people don't listen to instructions is beyond
            me-stay there and die!). This would have been certain failure for a smaller raiding party,
            but neverless, we prevailed. Brewall raids are now 3-0 against the beast, and although no
            paladin books have dropped (0 on 3 kills), three bards have a WDS necessary for epic
            quest. See links above for full write-up and raid points.<br>

            Decided to take on the Kael Drakkal arena tonight, and killed many guards, spectators, and
            a number of named mobs. Drops were fairly sparce, but very nice: Gladiator's Chain
            Leggings (lore no-drop ac17 str2 cha4 wis6 hp20 mr10 0.0wt
            war/clr/pal/rng/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm all) [Savardar] and a Gladiator's Chain Sleeves (lore

            Big guild news today, the Halcyon Coherence guild has merged with Crimson Talon. &nbsp;
            This finalizes the alliance between the guilds and the numerous raids we have conducted
            together. All the people I know from HC have been great players, and I know I'm not the
            only one to say welcome. With current guild size, we can definitely go after some bigger
            raids.<br>
            <br>
            <b>MAY 23, 2001</b><br>
            We were assembling at the Hole and noticed that several other groups were planning on
            raiding the zone as well. We decided to form a small army and Altus lead us on a crawl
            through the dungeon. Other groups were excellent companions and payed close attention to
            Altus's instructions. We laid waste to all that we encountered (screenshots in
            scrapbook).&nbsp; Among the drops were: Imbued Granite Spaulders (ac20 resists10 wt19.4)
            [Brewall], Ranger Epic Piece [Rutgereos-his last piece! congrats!], Shaman Epic Piece
            [Khallin], Enchanter Epic Piece [Greymask, Zhyr, Mysyn, and Saleel], and Loam Encrusted
            Lined Shoes (ac4 agi8 cha8 dex8 mana15 pr10 0.4wt) [Greymask].&nbsp; I'm certain we will
            returrn again soon to help the other shaman's who were with us that needed their epic
            items. <br>

            <b>MAY 20, 2001</b><br>
            Vox dies again at the hands of Crimson Talon, allies, and comrades- in-arms. A hearty
            group of adventurers braved the cold of Permafrost Keep and dispatched Lady Vox. Drops
            were: Dragon Bone Bracer [Ciladin], Dragon Bone Bracer [Riverwake], Pouch [Brewall], Horn
            [Ensis], and Eyepatch [Aprisle]. Perhaps next time, Vox will grace us with books &amp;
            scales (she is overdue on those books). Congrats to Chadmoe for kill shot. Special thanks
            to all buffers and Atlus for pulling. Full write-up of event, loot numbers, and raid
            points, can be found on links in section above.<br>

            Vox was definitely scared of the dragon hunting party that assembled outside her lair last
            night. Already overdue for a spawn (last kill was Fri at 10:31pm EST), with 7 days +
            random 24 hours expired, she should have been up. By midnight CST, Brewall called the raid
            off.&nbsp; By 7am CST she had spawned in her lair and was waiting to be killed. &nbsp; All
            attendees were credited with 1 raid point and will try again on Sunday at 10pm EST. It
            appears that the spawn time is a random 7-10 days after death.<br>

            If anyone was looking to complete a quest in Kael Drakkal last night, they were out of
            luck. Crimson Talon decided to set up residence inside the quest givers area and proceeded
            to take out all the giants. Lots of unusual and different items dropped: Silver Dragon
            Tattoo (ac2 str4 wis4) [Skylynn], Helm, Greaves, Axe, Dragonhide Belt (ac6 sta10 wt0.0),
            and a Mask of Malediction (wis-4 int+5 mana+10 fr-5 cr-5 wt 0.2). <br>

            <b>MAY 16, 2001</b><br>
            HS raid on north wing to restock some keys. A nice little raid in an empty dungeon. Only
            odd thing of the evening was a bug that caused Altus to get stuck in a wall. At least we
            now know that safe-spot for corpses is at zone in. Numerous spell drops were collected and
            added to guild vault.<br>
            Also, be sure to welcome Malvado to the guild.<br>

            Raid on the Hole. Definitely getting better at hunting in here, and we were able to make
            it further back than ever before. Several loam pieces dropped and were divided out.<br>
            <br>

            A glorious day for the Crimson Talon on two fronts. Lotera got help from the Divine
            Alliance and is now the proud owner of the rogue epic &quot;Ragebringer&quot;. I don't
            have any screenshots, but as soon as I get some in, I'll post on the site.<br>
            <br>
            While Lot was killing in Kithicor, Brewall led a successful raid against Lady Vox herself,
            and the first time she has been slain in several months.&nbsp; Although he did not win a
            coveted white dragon scale (a victim of his own idealistic open looting rules). A full
            write-up on the raid, attendees, and loot numbers can be found with this <a href="raidvox20010511.htm">link</a>. I only managed to take one screenshot of the event;
            with an electrical storm outside my house, a dead cable-modem, and a 42k connection, I was
            paranoid of lagging out. I'll post more shots if people send them in.<br>

            Phinigel Autropos met an untimely death this evening at the hands of Crimson Talon and
            other alliance members. Expert pulling by the monks brought him to us solo, where he went
            down with a muted gurgle. Loots were Robe of the Kedge [Lotera], Blue Crystal Staff
            [Grooveit], Wand of Mana Tapping [Jarheuu], and a second Wand of Mana Tapping [Greymask].
            The MT wands will come into great use against Vox.<br>
            <br>
            Lotera is extremely close on finishing the Rogue epic, and needs just one more mob - the
            general in Kithicor. Details and a guide for the raid on Sat May 12 can be found on the
            message board.<br>

            Sphiffy is looking for some help in Permafrost for some items needed for the warrior epic.
            Let's all plan to hunt there on Thursday night (prior to Vox raid on Fri) and get Sphiffy
            his items. Could also camp the weight reduction BP while we are there and stock up on some
            CR bracers.<br>

            Howling Stones proves again to be worth the effort of getting the keys. Among the drops
            were numerous spells (see Guild Stash in message board area) and a Sash of the Dragon Born
            (ac2 0.1wt 22% haste. fyi- FBSS is 17%) [Lotera won roll].<br>

            Dead frogs everywhere. The froglok hunter and forager died so many times, it was difficult
            to not step on one of their corpses.&nbsp; Other named spawns appeared as well, including
            Sigra who was nice enough to drop a Silken Cat-Fur Girdle (ac5 str9 dex13 wt1.5 all/all)
            [Brewall won roll]. Everyone in guild should now have keys to Seblis.<br>

            Another successful Howling Stones raid last night, as the guild conquered the South wing
            from start to finish. Numerous spell drops, several pieces of kylong armour, and a veil
            [Madmat won roll] dropped. Tomorrow night (May 01), the guild will hunt the named spawns
            in Trakanon for key pieces and other items.<br>
            <br>
            <b>April 29, 2001</b><br>
            The guild raided Howling stones last night and obtained a haste sash from the Crypt
            Spectre. Altus is its new proud owner and has gratiously passed down his FBSS. &nbsp; We
            return again tonight to this excellent, and often empty, dungeon.<br>

            The guild decided to raid Kedge with Halcyon Conherence.&nbsp; Phiny was away on business
            yet again, but was excellent practice for kedge-newbies. Excellent pulling by the monks
            spaced out the guardians perfectly, and had Phin been up, he would be swimming with the
            fishes.<br>

            <b>April 22, 2001</b><br>
            The Talon decided to raid Kedge on Sunday and made its way to Phiny's Lair. Although the
            master of the seas was away, the guild claimed many of his henchmen as victims.&nbsp; At
            the end of the raid, we decided to take out the shark Cauldronboil and got a nice Sharkjaw
            Cutlass (Tomwin won roll).<br>

            Time to start making out your wishlists! One of the greatest advantages to belonging to a
            guild is working together to get equipment.&nbsp; Pooling our resources and hunts, we may
            be able to help out multiple people in the same raid.&nbsp; My suggestion is that everyone
            go to <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">everquest.allakhazam.com</a>, register
            your character, enter all your equipment, and then use the upgrader option to find better
            stuff.&nbsp; This is an incredible tool, just remember that some dungeons/mobs are too
            difficult for us right now (dragon necropolis). Put your list together and post in the
            message board.<br>
