            <span class="s2cA"><b>LADY VOX IS DEAD</b><br>
            <br>
            Vox dies yet a fourth time at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers who
            joined us in battle.&nbsp; Interest in the raids is very high, until Brewall started
            raiding her, she had not gone down for several months, and the attendees were in blood
            lust.&nbsp; The last four Brewall led raids have eased the oppression of this cruel dragon
            over the lands of Everfrost, as well as, liberated even more of her property.<br>
            <br>
            Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at how many people
            showed up early. My brother, Greymask, called me just as I got home to tell me that there
            were 36+ people there - 1.5 hours before the raid! Quite a difference from two weeks ago
            when I had cobbled together just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of
            people are showing up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit
            attendance otherwise things are out of control, people start getting immature, and people
            don't listen to my instructions.</span><p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Thanks to Syncere
            for collecting names until I got on, next time, I will try to get on earlier (if I can get
            out of work quick enough). Thanks also go out to Altus for pulling the guards and the
            corpses at the end of the battle. In recognition of his selfless and humble efforts, I am
            crediting him some additional raid points.<br>
            <br>
            Biggest issue this time was Vox's proximity to the rock entrance. It was so close to the
            buff area that 53+ buffers were in her agro range and were getting expelled. The last part
            of the buffing was certainly a pain and took a little longer than normal, but the buffs
            were worth it.<br>
            <br>
            The two line buffing worked out well again. People are really getting the hang of it. With
            only 2 shamans and no 52+ clerics, I had to get inventive with the buff lines, but still
            worked out very well.<br>
            <br>
            Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle of room was
            very well executed. She did get off 1 CH during the fight, but it was a losing battle for
            her.<br>
            <br>
            Special thanks go out to Altus and Physst for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's guards.
            This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly appreciate their
            efforts. And to the buffers that evening as well: Sileguy, Loen, Bolgor, Syncere,
            Cerritus, Khallin, Mysyn, Saleel, Lazuli, Sevenswords, Larea, and Mandragorans. For all
            the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>

            <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
            Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the loot numbers next
            to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone can see which random number(s) they
            had for each item. Gaps in the numbers reflect raid points, and the number listed is the
            max number that person has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle
            had #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

            Note 1: Lazuli gave me choice at start of fight for which char, and I chose Enc, allowed
            to roll on alt's class. Saleel also gave me choice at start of fight for which char, and I
            chose Enc, allowed to roll on alt's class. Both declared class roll preference before the
            fight.<br>
            Note 2: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, final. All raid
            points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. I still like raid points and
            think they are a lot more democratic than other raids that give items to the 'most
            deserving' person (usually the level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random
            and attending more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
            <b><br>
            THE KILL</b><br>
            Vox did manage to get off 1 Complete Heal's during the fight, but went down neverless.
            Kept her off walls, but pit mobs was very sloppy and would have easily killed a smaller
            raiding party.<br>
            Congrats to Immolar for the kill shot<br>
            Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the fight and to all
            the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
            Vox was dead by 11pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:20.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
            <b>White Dragon Scale</b> - won by Brewall - since multiple scales dropped, got 1
            automatically (better than just closing out all the other bards that still needed one to
            get 100% of the numbers....).<br>
            <b>White Dragon Scale</b> - won by Cris<br>
            <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Scoff - use it exclusively for those plane
            raids!!!<br>
            <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Lazuli - give to FD class on your raids :)<br>
            <b>Runed Bolster Belt</b> - won by Tico<br>
            <b>Ice Comet Spell</b> - won by Aridican<br>
            4PP &amp; No Gems - Not exactly D&amp;D level here.<br>
            <br>
            <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
            1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap at 40, and keep a few spots open
            for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people no, but going to have to do it.
            Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 4 kills in 2 weeks and the word has gotten out
            that my raids work.<br>
            2. Lag last night was killing a lot of my canned socials (over 40), so will be redoing
            them again. Looked fine on my computer, but people were telling me that some were getting
            dropped.<br>
            3. Will kick &quot;BOOK DROP&quot; button. Vox 0-4 on book drops and I'm really feeling
            sorry for paladins. Vox should drop one every time in my opinion.<br>
            4. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ everyone should
            be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good habit to get into, if you accept
            less from guildmates/friends, that is your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp
            in peridots for those that don't carry them.<br>

            5. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open up once the
            original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping last night and did not have
            my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. On the next raid, the WDS will be open to
            casters with the following conditions:<br>
            -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing bards.<br>
            -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply each bard's
            raid points by a factor of X (will work on this week to come up with factor). I will
            target the factor so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 50% of
            the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of winning, otherwise a
            caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are continuing to attend with hopes of
            getting other dragon items, so it may be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.<br>
