        &amp; 53+ Bards</span><br>
        <em>Last update: 22 August 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
        <strong>THE WHITE DRAGON SCALES</strong><br>
        The White Dragon Scale is without a doubt the most difficult item to obtain 
        in the bard epic quest. A bard with it, is virtually assured of an epic 
        someday, a bard without, is still very far away from completion.&nbsp; 
        Bards are stuck in that the only two sources of the scale are Lady Vox 
        (for 52- bards) and Gorenaire. Gore is exceedingly difficult to kill, 
        and to do so requires an army of almost 50 level 58-60 players. Needless 
        to say, she rarely dies.&nbsp; Therefore, 53+ bards without a white scale 
        are in a horrible position. &nbsp; To help address this problem, I have 
        opened some options for 53+ bards to obtain the scales without having 
        to pay 100k+. The last offer I saw 3 weeks ago on Cazic-Thule was 140k...<br>
        <br>
        The White Dragon Scale cloak is a nice item, but there are definitely 
        better cloaks and back items in the game. The Heirophant cloak (rare drop 
        in Seblis) is extremely close, if not better. The bard epic, is without 
        a doubt, the most uber item a bard could ever get and has no equal.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FOR STARTERS, HOW LOOT IS DONE:</strong><br>
        No loot items on my raids is guaranteed or reserved, including for myself 
        (and I'm the host). Because of my open loot rules three other bards won 
        a WDS prior to myself, open loots can be aggravating at times, but the 
        ability for anyone to win anything, including first time attendees, makes 
        my raids very popular. Every time someone attends one of my dragon raids, 
        they are given a raid point, which helps their odds on nice items (RBB, 
        CoF, books, scales, &amp; eyepatch).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOW WDS IS DONE:</strong><br>
        When people report in for the raid, I enter all the names into a spreadsheet 
        that tracks everyone's attendance, does groups, and calculates loot numbers. 
        Everyone's name is listed alphabetically. For some items (e.g. Pouch), 
        everyone gets one number, I do a &quot;\random 1 N&quot; look up the correponding 
        name, and that person wins the item. Good items, like the WDS, are based 
        on 1 number + raid points (from prior attendance). &nbsp; The WDS is open 
        to bards and casters on a random roll when loot is divided out. Bards 
        (52-) on the raid get (1 + raidpoints)x3 numbers and casters get (1+raidpoints) 
        for numbers. Just for information, the rolls used to be bard-only, until 
        5 bards had won scales, and then was opened to casters.<br>
        <br>
        In the event that a caster wins the WDS and if a 53+ bard is present with 
        a White Dragonscale Cloak, Heirophant Cloak or better, I force a trade. 
        The cloak is given to me, I will give the WDS, and then give the cloak 
        to the caster.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>I'M NOT AT RAID, DO I STILL GET A CHANCE?</strong><br>
        Yes, but you need to do both of the following: (1) attend just 1 of the 
        dragon raids so people get chance to meet you (2) tell me that you want 
        on the list of bards wishing to make a trade.&nbsp; On any future raid, 
        if you are on-line during the buff stage of the raid (when I actually 
        have free time), I will send you a tell seeing if you are still interested. 
        &nbsp; Everyone who is on-line and interested, is given a chance in the 
        roll. You must be prepared to come to west commons on a moment's notice 
        if you win.&nbsp; A large percentage of my raid attendees are not from 
        my guild and I want to make a quick exchange.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE MY ODDS?</strong><br>
        Nothing.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>53 BARDS</strong><br>
        If you just dinged into 53, have no cloak to trade, you can still win 
        a WDS, by attending the raid, helping to clear, and singing mana song. 
        If your resists are needed, you may be asked to delevel in order to keep 
        yourself in on the main open roll.&nbsp; If there are plenty of people, 
        you may get to keep level and still be in the main open roll. This is 
        done on a case-by-case basis and only offered to bards that have come 
        up through the raids with more than 10 prior attendances. I stongly urge 
        these bards not to get far into 53. If you are 53+, you are not elligible 
        for any item other than the WDS. If you still need instruments or want 
        to win something else, stick to 52. I'll stress this again: stick to 52.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>WORDS OF WARNING</strong><br>
        Please do not try to bribe 53- bards from my raids that won scales. If 
        I hear of them selling the scale, they will never receive another potentially 
        sellable item from one of my raids again - ever. There are a lot of snitches 
        out there, and if I hear of a sale, I will check with that person to ensure 
        that the scale was not sold, if it was sold, they will go on my blacklist. 
        I realize everyone wants an epic as quickly as possible, but I've been 
        at 52 for over 5 months now working on white scales while many others 
        decided to pass up on Vox and to level instead. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>ANY IDEA HOW LONG THIS COULD TAKE?</strong> <br>
        Hard to say. Vox has been stingy of late with scales. 0 in the past 4 
        raids. On 13 raids, she has dropped 8 so far, all of which have gotten 
        into bard hands. Seems to be multiples or none most of the time. I am 
        currently the only one raiding her, and have killed her within a day of 
        all of her spawns.<br>
