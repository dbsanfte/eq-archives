      <strong>NOV 20, 2002</strong><br>
      The dentist's of Crimson Talon paid a visit to Seblis for a tooth extraction 
      this evening. Trakanon was complaining about a tooth ache and our perscription 
      was death and subsequent removal of his teeth. Virtually everyone in the 
      guild has completed their VP key now and the few remaining people are in 
      the final steps.<br>
      <br>
      After Seblis, we made our way to Chardok to pay the royals a visit. We hastily 
      made our way through the dungeon and slayed the prince, king, and queen 
      in short order. Excellent job by everyone on the fighting! A few turn-ins 
      later, Hattrick finished his enchanter epic! Ciene is also now just a few 
      shards away from a cleric epic as well.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 19, 2002</strong><br>
      Killed Gozzrem in West ToV again this evening and then moved on to the Halls 
      of Testing for a little bit.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 18, 2002</strong><br>
      Another foray into Veeshan's Peak. Stayed near the entrance with minimal 
      number of people for chances at some rare spells. Once more have keys, we 
      will be attempting penetrations much deeper into this dungeon.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 17, 2002</strong><br>
      Grats to Saille for reaching 60!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 16, 2002</strong><br>
      An impromtu raid on Fear this evening to help Tico finish his epic for his 
      fiery defender. Grats to Tico!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 14, 2002</strong><br>
      Raid on West ToV again to slay both Gozzrem and Telkorenar. Some nice drops: 
      Bracelet of Protection [Groovit], 2 Circlets of Silver Skies [Imotep, Greymask], 
      2 True Mithril Breastplates [Sabretta, Devaberiel], and a Pauldrons of Blight 
      [Maxist]. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 12, 2002</strong><br>
      Kael raid on Vindicator this evening and we easily slayed him with a minimal 
      crew. Unlike other guilds that kill with sheer numbers or uber gear, we 
      are able to accomplish tasks with teamwork and tactics. We obtained our 
      first Sleeper's Tomb key in addition to a few other nice items. Definitely 
      starting to move up the scale in boss mobs.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 11, 2002</strong><br>
      Raid on ToV yielded some nice items this evening. At one stage, we killed 
      three dragons at one time just for fun. Drops were: Tattered Silk Robe [Goratrix], 
      Leather Bracer [Ippit], Plate Bracer [Zypheal], Plate Boots [Stein], Silk 
      Bracer [Silvercaster], and Plate Gauntlets [Romell]. Killed Dozekar, which 
      resulted in two tears; Emerald Tear [Wildfern] and Runed Tear [Ceeni].<br>
      <br>
      Grats to Zionmaster for reaching 65<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 08, 2002</strong><br>
      Grats to Groovit for reaching 65<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 06, 2002</strong><br>
      Killed in West ToV this evening and killed numerous mobs, most notably Gozzrem 
      and Telkenor. Loots were: Bracelet of Protection [Tomwin], Circlet of Silver 
      Skies [Naladins], Shovel of the Harvest [Hawkien], Emerald Bastardsword 
      of Purity [Khandrahcir], and a True Mithril Breastplate [Machedor].<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 03, 2002</strong><br>
      Grats to Yakkai for reaching 60<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 02, 2002</strong><br>
      Grats to Cieni for reaching 60<br>
      <br>
      <strong>NOV 01, 2002</strong><br>
      Numerous groups continuing to explore in PoP and attempt the trials in the 
      Plane of Justice.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>OCT 29, 2002</strong><br>
      Brewall has published high-quality maps of PoK, PoT, and PoD within the 
      guild over the past week. Many of Brewall's maps have appeared on eqmaps.com, 
      and these are arguably better than any prior work. Within a few weeks, these 
      will be published to the general public.</p> 
      <p><strong>OCT 28, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to Veeshan's Peak this evening to obtain spells. Grats to Barelil 
        for obtaining Torpor! We also killed Silverwing for some other nice loots.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 27, 2002</strong><br>
        Fear was completely populated and we decided to clear the zone for some 
        epic mobs. Cazic-Thule was up as well, and we made our first attempt on 
        him - and won flawlessly. Among the loots this evening were: Tarrask (epic 
        item), Chantress (robe), Humm (enc epic item), Zypheal (sk epic item).</p>
      <p>Grats to Zypheal for completing the enchanter epic!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 23, 2002</strong><br>
        Dragon trifecta. Started the night out with Trakanon for some teeth and 
        it was a tactically flawless kill without a single death. Then, we realized 
        Gore was up. Even with the manaburn change we were able to kill her with 
        minimal forces without a death. Then, rumors abound that Talendor was 
        up. We moved over to Skyfire, and found him roaming about the zone. A 
        few quick buffs and long pull later, he met his demise as well. 3 dragon 
        kills in one evening for a dragon trifecta. Numerous drops: runed bolster 
        belt [Stein], WDS Hide [Lumadin], Shield of the White Dragon [Sanalorn], 
        Red Dragon Scale, Orb of Tishan, Gauntlets of Firey Might, 6 Spells.</p>
      <p>Grats to Hawkien for completing the paladin epic!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 19, 2002</strong><br>
        A few groups returned to VP this evening for experience, refining tactics, 
        and obtain more spells.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 18, 2002</strong><br>
        Entry into Veeshan's Peak. We have worked hard to finish a large number 
        of keys for VP, and we put them all to use for the first time this evening. 
        Almost 30 of us entered the zone and we proceeded to learn and experiment 
        within the zone. Overall, we had an enormous amount of fun doing something 
        new and reaching this guild milestone. In addition to our information 
        building, we managed to kill Silverwing and came away with some decent 
        drops this evening: Scimitar of Lifestealing [Maxist], Robe of Smothering 
        [Greymask], Hammer of Dragonborn [Khallin], Voice of the Berserker [Barelil], 
        Word of Redemption [Aorthin], Sunstrike, Lure of Ice, Malo, Mala and a 
        few other items. A great time was had by everyone.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 16, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Wildfern on obtaining ranger epic!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 15, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Trakanon again this evening for 3 more teeth.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 14, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Hattrick for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 13, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Machedor for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 12, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed the dragonfish this evening for Saille to complete her druid epic!</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 11, 2002</strong><br>
        Maemura now has matching ranger epic blades.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 09, 2002</strong><br>
        Another big HoT raid and we came away with nice drops: Plate BP [Brewall], 
        Plate Boots [Devaberiel], Plate Greaves [Devaberiel], Plate Bracer [Lumper], 
        Plate Helm [Kellethia], Leather Bracer [Polyneices], Glowing Orb [Jheball], 
        and a few other drops. After the raid, we killed Escorpa outside, but 
        only dropped a medallion [Denor] and an unusable no-drop quest item.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 06, 2002</strong><br>
        Small groups doing experience and a few others in Kael doing the cycle 
        again.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 05, 2002</strong><br>
        Multi-hour raid in the Hall's of Testing netting many upgrades. After 
        the HoT raiding, a couple groups did the Kael plate cycle and came away 
        with some nice drops including a BP.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 04, 2002</strong><br>
        Caught Trakanon again in his lair and dispatched him quickly. Excellent 
        execution and tactics and we were not dissapointed with seeing 5 teeth.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 02, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Azenyth for reaching 60!</p>
      <p>Large raid on the Hole for epic mobs and quest mobs. Afterwards, a few 
        groups went up to Hate and cleared it for quest items.</p>
      <p><strong>OCT 01, 2002</strong><br>
        Big horse in Umbral went down this evening. First attempt and killing 
        him and went down easily.</p>
