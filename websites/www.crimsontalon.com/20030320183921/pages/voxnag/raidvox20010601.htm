        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: June 01 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies yet a fourth time at the hands of Crimson 
        Talon and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle. Interest 
        in the raids is very high, until Brewall started raiding her, she had 
        not gone down for several months, and the attendees were in blood lust. 
        The last four Brewall led raids have eased the oppression of this cruel 
        dragon over the lands of Everfrost, as well as, liberated even more of 
        her property.<br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at 
        how many people showed up early. My brother, Greymask, called me just 
        as I got home to tell me that there were 36+ people there - 1.5 hours 
        before the raid! Quite a difference from two weeks ago when I had cobbled 
        together just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people 
        are showing up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to 
        limit attendance otherwise things are out of control, people start getting 
        immature, and people don't listen to my instructions.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Syncere for collecting names until I got on, next 
        time, I will try to get on earlier (if I can get out of work quick enough). 
        Thanks also go out to Altus for pulling the guards and the corpses at 
        the end of the battle. In recognition of his selfless and humble efforts, 
        I am crediting him some additional raid points.<br>
        <br>
        Biggest issue this time was Vox's proximity to the rock entrance. It was 
        so close to the buff area that 53+ buffers were in her agro range and 
        were getting expelled. The last part of the buffing was certainly a pain 
        and took a little longer than normal, but the buffs were worth it.<br>
        <br>
        The two line buffing worked out well again. People are really getting 
        the hang of it. With only 2 shamans and no 52+ clerics, I had to get inventive 
        with the buff lines, but still worked out very well.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle 
        of room was very well executed. She did get off 1 CH during the fight, 
        but it was a losing battle for her.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus and Physst for pulling of the Ice Giants 
        and Vox's guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and 
        I certainly appreciate their efforts. And to the buffers that evening 
        as well: Sileguy, Loen, Bolgor, Syncere, Cerritus, Khallin, Mysyn, Saleel, 
        Lazuli, Sevenswords, Larea, and Mandragorans. For all the first time buffers 
        that were there, great job!<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees. As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note 1: Lazuli gave me choice at start of fight for which char, and I 
        chose Enc, allowed to roll on alt's class. Saleel also gave me choice 
        at start of fight for which char, and I chose Enc, allowed to roll on 
        alt's class. Both declared class roll preference before the fight.<br>
        Note 2: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Vox did manage to get off 1 Complete Heal's during the fight, but went 
        down neverless. Kept her off walls, but pit mobs was very sloppy and would 
        have easily killed a smaller raiding party.<br>
        Congrats to Immolar for the kill shot<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight and to all the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
        Vox was dead by 11pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:20.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>White Dragon Scale</b> - won by Brewall - since multiple scales dropped, 
        got 1 automatically (better than just closing out all the other bards 
        that still needed one to get 100% of the numbers....).<br>
        <b>White Dragon Scale</b> - won by Cris<br>
        <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Scoff - use it exclusively for 
        those plane raids!!!<br>
        <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Lazuli - give to FD class on 
        your raids :)<br>
        <b>Runed Bolster Belt</b> - won by Tico<br>
        <b>Ice Comet Spell</b> - won by Aridican<br>
        4PP &amp; No Gems - Not exactly D&amp;D level here.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap at 40, and keep 
        a few spots open for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people 
        no, but going to have to do it. Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 
        4 kills in 2 weeks and the word has gotten out that my raids work.<br>
        2. Lag last night was killing a lot of my canned socials (over 40), so 
        will be redoing them again. Looked fine on my computer, but people were 
        telling me that some were getting dropped.<br>
        3. Will kick &quot;BOOK DROP&quot; button. Vox 0-4 on book drops and I'm 
        really feeling sorry for paladins. Vox should drop one every time in my 
        opinion.<br>
        4. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>AND</b><br>
        5. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of X (will work on this week to come 
        up with factor). I will target the factor so that the collective numbers 
        that bards have is approximately 50% of the total pool of numbers on the 
        roll. So bards have a 50% chance of winning, otherwise a caster wins it. 
        Many of the bards that have won are continuing to attend with hopes of 
        getting other dragon items, so it may be that the only people rolling 
        on WDS are casters.<br>
      <p> <b></b> <b> Until the next raid,<br>
        Brewall.</b> </p>
