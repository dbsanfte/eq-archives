        Guide </span><br>
        <em>Last update: 17 April 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br></span>
        The Plane of Hate is a level 46+ zone that normally requires a raid to 
        complete. It is the home of the god Innoruuk and his minions, including 
        the Maestro of Rancor. This guide covers everything needed to successfully 
        raid Hate, please read it all before attending a raid for the first time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Setting Up</b><br>
        The Plane of Hate can only be accessed via a Wizard spell, Alter Plane: 
        Hate. The spell requires a reagent known as a Soulstone of Innoruuk for 
        each casting of the spell. Soulstones can be purchased in the Neriak Cleric 
        guild for roughly 100 to 200pp depending on faction and charisma.<br>
        <br>
        Because Hate is not accessed from a normal zone line in a specific zone, 
        a Hate raid can meet anywhere to prepare. I suggest meeting in Greater 
        Faydark underneath the Wizard teleport spires. GFay is an ideal place 
        to set up for a Hate raid because there is a city in the same zone, and 
        melee can bind here.<br>
        <br>
        Before porting up into Hate, it is not necessary to buff everyone - in 
        fact, it's a waste of mana and time to do so. The only people that should 
        be buffed fully prior to porting up are the Clerics and Paladins (or anyone 
        that can Revive)1. Everyone should be invisible before porting, however 
        (execpt the Wizard, obviously). Groups should be set up so that everyone 
        knows their group, but groups cannot be formed fully at this time because 
        one slot in each group must be reserved for a Wizard to port up.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The Run to SS</b><br>
        Once groups are set up, porting should begin one group at a time. The 
        first group should be the pull group (notes on pull group later). After 
        they are up, no other group should be ported until given the OK by one 
        of the pull group's Rogues.<br>
        <br>
        If there are not enough Wizards present at the raid to have one in each 
        group (which there probably won't be), the Wizard porting up groups should 
        immediately gate out of the plane after porting up to get the next group.<br>
        <br>
        Upon zoning into Hate, all group members should immediately run the route 
        to SS2 ( <a href="http://angelfire.lycos.com/ct2/diggle/HatemapSSRun.gif" class="MainAreaLink">angelfire.lycos.com/ct2/d...pSSRun.gif</a> 
        ) and camp there. When running along the zone wall as shown by the map, 
        you are to run all the way to the top of the wall. Even when SS is reached, 
        you should camp at the top of the wall. All members of the group that 
        can Revive are to be protected at all costs - if they are agroed on the 
        way to SS, taunt the mobs off of them to attempt to buy them time to make 
        their way to SS and camp. It is absolutely essential that at least one 
        person that can Revive be camped at SS. If any non-Revivers are agroed 
        on the way to camp, run off the wall3 to the ground, where you are to 
        stand and die.<br>
        <br>
        Once everyone has either made it to SS or died, everyone should log in 
        and Resurrections should be begin. Everyone should be buffed during this 
        time as well. Note: all resses and buffing should take place at the top 
        of the wall until the raid leader gives the OK to move down.<br>
        <br>
        1 If anyone on the raid is in possession of a Staff of Forbidden Rites, 
        it is a good idea to hand this to a Rogue. This way, if no revivers make 
        it to camp, the Rogue can use a charge of the staff to res a Cleric.<br>
        <br>
        2 The route to SS is marked by the blue line, and starts at the port up 
        spot - marked (1) on the map.<br>
        <br>
        3 If you are agroed, it is best to run off the wall to the ground to die. 
        This is because the walls of hate are slanted, sometimes making corpses 
        very difficult to target for dragging. <br>
        <br>
        The Plane of Hate has a strange layout. It appears to be a city, with 
        many different houses, but actually has two levels - both with ceilings 
        - and yet is still considered an outside zone (i.e. SoW will work here). 
        There is very little movement in Hate for everyone but the pull team. 
        The majority of the raid will be spent sitting on the floor below the 
        SS you ran to.<br>
        <br>
        This first SS has a few things to be noted. First, you will notice two 
        Clerics and one Kiraikuei in the nearby Southwest corner of the zone. 
        As long as the camp stays close together where the pull team instructs 
        them to, you should not have to deal with these mobs often. Sometimes 
        however, mob or pet pathing will cause one cleric and the kiraikuei to 
        add. That being said, if this is a large raid, do not bother with pets. 
        They will often cause more harm than good here.<br>
        <br>
        While fighting here, try to keep mobs off of the wall. Not only is fighting 
        on the walls annoying for melees, if a mob dies here it's corpse can be 
        very difficult to target for looting.<br>
        <br>
        Also, one person (preferably an Enchanter) should be appointed to dispel 
        every mob as it enters camp. This is very necessary in Hate because of 
        the many Cleric, Shaman, Magician, and Enchanter mobs that will be buffing 
        each other like mad.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Notes for the Main Tank</b><br>
        The main tank for the raid should know what mobs to target first in multiple 
        mob pulls. Remember however that no matter what the pull consists of, 
        any mob that has been mezed should be skipped for un-mezed mobs first.<br>
        <br>
        Spite Golems are always the primary target in a multiple mob pull because 
        of their very high magic resistance which makes them almost impossible 
        to mez. The only time a Golem should not be the primary target is if there 
        is a Cleric in camp that for some reason cannot be mezed. The next target, 
        after Golems, should be Clerics. If all Golems and Clerics are dead, the 
        order of targeting is not very important. <br>
        <br>
        A good pull team is essential to Hate. The perfect set up for pull group 
        in Hate is: Cleric - Shaman - Monk - Monk - Rogue - Rogue. This can be 
        varied of course, but the group must have a Cleric and must have two Monks 
        or Shadowknights. Also, at least one Rogue is suggested to make the raid 
        move faster. Finally, if the pull group makeup does differ from this, 
        remember not to place any Enchanters or tanks in the pull group.4<br>
        <br>
        <b>Clerics and Shaman</b><br>
        The pull group needs it's own Cleric because the Monks will often need 
        a quick heal, and will need buffs on demand to keep the raid running. 
        A Shaman or Druid is suggested to keep buffs up as well. There are two 
        main things to remember as the Cleric or Shaman / Druid for the pull group. 
        First, do not waste mana fighting. The Monks and Rogues need whatever 
        buffs they ask for, when they ask for it. The pull team determines how 
        fast the raid moves. Secondly, never, ever cast anything on a Monk or 
        Rogue while they're pulling unless they ask for it. Healing a Monk while 
        they're not FDed or buffing a Rogue while he's scouting a house can cause 
        a train that will wipe out the raid.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Rogues</b><br>
        A Rogue's role in Hate is to scout. Rogues are unique for this job because 
        they are the only class in the game that can be invisible to both living 
        and undead creatures at the same time, which is perfect for Hate. There 
        are only four things in Hate that can see through a Rogue's Hide: Loathling 
        Liches, Scorn Banshees, the Maestro, and Innoruuk himself.<br>
        <br>
        The Rogues in Hate do a number of jobs to help move the raid faster and 
        make things easier for the Monks, including watching roamers and scouting 
        houses. They are also, as always, very good for CR. The Rogues are normally 
        in charge of the raid as they direct what to pull.<br>
        <br>
        A hidden Rogue will not cause aggression of mobs through walls or ceilings. 
        However, Monks or anyone else that is not invisible will - keep this in 
        mind while instructing the Monks what to pull.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, it is recommended that Rogues do not fight during the raid, except 
        during Maestro and Innoruuk. This is to both keep them from accidentally 
        training the camp by bringing back mobs they were not aware they had agroed, 
        and also to keep them alive should the raid suffer a wipeout so that they 
        can CR if needed.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Monks</b><br>
        Rogues are the scouts, but are most certainly not the pullers. The actual 
        pulling of mobs in Hate should be done by a team of two Monks. One acts 
        as the puller and one is the tagger. Before a pull, the tagger FDs at 
        a specified spot (depending on what part of the zone is being pulled and 
        which direction the pull will be coming from). The puller then runs out 
        and pulls whatever told to by the Rogues, brings the mobs back to the 
        tagger, and FDs next to him. A Rogue nearby watches the mobs and determines 
        when to complete the pull. When told by the Rogue or the puller Monk, 
        the tagger stands and brings the mobs to camp for killing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Notes</b><br>
        Specific buffs are needed by the pull team which either the Cleric or 
        Shaman should keep loaded at all times. Because Rogues will not be fighting, 
        the only buff they should need is SoW. Monks however will require many 
        different buffs, which the Cleric and Shaman should spilt up. Monks will 
        need a HP / AC buff (Resolution, Heroism), an AC buff (Shield of Words), 
        a symbol (Symbol of Naltron, Symbol of Marzin), a talisman (Talisman of 
        Altuna), Disease and Poison resistances, SoW, and See Invisible.<br>
        <br>
        Both the puller and tagger should bring some sort of throwing weapon with 
        them, or have a constant supply available to them from someone (Myrlokar's 
        Bracer is ideal).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pulling: House by House</b><br>
        <a href="../../images/maps/hateplane_map.gif"><img src="../../images/maps/hateplane_mapt.gif" width="192" height="144" border="0"></a><br>
        <br>
        All Rogues and Monks should have a copy of this map during the raid. The 
        suggested pulling order is as follows: Q R S C U V 2 3 4 5 A B 6 7 D P 
        E N O F H J M G I L K 6.<br>
        <br>
        Houses Q, R, S: These first three houses surround the SS. They can all 
        contain kiraikueis, scorn banshees, and haunted chests. When pulling house 
        S, the SW corner will often agro through the wall, and vice-versa. It 
        is recommended that this house be pulled by first chain pulling the SW 
        corner, and then pulling the house. The corner should be chained first 
        because it takes the mobs in the house longer to path outside than it 
        will take the mobs in the corner to path to the puller. After house Q 
        is clear, it is safe to move the raid back a bit, to SS b.<br>
        <br>
        House C: This large house contains many mobs on both floors. Fortunately, 
        because of the house's size, mobs from the second floor will not agro 
        through the floor while pulling the first floor. This house can contain 
        kiraikueis, clerics, forsaken revanants, spite golems, loathling liches, 
        and ashenbone drakes. When pulling the first floor, clear all mobs except 
        for the three static mobs by the exit to C near houses A and B. These 
        mobs will cause houses A and B to agro if pulled now; it is best to leave 
        them until later, after A and B are cleared. When pulling the second floor, 
        a Rogue should watch for roamer aggression through the wall as the puller 
        runs up the ramp.<br>
        <br>
        Houses U, V: These two houses can contain scorn banshees, kiraikueis, 
        and haunted chests.<br>
        <br>
        Houses 2, 3, 4, 5, A, B, 6, 7: These houses can contain abhorrents, ire 
        ghasts, haunted chests, and kiraikueis. The number houses are all clean 
        pulls, but houses A and B will sometimes agro each other. Also, the three 
        static spawns in C that were left alone earlier may add while pulling 
        A and B, but they are much easier to deal with now.<br>
        <br>
        House D: This large house contains many mobs on the first floor, but only 
        three on the second floor. It can contain any type of mob, and also houses 
        the Maestro of Rancor, who sits in front of his organ in the Northwest 
        corner of the first floor. As with house C, pulling mobs from the first 
        floor will not agro mobs from the second floor, but when pulling the second 
        floor roamers may agro through the wall as the puller runs up the ramp. 
        Most of the mobs on the first floor roam around the floor. There are however 
        two static spawns by the entrance of the house, and also two static spawns 
        on each side of the Maestro's organ. It is not necessary to clear the 
        second floor before pulling Maestro, but it is suggested that everything 
        on the first floor be cleared before pulling Maestro. After house D is 
        clear, the raid should be moved to SS c.<br>
        <br>
        House P: Pulling from house D does not cause aggression from house P, 
        but pulling from house P will cause agro from house D - this is why P 
        is pulled after D. It can contain scorn banshees, kiraikueis, and haunted 
        chests.<br>
        <br>
        Houses E, N, O, F, H, J, M, G, I, L, K: These houses are located in the 
        Northeast corner of the zone, also known as &quot;Caster Corner.&quot; 
        It is called this because all of these houses contain male or female revenants. 
        House O however can contain scorn banshees as well.<br>
        <br>
        Upper Chambers: The Upper Chambers, or Innoruuk's Lair, of Hate are much 
        smaller than the lower area. There are only three &quot;houses,&quot; 
        two small ones and one large one that houses Innoruuk himself. The large 
        house is packed full of wandering mobs of any type. Innoruuk himself is 
        stationary, standing all the way in the back of the house. Two ashenbone 
        drakes stand at top of the ramp to the Upper Chambers. It is not necessary 
        to move the raid up the ramp to pull the Upper Chambers, in fact it is 
        recommended that the raid stay at SS c until all is clear but Innoruuk 
        himself.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Roamers<br>
        </b>There are two sets of roamer paths in Hate, each with about 4 - 6 
        mobs. Roamers are always loathling liches, revultant rats, or ire ghasts. 
        They have a respawn time of anywhere from 30 - 45 minutes, and the drop 
        rate on roamers is drastically lower than static spawns. Fortunately, 
        none of the roamer mobs carry class armor. The SW corner has the same 
        spawn time and drop rates as roamers.<br>
        <br>
        4 Enchanters and tanks are not placed in the pull group because the Cleric 
        must keep his attention and mana saved for the Monks.<br>
        <br>
        5 An optional method of pulling mobs involves two Monks and a tank. The 
        two Monks pull / tag like normal, but instead of having the tagger run 
        the mob into camp, he FDs again just outside camp where a tank completes 
        the pull with a ranged weapon. This can be difficult because the tank 
        will probably not be in the pull group (see note 5), but it does ensure 
        that the mob will go straight for the tank instead of possibly having 
        the tagging Monk run it over a sitting caster, etc.<br>
        <br>
        6 Note that this is merely a suggested order, it can be altered slightly. 
        Also, note that house T is always empty, and houses 8 and 9 are not actually 
        houses. 8 is a fountain, 9 is the giant spiral ramp to the upper chambers.

        If there isn't enough time for clearing the entire Plane of Hate, certain 
        areas of Hate can be skipped if the raid is trying to reach a specific 
        class's armor, etc.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Skipping to Northeast Corner<br>
        </b>The Northeast corner of Hate is often known as &quot;Caster Corner&quot; 
        because this is where the majority of the Mage and Enchanter armor drops. 
        This is often the last area to be pulled and sometimes there isn't enough 
        time to reach it. There is good news for the casters however: this corner 
        can be cleared in a separate, short &quot;raid&quot; on Hate without going 
        through the normal pulling order.<br>
        <br>
        If the raid is going straight for NE Corner, groups are to stay in the 
        portal up house after porting up. This will be the camping spot. Pullers 
        should start by clearing the roamers on the south route, then proceed 
        by clearing houses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. After these houses are cleared, 
        the NE corner can be pulled. The only downside to pulling NE corner to 
        the port up spot is the pullers will have to deal with both the north 
        and south roamers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Skipping to Innoruuk</b><br>
        Skipping to Innoruuk requires more time. The raid should start normally 
        and clear all the way up to house D. After this is done, the raid can 
        be moved to the Upper Chambers and begin clearing it, leaving house D 
        and the NE corner popped. If the Northeast corner is skipped, Inny must 
        be pulled in a special way. He cannot be fought where he stands in his 
        house like normal, or the NE corner houses will agro through the floor. 
        He must be pulled to just inside the entrance of his large house and fought 
        there. <br>
        <br>
        The Maestro is the &quot;mini boss&quot; of Hate. He is a large vampire 
        that sits in front of his organ in house D. His special attack is a particularly 
        nasty one, making him at times harder than Innoruuk himself - an area 
        effect lifetap. Maestro also has a chance to duel wield weapons, if he 
        spawns with two of the special Bard weapons he can drop. When this happens, 
        he is incredibly hard because magical weapons cannot be disarmed. A minimum 
        of 18 people is suggested to attempt Maestro normally, more if he is duel 
        wielding.<br>
        <br>
        Before buffing for Maestro, all of the first floor of house D should be 
        cleared. This includes the four static spawns that guard him. Clearing 
        these four spawns can be difficult to clear, just be patient. Even if 
        an opportunity to pull Maestro alone before his guards are cleared presents 
        itself, do not do it. The raid must be absolutely ready for him.<br>
        <br>
        When he is ready to be pulled, everyone should be buffed fully. Because 
        of his special AE attack, it is important that all casters be grouped 
        together in the same spot, away from where he will be fought. Casters 
        must also be careful of ping-ponging Maestro, this can be very dangerous. 
        Finally, do not push Maestro up the wall.<br>
        <br>
        If casters stay together, watch their agro, and Maestro is kept in the 
        same spot, the fight should go smoothly. If your raid defeats Maestro, 
        it should have no problem with Innoruuk.<br>
        <br>
        The God of Hate and ruler of this plane is Innoruuk. He is actually slightly 
        easier than Maestro, but is still worthy of respect. He will deathtouch 
        every thirty seconds or so, and also casts an area effect gravity flux 
        which will very quickly annoy the hell out of you. It appears to be much 
        harder to resist than the normal gravity flux spell.<br>
        <br>
        Before charging Innoruuk, everyone should be buffed fully. He will deathtouch 
        the first person to reach him - plan for this, it shouldn't be a tank. 
        Little actual strategy is involved - it's pretty much a straight up fight. 
        He is not too much of a challenge if everyone is properly prepared for 
        him. </span> </p>
