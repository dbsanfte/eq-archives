        Dragon Raid (Lady Vox / Lord Nagafen)</span><br>
        <em>Last update: 21 September 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <span class="s2cA"><br>
        Greetings all. I've written this guide for those of you that are considering 
        hosting an open dragon raid against Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen. I will start 
        off by saying that it is a lot of work and most of the time you will feel 
        like you are hearding cats, but you can be successfull. This guide is 
        tailored for those running open raids with open loots.<br>
        <br>
        If you are planning to lead 1-3 guilds against a dragon, this guide will 
        give you a good idea of what to do, but you should be able to do a lot 
        of things in advance.&nbsp; You should pre-plan all groups, buffers &amp; 
        buffs, have everyone read attack plan, and determine tash/debuffers. This 
        will save you a lot of time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PLAN</b><br>
        In order to attack an dragon, you will need a hearty band of adventurers 
        to follow you into battle.&nbsp; But you will find few people willing 
        to follow someone with a bad reputation or a guild with unsavory history.&nbsp; 
        Also, dragon veterans will immediately ask what are the loot rules and 
        novices will need a lot of directions. &nbsp; You should prepare your 
        loot rules prior to setting up any raid and should have information for 
        people to read and maps to access. Assume that people won't have the time 
        to read a full-blown guide, you should be ready with basic instructions.<br>
        <br>
        <b>LOOT</b><br>
        Loot is the single biggest reason why people don't join raids or complain 
        at the end of one. Write out all your rules and post them for everyone 
        to see. Make sure you specify any reserved items and what happens if multiple 
        of same item drops.&nbsp; I usually do open rolls with raid points to 
        encourage people to attend multiple times (see other areas of this site 
        for information).<br>
        <br>
        <b>GETTING PEOPLE</b><br>
        I suggest drumming up support within the guild, asking some other guilds, 
        posting on server message boards, posting on guild message boards, and 
        listing your event out on EverquestRaids.com. First one is always the 
        hardest, but if you succeed just once, people will come out of the woodwork 
        for your raids. Getting people can be hard if you or your guild has a 
        bad reputation and you don't have a plan. If you break your loot rules 
        you will taint your reputation. My advice: Go out of your way to be fair, 
        if something bizarre happens, be extra fair, you will be remembered for 
        being honorable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SOCIALS</b><br>
        Prior to raid, set up several full banks of hotkeys for instructions on 
        forming groups, moving, buffing, loot rules, and attack commands. The 
        keys will save you an enormous amount of typing. All the hotkeys I use 
        during Vox/Nag raids can be found on the last sheet in DragonRaid.xls. 
        Some of the labels are prefixed with &quot;V&quot; for Vox- only, &quot;N&quot; 
        for Nag-only, and &quot;X&quot; for any dragon.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>USING THE DragonRaid SPREADSHEET</strong>: <a href="../DragonRaid.zip" class="MainAreaLink">Click 
        here for spreadsheet</a> (zip format)<br>
        I designed the DragonRaid spreadsheet to handle point-based random looting. 
        Everyone gets points for attending raids (raid points, book points, and 
        red dragon scale points) and these are used on some dragon loots. There 
        is a macro in the sheet that helps with sorting the data. Key sheets in 
        the spreadsheet:<br>
        <strong>LootList</strong>: List of all drops on Vox/Nag raid. This sheet 
        controls which class rolls on which items, level limits, and whether the 
        item uses points. Classes that do not roll are assigned 0, classes that 
        roll can be given a number 1+. If greater than 1, it will be used as a 
        factor on point items. I give bards a 3 on the WDS to factor their odds 
        3x over caster classes that have a 1.&nbsp; Do not ever change the item 
        numbers unless you make the same changes to historical data in the Winner 
        sheet.<br>
        <strong>Groups</strong>: Looks up who is in what group based on Roster 
        sheet. The buffer information is to the right of the groups and is entered 
        manually.&nbsp; This sheet is before Roster in the workbook to make it 
        easier to enter data (you'll spend most time on Roster sheet, use ctrl+up 
        to get to Groups or ctrl+down to get to RaidPoints, easier than using 
        mouse to change sheets).<br>
        <strong>Roster</strong>: Current raid roster sheet. Lot of formulas to 
        look up data, so focus on yellow-shaded areas. Enter name and the formulas 
        should look up class, level, guild, points, and calculate the loot numbers 
        off to the right. Use the sort column to help prioritize people if you 
        are flooded with attendees (if people sign in with large number of attendance+raid 
        points, give them priority of 9, give 53+ buffers along to help an 8, 
        and give new attendees a 5. As you finalize list, move the new attendees 
        up to 9's). &nbsp; There is a macro in this sheet that helps resort the 
        names based on: (1) sort column and then (2) name. When loots are done, 
        enter then loot number at the numbers will recalc. To freeze the data, 
        copy data from the column and paste special/value out to the right. There 
        is a column that gives the text for websites for people to see their numbers. 
        &nbsp; Loot calculations are broken out into a number of columns to make 
        it easy to see what is going on and to verify accuracy. The group leader 
        entered at top of sheet gets 3 points instead of 1 on point items.&nbsp; 
        After each raid, I take this info and put into a seperate sheet where 
        I have listing of attendance for every raid (one raid below the other).<br>
        <strong>RaidPoints</strong>: List of every person and every raid. First 
        few columns are used to enter data. There is a column for posting to websites 
        to show current point balance. There are a few columns that calculate 
        attendance, raid, book, and rds points, followed by transfer column and 
        points for each raid. To make it easy, I have some top row &amp; bottom 
        row cells at the top of the sheet that should correspond to Roster sheet. 
        After a raid, I enter the rows, and for attendance, I copy values from 
        &quot;I&quot; and paste-special values into &quot;J&quot; (I don't track 
        attendance by raid, just totals). I then copy &quot;K&quot; and paste-special 
        values into the corresponding raid (and then replace 0's with blanks), 
        and then give any bonus points. I'll admit the transfer column is cludgy, 
        but doing this by doing calculations on the Transfer sheet, resulted in 
        30 second recalcs which slow you down immensely.<br>
        <strong>Winners</strong>: Enter winners into this sheet. You can do as 
        each item is done during a raid or at the end of all the rolls. This sheet 
        is also useful for transfers where you have to split different kinds of 
        raid points.<br>
        <strong>Transfers</strong>: Detailed listing of all raid point transfers. 
        Not used in calculations because another vlookup or sum (using array formulas) 
        brings recalcs from 1-2 sec to over 30. There is a column out to the right 
        that presents information for posting to a site.<br>
        <strong>LootSummary</strong>: Look for trends in dragon loot drops. Just 
        a pivot table using the data on the Winners sheet. Makes use of the track 
        column to show/not show data.<br>
        <strong>WDSTrade</strong>: Use this sheet to random among any bards showing 
        up to raid with Heiro cloak/WDS cloak in the event that a caster wins 
        it.<br>
        <strong>Script</strong>: 50+ raid keys that I use during Vox/Nag raids.<br>
        <strong>Macros</strong> (not a sheet): 2 macros to sort data on Roster 
        and WDSTrade sheet.<br>
        <br>
        <b>GROUPING</b><br>
        Groups can be made as follows:<br>
        main tank groups: 1 cleric, 1 bard, 1 paladin, 3 tanks<br>
        debuf group (dispell vox, tash, slow, DoT, and seive): 1 cleric, 1 bard, 
        1 shaman, 3 enc<br>
        caster groups: 6 48+ dru/wiz/mag/nec<br>
        reserve group: left overs<br>
        <br>
        For Raid: 4 main tank groups, 1 debuf group, 1 caster group, 1-2 reserve 
        groups<br>
        <br>
        Put as many 50+ in first 2 tank groups that will be needed to rush/push/surround 
        the dragon. Minimizes risk of fearing. Don't worry about balancing groups 
        out. Make 2 solid kill groups and work down from there. Keep an experienced 
        person to lead reserve groups that typically has lowest level/least experienced 
        raiders.<br>
        <br>
        * If short on clerics, use any extra healing classes (shm/dru) instead. 
        Can also put 3-4 paladins per group. Group of 5 paladins 1 bard can last 
        a very long time.<br>
        * If short on enchanters, have other classes dispell Vox. Have all bards 
        twist in mana draining song.<br>
        * If short on bards, get more. Any group that does not have a bard should 
        not be sent into fight until 50% (excluding debuf group that can stay 
        out of AE range).<br>
