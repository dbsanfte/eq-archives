        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: May 29 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies a third time at the hands of Crimson Talon 
        and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle.&nbsp; Vox had not 
        gone down on the server for several months and the last three Brewall 
        lead raids have eased the oppression of this cruel dragon over the lands 
        of Everfrost, as well as, liberated more of her property.<br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I was absolutely 
        shocked how many people showed up. Less than two weeks ago, I had cobbled 
        together just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people 
        are showing up. Next raid will have a limit on people.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Definitely going to change way people make the list, and 
        it will be better for everyone involved if I do. Too many people causes 
        a lot more work (and time) to do a raid and almost results in mob mentality, 
        and instructions not being followed. I know it can be dull at start during 
        setup, but pullers and myself are hard at work. I average 1 tell every 
        10 seconds AND I'm trying to work out groups, buffers, tactics, and other 
        things.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">From now on, when people arrive in zone, they will need to 
        send me a tell, AND receive a message back from me that &quot;YOU ARE 
        ON LIST&quot;. It may add to my tells, but I was actually getting people 
        just arriving in zone claiming they had been there for a long time (I 
        wrote down every name when I first logged into Perma) - I turned some 
        away for this reason. Trust me, I don't like turning anyone away, but 
        just going to have to do it next time. I also turned away some below 45 
        that were on last raid, but this time we had plenty of 45+.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Vox was definitely tough this time on pulling guards. Hate 
        it when she agros and then summons the pullers, and I'm sure the pullers 
        do to. This next time, I'll include a message that Altus is puller, will 
        use shout, and everyone should help him in any way he asks.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Two line buffing worked out better than I anticipated time-wise, 
        but it still seems that some people are missing buffs. Seems like I can 
        lead an ogre to a beer but can't make him drink. I thought the way I ran 
        through each line and then did a recap was a good format, but next time, 
        I just will just jump to a recap messages and make people write it down. 
        No excuse for not getting 14 buffs.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Absolute biggest problem of the fight was that someone did 
        not listen to instructions, got feared and pulled back a ton of mobs from 
        the pits. If I could figure out who they were, they would not be welcome 
        on additional raids. I had planned to use reserve group 5 to take out 
        any respawns (I thought maybe 1 up) and instead they were decimated by 
        the pit mobs. Then, the bears wiped out a couple enchanters, allowing 
        Vox to retain mana for CH. To top it off, the bear AI must then have looked 
        for person doing most shouts, because I had 4 on me and couldn't get them 
        off. Needless to say, with 75hp left, I did my last shouts, did a suicide 
        AE 350hp dmg to all the bears and promptly died when Vox was at 20%.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Special thanks go out to Altus (CT guild leader) and Physst 
        for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's guards. This is an extremely difficult 
        and important task and I certainly appreciate their efforts. And to the 
        buffers that evening as well: Sileguy, Aorthin, Rekinom, Khallin, Lazuli, 
        Saleel, Tomwin, Remuvdar, Barelil, Syncere, Hierl, and Mysyn. <br>

        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note 1: Lazuli gave me choice at start of fight for which char, and I 
        chose Enc for rune, allowed to roll on desired item.<br>
        Note 2: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 3: Persecutis, please send me tell/leave msg. Have 1 prior raid listed 
        (2b), you told me two, but I checked my records for all prior raids and 
        can't find you in any group I made.</span></p>

font-family:Verdana"><b>THE KILL</b><br>
        Vox did manage to get off 1 Complete Heal's during the fight, but went 
        down neverless. Kept her off walls, but pit mobs was very sloppy and would 
        have easily killed a smaller raiding party.<br>
        Congrats to ______?______ for the kill shot<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight and to all the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
        Vox was dead by 11pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:20.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        Loot was:<br>
        White Dragon Scale - won by Alegro<br>
        Dragon Bone Bracelet - won by Physst<br>
        Crystalline Spear - won by Persecutis<br>
        Staff of Forbidden Rites - won by Valoria - use it exclusively for those 
        plane raids!!!<br>
        Enchanter page 400 (junk)<br>
        5PP &amp; No Gems - Not exactly D&amp;D level here.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap at 40, and keep 
        a few spots open for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people 
        no, but going to have to do it. Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 
        3 kills in 2 weeks and the word has gotten out.<br>
        2. Rule #2 is going to be: don't ever bring a mob back from pits. Rule 
        #1 is to keep Vox off walls.<br>
        3. Will kick &quot;BOOK DROP&quot; button. Vox 0-3 on book drops and I'm 
        really feeling sorry for paladins. Almost as bad as me hosting 4 raids 
        and not winning a scale yet...<br>
        4. If multiple scales drop, I will automatically recieve one, others all 
        up for random (vox drops 0-3). Already, 3 bards that I had never met before 
        I started the Vox raids have won, and will definitely ease the loot presure 
        on me. With many more bards in attendance (only 4 on 1st raid), I will 
        also increase my own raid points to still allow for chance someone else 
        may win, but my odds get no worse than this last fight. And, yes, even 
        after I win a WDS, I will continue to host raids.<br>
        5. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
