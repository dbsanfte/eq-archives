            Trakanon perished again to the forces of the Crimson Talon.&nbsp; Flawless killing with
            only 1 death due to the shroom port.&nbsp; Drops were: Wildlord Tunic [Kuriosity], SK BP
            [banked], Undead Dragon Sinew [Proetus], 4 Teeth [Polynecies, Chadmoe, Khandrahcir, and
            Zoranna]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Sev was roaming around in Emerald Jungle and we decided to quickly take him down. Killed
            him again so that another one of our warriors could get a coveted green scale.&nbsp; Loots
            were: Green Dragon Scale [Machedor], Shield of the Green Dragon [Azenyth], Mask of the
            Hunter [Dunskye], and Spirit of Oak [Windarii].<br>
            <br>
            GM event in the Swamp of No Hope in the tunnel to Trakanon's Teeth. A dragon was in the
            caves where the frogloks used to be and was red to level 60's.&nbsp; Although we were able
            to assemble 3+ full groups with 3 MB wizards, we didn't have any clerics on.&nbsp; Simply
            bad timing as several got on later that night.&nbsp; Another guild played around with the
            mob for a few hours before finally killing him;&nbsp; loot was a ranger belt.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to cut down his minions and slay the undead
            dragon himself.&nbsp; We decided to fight Trak on the bridge and even though he ported on
            us at 0.001 percent health, we still killed him losing only 1 person (from the shroom
            port). Excellent fighting and heads-up thinking by everyone dealing with Trak's escape.
            Drops were 5 teeth [Minmin, Immolar, Barelil, Chantress, and Kestel], Cleric BP [Skylynn],
            and a Cloak of Piety [Khandrahcir]. Grats to all.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kestel for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 23, 2002</strong><br>
            Big raid on Akheva Ruins.&nbsp; Crawled the entire zone from end-to-end. Another exciting
            evening as we tackled lots of new mobs and brand-new encounters.<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Maemura for completing the ranger epic for Swiftwind!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Guild raid to crawl Grieg's end.&nbsp; Went from Dawnshroud to Scarlet and a few detours
            along the way.&nbsp; The guild map of the zone is definitely getting better, but if anyone
            sees missing information, please tell Brewall.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Lumper for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 18, 2002</strong><br>
            Another big raid on Siren's Grotto. This time to explore the temple area.&nbsp; Definitely
            fun to see new areas and enrich our gem coffers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Took a long tour tonight of Siren's Grotto. We crawled around the zone making quite a few
            loops.&nbsp; Was a lot of new content for many of us and few of us had seen all the
            sights.&nbsp; Gem drops were excellent and we replenished our guild gem bank quite well.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 09, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again. Plate BP [Khandrahcir], Plate Gauntlets [Maxist], Plate Boots [Saulk], Chain
            Arms [Gilthanus], Plate Bracer [Gish], Silk Bracer [Imotep], Plate Boots [Skylynn], and
            Plate Helm [Lumper].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the Halls of Testing for some armour.&nbsp; Cleaned the wing out a few times
            and were rewarded with: Silk Legs [Greymask], Plate Legs [Ceeni], Plate Boots [Machedor],
            Chain BP [Maemura], Silk Sleeves [Lumadin], Leather Legs [Kuriosity], Chain BP [Udian],
            Chain Sleeves [Shcammer], Plate BP [Valstorm], Chain Gloves [Lotera], Plate Gauntlets
            [Tico], Plate Arms [Zypheal], and White Symbol [Tomwin].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Miscellaneous epic questing and experience questing for a few days while people are off
            for the holiday weekend.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 01, 2002</strong><br>
            We were killing some guardian wurms in skyfire this evening, when Talendor decided to make
            an appearance.&nbsp; Having slain this beast several times, we resolved to repeat his
            demise.&nbsp; Grats to Khandrahcir for burnt book!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 30, 2002</strong><br>

            Congrats to Tomwin for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to ToV for some more armour.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Large raid on Dragon Necropolis.&nbsp; Toured the zone and collected some gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Quick trip into Fear this evening to get the Wraith of Shissar that Chantress has been
            camping for weeks now. Grats to Chantress for getting our second enchanter epic in just
            days!&nbsp; While we were there, Yain showed up and needed the broken golem.&nbsp; Since
            we were there, we killed broken golem for him.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished Kestel's enchanter epic this evening with a quick trip to kill the Tangrin and
            final turn-in's.&nbsp; Grats to Kestel for getting his epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 18, 2002</strong><br>
            We needed a few epic items from Hate and decided to raid it this evening.&nbsp; On the
            first floor, we managed to get Kestel's vampire essence, 2 Eyes of Innoruuk [Imotep &amp;
            Kenatal] and Alone's Ranger stone. &nbsp; After laying waste to the first floor, we
            decided that we wanted our first Inny kill.&nbsp; We ventured out to the second floor and
            cleared the way to the god of hate. One excellently executed fight later, Inny lay dead at
            our feet.&nbsp; Grats to Immolar for the Pauldron's of Power!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 13, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again this evening. Drops: Leather BP [Aerayn], Plate Bracer, Leather Gloves, Plate
            Legs [Lilsong], Leather Boots [Physst], Silk Turban [Immolar], Plate Boots [Sylvanna],
            Runed Symbol [Altus], Leather Boots [Ippit], Leather Boots, Leather Legs [Altus], Chain
            Gloves [Barelil, no, Denor, no, Dreamthief, no, Dodja, ok, Klaminar], and Chain Legs
            [Dodja]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to Halls of Testing. Drops: Silk Boots [Mmatil], Plate Legs [Zypheal, Awll,
            Lisner], Silk Bracer [Mmatil], Silk Arms [Jarheuu, Groovit], and Leather Arms [Aerayn].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 11, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kilwean for obtaining the bard epic singing short sword!<br>
            <br>
            We also decided to try the Grimling High Priest in Acrylia.&nbsp; We brought two groups
            (spoiler sites suggested three), and we were complete overkill.&nbsp; Mobs barely lasted 5
            seconds as we killed the would-be repelers.&nbsp; After over an hour of killing them,
            watching the blood dry, and playing gems, the Grimling High Priest finally took matters
            into his own hands.&nbsp; Only problem was that once we had him down to 10 percent, he
            poofed. Not gated. Poofed.&nbsp; At least we got a few bone chips. Still, Brewall is
            making a few adjustments to his map from the explorations.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Denor for finishing the Shaman epic!&nbsp; At the same time as the CoM raid, we
            broke into Fear and proceeded to clear the zone.&nbsp; Lot of BP drops, too bad no one
            needed them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Dreamthief for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Cleared out Fear this evening for some epic loots: Broken Golem [Minmin], Amy whip
            [Kilwean], and Shissar [Kestel]. After that, we went to Kael arena to slay giants once
            again and came away with chain legs, plate legs, and a plate bp.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 06, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed both Severilous and Talendor today.&nbsp; Sev was stingy and dropped a dragon bone
            bracer [Chadmoe], Pouch [Greymask], and 6 spells - no green scale though.&nbsp; We
            followed that up with Talendor, but no books. Loots from these raids, even with our mana
            burning crew, is always given to guildmates - and are never sold.&nbsp; These two kills on
            top of a big dungeon crawl of Grieg's End. If you have never done a crawl of a dungeon
            before, you are really missing out. We've gotten much faster as a guild on quick assembly
            and rapid fire take out of the Kunark dragons. We have killed all 4 within the past 3 days
            - and yes, we are killing them because we want the items, not to sell them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 05, 2002</strong><br>
            We decided to raid the Hole to get a slew of needed epic items. We quickly fought our way
            down to Nortlav and dispatched the rusty weilding fighter. Grats to Kilwean for the Red
            Dragon Scale.&nbsp; Also killed many other epic mobs on the way back up for everyone else
            who needed something.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 04, 2002</strong><br>
            As a guild, we have been working hard and refining our tactics. Looking back on the last
            few months, we have steadily moved up the ladder of difficulty, and tonight was no
            exception. Coming off last nights two dragon raids, we wanted more. First, we decided to
            make our first attempt on Vindicator, and we were wildly successful. Loots were: Head
            [Tomwin], and Boots of the Vindicator [Awll].<br>
            <br>
            After we plowed Vindicator into dust, we decided to make our first attempt on Velketor.
            &nbsp; With no one with any prior experience with the fight, we still managed to kill him.
            &nbsp; Two big mobs in one night - again.&nbsp; Loots were: Shield of Freezing Wind
            [Chadmoe], Vermillion of Refraction [Mmatil], Crystal Crown of Confusion [Jarheuu], and 5
            spells.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 03, 2002</strong><br>
            The dragon hunting force was in full swing last night.&nbsp; We started in Dreadlands with
            Gorenaire, and dispatched the dragon with much fanfaire. Drops were nice for epics: WDS
            [Kilwean] and 2 Frost Books [Hawkien, Khandrahcir]. After Gore, we decided to do Juggs for
            more spells, only to discover that Trakanon himself was up.&nbsp; We then decided to
            dispatch him as well and killed him in record time.&nbsp; Drops were: Jaundice BP
            [Khallin], Deepwater BP [Chadmoe] and 2 Teeth [Brewall, Mmatil]. Along the way, we also
            managed to get 2 Dragon Sinews [Greymask, Kestel].&nbsp; After Trak, we then rolled on
            some extra Kael armour to MQ: Plate legs [Tico], Plate arms [Kilwean], and Plate gaunt
            [Zypheal].&nbsp; Excellent raiding by everyone with very minimal deaths (ZERO deaths on
            Gore and just 2 on Trak).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 02, 2002</strong><br>
            Small plate raid run in Kael this evening, and the drops were very good for a change: 2
            bracers: [Devaberiel, Lilsong], 2 legs: [Awll], 2 gaunts, 2 boots [Sylvanna, Khandrahcir],
            arms [Hawkien], and a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang: [Windarii].<br>
            <br>
