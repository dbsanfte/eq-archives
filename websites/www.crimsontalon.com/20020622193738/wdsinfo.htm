            <span class="s2cA"><strong>THE WHITE DRAGON SCALES</strong><br>
            The White Dragon Scale is without a doubt the most difficult item to obtain in the bard
            epic quest. A bard with it, is virtually assured of an epic someday, a bard without, is
            still very far away from completion.&nbsp; Bards are stuck in that the only two sources of
            the scale are Lady Vox (for 52- bards) and Gorenaire. Gore is exceedingly difficult to
            kill, and to do so requires an army of almost 50 level 58-60 players. Needless to say, she
            rarely dies.&nbsp; Therefore, 53+ bards without a white scale are in a horrible position.
            &nbsp; To help address this problem, I have opened some options for 53+ bards to obtain
            the scales without having to pay 100k+. The last offer I saw 3 weeks ago on Cazic-Thule
            was 140k...<br>
            <br>
            The White Dragon Scale cloak is a nice item, but there are definitely better cloaks and
            back items in the game. The Heirophant cloak (rare drop in Seblis) is extremely close, if
            not better. The bard epic, is without a doubt, the most uber item a bard could ever get
            and has no equal.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FOR STARTERS, HOW LOOT IS DONE:</strong><br>
            No loot items on my raids is guaranteed or reserved, including for myself (and I'm the
            host). Because of my open loot rules three other bards won a WDS prior to myself, open
            loots can be aggravating at times, but the ability for anyone to win anything, including
            first time attendees, makes my raids very popular. Every time someone attends one of my
            dragon raids, they are given a raid point, which helps their odds on nice items (RBB, CoF,
            books, scales, &amp; eyepatch).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>HOW WDS IS DONE:</strong><br>
            When people report in for the raid, I enter all the names into a spreadsheet that tracks
            everyone's attendance, does groups, and calculates loot numbers. Everyone's name is listed
            alphabetically. For some items (e.g. Pouch), everyone gets one number, I do a
            &quot;\random 1 N&quot; look up the correponding name, and that person wins the item. Good
            items, like the WDS, are based on 1 number + raid points (from prior attendance). &nbsp;
            The WDS is open to bards and casters on a random roll when loot is divided out. Bards
            (52-) on the raid get (1 + raidpoints)x3 numbers and casters get (1+raidpoints) for
            numbers. Just for information, the rolls used to be bard-only, until 5 bards had won
            scales, and then was opened to casters.<br>
            <br>
            In the event that a caster wins the WDS and if a 53+ bard is present with a White
            Dragonscale Cloak, Heirophant Cloak or better, I force a trade. The cloak is given to me,
            I will give the WDS, and then give the cloak to the caster.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>I'M NOT AT RAID, DO I STILL GET A CHANCE?</strong><br>
            Yes, but you need to do both of the following: (1) attend just 1 of the dragon raids so
            people get chance to meet you (2) tell me that you want on the list of bards wishing to
            make a trade.&nbsp; On any future raid, if you are on-line during the buff stage of the
            raid (when I actually have free time), I will send you a tell seeing if you are still
            interested. &nbsp; Everyone who is on-line and interested, is given a chance in the roll.
            You must be prepared to come to west commons on a moment's notice if you win.&nbsp; A
            large percentage of my raid attendees are not from my guild and I want to make a quick
            exchange.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE MY ODDS?</strong><br>
            Nothing.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>53 BARDS</strong><br>
            If you just dinged into 53, have no cloak to trade, you can still win a WDS, by attending
            the raid, helping to clear, and singing mana song. If your resists are needed, you may be
            asked to delevel in order to keep yourself in on the main open roll.&nbsp; If there are
            plenty of people, you may get to keep level and still be in the main open roll. This is
            done on a case-by-case basis and only offered to bards that have come up through the raids
            with more than 10 prior attendances. I stongly urge these bards not to get far into 53. If
            you are 53+, you are not elligible for any item other than the WDS. If you still need
            instruments or want to win something else, stick to 52. I'll stress this again: stick to
            52.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>WORDS OF WARNING</strong><br>
            Please do not try to bribe 53- bards from my raids that won scales. If I hear of them
            selling the scale, they will never receive another potentially sellable item from one of
            my raids again - ever. There are a lot of snitches out there, and if I hear of a sale, I
            will check with that person to ensure that the scale was not sold, if it was sold, they
            will go on my blacklist. I realize everyone wants an epic as quickly as possible, but I've
            been at 52 for over 5 months now working on white scales while many others decided to pass
            up on Vox and to level instead. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>ANY IDEA HOW LONG THIS COULD TAKE?</strong> <br>
            Hard to say. Vox has been stingy of late with scales. 0 in the past 4 raids. On 13 raids,
            she has dropped 8 so far, all of which have gotten into bard hands. Seems to be multiples
            or none most of the time. I am currently the only one raiding her, and have killed her
            within a day of all of her spawns.</span><br>
