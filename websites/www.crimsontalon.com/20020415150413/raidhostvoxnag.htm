            Cazic-Thule</b><br>
            Greetings all. I've written this guide for those of you that are considering hosting an
            open dragon raid against Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen. I will start off by saying that it is a
            lot of work and most of the time you will feel like you are hearding cats, but you can be
            successfull. This guide is tailored for those running open raids with open loots.<br>
            <br>
            If you are planning to lead 1-3 guilds against a dragon, this guide will give you a good
            idea of what to do, but you should be able to do a lot of things in advance.&nbsp; You
            should pre-plan all groups, buffers &amp; buffs, have everyone read attack plan, and
            determine tash/debuffers. This will save you a lot of time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>PLAN</b><br>
            In order to attack an dragon, you will need a hearty band of adventurers to follow you
            into battle.&nbsp; But you will find few people willing to follow someone with a bad
            reputation or a guild with unsavory history.&nbsp; Also, dragon veterans will immediately
            ask what are the loot rules and novices will need a lot of directions. &nbsp; You should
            prepare your loot rules prior to setting up any raid and should have information for
            people to read and maps to access. Assume that people won't have the time to read a
            full-blown guide, you should be ready with basic instructions.<br>
            <br>
            <b>LOOT</b><br>
            Loot is the single biggest reason why people don't join raids or complain at the end of
            one. Write out all your rules and post them for everyone to see. Make sure you specify any
            reserved items and what happens if multiple of same item drops.&nbsp; I usually do open
            rolls with raid points to encourage people to attend multiple times (see other areas of
            this site for information).<br>
            <br>
            <b>GETTING PEOPLE</b><br>
            I suggest drumming up support within the guild, asking some other guilds, posting on
            server message boards, posting on guild message boards, and listing your event out on
            EverquestRaids.com. First one is always the hardest, but if you succeed just once, people
            will come out of the woodwork for your raids. Getting people can be hard if you or your
            guild has a bad reputation and you don't have a plan. If you break your loot rules you
            will taint your reputation. My advice: Go out of your way to be fair, if something bizarre
            happens, be extra fair, you will be remembered for being honorable.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SOCIALS</b><br>
            Prior to raid, set up several full banks of hotkeys for instructions on forming groups,
            moving, buffing, loot rules, and attack commands. The keys will save you an enormous
            amount of typing. All the hotkeys I use during Vox/Nag raids can be found on the last
            sheet in DragonRaid.xls. Some of the labels are prefixed with &quot;V&quot; for Vox- only,
            &quot;N&quot; for Nag-only, and &quot;X&quot; for any dragon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>USING THE DragonRaid SPREADSHEET</strong>: <a href="DragonRaid.zip"><u>Click here
            for spreadsheet</u></a> (zip format)<br>
            I designed the DragonRaid spreadsheet to handle point-based random looting. Everyone gets
            points for attending raids (raid points, book points, and red dragon scale points) and
            these are used on some dragon loots. There is a macro in the sheet that helps with sorting
            the data. Key sheets in the spreadsheet:<br>
            <strong>LootList</strong>: List of all drops on Vox/Nag raid. This sheet controls which
            class rolls on which items, level limits, and whether the item uses points. Classes that
            do not roll are assigned 0, classes that roll can be given a number 1+. If greater than 1,
            it will be used as a factor on point items. I give bards a 3 on the WDS to factor their
            odds 3x over caster classes that have a 1.&nbsp; Do not ever change the item numbers
            unless you make the same changes to historical data in the Winner sheet.<br>
            <strong>Groups</strong>: Looks up who is in what group based on Roster sheet. The buffer
            information is to the right of the groups and is entered manually.&nbsp; This sheet is
            before Roster in the workbook to make it easier to enter data (you'll spend most time on
            Roster sheet, use ctrl+up to get to Groups or ctrl+down to get to RaidPoints, easier than
            using mouse to change sheets).<br>
            <strong>Roster</strong>: Current raid roster sheet. Lot of formulas to look up data, so
            focus on yellow-shaded areas. Enter name and the formulas should look up class, level,
            guild, points, and calculate the loot numbers off to the right. Use the sort column to
            help prioritize people if you are flooded with attendees (if people sign in with large
            number of attendance+raid points, give them priority of 9, give 53+ buffers along to help
            an 8, and give new attendees a 5. As you finalize list, move the new attendees up to 9's).
            &nbsp; There is a macro in this sheet that helps resort the names based on: (1) sort
            column and then (2) name. When loots are done, enter then loot number at the numbers will
            recalc. To freeze the data, copy data from the column and paste special/value out to the
            right. There is a column that gives the text for websites for people to see their numbers.
            &nbsp; Loot calculations are broken out into a number of columns to make it easy to see
            what is going on and to verify accuracy. The group leader entered at top of sheet gets 3
            points instead of 1 on point items.&nbsp; After each raid, I take this info and put into a
            seperate sheet where I have listing of attendance for every raid (one raid below the
            other).<br>
            <strong>RaidPoints</strong>: List of every person and every raid. First few columns are
            used to enter data. There is a column for posting to websites to show current point
            balance. There are a few columns that calculate attendance, raid, book, and rds points,
            followed by transfer column and points for each raid. To make it easy, I have some top row
            &amp; bottom row cells at the top of the sheet that should correspond to Roster sheet.
            After a raid, I enter the rows, and for attendance, I copy values from &quot;I&quot; and
            paste-special values into &quot;J&quot; (I don't track attendance by raid, just totals). I
            then copy &quot;K&quot; and paste-special values into the corresponding raid (and then
            replace 0's with blanks), and then give any bonus points. I'll admit the transfer column
            is cludgy, but doing this by doing calculations on the Transfer sheet, resulted in 30
            second recalcs which slow you down immensely.<br>
            <strong>Winners</strong>: Enter winners into this sheet. You can do as each item is done
            during a raid or at the end of all the rolls. This sheet is also useful for transfers
            where you have to split different kinds of raid points.<br>
            <strong>Transfers</strong>: Detailed listing of all raid point transfers. Not used in
            calculations because another vlookup or sum (using array formulas) brings recalcs from 1-2
            sec to over 30. There is a column out to the right that presents information for posting
            to a site.<br>
            <strong>LootSummary</strong>: Look for trends in dragon loot drops. Just a pivot table
            using the data on the Winners sheet. Makes use of the track column to show/not show data.<br>
            <strong>WDSTrade</strong>: Use this sheet to random among any bards showing up to raid
            with Heiro cloak/WDS cloak in the event that a caster wins it.<br>
            <strong>Script</strong>: 50+ raid keys that I use during Vox/Nag raids.<br>
            <strong>Macros</strong> (not a sheet): 2 macros to sort data on Roster and WDSTrade sheet.<br>
            <br>
            <b>GROUPING</b><br>
            Groups can be made as follows:<br>
            main tank groups: 1 cleric, 1 bard, 1 paladin, 3 tanks<br>
            debuf group (dispell vox, tash, slow, DoT, and seive): 1 cleric, 1 bard, 1 shaman, 3 enc<br>
            caster groups: 6 48+ dru/wiz/mag/nec<br>
            reserve group: left overs<br>
            <br>
            For Raid: 4 main tank groups, 1 debuf group, 1 caster group, 1-2 reserve groups<br>
            <br>
            Put as many 50+ in first 2 tank groups that will be needed to rush/push/surround the
            dragon. Minimizes risk of fearing. Don't worry about balancing groups out. Make 2 solid
            kill groups and work down from there. Keep an experienced person to lead reserve groups
            that typically has lowest level/least experienced raiders.<br>
            <br>
            * If short on clerics, use any extra healing classes (shm/dru) instead. Can also put 3-4
            paladins per group. Group of 5 paladins 1 bard can last a very long time.<br>
            * If short on enchanters, have other classes dispell Vox. Have all bards twist in mana
            draining song.<br>
            * If short on bards, get more. Any group that does not have a bard should not be sent into
            fight until 50% (excluding debuf group that can stay out of AE range).<br>
