            <strong>MAR 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Lot of people were out and about tonight. Switched night from raid to just open experience
            and faction.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 28, 2002</strong><br>
            Definitely getting better at ToV.&nbsp; Cleared the halls of testing repeatedly and came
            away with more items than last two nights combined. Drops were: Plate BP [Kilwean], Plate
            Helm [Aorthin], Chain Boots [Alone], Plate Legs [Hawkien], Chain Sleeves [Dodja], Silk
            Robe [Kestel], Silk Pants [Xamren], Chain Tunic [Denor], 2 Silk Bracer [Silvercaster,
            Fenik], 2 Plate Gauntlets [Skylynn, Sylvanna], and Plate Arms [Xamia]. Made our way to
            exit and zoned back out. Grats to all the winners!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Another night in ToV's Hall of Testing.&nbsp; Many dragons fell this evening and we were
            amply rewarded with loots: Plate Boots [Maxist, Lisner], Plate Bracer [Sylvanna], Chain
            Helm [Khallin], Plate Breastplate [Awll], Silk Sleeves [Silvercaster], and Silk Boots
            [Kestel].&nbsp; At the end, we medded up and then began walk towards zone exit, only to
            have 4 mobs appear on us at once (nothing like bad agros through walls and bad
            pathing...).&nbsp; We had planned well though, and nearly all the groups were able to
            evac, a few corpses had to be summoned, but overall, great preparedness. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Came back to ToV with a vengance. This time, we cleared large portions of the East Hall.
            Lots of loots this evening! Plate Boots [Valstorm, Kilwean], Plate Helm [Lisner], Leather
            Boots [Chiun], Plate Gloves [Nato], Glowing Drake Orb [Shcammer], and a few other drops.
            &nbsp; Made our way to the exit and zoned back to the start.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Crimson Talon's first raid on ToV! We did portions of the East Hall. Still getting our
            feet wet, but still managed to get a chain arms and plate boots.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 23, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Camped near entrance and managed to get some minor loot.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Siren's Grotto. Went to bottom of the well and came away with numerous velious
            breastplate quest gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Severilous was up again tonight, and Lumper was waiting for him.&nbsp; He quickly put out
            the word in guildchat and we came scrambling from Siren's Grotto to help our warrior out.
            &nbsp; We quickly dispatched Severilous for the second time this week.&nbsp; Drops were:
            Green Dragon Scale [Lumper], Selos Drums of the March [Devaberiel], Rune Bolster Belt
            [Machedor], Dragon Bone Bracer [Dreamthief], and 4 nice spells.&nbsp; Machedor passed down
            his sash of the dragonborn, and a fbss was passed down after that.&nbsp; Grats to everyone
            and thanks to the guests that tagged along with us.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 18-20, 2002</strong><br>
            Coming off a few days in Kael Drakkal to work on faction. Camped different area of the
            zone each night and came away with some nice armour drops. Lots of plate drops last night
            and had enough items go get something to almost every plate user and some extras. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Chardok.&nbsp; Went after the royals and killed the prince and king with ease.
            Some other nice items dropped in the library off some named spawns.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Severilous was up this morning and we were lucky enough to see him. We hastily assembled a
            few groups and killed this wurm. Much easier to kill than some of the other dragons, just
            unfortunate he is insta-killed on every spawn. Drops were: Green Dragon Scale [Valstorm],
            McVaxious Horn of War [Devaberiel], weight bag [Barelil], and 5 spells (2 spirit of
            raptor, spirit of oak, word of redemption, visions of granduer).&nbsp; As a guild, we can
            now say that we have killed all the Kunark dragons.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Windarii for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 13, 2002</strong><br>
            With Frost book and Burnt book in hand, Chadmoe finished off the rest of the paladin epic
            quest this evening and is now the proud holder of a Fiery Defender!&nbsp; Grats to Chadmoe
            for obtaining his epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 11, 2002</strong><br>
            Big raid on Seblis for spells this evening and we came away with quite a haul; including
            some rare spells.&nbsp; Thanks to all that came to help our casters flush out the spell
            books a bit more.<br>
            <br>
            Congratulations to Dreamthief for finishing the rogue epic last night! Our epic rampage
            continues! <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 10, 2002</strong><br>
            The royals of Chardok were trash-talking once again, and we decided to end their reign.
            &nbsp; In quick order, we dispatched, the prince, king, and even the queen.&nbsp; Great
            job by everyone and congrats to all the people who got epic items.<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Zionmaster for making 60! <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 09, 2002</strong><br>
            Lot of news and epics this week!<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Khallin for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            Trip to Hate resulted in mage staff for Immolar and Klaminar finishing the second ranger
            epic Earthcaller!<br>
            <br>
            Trip to Fear to kill the broken golem resulted in Silvercaster finishing her wizard epic!<br>
            <br>
            Trip to Hole, for 2 enchanter epic items, 1 paladin item, and Tenara finishing her first
            ranger epic, Swiftwind!&nbsp; This after, a quick trip to CoM and luckily getting a jade
            reaver to finally drop.<br>
            <br>
            Killed General in Kithicor to get Dreamthief to within one item of rogue epic, just need
            to get an SMR now.<br>
            <br>
            Slayed the dragonfish again, resulting in Azenyth getting a druid epic!<br>
            <br>
            Biggest news of all, was Crimson Talon leading a raid on Gorenaire herself with just 33
            people (some close friends helped us a lot) and completely owned her with just 2 deaths.
            &nbsp; This, with limited cleric and bard support. Solid tactics and smart playing - the
            Crimson Talon way. &nbsp; Drops were: Frost Book [Chadmoe] and White Dragon Scale
            [Devaberiel]. Chadmoe is now in homestretch for paladin epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Yazz for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Klaminar for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind! Crimson Talon's 8th epic this
            year!<br>
            <br>
            Talendor was happily surveying his territory of wurm-infested lava calderas of Skyfire,
            when Crimson Talon decided to do some landscaping.&nbsp; We sent Devaberiel out to pull
            the beast to our trap, and slayed him losing only a couple people to the DoT not being
            dispelled in time.&nbsp; Brewall was a little dissapointed anyone died, but there is no
            greater glory than being slain by a dragon. Drops were Burnt Book [Chadmoe], Gauntlets of
            Firey Might [Ippit], and about six spells.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 22, 2002 </strong><br>
            Congrats to Gilthanus for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Spawned Faydedar this evening and cut him into some nice dragonfish steaks so Yazz could
            finish his epic. Venril Sathir was up as well, so we killed him to get Wiz epic staff,
            shaman legs, and a cleric weapon.&nbsp; From there, we moved on to kill mob for enchanter
            epic.&nbsp; Overall, a very good epic night.&nbsp; Congrats to Yazz for obtaining the
            Nature Walkers Scimitar!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Another guild was clearing fear tonight, so we had another open experience night. &nbsp;
            Killed Uulump for Yazz and now within Faydedar of epic.<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Alone for making 60!<br>
            Grats to Skylynn for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 18, 2002</strong><br>
            The real Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to take him down.&nbsp; Excellent job
            fighting down to the lair and great job on the battle.&nbsp; Trak collapsed into a pile of
            rotting flesh with minimal losses to our small force of 33.&nbsp; Drops were 2 SK
            Breastplates, 4 teeth [Groovit, Greymask, Shcammer, and Khallin], and some very nice spell
            drops.&nbsp; Although it took a while to kill him, we made off with some incredible spells
            and the glory of beating this foul wurm.<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Valstorm for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Dragon Necropolis this afternoon. Several nice gem drops and some other nice
            loots: Spirit Talkers Headdress [Denor], 4 Pabella Fetish, and several batskull earrings. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Chadmoe for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            Small group killed VSR this morning. Both Gilthanus and Maemura got stone for ranger epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Crimson Talon was just starting to assemble for guardian wurm killing in Skyfire Mountains
            when we quickly realized that something was amiss. &quot;Who will challenge me?&quot;
            boomed an NPC wurm named Scales. &quot;Who is brave enough to fight me?&quot;.&nbsp; We
            opted to take on the dragon runt and make him pay the price of his empty boasting.&nbsp; A
            few seconds into the fight, however, something was really, really wrong.&nbsp; People were
            vanishing virtually every second and appearing in random, mob-infested areas of - drumroll
            please - The Deep.&nbsp; After a few GM rezzes and some teleportations, we were back in
            Skyfire, attacked again (sans buggy summoning), and&nbsp; dispatched this wurm. &nbsp;
            Drops were molten cloak, diamondine earrings, and 2 non-magical swords.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the plane of air to finish off Fenik's necro epic. Grats to Fenik for
            obtaining the Scythe of the Shadowed Soul! Later that evening we went to the Hole and
            killed Master Yael in addition to getting some epic mobs along the way. <br>
            <strong><br>
            FEB 05, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Uggabuga for making 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 04, 2002</strong><br>
            Got necro epic drop this evening and moved a couple alts to the zone so we can resume at a
            higher island more quickly the next time we try this zone.&nbsp; Also helped some
            non-guild people get some epic items before we fell down.&nbsp; Fenik now has a few
            turn-ins to do and a revisit to 3rd island and we should have our first necro epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 03, 2002</strong><br>
            On Friday, we decided to hit the plane of air.&nbsp; By Sunday, we had made our way up to
            the sixth island and killed necro mob epic, but he failed to drop the item.&nbsp; We
            logged for the night and will try him again on Monday. Some of the drops today included:
            Sphere of Swirling Color (rng epic) [Klaminar, Riverwake, Ronthen, Gilthanus, Maemura],
            Belt of Pine (rng haste belt) [Riverwake], Belt of Contention (war haste belt) [All
            warriors on trip], Belt of Concordance (brd haste belt) [Devaberiel], Weight of the Gods
            (clr shoulder item [Skylynn + 2more). <br>
