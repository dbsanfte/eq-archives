      <p class="MainAreaLastUpdate"><span class="MainAreaTitle">History of the 
        Crimson Talon</span><br>
        <em>Last update: 12 November 2002</em></p>
      <p><span class="s2cA">Originally founded as a small mercenary company based 
        in Freeport, Crimson Talon primarily served as merchant escorts, usually 
        on the long Freeport to Qeynos caravan route. Soon the company became 
        moderately prosperous, providing protection to a small but wealthy group 
        of merchants. Crimson Talon was not unlike many other mercenary groups 
        of that or any other time, drawing members from many races and professions. 
        Nonetheless, the organization maintained a reputation for discipline and 
        reliable, honorable service.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, this period of prosperity was short-lived. Thank, a well-trusted 
        member of the company who served as its treasurer disappeared one day 
        with the bulk of Crimson Talon&#146;s wealth. He was found the next day, 
        still in Freeport, face down in the sewer with his throat slit. It was 
        surmised that he had been betrayed by his partners in crime who killed 
        him and made off with the loot.<br>
        <br>
        In a desperate attempt to remain solvent, the remaining members kept taking 
        jobs long into the winter, well beyond the normal end to the trading season. 
        On the last escort of that year, most of the company was shepherding a 
        small group of jewelers from Freeport to Qeynos. As the group reached 
        the base of Highhold Pass, the weather was starting to turn ugly. The 
        merchants were urged to postpone their journey until the spring or at 
        least until the weather cleared. They refused. The Crimson Talon captain 
        then pleaded with them to consider backtracking to take the more temperate 
        Southern route to Qeynos. The merchants responded by doubling their contracted 
        fee and demanding that the party press onward. Driven by greed and a desire 
        not to break faith with their employers, the Crimson Talons reluctantly 
        agreed to make an attempt on the pass. Leaving a few of their younger 
        members at the base of the trail to maintain a safe camp in the event 
        that weather or opposition forced a retreat, the merchants and mercenaries 
        marched into the pass and up into the gathering gloom. No member of that 
        party has been seen again.</span></p>
      <p><span class="MainAreaTitle">The Crimson Talon Today</span><br>
        <span class="s2cA">After the disaster at Highhold Pass, Crimson Talon 
        lies nearly broken, far from the heights of its former power. The members 
        who remain, however, have sworn themselves to the task of rebuilding. 
        The remaining sell-swords and the new members they have recruited have 
        reformed the organization from an one driven by the whims of foreign masters 
        into a society dedicated to making its own destiny. Its members have sworn 
        that the greed and ignorance of others will never again lead them to ruin. 
        Thus their motto:<br>
        <br>
        Destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice. It is not 
        a thing to be waited for. It is a thing to be achieved.</span></p>
      <p><span class="MainAreaTitle">Tenets of Belief</span><br>
        <span class="s2cA">The following are the core beliefs of the Crimson Talon.<br>
        <br>
        * Accept all in brotherhood that would pledge truly to the cause.<br>
        * Give loyalty to those who are loyal to you.<br>
        * Never allow yourself to be blindly led.<br>
        * Help the deserving without cost or profit. Never help those who do not 
        deserve help without cost or profit.<br>
        * Pursue your enemies and destroy them utterly for to do otherwise is 
        to plant the seeds of your own demise.<br>
        <br>
        The symbol of Crimson Talon is a crimson talon clenched as if it were 
        a fist. Rivulets of crimson the color of fresh blood stain the talon, 
        and pour from its crushing grip</span> </p>
