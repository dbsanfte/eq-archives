        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: July 25 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies for a tenth time at the hands of Crimson Talon 
        and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle.<br>
        <br>
        To say that people are interested in killing dragons is an understatement. 
        More and more people show each raid and it's difficult to pick those that 
        make the raid list. &nbsp; These are truely open attendance raids, there 
        are typically 20+ guilds in attendance, and usually only 5-6 from Crimson 
        Talon, as many are now beyond the 52 dragon cap.<br>
        <br>
        Was interesting start at the raid when all of Vox guards were pulled out 
        in one fell swoop at the start.&nbsp; Did have a bit of a problem with 
        residual dragon agro, requiring everyone to camp, but made the raid go 
        very quickly. This also made for an excellent multi-mob battle to warm 
        everyone up.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too 
        late. Sending additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time 
        attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. 
        Sometimes, I just can't add people and keep things going smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: I originally wrote down 2 DBB's and 1 Rez Stick. I didn't realize 
        my error until I after I did second roll. Sorry Trueth.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:00.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>McVaxious Horn of War</b> (4) Ferdinand<br>
        <b>Dragon Bone Bracelet</b> (2) Sintosa<br>
        <b>Ice Comet</b> (1) Grimstaff<br>
        <b>Kayrul's Mystical Pouch</b> (19) Irrenne (first roll was 16. Ferdinand, 
        cannot win 2 items. Rerolled.)<br>

        <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> (38) Saltz<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. People need to report in when I shout for names. If you do not send 
        in your name, you are not even on my radar to be assigned to a group. 
        It takes me a while to go through tells, and I rarely miss someone.<br>
        2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        3. Definitely have limits now on people and enforced them last night. 
        No LD and lag was quite reasonable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        4. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are 
        continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may 
        be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.</p>
