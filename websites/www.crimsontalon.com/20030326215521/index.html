        Grats to Sabretta for finishing the Shadow Knight epic and obtaining the 
        new sword named 'George'.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 19, 2003</strong><br>
        Grats to Denor for reaching 65!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 18, 2003</strong><br>
        NToV was FFA this evening, so we decided to make our first trip deep into 
        the zone and to kill as many dragons as we could. We weren't dissapointed! 
        Mazrien: Shield of the Protector [Hawkien]. Then Koi: Trident of the Deep 
        Sea [Runehammer], Ancient Pirate Eyepatch [Chadmoe], and Helm of the Deep 
        Sea [Nantuil]. Killed Zlexak next: Dragon Skin Bracelet [Proetus] and 
        Baton of Flame [Bruise]. Cekenar followed: Frosted Iron Spike [Teeni] 
        and Maljeldin, Bane of Giants [Sabretta]. Sevalak perished dropping 2 
        Axe of Resistance [Jollander and Tarrask]. Jorlleag dead: Earring of the 
        Icecrasher [Lathrim], Crown of Resistance [Chiun], and a Facesmasher [Wynndy]. 
        Lastly, we killed the Lady: 2 Cloak of Thorns [Teranick and Windarii]. 
        A lot of new encounters in a new area!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 16, 2003</strong><br>
        Ventured into Grieg's End this evening to kill Grieg himself. Our tactics 
        and execution were flawless resulting in our first ever Grieg kill!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 15, 2003</strong><br>
        Looking for some things to kill, we decided on hitting WToV. Killed Gozz: 
        Shovel of the Harvest [Chiun] and Rekeklo's War Sword [Sabretta]. Then 
        Telk: 2 Circlet of Suffering [Proetus &amp; Physst] and a Lance of Thunder. 
        Then Lend: Talisman [Brewall].</p>
      <p><strong>Mar 14, 2003</strong><br>
        We are all very thankful as a guild to be made up of players that like 
        to play EQ as a game and treat each other like family. As we have progressively 
        climbed up the encounter difficulty ladder, we remember where we came 
        from and how long we have played together. Cherishing our friendship, 
        we stay together, and look forward to the next new encounter and challenge. 
        In just the last month, we have taken on and killed: The Statue of Rallos 
        Zek, the Avatar of War, Aaryonar, and the 10th coldain ring war. NToV 
        and other new encounters are coming up as well. <strong>Next!</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 13, 2003</strong><br>
        An epic day today as a few groups were able to slay long-outstanding mobs 
        that have a horrible habit of never dropping their epic items. Sabretta 
        was able to obtain the Essense from the Ashenbone Drake in hate, the hand 
        of maestro for Dakatsu, and a Magi kill for Fluteria. After countless 
        empty kills, they all managed to drop what we were looking for! <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 12, 2003</strong><br>
        We made a raid into VP again this evening after tearing it up the last 
        three weeks. It seems the zone was bugged though with a few things that 
        made it virtually impossible to move into the zone. Chanters could not 
        mez or charm ANY mob in the zone (huge nerf to enchanters if this was 
        intentional) and there were numerous mobs with absolutely insane regen. 
        Regen on some mobs was so high you could beat on it and see its health 
        ticking back up after a wizard nuke that would barely dent it. In the 
        end, we took our fustrations out on another zone...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 11, 2003</strong><br>
        Another successful joint raid with OC on the Avatar of War and his henchmen. 
        Drops were very generous: Chestplate of Vindication [Tigerbane], Hammer 
        of Battle [Kynlore], Reaver [Tico], Iron Scroll of War [Kridak], Blade 
        of Carnage [Cmgal], Helm of Rallos Zek [Trast]. After that, we went on 
        to kill Sontalak for our very first time and took him down flawlessly: 
        Sontalak's Talisman [Tigersbane], Circlet of Silver Skies [Justan], Rekelos 
        War Sword [Dexuran], and numerous spell drops. The West ToV dragons fell 
        shortly after that.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 10, 2003</strong><br>
        Eigth shawl quest for Skylynn this evening. Protected the General and 
        Skylynn is now the proud owner of the 8th Coldain shawl congrats!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 09, 2003</strong><br>
        PoI factory raid which was followed up with finishing the 8th shawl for 
        Brewall. Probably one of the few bards that has this item and this may 
        have spurned all the casters into finishing it as well.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 08, 2003</strong><br>
        Off to kill the Avatar of War again, and we weren't disappointed. Another 
        flawless kill resulting in: Flayed Barbarian Hide Leggings [Ashant, Wynndy], 
        Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask [Kitpoke], and a Helmet of Ralos Zek [Kynlore].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 07, 2003</strong><br>
        We stormed into Fear with our friends in OC to kill Cazic Thule. After 
        clearing the zone, we sent our bards out to pull him into our trap netting 
        us: Groteque Girdle [Zionmaster], Crimson Robe of Aledine [Satashi], Pauldrons 
        of Ferocity [Shinlae], Cloak of the Fearsome [Bruize], and a Bile Etched 
        Obsidian Choker [Riverwake].<br>
        <br>
        We also killed the Kael statue with loots of: Breastplate of Eradication 
        [Kilwean], Shard of Hsaga's Talisman [Chiun], Cloak of Falling Stars [Jonasin], 
        and 2 Reavers.<br>
        <br>
        Tormax also fell to us for a first time kill! Drops were: Shard of Hsaga's 
        Talisman [Tico], King Tormax's Head, and 4 count'em 4 White Dragon Scale 
        Sashes [Tribul, Bimie, Kandye, and Fayluna].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 6, 2003</strong><br>
        Ringwar! Tonight, the forces of CT and OC combined to fight our first 
        tenth coldain ringwar. Fenik turned in the orders and the war was on. 
        Lasting just a tad over two hours, we slayed wave after wave of giants. 
        In the end, our forces prevailed and we reveled in our victory over the 
        giants. All of the coldain heros were kept safe, adding to our loot bounty. 
        Grats to Fenik on the ring and to OC for the lance and crown.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 5, 2003</strong><br>
        Brewall has posted maps of all LoY zones in the guild only area of the 
        site. Still has to do drawing versions, but at least the in-game cartography 
        should work for those who download the files.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mar 4, 2003</strong><br>
        We went back to Veeshan's Peak tonight and just plain tore the place up.<br>
        <strong>Hoshkar</strong> was very generous to us tonight [Grey Suede Boots]x2 
        Maxist, Altus. [Feverblade - Bane of the Shissar]x2 Dreamthief, Kitpoke<br>
        <strong>Silverwing</strong> dropped some craptastic loot [Scimtar of Lifestealing] 
        Kitpoke, [Robe of Smothering][Dragon Spine Staff][Lyran's Mystical Lute](we 
        couldn't give them away).<br>
        <strong>Phara Dar</strong> gave us a new loot tonight [Crown of Rile] 
        Khandrahcir, [Claw of Phara Dar]x2 Kitpoke, Dakatsu<br>
        <strong>Xygoz</strong>[Smoldering Cudgel] Klaminar, [Frozen Zweihander]x2 
        Maxist,rot.<br>
        <strong>Druushk</strong> gave a new toy [Sarnak Summoners Staf] Immolar, 
        [Maelstrom] Romell, [Skullcrusher of Kragg][Katana of endurance]craptastic.<br>
        <strong>Nexona</strong> has to be the hardest dragon in the zone, to pull, 
        to fight, we lose more people fighting this mob than any other in the 
        zone as well as the pull team a few times. [Nightfall] Kitpoke, [Robe 
        of Adversity] Sardilaav (BG), [Star of the Guardian]rot.<br>
        We completely cleared the zone in right at 3 hours of fighting, our first 
        single night clearing of all of the dragons in VP<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 27, 2003</strong><br>
        Tonight, the <strong>Idol</strong> was up and needed some company in Kael. 
        So, we gathered the forces of CT/OC and killed him and once again slayed 
        the <strong>Avatar of War</strong>. Congrats to all of the winners, what 
        a busy week our alliance has had. [Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings] Physst, 
        [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Runehammer(OC), and [Helmet of Rallos Zek] 
        Valstorm.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 26, 2003</strong><br>
        We are starting to like it when small patches happen and the servers are 
        brought down. <strong>Aaryonar</strong> Is apparently the mob that you 
        have to kill to get a spot in the NToV rotation. It spawned, it died. 
        [Amulet of the Dreadgazer] Chiun, [Rocksmasher] Sparty(OC) [Reapers Ring] 
        Whosane(OC).<br>
        <br>
        This has secured our spot on the NToV rotation which is after BG/CoG and 
        currently due to start our week on March 19.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 25, 2003</strong><br>
        What a busy week we have had. Tonight once again we killed <strong>Vindi</strong> 
        [Chestplate of Vindication] Barelil, <strong>Idol</strong> and <strong>AoW</strong> 
        [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Teeni (OC), [War Bow of Rallos Zek] Klaminar/Jollander(OC) 
        with Obsidian Coven.<br>
        <br>
        After that we moved over to NToV for a few quick kills and got <strong>Eashen 
        of the Sky </strong> [Twisted Steel Gauntlets] Maxist, [Twisted Steel 
        Bastard Sword] Cmgal(OC). And <strong>Ikitar</strong> which was kind enough 
        to drop [Ancient Wyvern Leggings] Tigerstorm, [Cloak of Venom] Fenik.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 24, 2003</strong><br>
        Tonight we went to WToV and took out <strong>Gozzrem</strong> [Bracelet 
        of Protection] Klaminar, [Shovel of Harvest] Altus, [Rekelo's War Sword]. 
        After that we moved over and did an instapull to clear everything around 
        <strong>Lendiniara the Keeper</strong> [Truesight Helmet] Hawkien, [Velium 
        Maul of Superiority] Kitpoke, [Lendiniara's Talisman] Khallin.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 23, 2003</strong><br>
        Another successful raid with Obsidian Coven. Cleared fear in about 2 hours 
        and proceded to kill Cazic-Thule himself.<br>
        <strong>Cazic-Thule</strong>: [Brain of Cazic Thule] Xern (OC), [Halo 
        of the Enlightened] Gish, [Bile Etched Obsidian Choker] Bronx (OC)<br>
        <br>
        We then went over to Cazic-Thule and gave the Ring of Fear a try. For 
        those of you who haven't done this event, man it's fun. We learned a lot 
        killed mobs like <strong>Avatar of Dread</strong> [Dread Coronet] Polyneices, 
        and the <strong>Avatar of Fright</strong> [Mantle of Paralyzing Fright] 
        Teranick (OC). The <strong>Avatar of Terror</strong> got the best of us 
        however. But next time it will definitely be a different story...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 20, 2003</strong><br>
        After some talk with Obsidian Coven, The forces of CT and OC decided to 
        do a joint raid to see how things would work out. Man did it work out 
        well.<br>
        <br>
        On our first attempt ever and first time to team up, we went to Kael Drakkal. 
        <strong>Vindi</strong> died easily, and the <strong>Statue</strong> spawned 
        so we gave it a go. What a chump, he dropped fast. So we then went ahead 
        and killed the <strong>Idol</strong> and <strong>AoW</strong> spawned. 
        With around 65 people there few gave us a shot at taking out AoW but...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Avatar of War</strong> has been slain by Maxist!<br>
        <br>
        Congrats to all of the winners. [Chestplate of Vindication] Denor, [Sleepers 
        Tomb Key] Gish, [Swiftblade of Zek] Dakatsu, <strong>AoW</strong> loots: 
        [Blade of Carnage] Valstorm, [Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask] Brewall, Congrats 
        to OC for the Cloak of Falling Stars, Iron Scroll of War, Hammer of Battle, 
        Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask, and Helmet of Rallos Zek.<br>
        <br>
        After that CT went over and killed <strong>Trakanon</strong> again and 
        got [Donal's Chestplate of Mourning] Ceeni, [Singing Steel Breastplate] 
        Brewall, and 4 teeth.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 19, 2003</strong><br>
        After a slight problem in Plane of Air going after the Warrior epic part. 
        Our forces ran over to West Temple of Veeshan to kill some dragons.<br>
        <strong>Gozzrem:</strong> 2x[Rekklo's War Sword] Tico/Dakatsu, [Bracelet 
        of Protection] Klaminar.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 17, 2003</strong><br>
        EQMaps has just posted 4 of Brewall's maps and 2 revised maps. These maps 
        have been available within the guild for quite some time and are just

        Hey, anyone wanna kill a dragon? Sure, lets go kill Telkenor in WToV. 
        Flawless victory!<br>
        <strong>Telkenor:</strong> Neclace of Nightstalking [Czad], Pauldrons 
        of Blight [Stien]<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 12, 2003</strong><br>
        Veeshan's Peak falls to Crimson Talon! After two hard fought nights and 
        a few months of working on our strategy, Crimson Talon cleared all of 
        the dragons of Veeshan's Peak.<br>
        <br>
        Alot of hard work and effort has been put in by our members to get keyed 
        up. In all it took us two years or so to get our keys done and we still 
        have a few people still needing to finish their quest. Some guilds have 
        completed the Kunark expansion faster than we have, but most haven't done 
        VP at all! WTG Crimson Talon<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Nexona:</strong> Nightfall [Dreamthief], Sprinkler of Suffering 
        x2 [Aorthin, Bormer], Robe of Adversity [Fenik]<br>
        This completes our conquest of Veeshan's Peak and the Kunark expansion.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Feb 11, 2003</strong><br>
        Veeshan's Peak was under heavy attack this evening by the forces of Crimson 
        Talon. Many dragons and their ilk fell to our swords and magics:<br>
        <strong>Hoshkar:</strong> Grey Suede Boots [Kuriosity], Sword of the Shissar 
        [Dreamthief], Shissar Protection Staff [Skylynn], Green Dragon Scales, 
        Emmissary of Thule<br>
        <strong>Phara Dar:</strong> Robe of Azure Sky[Zionmaster], Shield of Elders 
        [Tico]<br>
        <strong>Xygoz:</strong> Left Eye of Xygoz [Silvercaster], Razor Fang of
