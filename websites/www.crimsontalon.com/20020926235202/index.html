            Killed Trakanon again to obtain more teeth. Drops were: 2 Teeth [Klaminar, Lumper], Donal
            BP [Aorthin], and a Cobalt BP [Guild bank].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished Aorthin's epic this evening. Grats to Aorthin for the water sprinkler! Ragefire
            also dropped 3 red dragon scales. Would have preferred 3 cloak of flames.&nbsp; From
            there, we did a bit more epic work in the Hole.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Experience night after a lot of raiding. A few of us went over to skyfire and managed to
            obtain 2 more shards within an hour using Brewall's patented camping technique. Aorthin is
            just a Ragefire away from epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Another night in ToV. Got off to a slow start, but then we cleared the Halls of Testing in
            record time. Drops were very light for plate, but the other classes were very happy.
            Loots: Chain BP [Shcammer], Leather Gloves [rotted], Silk Wrist [Chantress], Chain Helmet
            [Dreamthief], Chain Legs [Klaminar], White Symbol [Brewall], Leather Legs [for MQ], and a
            Silk Turban [Kestel].<br>
            <br>
            After we zoned out of ToV, we realized that Escorpa was up, and with information
            consisting of 'has a drop I need', we decided to attack. On our first attempt, we had
            Escorpa down to under ten percent when it gated on us. We quickly recovered and pummelled
            Escorpa on the second attempt without losing a single person. Not bad for learning a mob
            on the fly, and testifies to the good players within the guild. Drops were a Talisman
            [Groovit] and a Book.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 17/18, 2002</strong><br>
            Played around with Grieg a couple times. Good learning experience for us, and perhaps with
            a bit more weapons and armour we will try again in the near future.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 16, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV, The Halls of Testing. Cleared the entire east side of the zone without difficulty.
            Drops were: Chain Boots [Khallin], Plate Bracer [Gish], Ruby Symbol [Klaminar], Poison
            Symbol [Kestel], Silk Arms [Zionmaster], Plate Gaunts [Devaberiel], and Runed Symbol
            [Maxist]. We were resoundingly successful killing Dozekar a second time as well.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Khandrahcir for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 11, 2002</strong><br>
            Dozekar perished to our hands for the first time this evening.&nbsp; Having never fought
            him before, we devised a strategy and then attacked.&nbsp; In our first attempt, we had
            him down to 70, but decided to camp out in an organized fashion and reattempt with a
            different strategy and groups.&nbsp; The second attempt was significantly smoother and we
            were able to kill him with only a stray death.&nbsp; Drops were a Poison Tear [Klaminar]
            and White Tear [Machedor].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the halls of testing and cleared the east wing several times for armour drops
            and symbols.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 09, 2002</strong><br>
            More cleric epics. This time for Ceeni and Bormer.&nbsp; Now that the Ragefire camp-a-thon
            has been removed guilds that can't be on 24x7 have been taking advantage of this welcome
            change.&nbsp; Nice to see all the different guilds finishing off shards and working with
            one another to line up spawn order.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished off Ixibalt so more clerics are ready for Ragefire. A lot of shard camping the
            last couple nights.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 04, 2002</strong><br>
            Unbelievable day.&nbsp; With the changes to Ragefire spawn, we decided as a guild to
            concentrate our efforts and finish off some of our cleric epics.&nbsp; Over 45 members
            formed an army and laid waste to hundreds of wurms, drakes, and other dragon-ilk. &nbsp;
            Our clerics collected the the precious shards as we worked out spawn arrangement order
            with other guilds in the zone.&nbsp; The effort was well worth it:<br>
            Grats to Skylynn for obtaining the cleric epic!<br>
            Grats to Awll for obtaining the cleric epic!<br>
            <br>
            Amongst the loots were a Treasure Hunter's Satchel [Altus], Red Dragon Scale [Tresten],
            and several other items.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 03, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Riverwake for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 02, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Sylvanna for finishing our first Shadow Knight epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 01, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Gilthanus for reaching 60!<br>
            Grats to Kandrahcir for finishing his epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 29, 2002</strong><br>
            The Dain needed help with an accessory and Kestel decided to help.&nbsp; Excellent
            turn-out once again by the Crimson Talon forces to help Kestel beat back the horde of
            giants and protect a clueless dwarf. Grats to Kestel for completing the Eigth Shawl. Grats
            to Kestel!<br>
            <br>
            Brewall achieves the original inspiration of his name and is now a grandmaster brewer -
            250 (the other inspiration was brewing 4 batches of beer/ale in RL and receiving EQ from
            his brother as a b-day present the same day, but that is a much longer story...)<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 28, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kenatal for finishing the necro epic! QUACK QUACK!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Second day in the Plain of Air.&nbsp; Obtained numerous warrior blades and the necessary
            paladin and necro items.&nbsp; Overall, a successful raid.&nbsp; We were tempted to press
            higher, but with no mages needing the seventh isle, we decided to return back to the
            mortal world.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 24, 2002</strong><br>
            The long-awaited return to the plain of air.&nbsp; Excellent turn-out from the guild in
            support of those that need epics.&nbsp; Definitely a guild where everyone puts aside
            personal gain to help others.&nbsp; Pulvarized mobs up to the third isle in record time.
            &nbsp; Goal is to obtain some warrior, paladin, and necro items.<br>
            <br>
            Alone missed the port to Luclin and decided to meet out some vengance upon the gatekeeper.
            &nbsp; The body was later mistaken by the coroner as a porcupine from all the arrows in
            it. Details <u><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3114">here</a></u>.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 23, 2002</strong><br>
            Trakanon's lease on Seblis expired and we went into his lair to evict him.&nbsp; Instead
            of throwing him out, we decided just to slay the foul beast. Drops were: Donal's BP
            [Bormer], Cloak [Kilwean], and 4 Teeth [Physst, Silvercaster, Proetus, and Ceeni].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Gilthanus for finishing the ranger epic for Earthcaller!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 21, 2002</strong><br>
            This night's raid was Hate in order to get a ranger stone.&nbsp; We quickly cleared our
            way through the first level and proceeded to work on the second.&nbsp; Drops on the second
            floor were very light (as always - that zone really needs a better drop rate). After
            dozens and dozens of kills, we managed to get a Darkmetal Falchion.&nbsp; Innoruuk seemed
            to be aware of our presence and just before we pulled him, he ran out of the building to
            another spot! We rescouted and then fought an epic battle with the god.&nbsp; Overall
            great fight and only one death. Drops were: Eye [holding], Icebelt [Denor], Pauldrons
            [Karrzem-guest], Triumphant Mask [Machedor], Ring of Pure Blood [Awll], and a Shattered
            Emerald [Gilthanus].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Started the night in ToV, but another guild was already present.&nbsp; We did the right
            hallway for a bit, until we decided to try Vindicator.&nbsp; We ported other quickly and
            barely paused from our sprint to the arena to kill the giants in our way.&nbsp; Then, a
            flawless pull and a well executed fight later, we divided up Vindi's loot: Living Thunder
            Earring [Signarius] and Head [Dunskye].<br>
            <br>
            Our posse then moved on to Fear to kill all the minis in the hope of getting a SK epic
            piece.&nbsp; The mobs seemed to drop everything else except what we were looking for
            including: Shield, Claws, Puppet Strings, and a Trunk.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to ToV and the Halls of Testing for the night. Drops were very light even though
            we cleared it multiple times: Plate Arms [Machedor], Silk Arms [Talonclaw], Chain Legs
            [Zoranna], 2 Plate Bracer [Aorthin, Maxist], 2 Chain Arms [Denor, Maemura], Leather Arms
            [Polyneices], and Chain Bracer [Wildfern]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 18, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Denor for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Goratrix for completing the wizard epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 15, 2002</strong><br>
            Trakanon is dead again, another flawless killing. Drops were Bard BP, SK BP, Hardened Clay
            Bracelet [Kestel], Peacebringer [Barelil], and 4 teeth [Tippe, Altus, Skylynn, and Ippit].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed Talendor to start the evening. He actually died so fast, most of the tanks hadn't
            even gotten the chance to get one hit in. Drops were excellent: Torbins Eyepatch
            [Dunskye], Cloak of Flames [Tico], Runed Bolster Belt [Maxist - handdown from Tico],
            Runebranded Girdle [Lisner - handdown from Maxist], Shield of the Red Dragon [undecided],
            Orb of Tishan [undecided].<br>
            <br>
            From there, we went up to the moon and killed the Servitor of Luclin. Drops were: Wand of
            Musing [Silvercaster] and Sombrous Claidmore [Uggabuga].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 13, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed Vindicator. Drops were Boots [Khandrahcir] and Head [Polyneices].<br>

            Open experience night.&nbsp; Brewall used the time to do a detailed map of Jaggedpine
            Forest.&nbsp; All but the darkpaw cave and neriad caves are done.&nbsp; Will be posting to
            guild board early next week.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed Trakanon again this evening. The raid was flawless, and even though we had minimal
            manaburn crew, we still killed him with ease.&nbsp; Drops were: Beastlord BP [randomed for
            sale], Rogue BP, Spells, and 5 teeth [Kuriosity, Windarii, Azenyth, Dodja, and Maxist].<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Raided Chardok this evening to kill the royalty. We easily slayed the prince, king, and
            queen. Congrats to Machedor for finishing the warrior epic!<br>

            Grats to Dunskye for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            Found Venril up and cobbled together a minimal crew with what we had on to kill him. Grats
            to Goratrix for getting wizard staff, just a broken golem away from epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 31, 2002</strong><br>
            Another clearing or two of the Halls of Testing. Loots: 2 Plate Legs [Kilwean, Brewall],
            Plate Helm [Lilsong], Plate Bracer [Machedor], Leather Gloves [Windarii], Plate Boots
            [Tarrask], Poison Symbol [Zypheal], and a Silk Wrist.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 30, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to ToV and the Halls of Testing. A very odd night, very few armour drops, but we
            killed an enormous number of named mobs. Loots were: Silk Legs [Immolar], Flame Kissed
            Symbol [Lisner], White Symbol [Machedor], Serrated Symbol [Maxist], Black Symbol
            [Polyneices], Chain Tunic [Yakkai], Leather Legs [Proeteus], Runed Symbol [Altus], Silk
            Arms[Jheball], and Emerald Symbol [Gilthanus].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Trakanon perished again to the forces of the Crimson Talon.&nbsp; Flawless killing with
            only 1 death due to the shroom port.&nbsp; Drops were: Wildlord Tunic [Kuriosity], SK BP
            [banked], Undead Dragon Sinew [Proetus], 4 Teeth [Polynecies, Chadmoe, Khandrahcir, and
            Zoranna]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Sev was roaming around in Emerald Jungle and we decided to quickly take him down. Killed
            him again so that another one of our warriors could get a coveted green scale.&nbsp; Loots
            were: Green Dragon Scale [Machedor], Shield of the Green Dragon [Azenyth], Mask of the
            Hunter [Dunskye], and Spirit of Oak [Windarii].<br>
            <br>
            GM event in the Swamp of No Hope in the tunnel to Trakanon's Teeth. A dragon was in the
            caves where the frogloks used to be and was red to level 60's.&nbsp; Although we were able
            to assemble 3+ full groups with 3 MB wizards, we didn't have any clerics on.&nbsp; Simply
            bad timing as several got on later that night.&nbsp; Another guild played around with the
            mob for a few hours before finally killing him;&nbsp; loot was a ranger belt.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to cut down his minions and slay the undead
            dragon himself.&nbsp; We decided to fight Trak on the bridge and even though he ported on
            us at 0.001 percent health, we still killed him losing only 1 person (from the shroom
            port). Excellent fighting and heads-up thinking by everyone dealing with Trak's escape.
            Drops were 5 teeth [Minmin, Immolar, Barelil, Chantress, and Kestel], Cleric BP [Skylynn],
            and a Cloak of Piety [Khandrahcir]. Grats to all.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kestel for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 23, 2002</strong><br>
            Big raid on Akheva Ruins.&nbsp; Crawled the entire zone from end-to-end. Another exciting
            evening as we tackled lots of new mobs and brand-new encounters.<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Maemura for completing the ranger epic for Swiftwind!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Guild raid to crawl Grieg's end.&nbsp; Went from Dawnshroud to Scarlet and a few detours
            along the way.&nbsp; The guild map of the zone is definitely getting better, but if anyone
            sees missing information, please tell Brewall.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Lumper for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 18, 2002</strong><br>
            Another big raid on Siren's Grotto. This time to explore the temple area.&nbsp; Definitely
            fun to see new areas and enrich our gem coffers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Took a long tour tonight of Siren's Grotto. We crawled around the zone making quite a few
            loops.&nbsp; Was a lot of new content for many of us and few of us had seen all the
            sights.&nbsp; Gem drops were excellent and we replenished our guild gem bank quite well.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 09, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again. Plate BP [Khandrahcir], Plate Gauntlets [Maxist], Plate Boots [Saulk], Chain
            Arms [Gilthanus], Plate Bracer [Gish], Silk Bracer [Imotep], Plate Boots [Skylynn], and
            Plate Helm [Lumper].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the Halls of Testing for some armour.&nbsp; Cleaned the wing out a few times
            and were rewarded with: Silk Legs [Greymask], Plate Legs [Ceeni], Plate Boots [Machedor],
            Chain BP [Maemura], Silk Sleeves [Lumadin], Leather Legs [Kuriosity], Chain BP [Udian],
            Chain Sleeves [Shcammer], Plate BP [Valstorm], Chain Gloves [Lotera], Plate Gauntlets
            [Tico], Plate Arms [Zypheal], and White Symbol [Tomwin].<br>

            Miscellaneous epic questing and experience questing for a few days while people are off
            for the holiday weekend.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 01, 2002</strong><br>
            We were killing some guardian wurms in skyfire this evening, when Talendor decided to make
            an appearance.&nbsp; Having slain this beast several times, we resolved to repeat his
            demise.&nbsp; Grats to Khandrahcir for burnt book!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 30, 2002</strong><br>

            Returned to ToV for some more armour.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Large raid on Dragon Necropolis.&nbsp; Toured the zone and collected some gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Quick trip into Fear this evening to get the Wraith of Shissar that Chantress has been
            camping for weeks now. Grats to Chantress for getting our second enchanter epic in just
            days!&nbsp; While we were there, Yain showed up and needed the broken golem.&nbsp; Since
            we were there, we killed broken golem for him.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished Kestel's enchanter epic this evening with a quick trip to kill the Tangrin and
            final turn-in's.&nbsp; Grats to Kestel for getting his epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 18, 2002</strong><br>
            We needed a few epic items from Hate and decided to raid it this evening.&nbsp; On the
            first floor, we managed to get Kestel's vampire essence, 2 Eyes of Innoruuk [Imotep &amp;
            Kenatal] and Alone's Ranger stone. &nbsp; After laying waste to the first floor, we
            decided that we wanted our first Inny kill.&nbsp; We ventured out to the second floor and
            cleared the way to the god of hate. One excellently executed fight later, Inny lay dead at
            our feet.&nbsp; Grats to Immolar for the Pauldron's of Power!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 13, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again this evening. Drops: Leather BP [Aerayn], Plate Bracer, Leather Gloves, Plate
            Legs [Lilsong], Leather Boots [Physst], Silk Turban [Immolar], Plate Boots [Sylvanna],
            Runed Symbol [Altus], Leather Boots [Ippit], Leather Boots, Leather Legs [Altus], Chain
            Gloves [Barelil, no, Denor, no, Dreamthief, no, Dodja, ok, Klaminar], and Chain Legs
            [Dodja]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to Halls of Testing. Drops: Silk Boots [Mmatil], Plate Legs [Zypheal, Awll,
            Lisner], Silk Bracer [Mmatil], Silk Arms [Jarheuu, Groovit], and Leather Arms [Aerayn].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 11, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kilwean for obtaining the bard epic singing short sword!<br>
            <br>
            We also decided to try the Grimling High Priest in Acrylia.&nbsp; We brought two groups
            (spoiler sites suggested three), and we were complete overkill.&nbsp; Mobs barely lasted 5
            seconds as we killed the would-be repelers.&nbsp; After over an hour of killing them,
            watching the blood dry, and playing gems, the Grimling High Priest finally took matters
            into his own hands.&nbsp; Only problem was that once we had him down to 10 percent, he
            poofed. Not gated. Poofed.&nbsp; At least we got a few bone chips. Still, Brewall is
            making a few adjustments to his map from the explorations.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Denor for finishing the Shaman epic!&nbsp; At the same time as the CoM raid, we
            broke into Fear and proceeded to clear the zone.&nbsp; Lot of BP drops, too bad no one
            needed them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Dreamthief for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Cleared out Fear this evening for some epic loots: Broken Golem [Minmin], Amy whip
            [Kilwean], and Shissar [Kestel]. After that, we went to Kael arena to slay giants once
            again and came away with chain legs, plate legs, and a plate bp.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 06, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed both Severilous and Talendor today.&nbsp; Sev was stingy and dropped a dragon bone
            bracer [Chadmoe], Pouch [Greymask], and 6 spells - no green scale though.&nbsp; We
            followed that up with Talendor, but no books. Loots from these raids, even with our mana
            burning crew, is always given to guildmates - and are never sold.&nbsp; These two kills on
            top of a big dungeon crawl of Grieg's End. If you have never done a crawl of a dungeon
            before, you are really missing out. We've gotten much faster as a guild on quick assembly
            and rapid fire take out of the Kunark dragons. We have killed all 4 within the past 3 days
            - and yes, we are killing them because we want the items, not to sell them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 05, 2002</strong><br>
            We decided to raid the Hole to get a slew of needed epic items. We quickly fought our way
            down to Nortlav and dispatched the rusty weilding fighter. Grats to Kilwean for the Red
            Dragon Scale.&nbsp; Also killed many other epic mobs on the way back up for everyone else
            who needed something.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 04, 2002</strong><br>
            As a guild, we have been working hard and refining our tactics. Looking back on the last
            few months, we have steadily moved up the ladder of difficulty, and tonight was no
            exception. Coming off last nights two dragon raids, we wanted more. First, we decided to
            make our first attempt on Vindicator, and we were wildly successful. Loots were: Head
            [Tomwin], and Boots of the Vindicator [Awll].<br>
            <br>
            After we plowed Vindicator into dust, we decided to make our first attempt on Velketor.
            &nbsp; With no one with any prior experience with the fight, we still managed to kill him.
            &nbsp; Two big mobs in one night - again.&nbsp; Loots were: Shield of Freezing Wind
            [Chadmoe], Vermillion of Refraction [Mmatil], Crystal Crown of Confusion [Jarheuu], and 5
            spells.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 03, 2002</strong><br>
            The dragon hunting force was in full swing last night.&nbsp; We started in Dreadlands with
            Gorenaire, and dispatched the dragon with much fanfaire. Drops were nice for epics: WDS
            [Kilwean] and 2 Frost Books [Hawkien, Khandrahcir]. After Gore, we decided to do Juggs for
            more spells, only to discover that Trakanon himself was up.&nbsp; We then decided to
            dispatch him as well and killed him in record time.&nbsp; Drops were: Jaundice BP
            [Khallin], Deepwater BP [Chadmoe] and 2 Teeth [Brewall, Mmatil]. Along the way, we also
            managed to get 2 Dragon Sinews [Greymask, Kestel].&nbsp; After Trak, we then rolled on
            some extra Kael armour to MQ: Plate legs [Tico], Plate arms [Kilwean], and Plate gaunt
            [Zypheal].&nbsp; Excellent raiding by everyone with very minimal deaths (ZERO deaths on
            Gore and just 2 on Trak).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 02, 2002</strong><br>
            Small plate raid run in Kael this evening, and the drops were very good for a change: 2
            bracers: [Devaberiel, Lilsong], 2 legs: [Awll], 2 gaunts, 2 boots [Sylvanna, Khandrahcir],
            arms [Hawkien], and a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang: [Windarii].<br>
