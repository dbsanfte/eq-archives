            Took a long tour tonight of Siren's Grotto. We crawled around the zone making quite a few
            loops.&nbsp; Was a lot of new content for many of us and few of us had seen all the
            sights.&nbsp; Gem drops were excellent and we replenished our guild gem bank quite well.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 09, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again. Plate BP [Khandrahcir], Plate Gauntlets [Maxist], Plate Boots [Saulk], Chain
            Arms [Gilthanus], Plate Bracer [Gish], Silk Bracer [Imotep], Plate Boots [Skylynn], and

            <strong>JUL 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the Halls of Testing for some armour.&nbsp; Cleaned the wing out a few times
            and were rewarded with: Silk Legs [Greymask], Plate Legs [Ceeni], Plate Boots [Machedor],
            Chain BP [Maemura], Silk Sleeves [Lumadin], Leather Legs [Kuriosity], Chain BP [Udian],
            Chain Sleeves [Shcammer], Plate BP [Valstorm], Chain Gloves [Lotera], Plate Gauntlets

            Miscellaneous epic questing and experience questing for a few days while people are off
            for the holiday weekend.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUL 01, 2002</strong><br>
            We were killing some guardian wurms in skyfire this evening, when Talendor decided to make
            an appearance.&nbsp; Having slain this beast several times, we resolved to repeat his
            demise.&nbsp; Grats to Khandrahcir for burnt book!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 30, 2002</strong><br>
            Large guild raid on Cazic-Thule this evening.<br>

            <strong>JUN 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Large raid on Dragon Necropolis.&nbsp; Toured the zone and collected some gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Quick trip into Fear this evening to get the Wraith of Shissar that Chantress has been
            camping for weeks now. Grats to Chantress for getting our second enchanter epic in just
            days!&nbsp; While we were there, Yain showed up and needed the broken golem.&nbsp; Since
            we were there, we killed broken golem for him.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished Kestel's enchanter epic this evening with a quick trip to kill the Tangrin and
            final turn-in's.&nbsp; Grats to Kestel for getting his epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 18, 2002</strong><br>
            We needed a few epic items from Hate and decided to raid it this evening.&nbsp; On the
            first floor, we managed to get Kestel's vampire essence, 2 Eyes of Innoruuk [Imotep &amp;
            Kenatal] and Alone's Ranger stone. &nbsp; After laying waste to the first floor, we
            decided that we wanted our first Inny kill.&nbsp; We ventured out to the second floor and
            cleared the way to the god of hate. One excellently executed fight later, Inny lay dead at
            our feet.&nbsp; Grats to Immolar for the Pauldron's of Power!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 13, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again this evening. Drops: Leather BP [Aerayn], Plate Bracer, Leather Gloves, Plate
            Legs [Lilsong], Leather Boots [Physst], Silk Turban [Immolar], Plate Boots [Sylvanna],
            Runed Symbol [Altus], Leather Boots [Ippit], Leather Boots, Leather Legs [Altus], Chain
            Gloves [Barelil, no, Denor, no, Dreamthief, no, Dodja, ok, Klaminar], and Chain Legs
            [Dodja]. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to Halls of Testing. Drops: Silk Boots [Mmatil], Plate Legs [Zypheal, Awll,
            Lisner], Silk Bracer [Mmatil], Silk Arms [Jarheuu, Groovit], and Leather Arms [Aerayn].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 11, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Kilwean for obtaining the bard epic singing short sword!<br>
            <br>
            We also decided to try the Grimling High Priest in Acrylia.&nbsp; We brought two groups
            (spoiler sites suggested three), and we were complete overkill.&nbsp; Mobs barely lasted 5
            seconds as we killed the would-be repelers.&nbsp; After over an hour of killing them,
            watching the blood dry, and playing gems, the Grimling High Priest finally took matters
            into his own hands.&nbsp; Only problem was that once we had him down to 10 percent, he
            poofed. Not gated. Poofed.&nbsp; At least we got a few bone chips. Still, Brewall is
            making a few adjustments to his map from the explorations.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Denor for finishing the Shaman epic!&nbsp; At the same time as the CoM raid, we
            broke into Fear and proceeded to clear the zone.&nbsp; Lot of BP drops, too bad no one
            needed them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Dreamthief for reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Cleared out Fear this evening for some epic loots: Broken Golem [Minmin], Amy whip
            [Kilwean], and Shissar [Kestel]. After that, we went to Kael arena to slay giants once
            again and came away with chain legs, plate legs, and a plate bp.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 06, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed both Severilous and Talendor today.&nbsp; Sev was stingy and dropped a dragon bone
            bracer [Chadmoe], Pouch [Greymask], and 6 spells - no green scale though.&nbsp; We
            followed that up with Talendor, but no books. Loots from these raids, even with our mana
            burning crew, is always given to guildmates - and are never sold.&nbsp; These two kills on
            top of a big dungeon crawl of Grieg's End. If you have never done a crawl of a dungeon
            before, you are really missing out. We've gotten much faster as a guild on quick assembly
            and rapid fire take out of the Kunark dragons. We have killed all 4 within the past 3 days
            - and yes, we are killing them because we want the items, not to sell them.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 05, 2002</strong><br>
            We decided to raid the Hole to get a slew of needed epic items. We quickly fought our way
            down to Nortlav and dispatched the rusty weilding fighter. Grats to Kilwean for the Red
            Dragon Scale.&nbsp; Also killed many other epic mobs on the way back up for everyone else
            who needed something.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 04, 2002</strong><br>
            As a guild, we have been working hard and refining our tactics. Looking back on the last
            few months, we have steadily moved up the ladder of difficulty, and tonight was no
            exception. Coming off last nights two dragon raids, we wanted more. First, we decided to
            make our first attempt on Vindicator, and we were wildly successful. Loots were: Head
            [Tomwin], and Boots of the Vindicator [Awll].<br>
            <br>
            After we plowed Vindicator into dust, we decided to make our first attempt on Velketor.
            &nbsp; With no one with any prior experience with the fight, we still managed to kill him.
            &nbsp; Two big mobs in one night - again.&nbsp; Loots were: Shield of Freezing Wind
            [Chadmoe], Vermillion of Refraction [Mmatil], Crystal Crown of Confusion [Jarheuu], and 5
            spells.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 03, 2002</strong><br>
            The dragon hunting force was in full swing last night.&nbsp; We started in Dreadlands with
            Gorenaire, and dispatched the dragon with much fanfaire. Drops were nice for epics: WDS
            [Kilwean] and 2 Frost Books [Hawkien, Khandrahcir]. After Gore, we decided to do Juggs for
            more spells, only to discover that Trakanon himself was up.&nbsp; We then decided to
            dispatch him as well and killed him in record time.&nbsp; Drops were: Jaundice BP
            [Khallin], Deepwater BP [Chadmoe] and 2 Teeth [Brewall, Mmatil]. Along the way, we also
            managed to get 2 Dragon Sinews [Greymask, Kestel].&nbsp; After Trak, we then rolled on
            some extra Kael armour to MQ: Plate legs [Tico], Plate arms [Kilwean], and Plate gaunt
            [Zypheal].&nbsp; Excellent raiding by everyone with very minimal deaths (ZERO deaths on
            Gore and just 2 on Trak).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JUN 02, 2002</strong><br>
            Small plate raid run in Kael this evening, and the drops were very good for a change: 2
            bracers: [Devaberiel, Lilsong], 2 legs: [Awll], 2 gaunts, 2 boots [Sylvanna, Khandrahcir],
            arms [Hawkien], and a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang: [Windarii].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 31, 2002</strong><br>
            The inky general in Kithicor was cut down by Crimson Talon this evening. Grats to both
            Czad and Yakkai for their rogue epics!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 30, 2002</strong><br>
            While it may seem quiet on the newsfront, the guild has actually been very busy of late
            with some major raiding in many new zones.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Brewall for reaching 60! A new virtuoso!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Immolar for reaching 60! A new archmage!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Hate this evening to go after some of the mini bosses for epic items and some
            other epic mobs as well.&nbsp; Grats to Czad on a rogue bp.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Greigs End this evening.&nbsp; Killed nearly all the named mobs with the exception
            of Greig himself.&nbsp; Among the victims were: Occisor Pimorus, Prast Ianitor, and
            Praetorian Myral.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Working on a a few monk and rogue epics this evening. Actually starting to run low on
            epics to complete.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Another large raid on Cazic-Thule. Penetrated deep within the zone and managed to come
            away with a couple interesting items.&nbsp; Everyone is enjoying playing in a new place.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 15, 2002</strong><br>
            Large scale raid on Cazic-Thule this evening. Laid waste to the zone.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid in Iceclad to finish Greymask's eigth shawl.&nbsp; With 30+ players there showing
            support (and not wanting anyone to lose the seventh shawl), the wandering dwarf was
            scarcely touched.&nbsp; Other loots dropped as well from the attacking mobs, including a
            helmet and a caster primary hand item.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Crimson Talon returned to Grieg's and slayed Praetorian Myral.&nbsp; Nothing like killing
            a 300k HP mob that wields a weapon that procs divine aura.&nbsp; A very long fight to kill
            him, but he went down neverless.&nbsp; Dropped a very nice 1hs weapon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Grieg's End this evening.&nbsp; Fought our way in and managed to obtain the key to
            rest of the zone.&nbsp; Very interesting zone with mob traps and shifting appearances.
            &nbsp; Zone would get a lot more use from players if it was itemized better.&nbsp; Still,
            it is a fun change of pace.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Devaberiel did final hand-ins for bard epic this evening - grats on the new Singing Short
            Sword!<br>

            Killed spawned Trakanon for Devaberiel to finish his bard epic.&nbsp; After clearing the
            lair, we spawned Trakanon and killed him within 20 seconds. Fight was over so fast one of
            our manaburn wizards didn't even have time to get off her nuke. Grats to Dreamthief for
            rogue BP.&nbsp; This will be quiet week as many of us are working on exp prior to another
            big raiding week.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 01, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Wyntyr for finishing the wizard epic quest this evening.&nbsp; Phinny was very
            stubborn for her and he finally decided to reward her for her efforts. In looking over our
            guild news from the past month, it is easy to see we've been rampaging on epics of late.
            &nbsp; With 10 in just the last 30 days, including some of the toughest in the game
            (magician, warrior).&nbsp; For a guild of our size, this is an epic achievement of its
            own, and demonstrates how well we all work together. There aren't many epics left to get,
            and if could just catch Ragefire...<br>
            <br>
            Also this evening, the Halls of Testing: Chain Bracer [Dreamthief], Plate Boots [Gish],
            Silk Boots [Groovit, Silvercaster], Plate Gauntlets [Stien], Silk Wrist [Jarheuu], and
            Chain Gauntlets [Shcammer].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 30, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again. Killed twice as many mobs as the night before, but far fewer loots: Silk Bracer
            [Zionmaster], Chain Helm [Barelil], Plate Bracer [Chadmoe], Leather Legs [Physst], Plate
            Helm [Maxist], and Plate Arms [Ceeni].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Big raid on The Halls of Testing this evening and we came away with quite a bit of loot:
            Leather legs [Ikana], 3 Plate Legs [Machedor, Aorthin, Khandrahcir], 2 Plate Bracers
            [Awll, Uggabuga], Chain Tunic [Alone], and 2 Silk Turbans [Mmatil, Silvercaster].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 28, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished another epic this afternoon - congrats to Ippit for finishing the monk epic!
            &nbsp; Also raided Siren's Grotto for some gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Kael.&nbsp; Quite a few drops: Plate Arms [Grumpie], Plate Bracer [Khandrahcir,
            Stien], Silk Sleeves [Greymask], Plate Boots [Tarrask], and a few quest items.&nbsp;
            Killed Phinny later that night and dropped nothing of value, just 1 item short of another
            wizard epic - and we are waiting.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Ssra Temple this evening.&nbsp; Easily cleaned out first floor with little
            difficulty. Came away with some nice spells and next time will progress much deeper into
            this dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Stevenfost completed Shield of Bane quest. The first time he tried to do the quest, the
            mob ran off at end of the fight and died in a rock.&nbsp; When he tried to get help from
            customer support, they didn't do anything to help him, even when he offered to just roll
            back his character.&nbsp; Hats off to Tilol though, he checked the logs and saw that
            Stevenfost did get to this point in the quest and restored his items.&nbsp; Steven did
            last fight this evening and kept the mob snared and far away from rocks.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Hawkien completed 8th ring quest this evening.&nbsp; Ippit also attained his Robe of the
            Whistling Fist and then finished the monk epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Miscellaneous experience raiding the next week as we gear up for some guild raids the week
            after.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Lumper for completing the warrior epic! The epic rampage continues!<br>
            Grats to Awll and Maxist for both reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Quick raid on fear to take out the broken golem to get item for Wyntyr's wizard epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished up on the Plane of Sky this evening by decimating bee island and then moving up
            to the seventh, sphynx island.&nbsp; There, we killed drakes until we had our sought after
            item - the crown of elemental mastery.&nbsp; Congrats to Immolar for finishing the
            magician epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 12-14, 2002</strong><br>
            Climbing the islands in the Plane of Sky the last few nights and have been clearing each
            one repeatedly in order to get some quest drops before moving on to the next one.&nbsp; By
            Sunday, we made it to the Spiroc Lord and defeathered the bird several times to get items
            for our warriors.&nbsp; Valstorm obtained the last item he needed to complete the warrior
            epic, and at the end of the evening, dropped down and did the turn-in.&nbsp; Grats to
            Valstorm!&nbsp; Soon, we will move up and work towards finishing off a magician epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 09, 2002</strong><br>

            <br>
            <strong>APR 04, 2002</strong><br>
            Hate raid today to get some resist gear gems and take down as many epic mobs as possible.
            Non-stop killing, and very quick pace. Most of the first floor was cleared within an hour,
            and by the second hour, pickings were rather slim.&nbsp; Still, managed to come away with
            a nice number of gems and a few epic pieces.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 03, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Chardok royals. Killed prince, king, and queen with very few losses. Grats to
            Lumper for warrior epic item. We are very close to our first warrior epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 02, 2002</strong><br>
            This was our last night of ToV for a few weeks. Planning on some other activities and

            [Valstorm, Brewall], Leather Cap [Tomwin], Leather Boots [Tomwin], and a Black Symbol

            Returned to ToV. Drops were a bit light tonight: Plate legs [Sylvanna], Chain Legs, Plate
            Boots [Aorthin], and a Ruby Symbol [Skylynn].<br>
