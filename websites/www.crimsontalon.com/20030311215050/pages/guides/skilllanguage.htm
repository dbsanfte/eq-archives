      <p><span class="s2cA"><b>EQ LANGUAGE GUIDE - Written by Brewall Rainsinger 
        // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        This guide covers all you want to know about the languages in Everquest, 
        where to find them, and how to learn them.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>THE LANGUAGES</strong><br>
        There are 25 total languages in EverQuest and are split among those that 
        the player-controlled characters speak and those that can only be obtained 
        through training.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>PLAYER LANGUAGES</strong><br>
        Easiest to find and to train in.&nbsp; Find any player of the corresponding 
        race/class and have them train you to level of mastery:<br>
        <br>
        Barbarian<br>
        Combine: (Vah Shir have master skill) <br>
        Common Tongue<br>
        Dark Speech<br>
        Dwarvish<br>
        Elder Elvish: (High Elves have skill of 41)<br>
        Elvish<br>
        Erudian<br>
        Gnomish<br>
        Halfling<br>
        Lizardman: Language of the Iksar.<br>
        Ogre<br>
        Tier'Dal (Dark Elvish language)<br>
        Thieve's Cant (All rogues have master skill)<br>
        Troll<br>
        Vah Shir<br>
        <br>
        <strong>NON-PLAYER LANGUAGES</strong><br>
        With these languages, it is impossible to create or find someone based 
        on their race to train you in these languages.&nbsp; The only way to obtain 
        them is to find someone who already knows them or put training points 
        in them and/or find partners to practice with: <br>
        <br>
        Dragon: level 20<br>
        Elder Dragon: level 30<br>
        Elder Tier'Dal: level 30<br>
        Faerie: level 20<br>
        Froglok: level 20<br>
        Gnoll: level 10<br>
        Goblin: level 20<br>
        Old Erudian: level 10<br>
        Orcish: level 20<br>
        <br>
        Note: level is when most classes are able to train in that language. May 
        vary based on class &amp; trainer. Not all languages are taught at all 
        trainers.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>RULES TO LEARNING LANGUAGES</strong> <br>
        1. You can only learn by listening to someone else with equal or higher 
        skill than yourself.<br>
        2. You can train someone else up to 1 point higher than your skill.<br>
        3. You must be in same zone as someone else to learn.<br>
        4. EQ does not recognize any skill increases until you zone. If you are 
        teaming with someone else, you will need to zone to get the increases 
        recognized.<br>
        5. If you are teaming with someone else to learn a language, you will 
        each need to zone every time the other person's skill is increased (see 
        rules 3 &amp; 4).<br>
        6. Can't train in some obscure languages until after level 20 and some 
        after 30. This prevents people from creating new characters for sole purpose 
        of language training.<br>
        7. You can identify a language being spoken to you at a skill of 25 (it 
        will no longer be &quot;unknown language&quot;)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOW TO LEARN FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS MASTERED A LANGUAGE</strong><br>
        1. Get some cheap int or wis gear. Try to get stat over 100.<br>
        2. Have the person you are going to learn from set up hotkey with 5 lines 
        of group say spam. I recommend a few letters per line. Some people say 
        that it works faster with long lines of text, but from my testing, long 
        lines only increase lag.&nbsp;Each line should have something different, 
        otherwise, the server may filter the message because it looks similar.&nbsp; 
        I use a social hotkey of:<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay abc123<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay efg456<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay hij789<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay klm123<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay nop456<br>
        3. Form a group, have other person change language to desired one to learn. 
        If you do not form a group, the messages to other players are filtered 
        for spamming.<br>
        4. Have them spam you over-and-over with the hotkey.<br>
        5. Skill point increases in languages do not show the numerical value 
        when you get an increase, but you will see a message that your skill gets 
        better.<br>
        6. Typically takes about 10 minutes to go from 0 to 101 (master) with 
        an intelligence of 100.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOW TO TEACH EACH OTHER A LANGUAGE (WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND A MASTER)</strong><br>
        1. Get some cheap int or wis gear. Try to get stat over 100.<br>
        2. Have 1 person put at least 1 point into the language (e.g. PlayerA 
        trains 1 point).<br>
        3. Have person you are going to learn from set up hotkey with 5 lines 
        of group say spam. I recommend a few letters per line. Some people say 
        that it works faster with long lines of text, but from my testing, long 
        lines only increase lag.&nbsp;Each line should have something different, 
        otherwise, the server may filter the message because it looks like you 
        are spamming.&nbsp; I use a social hotkey of:<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay abc123<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay efg456<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay hij789<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay klm123<br>
        &nbsp; /gsay nop456<br>
        4. Form group, have other person change language to desired one to learn.<br>
        5. Player knowing language will spam the other person until they get to 
        1 point higher than the teacher (e.g. PlayerA, with skill of 1, spams 
        PlayerB with skill of 0, until PlayerB gets 2 skill increases. PlayerA 
        skill is 1, PlayerB skill is now 2).<br>
        6. Both players zone, and original learner spams the teacher until that 
        person gets 2 skill increases (e.g. PlayerB, with skill of 2, spams PlayerA 
        with skill of 1, until PlayerA gets 2 skill increases. PlayerA skill now 
        3, PlayerB skill is 2).<br>
        7. Repeat 5-6 until both players at 101.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <strong>TIPS</strong><br>
        1. To see list of languages you know, use the &quot;/language help&quot; 
        command to see list of languages and corresponding numbers.<br>
        2. You can see the language you are currently speaking with &quot;/language 
        0&quot;<br>
        3. You can change the language you are speaking with &quot;/language #&quot;, 
        where # is the language number.<br>
        4. If partnering with someone to learn languages from scratch, try to 
        do several languages at one time. Zoning takes majority of time.<br>
        5. Don't try to train languages in busy zones. Longer load time when zoning 
        into crowded areas and more spam.<br>
