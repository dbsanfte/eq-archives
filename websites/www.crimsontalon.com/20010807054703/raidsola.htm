font-family:Verdana">Having
            found Ferrik Bloodforge&#146;s treatise on Solusek A I decided to venture to that remote
            dungeon myself. What a wonderful surprise, I have enjoyed my time there immeasurably. I
            put pen to parchment now in the hopes that others can benefit from my experiences. I have
            written much of this from a Paladin&#146;s prospective. For this I do not apologize, for I
            am, after a Paladin. <b><p><u>Greyfin&#146;s Rules for Solusek A </u></b><ol>
              <li>Don&#146;t fall into the lava </li>
              <li>Don&#146;t forget rule 1 </li>
              <li>Don&#146;t pull on the stairs. If you do you will eventually fall into the lava and
                break rules 1, 2 and 6. </li>
              <li>Know where the nearest zone to Sol B is. As strange as it sounds it&#146;s a good place
                to escape to. Sure sometimes you die when trains collide, but that is very rare. </li>
              <li>Once down the stairs and inside the &quot;window room&quot; don&#146;t run back up to
                the stairs to zone. Use the Sol B zone near the &quot;safe spot.&quot; </li>
              <li>Don&#146;t swim in the lava </li>
              <li>NO RUNNERS: ensnare or root everything. </li>
              <li>IF there is a runner, RUN, gate or die. Don&#146;t wait for the dam to break. It already
                has you just can&#146;t see the wall of water about to fall on your head. If you let a
                goblin escape you will see the gates of hell open up. Shout TRAIN! and scoot. </li>
              <li>If it moves, kill it. Many of the NPC&#146;s wander around Sol A. All the NPC&#146;s
                have place holders. If you&#146;re looking for any of these you have to kill the
                wanderers. </li>
              <li>Don&#146;t cast Area Effect spells unless you know EXACTLY where you are. I&#146;ve seen
                many a caster die because the employees of the Solusek Mining Company are so short they
                weren&#146;t seen... </li>
              <li>Always have batwings (see rules 1, 2 and 6) make sure everyone in your party has one or
                two (the worst feeling in the world is when the guy with all the batwings is at the bottom
                of the lava stream). </li>
              <li>No one dies. Go slow, follow the rules and Rule 11 will rarely be broken. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>About Lava</b>: Just about everyone has heard that the lava at Sol A is bad. Because
            of this, often people do not want to go to there. Well, I&#146;m here to tell you
            it&#146;s not that bad at all. 95% of the BAD lava is in the first 10% of the dungeon. Go
            slowly, pull whatever is on the stairs back to the top and no one should fall in. Falling
            into the lava is a pain because you have to retrieve your corpse and only you can do it
            (others can&#146;t do it because they can&#146;t target your corpse when it&#146;s in
            lava. Well, not unless they want to go swimming to find it). IF you do fall in, get as
            close as you can to the corner near the window (keep reading you'll understand soon).
            I&#146;ve seen people drag their body from the path/stairs when they died in this area. If
            you don&#146;t get lucky you will have to levitate and drag you corpse either back onto
            the path or further on you will eventually find some stone where you can bring your body.
            I would suggest you just getting back onto the path.<br>
            <br>
            Now sometimes Levitate doesn&#146;t float you high enough to get back on the path. This
            can happen for 2 reasons: you follow the lava stream to a pathway that leads down and the
            roof will force you down and sometimes levitate will drop you below the path, but above
            the lava for no reason. DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAVA WHERE IT ENTERS THE TUNNEL (the one that
            leads down). Nothing good will come of it. If your body is in the lava and you can&#146;t
            find it, don&#146;t go here to look. It&#146;s not down there, the only way bodies get
            there is if you drag it there, whatever you do NEVER DRAG YOUR BODY DOWN THIS TUNNEL. IF
            you end up floating above the lava but too low to get back on the path for no reason you
            can try and climb back up the wall (it works sometimes) or contact a GM/Guide. I have had
            great success with asking guides and GM&#146;s for help with this bug (they usually
            teleport me out, so loot your corpse before you ask for help<br>
            <br>
            ONE TIME I fell into the lava and was able to successfully CLIMB THE WALL and get out of
            the lava. I was never able to do it again and no one I know has done it, but it&#146;s
            worth trying. Find the corner near the window room and try and climb up, like you would a
            ladder.</p>
            <i><p>&quot;The best way to avoid the initial lava is to go in through Sol B. Enter Sol B
            and make all lefts that you can until you zone into Sol A... With Sol B as heavily camped
            as it is there should be no problem doing this.</i></p>
            <p><i>- Beldukil Lawbringer High Elf Lvl 50 Paladin Povar</i></p>
            <p><b>GETTING THERE</b>: Solusek&#146;s Eye, (Sol A) can be found in Lavastorm Mountains
            (LS). It is often mistaken for Nagafen&#146;s Lair (Sol B). This causes some confusion and
            the misperception that it is a very high level dungeon: it&#146;s not as hard as you
            think. Sol B is an extremely difficult dungeon, don&#146;t expect to go to Sol B till
            you&#146;re well into your 30&#146;s (and from what I&#146;ve heard, you don&#146;t need
            to leave before 50). Now don&#146;t get me wrong, Sol A is not easy; I&#146;ve seen
            parties in there high 30&#146;s have trouble there. I&#146;m just saying a lot of people
            come too late. I got there around level 23 and had great fun. In fact, it&#146;s a much
            harder dungeon after level 27; now you have to fight your way past annoying greens to get
            experience.<br>
            <br>
            <b>THE LOOT: </b>I found the experience and the loot to be greater than many of the other
            areas people of my level were fighting in (Mistmoore, Unrest, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and
            High Hold Keep) and certainly the train makes less stops in Sol A then in MM, Unrest and
            CT. The experience is great here. I will finish this guide with some ideas about where to
            go to get the most experience, you can skip there now, but it won&#146;t mean as much to
            you until you&#146;ve read the whole guide. I love this dungeon. With everyone complaining
            about overcrowding, I am constantly amazed at how few people are at Solusek A. With the
            recent invasion of Splitpaw Solusek don&#146;t expect anything to change either (which is
            a good thing, IMHO). I have included a quick reference at the end of this guide.</p>
            <b><p>ON BINDING</b>: Freeport is the typical binding point for melee types who can&#146;t
            get bound in Neriak. There was a rumor you could bind in the Solusek Temple (that would
            have been nice) it&#146;s not true.</p>
            <p><b>OF INTEREST</b>: Dwarves and, I heard a rumor, Erudites, are not KOS to the Goblins
            in Sol A unless you have done something to lose faction with them (it took me about 1
            whole level to become KOS)&#133; I spent 2 days walking around Sol A, learning my way
            around. Except for 4 mobs (2 of which are NPC&#146;s there is nothing in Sol A that will
            bother a sight-seeing dwarf (so pack a lunch and bring the kids).</p>
            <p>There is a rumor that the Gnomish Vendor in the Castle sells Melatite. It&#146;s not
            true. Like all vendors he sells it if another Player sold it to him. And before people
            knew how to do the Armor of Ro quests I&#146;m sure players sold it to him, not anymore.
            So don&#146;t get your hopes up.</p>
            <p>Invis doesn&#146;t work very well in Sol A as all the spell casters and the gnomes can
            see invis.</p>
            <p>Killing Kobolds in Sol B will raise your faction with Solusek Mining Company (but not
            the Ak&#146;anon faction). A useful thing to know if you&#146;re an evil race (since
            you&#146;re KOS to the Mining Company otherwise) or anyone who plans to camp the employees
            of the Solusek Mining Company and their mechanicals. This isn&#146;t really an option
            before level 30, although I did venture down here and take swings at some kobolds when I
            was in my 20&#146;s, but only when others were actually fighting them. I still
            haven&#146;t raised my faction above indifferent.</p>
            <p>Paladins can solo here from Level 22 - 27 (after 27 you stop getting exp)... It's not
            great but since we rarely get to solo anything it's fun for a change and this is better
            than running somewhere else to fight... Pull to the Sol B room and root when the goblins
            get near 40%... Even if they do run you should have time to catch them, if you don't
            they'll train, but you'll have time to zone to Sol B. I&#146;ve solo&#146;d the Predator
            room and the Foreman rooms at level 31, but I wouldn&#146;t recommend it until you learn
            the zone very well (or after level 35)</p>
            <p><b>THE SAFE AREA</b>: Ferrick identified 2 areas in Sol A, the Goblin Stronghold and
            the Gnome Castle. The only thing I will do is add another area, I call it the safe area.
            It&#146;s &quot;safe&quot; because because nothing spawns on this side of Sol A. Unless
            someone pulls/trains something, you will not see any Goblins here. There is also a
            relatively safe zone to Sol B here, for escape purposes. The safe area is good place to
            rest, meditate and even camp. It&#146;s also a useful reference point (&quot;meet you in
            the safe area&quot;). Getting there is very easy. After zoning in you will see some
            stairs. At the midway point you will find a window (some call it a crack). This room and
            the one that adjoins it I call the window room. The window room has 2 exits: one leading
            back to the stairs (I never bother with this exit, using the window instead) and one that
            leads to a ledge (I will come back here a lot, when I say &quot;the ledge&quot; I mean
            here). At the ledge, if you take a right, you will enter a hallway that opens up to a path
            leading down and a bridge that dead-ends into the wall. This is the safe area. Continuing
            down the ramp, you come to a room and a short hall to the Sol B zone. I refer to this room
            simply as the Sol B room (for obvious reasons).</p>
            <p>Back to the ledge, there is a door straight ahead of you in a small pit-like area (jump
            or take the stairs). It leads to the Goblin Stronghold. This is where you will find the
            Goblin King, the Goblin Bartender, the Goblin Drunkard (who new they drank so much?) the
            Goblin High Shaman and the Infernal Torturer. Solusek Goblins (the toughest kind there is
            in Solusek &#150; go figure) can only be found in the stronghold.</p>
            <p>The Castle area is where the employees of the Solusek Mining Company live. This does
            not mean there are no Goblins in the &quot;Castle area.&quot; They just don&#146;t live in
            the Castle-proper. In fact, there are as many goblins living in this area as in the
            Stronghold. In the Castle area you will find some very nice NPC&#146;s: Kindle, Singe, the
            Goblin Foreman, the Kobold Predator, the Goblin Captain, The Clockwork EXG, Gabbie
            Mardoddle, Reckless Efreeti (I&#146;ll include their drops when I talk about where to find
            them), Captain Bipnipple and the Lava Elemental.</p>
            <b><p>KOBOLD PREDATOR AND THE GOBLIN FOREMAN</b>: From the ledge (you&#146;re facing the
            doorway to the Goblin Stronghold), turning left you will see some Goblins (at least 2, but
            very often there is a wandering goblin there as well). There is a hallway to the left.
            This is the &quot;hard way&quot; to the<b> </b>Predator room as you will have to fight
            about 12-15 goblins to get here, but if you&#146;re with evil races you have to go this
            way as they are KOS to the employees of the Solusek Mining Company. Take it, continuing
            straight over the bridge (more lava). Eventually you will come to a hallway leading to the
            left. At the end of this hall you come to a door. The <b>Kobold Predator </b>is often
            behind this door (he wanders up and down the hall). Like most of the spawns in Sol A the
            Predator is roughly a 20 minute spawn. But he has place-holders, I&#146;ve seen him spawn
            twice in a 6 hour stretch and 4 times in a row another time. The Predator drops
            Kobold-Hide Boots (AC5 +3 AGI +10 HP) and the rare Obsidian Shard (6 Dmg 25 Dly Effect:
            Obsidian Shatter &#150; 30 point Direct Damage AND reduces AC by about 30 points, a very
            nice spell).</p>
            <p>Note: I&#146;ve been told that Obsidian Shatter is a fire based spell and as such is
            not very useful in Sol A as the goblins there have high fire resistance (go figure).</p>
            <p>You&#146;ll have to fight your way to hallway (unless you get lucky with invis and
            there are no casters on the path.) Once you get to hall you can rest (don&#146;t sit too
            close to the doorways). The nice thing is the hall is safe as only 1 MOB will venture in
            here. The good news is that mob is the Predator or his placeholder, a goblin. Either way
            kill anything you see in this hall. Open the door and you will be on a landing at the top
            of some stairs. The Predator spawns on this landing. Kill whatever is here. The nice thing
            is you will not agro the 2 goblins in the room below. When you&#146;re done go down and
            clear the other 2 goblins. There is one exit (other than the one you came in) in this
            room. Through that door there are 3 goblins in here. The one in the middle is the <b>Goblin
            Foreman</b> (behind the well-like structure). He drops the Foreman Tunic (10AC 0 weight +3
            STR +3 WIS) or the Obsidian Scimitar (6 dmg 27 dly +6 AGI). Like most of the spawns in Sol
            A, his is roughly a 20 mins spawn. But he has place-holders, I&#146;ve seen him spawn
            twice in a 6 hour stretch and 4 times in a row another time.</p>
            <p>A full group of mid-20&#146;s can handle both these rooms. Around level 27 I could
            handle both rooms with 2 other people. At 30 I could handle the Predator room by myself.
            (it&#146;s very hard to break up the Foreman room solo, but I&#146;ve done it. I
            wouldn&#146;t suggest it till you know what you&#146;re doing. In the back of the Foreman
            room is a secret door. The hallway behind here is very safe. Goblins don&#146;t wander
            through here unless pulled.</p>
            <p>Now, the easy way into the Foreman/Predator rooms. Go back to the ledge take a left
            again, but this time keep going. There&#146;s a small alcove with 2 goblins fairly close,
            continue on. You will come to another small alcove with your first Gnome Mechanical in it.
            Don&#146;t fight him unless your in your 30&#146;s, have a good group and don&#146;t mind
            the faction hits. From the alcove there is a sharp (very easy to miss) left that leads to
            an L-shaped bridge (more lava). Go across. When you reach the end of the bridge, stop.
            There is a hallway to your left (again, VERY easy to miss) take it. You will pass a
            doorway and go up some small steps, when you come to a charred section of the wall on your
            right (same wall the door was on) stop. This charred section is actually a secret door, go
            through it. You are now in the secret hallway that leads to the Foreman room. Go forward
            and take your first left, then right, then left again and you should be looking at a
            another secret doorway (you can tell by the small holes in the surface, if you see them
            &#150; they&#146;re usually more visible from the back side). Well, we&#146;re back to the
            secret door to the Goblin Foreman room.</p>
            <b><p>SINGE AND KINDLE</b>: Two NPC&#146;s, they fly around the Castle area (never
            venturing into the castle-proper). Like all the other NPC&#146;s in Sol A they have
            place-holders. My best advice is whack any wondering goblin you see (rule #9). They were
            blue to me at 27, but hit hard (IMHO Singe hits harder). They wander all over the castle
            area. <b>Singe</b>, a Fire Drake, sometimes goes as far as the ledge over by the
            Stronghold. Singe commonly drops the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3 INT &#150;
            I&#146;ve traded them to spell-casters for some very nice items) and rarely the Drake
            Scale Belt (AC5 +3 DEX +10 vs Fire &#150; spell-casters love em). Personally I&#146;ve
            killed Singe a dozen times and I&#146;ve never seen the belt, so I&#146;m starting to have
            my doubts. Maybe it&#146;s a myth. <b>Kindle</b>, a Fire Imp, I see much less frequently.
            I don&#146;t know why maybe I&#146;m unlucky. Some other possibilities: he makes less
            noise than Singe (who&#146;s screach can be heard a good distance away) so people
            aren&#146;t, so apt to know he&#146;s around , he roams less or people tend to kill his
            place-holder less often. Kindle&#146;s drop is either the boring Obsidian Ring (AC3 +3 DEX
            +10 HP) or the Imp Skin Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10 Mana &#150; spell-casters love em).</p>
            <p>Back to the secret hall behind the Foreman room. If you&#146;re facing the room, there
            is a hall that branches off to your right. Follow this and you will come to another secret
            door, you will enter a room with 3 doors and 2-3 goblins. These goblins are nastier
            (flame, fire and inferno) than the ones you&#146;ve seen so fare, so be prepared for a
            fight. I&#146;m told that Singe spawns in this room. I have never seen him in this room,
            but that&#146;s the legend. The door to the left leads to a Sol B zone B (a very useful
            escape route! &#150; see rule 5). The door straight ahead is the one we want. Open the
            door and move forward. There are 3 (maybe 2?) goblins in this area, if you follow the left
            wall you will find another zone to Sol B (a very useful escape route! &#150; see rule 5).
            IF you go through the door, walk forward a bit and turn around you will see an exit to
            your left (it&#146;s, very easy to miss). You will see some stairs up and a tunnel
            entrance. There is one goblin in the corner of this area and another on top of the stairs
            on the ledge. Most times, if I was lucky enough to find him, I found Singe on this ledge.</p>
            <p>If you go into the tunnel you will sometimes run into Kindle. It&#146;s a dangerous
            place as there are many goblins down here. Since Kindle likes to wander, I really
            wouldn&#146;t recommend it going down here to hunt him unless you really know what
            you&#146;re doing or have good faction with the Goblins. Back to the ledge where we
            hopefully find Singe&#133; There&#146;s a door on this ledge, go in. You&#146;re now in a
            short hallway go through the next door. You will find yourself into a room with a table
            and a 2<sup>nd</sup> door in the far wall. IF you go to the right hand corner you will
            find a secret door. This leads down to a pit where the Reckless Efreeti Spawns</p>
            <b><p>The Reckless Efreeti</b>: My favorite Graphic in the game, to date (I love the laugh
            too). He drops two very nice items: Platinum Armbands (0 AC +3 WIS +3 STR &#150; druids
            love em, as will your occasional High Elf Cleric) and the rare Obsidian Flamberge (20 dmg
            50 dly effect: Obsidian Shatter PAL WAR SK 2H Sword - No Drop/Lore). Not as good as the
            Gigantic Zweihander, but it&#146;s a nice 2-handed weapon, especially since practically no
            one has heard of it). He has company, 2 Blazings Elementals, around their mid-20&#146;s
            they are aggro to everyone. This includes those lucky Dwarves and Erudites who have been
            walking around Sol A without a care in the world&#133; I haven&#146;t made up my mind if
            the Efreeti is aggro or not. Sometimes, he just sits there, sometimes, he attacks. His
            spawn rate is not the typical 20 minutes. Ferrick stated that he missed a round, putting
            him on a 40 minute spawn cycle, but whenever I timed his spawn, it seemed a little more
            random (between 35 and 55 mins). Like all the other spawns in Sol A has a place-holder,
            another Blazing elemental.</p>
            <b><p>The Goblin Captain</b>: The Captain is very close to the Efreeti. But be warned
            it&#146;s a very difficult pull. Go back up the ramp out of the Efreeti pit and into the
            room with the table. Take the door to your right (the one you haven&#146;t used yet).
            You&#146;ll come into a room with 2 more Goblins and a fireplace in it. This is a pretty
            good place to set up base camp. Kindle will wander right through this room and you&#146;re
            close enough to pull from the Captain&#146;s room and the Efreeti pit. There&#146;s
            another door on the other side of the fireplace. Take that door, you&#146;re now in a
            short hall. Open the door at the end you will see a room with 3 doors, there are 2 goblins
            guarding the middle door. This is the Captain&#146;s room. Pulling is difficult because
            you can&#146;t pull only those 2. When you pull either of them, you will pull 2-4 more. 2
            or 3 from the Captain&#146;s room plus there&#146;s usually a lurker behind the left door
            who will come, too. So now you have to fight 5 or 6 goblins. During the fight one of the
            of the spawns in the fireplace rooms will pop up and sometimes kindle (or his placeholder)
            will wander in. Compound that with the Goblins proclivity to run and you have all the
            makings for a disaster. Think: ENCHANTER or BARD&#133; Once you&#146;ve broken the spawn
            it&#146;s much easier of course. It&#146;s worth it because the Captain drops two very
            nice items: Charred Boots are common (AC6 +3 AGI +5 vs Fire and Poison) and Charred
            Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT) rare. When you consider how few good gloves and boots there
            are (I got my snakeskin gloves at level 10) then you&#146;ll realize how truly special the
            Captain is.</p>
            <p>By my count, for gloves there are 4 choices after snakeskin: plate (steel or bronze),
            Charred, Ro or Darkmail. Boots are worse, plate, Dwarven workboots or Ro. Considering that
            he ALWAYS drops boots or gloves and that a party in their high 20&#146;s to low 30&#146;s
            I don&#146;t understand why he isn&#146;t camped far more often. I was offered 2000pp in
            trade for my gloves (2 foreman tunic &#150;800, 2 kobold boots -400, 2 obsidian hoops -500
            and chitin greaves-300).</p>
            <p>I have not met anyone who has seen charred leggings or charred bracers. Ferrick
            reported that he had heard rumors that they were available. It would be fairly sweet to
            find.</p>
            <b><p>MINING MELATITE</b>:<i> </i>Now the question all the Paladins (and Shadowknights and
            Rangers to a lesser degree) will want answered: what drops Melatite? I have been told
            models MB, MC, and XC, XB and the minors drop Melatite. No one seems to know. The best
            answer is to kill as many employees and mechanicals of the Solusek Mining Company as
            possible (Verant really doesn&#146;t want us to roleplay do they?). It&#146;s very rare,
            so don&#146;t expect to get much. Camping Gabbie, Captain and the EXG while trying to get
            Melatite makes the most sense. A few things to note. I have heard rumors that melatite
            drops more often outside the Castle proper (near the &quot;L-bridge&quot; but I have my
            doubts. Also, killing the gnomish minors gives you a much bigger faction hit than killing
            the mechanicals. I would avoid killing the minors and conjurers if I could<i>.</i></p>
            <p>To get to the Gnome Castle and find Melatite. Backtracking to the L-bridge, go over the
            bridge and continue on, you&#146;ll come to a swinging pendulum (its only for looks, it
            won&#146;t actually hurt you). Keep going and you will come to a larger room with a large
            pool of lava. Follow the path to the left and you will see the Castle. You will have to
            jump into and swim (you&#146;re given a waiver for rule # 6 this one time) a very small
            section of lava. If you do this quickly you won&#146;t even take the usual 40 points of
            lava damage. It&#146;s not really dangerous, but it&#146;s fun to watch people do for the
            first time.</p>
            <p>After you negotiate the lava (the first time you&#146;ll be breathing kinda hard, but
            it wasn&#146;t that bad, was it?) you will come to two drawbridges. The one on the right
            is the one we want. The left leads you to the doorway back by the secret door that leads
            to the Goblin Foreman room. I have not met anyone who has found anything particularly
            noteworthy on this side of the Castle.</p>
            <p>Inside the castle is essentially one long hallway. Follow the hall until you come to a
            set of steps going down. Keep walking (well run &#150; does anyone walk in Norrath?)
            we&#146;ll come back later. Eventually the hall dead-ends at an opening with some lava.
            Across which you can see another drawbridge. There is a secret room (closet more like)
            with a lever a little bit behind you. It&#146;s hard to see, just turn around and run
            along the right wall and you will run into it. Over the drawbridge are more Gnomes and
            their mechanical friends. It&#146;s a hard place to describe and I&#146;m not going to
            try. There are 4 secret doors in this area. They all lead to the same room. Inside there
            are 6 Gnomes, one of them is a wanderer. The wandering Gnome is the placeholder for <b>the
            Lava Elemental</b> (drops the Runed Lava Pendant, 5AC +5Str +5 Fire, I&#146;ve been told
            his common drop is a healing potion, I have yet to confirm this). This room is tough. When
            you attack any of the gnomes they will all attack you. I think they will attack you if you
            attack the Lava Elemental (I think he&#146;s aggro). I&#146;ve been told level 50 players
            get experience from the Elemental, so beware. The Runed Lava Pendant is pretty darn nice.</p>
            <p>Going back down the hall to the stairs, go down. At the bottom you will find a button
            and a door. To open the door you push the button. It locks behind you so don&#146;t go in
            unless you want to. You go through a hall, a door and are in a small courtyard with a
            reddish tint. There is a secret room in here with a button on the wall. It opens the door
            that locked behind you&#133; When you leave the courtyard you now find yourself in a small
            hallway with 2 doors and a portcullis. The first door has the Gnomish Vendor. He sells the
            Bag of the Tinkerers. It sells for around between 5250 and 7000pp. Buy me one, OK? I use
            him to sell FS and other goodies. People in Sol B use him too. I have found some very nice
            items for sale here (like medium Bronze Tunics and a Savant Cap.) Buying an item is a good
            way to get rid of excess copper silver and gold. Or you can just leave monk droppings all
            over the place, but I hate a messy dungeon. If only he sold food and drink (the gypsy camp
            in Lava Storm is the closest place I know for that). When he stops selling to you
            it&#146;s time to go back to Sol B and whack Kobolds.</p>
            <p>The next door is where <b>Gabbie Mardoddle</b> spawns. Gabbie&#146;s rare drop is the
            uber-rare, Molten Cloak (4AC +4 WIS and INT &#150; watch the spell-casters drool).
            Gabbie&#146;s common drop is the Mithril Quill, a 4 dmg 19 dly +20 HP piercing weapon
            (wow! /em dripping sarcasm). She spawns behind the desk. Gabbie is a caster and can do a
            TON of damage in a small amount of time. There are 2 other Gnomes in the room with her.
            They will attack when you start attacking Gabbie (or the place-holder) so be prepared for
            a fight. If she has the quill you will see it. It looks like a dagger&#133; <b>Captain
            Bipnipple</b>, or his place-holder, will wander in and stand next to Gabbie. He&#146;ll
            join in the fray as well, so I advice you kill him first. You can find a few spots to
            fight him while he&#146;s alone fairly easily (like the courtyard with the reddish tint)
            if you follow him. Captain Bipnipple drops the Gnomish Environmental suit (not sure what
            the other drop is).</p>
            <p>There&#146;s one more NPC to camp while your mining for Melatite: the <b>Clockwork
            Model EXG</b>. She drops the Charred Guardian Shield (10AC +9 WIS &#150; druids and
            clerics love it) as her common drop and the Charred Guardian Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6
            STA - LORE ITEM &#150; looks great too) is the rare drop (which is fine since the shield
            is so much more valuable). The EXG is a large female mechanical. You can see the shield if
            she has it. To find her go through the portcullis outside Gabbie&#146;s room. You are in a
            big courtyard at the front of the Castle, now. There&#146;s only one path, follow it.
            Continue cross two bridges (more lava). After the second bridge you&#146;ll come to a
            small room with 2 mechanicals. The EXG wanders between the portcullis this room (she and
            her place-holders are the only employees that wander in this area). She&#146;s very touch
            to kill, being 100% resistant to magic (you can cast cancel magic on her). Nearby Gnomish
            Conjurer&#146;s will buff and heal her, so find a nice secluded place to fight and tell
            your casters to med. I&#146;ve killed her twice, a couple of healers and a couple of tanks
            can take her down around level 30. Like most of the mobs in Sol A she has a 20 minute
            spawn cycle and has place holders (the ones that wander along her path).</p>
            <p>This is the end of the Gnome area. Continuing past that room with 2 gnome mechanicals
            that the EXG wanders to and you&#146;ll go up some stairs (it turns left) and eventually
            the hall will end. You have to take a left or right here. (if you look to your right you
            will see some nasty looking spikes (like the swinging pendulum it doesn&#146;t hurt,
            it&#146;s just for looks) you will also see Goblins again.</p>
            <p>If you take the right, towards the there is a doorway to your left BEFORE you get to
            the spikes, TAKE IT. If you continue on there are two traps past the spikes that drop you
            into the pit with the blazing elementals and the Reckless Efreeti. I only had to do that
            once to learn, I never go past the spikes now. You will find yourself on a ledge with a
            door and a single goblin. This is the door/ledge that leads to the Reckless Efreeti (the
            one you find Singe on a lot).</p>
            <p>Well that&#146;s a full circle. Time to go explore the Goblin Stronghold.</p>
            <b><p>THE STRONGHOLD</b>: OK, you&#146;ve explored the rest of the Goblin areas around the
            castle. You&#146;ve gotten a few good items (probably a Foreman&#146;s tunics at least)
            and you&#146;re ready to go fight the Goblins on their home ground. Be warned the goblins
            in the Stronghold are tougher. There are very few Youngs and Cinders. If you venture in
            far enough you will see Solusek Goblins, and these guys are nasty, especially the casters.
            So, go back to the ledge. In front of you is a small pit-like area. Take the stairs or
            jump down. The door in front of you is the entrance to the Stronghold. Enter and you will
            be in a short hall with a door at the end. Go through and you will find yourself in a room
            with a portcullis there are 4 goblins in here, 2 near the door and 2 behind the
            portcullis. You will usually have to fight all 4 in the same pull. After the portcullis
            there are 2 doors, one on the left and one on the right. Take the left one. (if you find a
            secret door that leads back to the ledge, turn around, I didn&#146;t mean that one, you
            have to go through the portcullis before you take the left).</p>
            <b><p>Drunkedness in the Stronghold: </b>I had never heard that Goblins were big
            drinkers&#133; The bar is very popular with players, certainly. The <b>Goblin Bartender</b>
            drops Drakeskin arms (rare) and Drakeskin leggings (Enchanters love the leggings: AC5 +5
            DEX +5 CHA). Getting there is a bit of risk. Go straight you will go up some stairs and
            eventually come to a door. The bar is behind that door. There will be several goblins on
            the stairs getting to the bar. I always pull them back to the portcullis room. When you
            get to bar there are 3 goblins there. The bartender spawns behind the bar (gasp!). There
            are two rooms off of the bar. The one to the left (when you enter the bar) is a storeroom.
            There are 3 goblins here. To the right there is another room with 2 small rooms adjoining
            it. These rooms have pallets and appear to be where the goblins go to sleep it off. One of
            these side rooms is where the <b>Goblin Drunkard </b>spawns. I think it&#146;s the room in
            the back. I cannot confirm this, as I have never seen the Drunkard. Close by is the <b>High
            Goblin Shaman. </b>I understand that he drops the (Glowing Stone Band: +2 AC. Serpent
            Sight) as his common drop. Considering all the people who are up in arms about the loss of
            DE vision with the loss of the Mask of the Deceiver I am very surprised that this item in
            not more heavily camped. Being a Dwarf I have no basis of comparison here. But if you want
            infravision here it is. His other drop I have been told is a Platinum Totem. No idea what
            it does.</p>
            <p>Finding the high shaman is not easy. Much of the Stronghold is maze of confusing turns
            and corridors. I&#146;ll try and give directions, but don&#146;t blame me if you get lost.
            Starting at the portcullis in the Goblin Stronghold, go through and take the door on left
            (towards the bar). Halfway up stairs, turn right and go through that door. There are 2
            spawns in this room. Take the door ahead of you (not the one on the right). Follow the
            hall, it turns left. At the end of hall, past one door on right with one gob in, turn
            right. Go all way to end of hall (there are two rooms in this hall with one spawn in
            each), at the end of hall there should be a red devil head. The door on right of head
            opens into a room with 1 goblin. There is 1 door leading out of this room, to a corridor,
            there&#146;s 1 door directly opposite. Down and to the left there's a door. This goes into
            a small room with lots of books around the wall. There are 3 spawn points to the left of
            the door. This is the Shaman&#146;s room.</p>
            <p><b>QUEST INFO:</b> There is a new NPC in Sol A, <b>Lynada</b>, a Dark Elf mage. She
            may, or may not, have replaced the Shaman. Apparently she is part of some new quest (drops
            the sparkle-purse that <b>Kizdean Gix</b> in West Commons used to have). You can hear her
            casting when you&#146;re at the bar. If you figure out what the sparkle purse is for let
            us know, it appears to be part of a paladin quest (dare I say it&#133; No, won&#146;t jinx
            it). Why do I think it is part of a paladin&#146;s quest? Because of the appearance of the
            &quot;Sparkling Sapphire&quot; &#150; NO DROP - LORE - PAL ONLY All races &#150; at <b>Noresa
            Sparkle&#146;s</b>, a gem merchant in West Commons&#133; Lynada is in the center of this
            room I have been told. She is around level 28-32.</p>
            <p>Back to the portcullis, if you take the right door the hall turns left. There is a
            secret door here and you can continue forward. It doesn&#146;t matter which way you go,
            straight or left, both eventually lead you to the Goblin King. If you go through the
            secret door you take a left and go down a long hall and come to a door. Open the door and
            you will be in a small chamber with 2 others doors. The one on your left leads to a small
            bedroom, the other leads to the throne room. Surprisingly the <b>Goblin King </b>spawns in
            the bedroom. His majesty commonly drops the Ring of the Goblin Lords (AC4 +3 Int +3 Str).
            His rare drop is the Scepter of Flame (Damage 7, Delay 29, +15 Mana, +5 Fire and Magic), a
            nice weapon, but I was hoping for better. If you don&#146;t use the secret door (meaning
            you took a left) you will go down a shorter hall. There&#146;s a room on your left with
            the Goblin Merchant in it. He doesn&#146;t drop anything memorable, but if you have good
            faction or can sneak you can sell to him (he sells water and bandages as well). A little
            farther the hall ends and you have 2 doors, left or right. The King is beyond the right
            one. You will go through a small room with 2 goblins first and you&#146;ll be back in the
            throne room.</p>
            <p>Back out of the throne room and go to the hall with 2 doors (you took the right door).
            If you take the left door and then continue to your right (there&#146;s a door there soon
            see some some jail cells. At the end of the hall there&#146;s a door (not a cell), inside
            you will find the <b>Inferno Goblin Torturer</b>. The few times I hunted him he dropped a
            Turquoise Eyepatch (+2 Str +2 Int +2 Cha) which isn&#146;t that wonderful for melee types,
            but enchanters seem to like them. Since I&#146;ve never seen him drop anything else, I
            have to assume this is his common drops . I have yet to meet anyone who knows what the
            rare drop is&#133; I plan to find out soon.</p>
            <p>There is a zone to Sol B in the stronghold, but it&#146;s fairly deep and as I&#146;ve
            said navigating in the stronghold is pretty difficult, so I&#146;m not going to try to
            lead you there.</p>
            <b><p>STRATEGY</b>: Solusek A is a great place for both loot and experience. If it is
            experience you crave, I would suggest you head to the Stronghold as soon as possible. The
            loot is not as great, (you&#146;ll still get mad amounts of Fine Steal, just not as many
            rare items). I have seen some people get crazy experience there. Start in the portucullis
            room and pull nearby goblins. Once you find you can handle that move on to the bar. After
            that it&#146;s time to tackle the Solusek Goblins and the Goblin King. A small
            well-organized group can utilize the secret hall and camp the Goblin king fairly easily.
            Larger groups should camp the Throne room and pull there (IMHO).</p>
            <p>There is less experience to be had on the other side of the dungeon, but I think the
            great loot and fun is well worth it. I started on the stairs (bad idea &#150; which I
            document &#150; see rules #3, #1, #2 and #6) and quickly moved to the goblins on the ledge
            (pulling them to the Sol B room). When I could get good groups together we would move on
            to the Predator/Foreman rooms. (I have made several camps of the bar, but I find those
            groups have to be much more disciplined.) When that became easy we moved into the Reckless
            Efreeti area. I found I was able to successfully solo the ledge goblins around level 25
            and the Predator room around level 30. I still have trouble with soloing the Foreman room.</p>
            <p>A good group can camp the room above the Efreeti pit, pulling the Efreeti, the Goblin
            Captain room and several surrounding rooms as well. Be forewarned pulling the
            Captain&#146;s room usually results in 4 or 5 goblins (inferno&#146;s and fires).</p>
            <p>At 31 I have several options. I can solo the Predator/Foreman rooms. I can get a group
            to fight in the Captain/Kindle/Efreeti/Singe area. With a good group I can mine for
            melatite among the gnomes. I do this by alternating between Gabbie and the EXG. Or I can
            go after the Throne room and hunt Solusek Goblins. The bar is another choice.</p>
            <p>Well, that pretty much covers the whole place. Good hunting and if you find some
            charred leggings or bracers post something on the Paladin&#146;s of Norrath and tell us
            how. Also, if you out anything more about <b>Lynada </b>let us know.</p>
            <p><i>&quot;Another thing to note about the High shaman room, is that the table blocks
            Line of Sight. So you can go into one corner (to the left of the high shaman), and neither
            Lynada or the other spawn in the room can see you&#133; You can do the same thing in the
            bar. If you fight the bartender behind the bar, the other mobs will not assist (unless he
            moves past the end of the bar).&quot;</i></p>
            <p><i>- Gregory, Xegony</i></p>
            <p><i>&quot; In all cases you will want to kill wizards, then shamans first. Even with a
            good MR force shocks can devastate a tank in short order if they are not resisted.&quot;</i></p>

            <b><p>GOBLINS: </b>There are several types of Goblins in Sol A. The deeper you go the
            bigger and nastier they get. Solusek goblins are only found in the Stronghold. From low to
