            Congratulations to Dainin for finishing the monk epic quest! It is the first monk epic in
            our guild and about 3 groups killed mob after mob throughout the evening to finish it.
            Started with a quick trip to the Plane of Air to kill Gwan on second island, trip to Nurga
            to slay Trunt, and finished up in the lake of ill omen against Vorash, Deep, and
            Xeneverash. Celestial Fists: ac15, agi10 dex10 str20 sta10 hp100 mr10 cr10 fr10 pr10 dr10

            10 Days, 3 epics. Tonight, we raided City of Mist and finished Zulon's epic for the shaman
            Spear of Fate. A few other members are close to finishing their epics and more raids
            coming up in the coming weeks.<br>

            <b>SEP 14-16, 2001</b><br>
            Raid on the Plane of Hate. Late start on Friday due to login server snafu that prevented
            many of us from logging in. Throughout the weekend we cleared the zone several times, and
            the lack of sleep paid of well. We came away with 4 BP's, 40+ items, and numerous gems. A

            Raided City of Mist this evening, and Barelil got final item needed for shaman epic. Grats
            to Barelil! May try for Zulon's if we can take of some unfinished wizard epic business
            first.<br>

            Canceling Vox raid for this evening. Spend some time with the ones you love and pray for
            the victims of the senseless act of terrorism.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SEP 10, 2001</b><br>
            Lady Vox dies for the sixteenth time to Brewall led raid (24-0 versus Nag &amp; Vox). Late
            night. Were short on clerics and enchanters (1 &amp; 0 respectively) until raid members
            got friends to come. Lair pulling still very difficult with Vox agro changes.&nbsp; The
            inevitable only pushed back so long and Vox perished slightly after midnight. Drops were
            Frost Book [Merril], McVaxious Horn of War [Tegerien], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Ammene],
            and Warhammer of Divine Grace [Draconai].<br>
            <br>
            <b>SEP 08, 2001</b><br>
            Descended upon the Hole once again for another long crawl of the dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SEP 07, 2001</b><br>
            Hole raid. Alone got last item for epic and now has Swiftwind! Quite a bit of other loot
            dropped as well including Imbued Granite Spaulders. Returning again Saturday night.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 06, 2001</strong><br>
            Site was down while it was moved to another ISP. Lost a couple days worth of messages on
            the boards. Sorry for technical problems, but short notice couldn't be avoided.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SEP 05, 2001</strong><br>
            Howling Stones raid. Took out Drusella Sathir, the boss mob, once again. Will have to take
            out her still-living husband Venril sometime soon.<br>
            <br>
            <b>AUG 30, 2001</b><br>
            Vox dies for the 15th time last night to a Brewall led dragon raid. Everyone was still in
            blood-lust mode from last night's server problems and were eager to return. Lair still
            tricky to pull with agro changes. Buff stations now at the bottom of the ramps, and did
            not have Vox attack us this time (see Map in updated Vox raid guide). Buffs were very
            quick, and the entire raid was done in well under 3 hours. Vox managed 1 CH, but died
            neverless. Drops were: Book [Tico - 19 time attendee], Kayrul's Mystical Pouch [Roobee],
            Crystalline Spear [Banamana], and 2 Ice Comets [Seviriyn, Zeretul]. Now 23-0 versus Nag
            and Vox.<br>
            <br>
            <b>AUG 29, 2001</b><br>
            Absolute Vox raiding mess last night. Were very close to clearing the lair out, when the
            servers decided to come to a grinding halt. The raiding party was down to just 12 people,
            and many decided to give up&nbsp; after trying for 30+ minutes to get back on. Without
            critical mix of classes, Brewall postponed raid until Thu night.<br>
            <br>
            Updated all the dragon raiding guides for Vox, Nagafen, and Faydedar.<br>
            <br>
            <b>AUG 27, 2001</b><br>
            Lord Nagafen falls yet again to another open attendance/open loot raid led by Brewall. Now
            22-0 versus Nag and Vox. Nagafen fell quickly and deaths were minimal. Loots were: Torn
            Burnt Book [Ciladin], 2 Selo Drums of the March [Cask, Corus], Red Dragon Scales
            [Venswayla/Rado], Bladestopper [Tico], Blight, Hammer of Scourge [Krazus], Jacinth
            [Physst], and a Diamond [Guuma]. Also got to clear out giants in the process, drops were:
            Crown of King Tranix [Faedilsong], Mithril Greaves [Iversen], and Polished Mithril Mask
            [Tularane].<br>
            <br>
            <b>AUG 26, 2001</b><br>
            Venril Sathir's remains were up and we quickly mobilized to take him out. Definitely
            getting better at these quick raids and it is great to see everyone helping each other.
            Both Dunskye and Dodja now have items needed for druid and ranger epics.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 25, 2001</strong><br>
            After over a month of planning, Crimson Talon did its first in-house (with friend invites)
            raid on Fear. Spent Friday night breaking the plane and giving ourselves some breathing
            room. As our first break, we did pretty well, and learned a lot. Sat morning, we got back
            on and proceeded to clear it out. On a whim, we decided to take on the enraged golem (150k
            of hit points), and WON! Only suffered 4 deaths during the 16+ minute fight. Groovit is
            now just 1 item away from the wizard epic (staff from VS)! Drops for the weekend were:
            Thorny Vine Leggings [Udian &amp; Klaminar], Carmine Gloves [Groovit], Carmine Leggings
            [Groovit], Carmine Robe [Groovit], Oil from Enraged Golem [Groovit], Umbral Breastplate
            [Sylvanna], Vermiculated Arms [Azenyth], Cryosilk Sleaves [Jaade], Flayed Turmoil Skin
            Belt [Barelil], Rune Etched Boots [Barelil], Amy Whip [Lumper, Valstorm, Devaberiel],
            Rogue Bracer [Zoranna], Eyerazza [Zoranna, Dreamthief], Shiverback Leggings [Chiun],
            Girdle of the Diligent [Ghoem], Thorny Vine Gauntlets [Klaminar], Umbral Leggings
            [Sylvanna], Vermiculated Leggings [Windarii], Umbral Gauntlets [Sylvanna], Indicolite
            Gauntlets [Lumper], and Valorium Vambraces [Savardar].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 22, 2001</strong><br>
            Three words: &quot;Permafrost was changed&quot;. The mobs, mob placement, roamers, and
            timing are all a bit different in Permafrost. Not big changes, just enough to make pulling
            more work than ever. Vox agro range is a lot bigger than before as well. While we were
            finishing up buffing the buffers, Vox suddenly appeared in the hallway and started killing
            people. Took a while to get her moved back into the lair and get everything back on track.
            For all the trouble, Vox had the last laugh dropping: 2 Kayrul's Mystical Pouches [Kauf,
            Sventhal], 2 Crystilline Spears [Cask, Brewall], a Dragon Bone Bracelet [Nieche], and Ice
            Comet [Silvercaster]. Just for clarification, Nieche came with monk &amp; a 50 enc, wanted
            to play with monk, but I was desperate for enc, I let him roll as monk - this was all set
            in stone prior to groups being announced. I have never turned away a 48+ enchanter from a
            Vox raid, seive is too important.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 21, 2001</strong><br>
            Udian finished the first sword of the ranger epic, Swiftwind (1hs 13/21 str15 sta10 dex10
            mr5 fr5 cr5 pr5 dr5 hp50 2.0wt w/ Swift Spirit: 40% haste &amp; atk40). Needs only a
            Shattered Emerald of Corruption from Hate mini bosses/Inny to get the other sword,
            Earthcaller.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 20, 2001</strong><br>
            Descended upon the Swamp of No Hope to kill Ulump for another part of Tippe's epic. Was
            the first time we were able to take him out with no deaths at all, a very clean fight.
            Tippe is now just a sea horse and a sea dragon away!<br>

            The forces of Crimson Talon gathered in the Burning Woods last night to slay Ixiblat Fer.
            Spent a little time setting up buffs and then Tomwin pulled the mob all the way to the
            Skyfire zone for the battle. A short fight later, Ixiblat lay defeated. Grats to Skylynn
            for another part of her epic and Wyntyr for winning the Circlet of Fire (Head 20mana 15fr
            w/ 5 charges supernova).<br>

            Late night activities in the Eastern Wastes as Hawkien finished his fifth Coldain ring
            quest. A small group was on-hand to kill Scarbrow and the other orcs.<br>

            The six day killing-spree on dragons has ended with 2 dead Nagafen's and 2 dead Vox's.
            &nbsp; Brewall was hosting his 20th open-attendance/open-loots/no reserved items raid last
            night against Vox.&nbsp; With just one lone enchanter on the raid (other than 53+ buff
            enchanters), the fight was going to be a long one. The battle was of epic length and Vox
            managed to get off two complete heals, but it was for naught. Great job by all attending
            keeping her off the walls and continuing to relentlessly beat her into submission. Drops
            were: White Dragon Scale [Woodsing],&nbsp; Dragon Bone Bracelet [Ferdinand], 2 Crystalline
            Spear [Klaminar, Corus], Kayrull's Mystical Pouch [Olwe], and Warhammer of Divine Grace
            [Aenlador]. Aenlador left prior to the roll and Brewall still has item, you have 1 week to
            come claim it. Brewall raids now 20-0 versus Nag/Vox.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>AUG 15, 2001</strong><br>
            Patch day, and another dragon falls. This time Nagafen, the dragon cursed by clerics
            everywhere. Plenty of people on hand, and at least 15 were turned away. Buffs went quickly
            and the battle in Solusek began. Nagafen fell quickly and was only able to claim a few
            victims. Loot was plentiful, but paltry (no CoF or Books): Heirophant's Crook [Windarii],
            2 Gauntlets of Firey Might [Zypheaal, Namffoh], Prayers of Life [Sarduakar], Bladestopper
            [Ciladin], Treasure Hunters Satchel [Kathandros], Ruby Crown [Infernostar], and a Diamond
            [Hawkien]. <br>
