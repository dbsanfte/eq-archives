        <em>Last update: 04 January 2002</em></p>
      <p><b>Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
        Greetings all. I've written this guide to explain how a textbook Faydedar 
        raid is done. This is the compilation of my observations on both good 
        &amp; bad raids and numerous &quot;guides&quot; that I have found that 
        were often lacking, and my successful raid against the dragonfish. For 
        many players, dragon hunts are their first foray into large scale raids 
        and if you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot of 
        what is going on, and what you need to do. Most of all, be patient. Pulling 
        off a large raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short 
        of certain classes. Just working out good groups can take a while.<br>
        <br>
        I've written this guide from standpoint of doing the druid epic quest 
        with the spawned Faydedar. This assumes that you have minimal resources 
        or assistance from level 52+ players, as was such when our guild first 
        began killing Faydedar.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT YOU NEED</b><br>
        1. You should be between levels 45 and 60. Clerics as low as 39 (with 
        complete heal) are also useful.<br>
        2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Fire Resistance of 100. The 
        higher the better.<br>
        3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will 
        be used for beneficial spells. <br>
        4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed, especially 
        if multiple druids are present.<br>
        <br>
        <b>HOW TO GET THERE</b><br>
        1. Melees should bind in East Freeport near the south gates<br>
        2. Casters should bind on docks in oasis<br>
        3. Have an extra non-participant character on docks that has coffins, 
        batwings (or a necro for dead man floating), and a couple store-bought 
        bard drums. Just in case the raid fails.<br>
        <br>
        <b>IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER</b><br>
        1. Faydedar is a level 55 Dragon Magician (no pet).<br>
        2. Faydedar's most deadly weapon is his AE lava (huge radius) and AE fear 
        spell. Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics 
        (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
        3. Faydedar dual hits in the 300's.<br>
        4. Faydedar moves at very close to SoW speed. Very hard to outrun him.<br>
        5. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 
        2xEarring of Fire Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at Lavastorm gypsies), Gold 
        Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10 MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald 
        Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging 
        (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok 
        King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
        6. In order to cast any spell on a dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN ITS MELEE 
        RANGE.<br>
        7. Key to the fight is that only the 1-2 main tanks will be taunting. 
        No one else should taunt!<br>
        8. Anyone sitting during the battle is instantly moved to the top of the 
        hate list. Casters should not sit!<br>
        <br>
        <b>STAGING PHASE</b><br>
        1. When you are in SRO or TD, report in to the Raid leader. Give your 
        class and level.<br>
        2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check 
        with friends if asked.<br>
        3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
        4. The Raid Leader will use Shout channel. All other communication should 
        be on the OOC channel.<br>
        5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and 
        the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical 
        areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers).<br>
        <br>
        <b>SETUP PHASE</b><br>
        1. Faydedar is different from almost all other mobs in game in that his 
        hate for casters is insane. When spawned, he will go after anyone sitting 
        or casting within a huge radius. Key to fight is to let tanks build up 
        enough agro that it is safe for casters.<br>
        2. Under no condition will a caster sit immediately prior to Fay spawn 
        through the end of fight. Doing so, is suicide for the caster.<br>
        3. All casters and reserve tanks will be in far SE corner of the oasis 
        area when Fay is spawned. There will be no pets at the start of the fight, 
        Faydedar starts the fight with large AE fear and will agro pets.<br>
        4. The main tank group will consist ideally of 1-2 warriors, 1 cleric, 
        and 3-4 paladins (can also include an enchanter to chain cast rune). They 
        will fight just SW of the pier. The 2 main tanks will be sitting on the 
        ground when Faydedar is spawned. Paladins should have solid plan to do 
        LoH until all are expended. Goal of main tank group is to engage Fay, 
        and build enough hate that clerics are safe to cast heals. Cleric in main 
        tank group should not cast CH, and should instead cast smaller heals, 
        but should wait until several LoH have been done.<br>
        5. All extra paladins not in main tank group will stage in tunnel area 
        and have target hotkeys ready to heal the 2 main tanks. They will use 
        their LoH during first portion on the fight.<br>
        6. Added security measures to control Fay agroing on casters can also 
        be taken. Casters can log into fight after 30 seconds of tanks initial 
        engagement. Group leaders should program macros to select and invite party 
        members. Now that I have led a raid to kill Fay, I feel this is unnecessary.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BUFFING PHASE</b><br>
        1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff 
        number.<br>
        2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to 
        minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).<br>
        3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.<br>
        4. Once stripped, all buffers &amp; all bards will disband from the groups. 
        Temporary buffer groups will be formed. I suggest doing at least 2 buff 
        stations near the pier. I suggest #1 buff station to the left of the pier 
        and #2 buff station to the right. Clarity should be kept on all buffers 
        and teamed with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, keep chloro and 
        bard singing mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana. Do any magician 
        buffing at the end so they can provide rods as well.<br>
        5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should 
        move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step. 
        Give a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.<br>
        6. The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time. 
        If better spells of the same line are available to raid from 53+ attendees, 
        I suggest using them.<br>
        &nbsp; #01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold)<br>
        &nbsp; #02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
        &nbsp; #03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease, strength)<br>
        &nbsp; #04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision)<br>
        &nbsp; #05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min) - Use 
        better if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min) - Use better 
        if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #07 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min) - Use better 
        if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #08 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min) - Use better 
        if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #09 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min) 
        - Use better if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min) 
        - Use better if available.<br>
        &nbsp; #11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
        &nbsp; #12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
        &nbsp; #13 druid - circle of winter - group FR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
        &nbsp; #14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
        &nbsp; #15 open - for bard resist song<br>
        7. Once buffed, the group should move to the SE corner, disband, OOC that 
        done, and camp out.<br>
        8. When back at the server selection screen, go to the chat area, and 
        go to the server chat (Cazic-Thule in my case). Wait here until someone 
        gets on and says everyone should log back.<br>
        9. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary groups will form groups 
        of 5, buff themselves, and recover mana.<br>
        10. Someone will camp and tell the chat room that the attack will start 
        momentarily. Give group leaders a 30 second head start.<br>
        11. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Fay will cast fear, and it is 
        best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and he fears you, you may 
        wind up far away from oasis or even climb over the top and find yourself 
        outside the outermost ring.&nbsp; <strong>Note:</strong> VI changed this 
        code, when feared you will always move at a set speed, therefore, it no 
        longer does any good to turn on walk.<br>
        12. Reform final groups and OOC group is ready.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ASSAULTING FAY</b><br>
        1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. 
        Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
        2. All casters and extra tank groups should be in SE corner. NO ONE SHOULD 
        BE SITTING. NO ONE SHOULD CAST ANY SPELLS. Bards <b>should not</b> be 
        singing <b>any</b> songs. <br>
        3. Main tank group should be just SW of pier. The two main tanks should 
        be sitting on the ground.<br>
        4. All extra paladins should be near tunnel and should be ready to LoH 
        the main tanks. Having an established order avoids wasting any.<br>
        5. Fay will be spawned and will appear in the water just next to the pier.<br>
        6. Fay will agro on the sitting tanks.<br>
        7. The 1 tank group will engage Fay and will try to build as much hate 
        as possible. Fay hits in the 300 range and lava does about 300-500 damage. 
        Warriors should say when low and paladins should have scripted order of 
        who will do LoH. Do early if necessary.&nbsp; Goal is to build enough 
        hate that other groups can engage without having to worry about Cleric 
        safety. Bards in main tank group can begin singing once main tank has 
        gotten several hits in and taunted at least once.<br>
        8. Keep Fay in SW corner. This will place him farther away from caster 
        camp and minimizes risk of AE lava damage to those in SE corner.<br>
        9. 20 seconds into fight, other tank groups will be called into the fight. 
        Bards in the other tank groups should not start songs until they have 
        approached Fay, they should not start singing in SE corner and risk agroing 
        Fay.<br>
        10. It is now safe for clerics to heal, but not with CH. They should get 
        close to the fight and heal whoever Fay is attacking by chain casting 
        smaller heals. Remember that the two main tanks are taking most of the 
        damage and it is critical they stay alive and at top of hate list.<br>
        11 Casters should summon pets now.<br>
        12. Bards should be playing Elemental and try to slow/snare Fay with Binding 
        song. Twist Guardian if able to do twist three during fight.&nbsp; Have 
        dirge ready for suicide damage.<br>
        13. Tanks with snare spells should chain cast to try to get them to stick.<br>
        14. With LoH exhausted, Clerics can now heal, but should avoid CH. Chain 
        cast lower level heals based on who Fay is attacking. Keep people in primary 
        tank group alive. Multiple clerics should be healing same person at once.<br>
        15. At 60%, Slower/Tasher/Debuffer should run to Fay engagement area in 
        SW corner and try to land spells. Do not cast from SE corner because if 
        you agro Fay, it is too far away from the tanks.<br>
        16. At 50%, send in fire pets.<br>
        17. At 50%, casters should approach SW corner and being nuking. Bards 
        with occlusion of sound should do it now.<br>
        18. Continue all-out assault until Fay is dead.<br>
        ==&gt; In the event that Fay agros on a caster in SE corner, the tanks 
        in SW corner should not move! Instead, they should all sit down to bring 
        Fay back! Failed Fay raids usually involve the dragon running all over 
        at high speeds from SW to SE picking people off 1 at a time. Having tanks 
        stay in 1 place and then sitting if necessary to bring him back will avoid 
        this problem.<br>
        <br>
        <b>FAILED RAID &amp; CORPSE RECOVERY</b><br>
        1. Restage outside first tunnel on the wall.<br>
        2. Bards can be given drums at oasis dock and can be first back on scene 
        to begin pulling corpses. Also, buff with HP/AC/FR buffs.<br>
        3. Fay agro radius is quite large, if you are within the ring surrounding 
        the oasis area, you could be agroed.<br>
        4. Fay will almost always agro on you once you emerge from water into 
        oasis area. If you have very high speed, you can get from tunnel to SE 
        corner without being agroed. Bards can get to SE corner easily if using 
        a drum.<br>
        5. Corpse recovery is best to have high-speed person go in and pull all 
        bodies out of SE corner walls. They should then exit the area pulling 
        a cleric with them. At high speed, it is sometimes possible to exit the 
        area without agroing Fay**.<br>
        6. 2 Monks should enter, FD, and remain FD. One will pull bodies part 
        way, and the other to the edge of the water.<br>
        7. High speed people (1-2 bards), can pull bodies from one tunnel to the 
        other. I suggest staging 1 person in water on outside edge of ring leading 
        to oasis tunnel for them to find entrance easier and also because Fay 
        easily agros when too close to inner ring wall near oasis tunnel. Finding 
        first tunnel is fairly easy.<br>
        8. 1 more person pulls from first tunnel to outer wall rim for rezzing.<br>
        9. In event of puller deaths, priority to get pullers back out and rezzed 
        quickly to keep flow going.<br>
        10. If the plan is to attack again, restage at first tunnel, do buffs 
        and then move to outside wall near oasis tunnel. No one should cast spells 
        in this area. It is fairly safe to sit and camp out.<br>
        11. Rush the first tank group in again and as soon as they agro Fay, send 
        in remaining tank groups. Casters should follow and get into SE corner.<br>
        <br>
        ** Note: Heard rumor that it may be possible for person in SE corner to 
        pull body to top of the wall and have someone on other side do locate 
        corpse to detect closest one and pull it over. This could save a lot of 
        time, but should be done cautiously and one at a time to avoid losing 
        one in the slope.<br>
