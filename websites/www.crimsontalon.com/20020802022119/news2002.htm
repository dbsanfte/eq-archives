            The inky general in Kithicor was cut down by Crimson Talon this evening. Grats to both
            Czad and Yakkai for their rogue epics!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 30, 2002</strong><br>
            While it may seem quiet on the newsfront, the guild has actually been very busy of late
            with some major raiding in many new zones.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Brewall for reaching 60! A new virtuoso!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Immolar for reaching 60! A new archmage!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Hate this evening to go after some of the mini bosses for epic items and some
            other epic mobs as well.&nbsp; Grats to Czad on a rogue bp.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Greigs End this evening.&nbsp; Killed nearly all the named mobs with the exception
            of Greig himself.&nbsp; Among the victims were: Occisor Pimorus, Prast Ianitor, and
            Praetorian Myral.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 19, 2002</strong><br>
            Working on a a few monk and rogue epics this evening. Actually starting to run low on
            epics to complete.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Another large raid on Cazic-Thule. Penetrated deep within the zone and managed to come
            away with a couple interesting items.&nbsp; Everyone is enjoying playing in a new place.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 15, 2002</strong><br>
            Large scale raid on Cazic-Thule this evening. Laid waste to the zone.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 14, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid in Iceclad to finish Greymask's eigth shawl.&nbsp; With 30+ players there showing
            support (and not wanting anyone to lose the seventh shawl), the wandering dwarf was
            scarcely touched.&nbsp; Other loots dropped as well from the attacking mobs, including a
            helmet and a caster primary hand item.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Crimson Talon returned to Grieg's and slayed Praetorian Myral.&nbsp; Nothing like killing
            a 300k HP mob that wields a weapon that procs divine aura.&nbsp; A very long fight to kill
            him, but he went down neverless.&nbsp; Dropped a very nice 1hs weapon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Grieg's End this evening.&nbsp; Fought our way in and managed to obtain the key to
            rest of the zone.&nbsp; Very interesting zone with mob traps and shifting appearances.
            &nbsp; Zone would get a lot more use from players if it was itemized better.&nbsp; Still,
            it is a fun change of pace.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Devaberiel did final hand-ins for bard epic this evening - grats on the new Singing Short
            Sword!<br>
            <br>
            Grats to Barelil for reaching 60! <br>
            </span><br>
            <span class="s2cA"><strong>MAY 06, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed spawned Trakanon for Devaberiel to finish his bard epic.&nbsp; After clearing the
            lair, we spawned Trakanon and killed him within 20 seconds. Fight was over so fast one of
            our manaburn wizards didn't even have time to get off her nuke. Grats to Dreamthief for
            rogue BP.&nbsp; This will be quiet week as many of us are working on exp prior to another
            big raiding week.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAY 01, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Wyntyr for finishing the wizard epic quest this evening.&nbsp; Phinny was very
            stubborn for her and he finally decided to reward her for her efforts. In looking over our
            guild news from the past month, it is easy to see we've been rampaging on epics of late.
            &nbsp; With 10 in just the last 30 days, including some of the toughest in the game
            (magician, warrior).&nbsp; For a guild of our size, this is an epic achievement of its
            own, and demonstrates how well we all work together. There aren't many epics left to get,
            and if could just catch Ragefire...<br>
            <br>
            Also this evening, the Halls of Testing: Chain Bracer [Dreamthief], Plate Boots [Gish],
            Silk Boots [Groovit, Silvercaster], Plate Gauntlets [Stien], Silk Wrist [Jarheuu], and
            Chain Gauntlets [Shcammer].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 30, 2002</strong><br>
            ToV again. Killed twice as many mobs as the night before, but far fewer loots: Silk Bracer
            [Zionmaster], Chain Helm [Barelil], Plate Bracer [Chadmoe], Leather Legs [Physst], Plate
            Helm [Maxist], and Plate Arms [Ceeni].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Big raid on The Halls of Testing this evening and we came away with quite a bit of loot:
            Leather legs [Ikana], 3 Plate Legs [Machedor, Aorthin, Khandrahcir], 2 Plate Bracers
            [Awll, Uggabuga], Chain Tunic [Alone], and 2 Silk Turbans [Mmatil, Silvercaster].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 28, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished another epic this afternoon - congrats to Ippit for finishing the monk epic!
            &nbsp; Also raided Siren's Grotto for some gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Kael.&nbsp; Quite a few drops: Plate Arms [Grumpie], Plate Bracer [Khandrahcir,
            Stien], Silk Sleeves [Greymask], Plate Boots [Tarrask], and a few quest items.&nbsp;
            Killed Phinny later that night and dropped nothing of value, just 1 item short of another
            wizard epic - and we are waiting.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Ssra Temple this evening.&nbsp; Easily cleaned out first floor with little
            difficulty. Came away with some nice spells and next time will progress much deeper into
            this dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Stevenfost completed Shield of Bane quest. The first time he tried to do the quest, the
            mob ran off at end of the fight and died in a rock.&nbsp; When he tried to get help from
            customer support, they didn't do anything to help him, even when he offered to just roll
            back his character.&nbsp; Hats off to Tilol though, he checked the logs and saw that
            Stevenfost did get to this point in the quest and restored his items.&nbsp; Steven did
            last fight this evening and kept the mob snared and far away from rocks.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 24, 2002</strong><br>
            Hawkien completed 8th ring quest this evening.&nbsp; Ippit also attained his Robe of the
            Whistling Fist and then finished the monk epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Miscellaneous experience raiding the next week as we gear up for some guild raids the week
            after.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Lumper for completing the warrior epic! The epic rampage continues!<br>
            Grats to Awll and Maxist for both reaching 60!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 20, 2002</strong><br>
            Quick raid on fear to take out the broken golem to get item for Wyntyr's wizard epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Finished up on the Plane of Sky this evening by decimating bee island and then moving up
            to the seventh, sphynx island.&nbsp; There, we killed drakes until we had our sought after
            item - the crown of elemental mastery.&nbsp; Congrats to Immolar for finishing the
            magician epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 12-14, 2002</strong><br>
            Climbing the islands in the Plane of Sky the last few nights and have been clearing each
            one repeatedly in order to get some quest drops before moving on to the next one.&nbsp; By
            Sunday, we made it to the Spiroc Lord and defeathered the bird several times to get items
            for our warriors.&nbsp; Valstorm obtained the last item he needed to complete the warrior
            epic, and at the end of the evening, dropped down and did the turn-in.&nbsp; Grats to
            Valstorm!&nbsp; Soon, we will move up and work towards finishing off a magician epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 09, 2002</strong><br>
            Server patch today, killed Phinny and he dropped wizard epic piece.&nbsp; Congrats to
            Zionmaster for completing wizard epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 08, 2002</strong><br>
            Congrats to Reapmaster for completing the monk epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 07, 2002</strong><br>
            Congrats to Riverwake in completing the ranger epic for Swiftwind!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 06, 2002</strong><br>
            Dragonfish died again today. Congrats to Morc on druid epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 04, 2002</strong><br>
            Hate raid today to get some resist gear gems and take down as many epic mobs as possible.
            Non-stop killing, and very quick pace. Most of the first floor was cleared within an hour,
            and by the second hour, pickings were rather slim.&nbsp; Still, managed to come away with
            a nice number of gems and a few epic pieces.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 03, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Chardok royals. Killed prince, king, and queen with very few losses. Grats to
            Lumper for warrior epic item. We are very close to our first warrior epic.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 02, 2002</strong><br>
            This was our last night of ToV for a few weeks. Planning on some other activities and
            trying to finish up some epic quests.&nbsp; Drops were very kind tonight: Plate BP
            [Maxist], Plate Legs [Lumper], 2 Plate Gauntlets [Khandrahcir, Ceeni], 2 Plate Helms
            [Valstorm, Brewall], Leather Cap [Tomwin], Leather Boots [Tomwin], and a Black Symbol
            [Altus].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>APR 01, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to ToV. Drops were a bit light tonight: Plate legs [Sylvanna], Chain Legs, Plate
            Boots [Aorthin], and a Ruby Symbol [Skylynn].<br>
            </span><br>
            <span class="s2cA"><strong>MAR 31, 2002</strong><br>
            Instead of ToV this evening, we went to Dragon Necropolis and decided to do a crawl of the
            zone. About midway through the raid, we realized that Zlandicar was up and sent a tell to
            Unseen Hand if they would be interested in teaming up to take him down. Everyone moved
            into position and we took down Zlandicar with only a few deaths from the DoT.&nbsp; Drops
            were: Cowl of Mortality [Valstorm], 2 Talisman of Zlandicar [Unseen Hand], Heart of
            Zlandicar [Mmatil], and 4 spells (2 Focus, Protection of the Glade, Call of the Preditor).
            &nbsp; Valstorm passed down his RBG [Maxist], and Maxist's FBSS went into the guild bank.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Lot of people were out and about tonight. Switched night from raid to just open experience
            and faction.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 28, 2002</strong><br>
            Definitely getting better at ToV.&nbsp; Cleared the halls of testing repeatedly and came
            away with more items than last two nights combined. Drops were: Plate BP [Kilwean], Plate
            Helm [Aorthin], Chain Boots [Alone], Plate Legs [Hawkien], Chain Sleeves [Dodja], Silk
            Robe [Kestel], Silk Pants [Xamren], Chain Tunic [Denor], 2 Silk Bracer [Silvercaster,
            Fenik], 2 Plate Gauntlets [Skylynn, Sylvanna], and Plate Arms [Xamia]. Made our way to
            exit and zoned back out. Grats to all the winners!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 27, 2002</strong><br>
            Another night in ToV's Hall of Testing.&nbsp; Many dragons fell this evening and we were
            amply rewarded with loots: Plate Boots [Maxist, Lisner], Plate Bracer [Sylvanna], Chain
            Helm [Khallin], Plate Breastplate [Awll], Silk Sleeves [Silvercaster], and Silk Boots
            [Kestel].&nbsp; At the end, we medded up and then began walk towards zone exit, only to
            have 4 mobs appear on us at once (nothing like bad agros through walls and bad
            pathing...).&nbsp; We had planned well though, and nearly all the groups were able to
            evac, a few corpses had to be summoned, but overall, great preparedness. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Came back to ToV with a vengance. This time, we cleared large portions of the East Hall.
            Lots of loots this evening! Plate Boots [Valstorm, Kilwean], Plate Helm [Lisner], Leather
            Boots [Chiun], Plate Gloves [Nato], Glowing Drake Orb [Shcammer], and a few other drops.
            &nbsp; Made our way to the exit and zoned back to the start.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 25, 2002</strong><br>
            Crimson Talon's first raid on ToV! We did portions of the East Hall. Still getting our
            feet wet, but still managed to get a chain arms and plate boots.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 23, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Camped near entrance and managed to get some minor loot.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Siren's Grotto. Went to bottom of the well and came away with numerous velious
            breastplate quest gems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Severilous was up again tonight, and Lumper was waiting for him.&nbsp; He quickly put out
            the word in guildchat and we came scrambling from Siren's Grotto to help our warrior out.
            &nbsp; We quickly dispatched Severilous for the second time this week.&nbsp; Drops were:
            Green Dragon Scale [Lumper], Selos Drums of the March [Devaberiel], Rune Bolster Belt
            [Machedor], Dragon Bone Bracer [Dreamthief], and 4 nice spells.&nbsp; Machedor passed down
            his sash of the dragonborn, and a fbss was passed down after that.&nbsp; Grats to everyone
            and thanks to the guests that tagged along with us.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 18-20, 2002</strong><br>
            Coming off a few days in Kael Drakkal to work on faction. Camped different area of the
            zone each night and came away with some nice armour drops. Lots of plate drops last night
            and had enough items go get something to almost every plate user and some extras. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 17, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on Chardok.&nbsp; Went after the royals and killed the prince and king with ease.
            Some other nice items dropped in the library off some named spawns.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAR 16, 2002</strong><br>
            Severilous was up this morning and we were lucky enough to see him. We hastily assembled a
            few groups and killed this wurm. Much easier to kill than some of the other dragons, just
            unfortunate he is insta-killed on every spawn. Drops were: Green Dragon Scale [Valstorm],
            McVaxious Horn of War [Devaberiel], weight bag [Barelil], and 5 spells (2 spirit of
            raptor, spirit of oak, word of redemption, visions of granduer).&nbsp; As a guild, we can
            now say that we have killed all the Kunark dragons.<br>

            With Frost book and Burnt book in hand, Chadmoe finished off the rest of the paladin epic
            quest this evening and is now the proud holder of a Fiery Defender!&nbsp; Grats to Chadmoe

            Big raid on Seblis for spells this evening and we came away with quite a haul; including
            some rare spells.&nbsp; Thanks to all that came to help our casters flush out the spell
            books a bit more.<br>
            <br>
            Congratulations to Dreamthief for finishing the rogue epic last night! Our epic rampage

            The royals of Chardok were trash-talking once again, and we decided to end their reign.
            &nbsp; In quick order, we dispatched, the prince, king, and even the queen.&nbsp; Great
            job by everyone and congrats to all the people who got epic items.<br>

            Trip to Hate resulted in mage staff for Immolar and Klaminar finishing the second ranger
            epic Earthcaller!<br>
            <br>
            Trip to Fear to kill the broken golem resulted in Silvercaster finishing her wizard epic!<br>
            <br>
            Trip to Hole, for 2 enchanter epic items, 1 paladin item, and Tenara finishing her first
            ranger epic, Swiftwind!&nbsp; This after, a quick trip to CoM and luckily getting a jade
            reaver to finally drop.<br>
            <br>
            Killed General in Kithicor to get Dreamthief to within one item of rogue epic, just need
            to get an SMR now.<br>
            <br>
            Slayed the dragonfish again, resulting in Azenyth getting a druid epic!<br>
            <br>
            Biggest news of all, was Crimson Talon leading a raid on Gorenaire herself with just 33
            people (some close friends helped us a lot) and completely owned her with just 2 deaths.
            &nbsp; This, with limited cleric and bard support. Solid tactics and smart playing - the
            Crimson Talon way. &nbsp; Drops were: Frost Book [Chadmoe] and White Dragon Scale
            [Devaberiel]. Chadmoe is now in homestretch for paladin epic!<br>
            <br>

            <strong>FEB 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Grats to Klaminar for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind! Crimson Talon's 8th epic this
            year!<br>
            <br>
            Talendor was happily surveying his territory of wurm-infested lava calderas of Skyfire,
            when Crimson Talon decided to do some landscaping.&nbsp; We sent Devaberiel out to pull
            the beast to our trap, and slayed him losing only a couple people to the DoT not being
            dispelled in time.&nbsp; Brewall was a little dissapointed anyone died, but there is no
            greater glory than being slain by a dragon. Drops were Burnt Book [Chadmoe], Gauntlets of
            Firey Might [Ippit], and about six spells.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 22, 2002 </strong><br>

            <strong>FEB 21, 2002</strong><br>
            Spawned Faydedar this evening and cut him into some nice dragonfish steaks so Yazz could
            finish his epic. Venril Sathir was up as well, so we killed him to get Wiz epic staff,
            shaman legs, and a cleric weapon.&nbsp; From there, we moved on to kill mob for enchanter
            epic.&nbsp; Overall, a very good epic night.&nbsp; Congrats to Yazz for obtaining the
            Nature Walkers Scimitar!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 19, 2002</strong><br>

            The real Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to take him down.&nbsp; Excellent job
            fighting down to the lair and great job on the battle.&nbsp; Trak collapsed into a pile of
            rotting flesh with minimal losses to our small force of 33.&nbsp; Drops were 2 SK
            Breastplates, 4 teeth [Groovit, Greymask, Shcammer, and Khallin], and some very nice spell
            drops.&nbsp; Although it took a while to kill him, we made off with some incredible spells
            and the glory of beating this foul wurm.<br>

            Raid on Dragon Necropolis this afternoon. Several nice gem drops and some other nice
            loots: Spirit Talkers Headdress [Denor], 4 Pabella Fetish, and several batskull earrings. <br>

            Crimson Talon was just starting to assemble for guardian wurm killing in Skyfire Mountains
            when we quickly realized that something was amiss. &quot;Who will challenge me?&quot;
            boomed an NPC wurm named Scales. &quot;Who is brave enough to fight me?&quot;.&nbsp; We
            opted to take on the dragon runt and make him pay the price of his empty boasting.&nbsp; A
            few seconds into the fight, however, something was really, really wrong.&nbsp; People were
            vanishing virtually every second and appearing in random, mob-infested areas of - drumroll
            please - The Deep.&nbsp; After a few GM rezzes and some teleportations, we were back in
            Skyfire, attacked again (sans buggy summoning), and&nbsp; dispatched this wurm. &nbsp;
            Drops were molten cloak, diamondine earrings, and 2 non-magical swords.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Returned to the plane of air to finish off Fenik's necro epic. Grats to Fenik for
            obtaining the Scythe of the Shadowed Soul! Later that evening we went to the Hole and
            killed Master Yael in addition to getting some epic mobs along the way. <br>

            Got necro epic drop this evening and moved a couple alts to the zone so we can resume at a
            higher island more quickly the next time we try this zone.&nbsp; Also helped some
            non-guild people get some epic items before we fell down.&nbsp; Fenik now has a few
            turn-ins to do and a revisit to 3rd island and we should have our first necro epic!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>FEB 03, 2002</strong><br>
            On Friday, we decided to hit the plane of air.&nbsp; By Sunday, we had made our way up to
            the sixth island and killed necro mob epic, but he failed to drop the item.&nbsp; We
            logged for the night and will try him again on Monday. Some of the drops today included:
            Sphere of Swirling Color (rng epic) [Klaminar, Riverwake, Ronthen, Gilthanus, Maemura],
            Belt of Pine (rng haste belt) [Riverwake], Belt of Contention (war haste belt) [All
            warriors on trip], Belt of Concordance (brd haste belt) [Devaberiel], Weight of the Gods
            (clr shoulder item [Skylynn + 2more). <br>

            <span class="s2cA"><strong>JAN 30, 2002</strong><br>
            Emergency patch provided ample opportunities for slaying this evening: Phinny (junk
            loots), Venril Sathir (paly legs, bard legs, wizard epic staff [Silvercaster]), Ixiblat,
            and then the Tangrin [Mysyn].&nbsp; Went to kill Uulump, but he wasn't up, so instead
            moved on to kill reavers in CoM for a while, but no jade reavers dropped. Great job
            mobilizing and getting several epic components in one night!&nbsp; Now have 3 clerics
            waiting on Ragefire...<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JAN 29, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed Ixiblat this evening to get Ointmennt to within 1 item of cleric epic. With two
            clerics now waiting on Ragefire, we are eager to get our first click-sticks.&nbsp; After
            Ix, we cleared the remaining guardian wurm in SF, and then moved on to OT to kill cliff
            golems. No good spell drops, but the adventurers in OT were fairly safe while we buried
            goons of the indigo brotherhood.<br>

            <strong>JAN 26, 2002</strong><br>
            Small raid on the Hole. Drops were: Soulbound Hammer [Ronthen, Gilthanus] and Imbued
            Granite Spaulders [Klaminar].<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JAN 25-26, 2002</strong><br>
            Dallas fanfaire. Brewall, Greymask, and Dodja were there.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JAN 22, 2002</strong><br>
            Killed spawned Trakanon again this evening.&nbsp; Managed to get a cobalt breastplate this
            time [Swolore] and another set of guts [Kilwean].&nbsp; Brewall did turn-in for bard epic,
            Singing Short Sword: 1HS 16/26 str15 dex10 sta5 cha20 hp100 resists10 with Dance of the
            Blade proc (55% haste 30str 30atk 150' radius). Perhaps the best feature of the sword is
            that acts as though you are holding a store-bought instrument of every type in your hand
            and even magnifies the strength of voice skill songs. This item completely changes how a
            bard is played, song selection, and melee capabilities.<br>

            </strong>The resident dragon of Seblis, Trakanon, met an untimely death this evening to
            the forces of Crimson Talon.&nbsp; The night got off to a good start with numerous spell
            drops and even a cobalt helm [Swolore]. We finished off Jumpy who dropped wizard epic
            piece and a robe [Imotep].&nbsp; After some buffing, Brewall spawned Trakanon and were
            able to kill him with only a couple deaths.&nbsp; Flawless execution of the plan by the
            well-seasoned dragon hunting crew led by Brewall's research and everyone's desire to see
            this beast dead. Drops were Guts [Brewall's last item for epic] and a Druid BP [Tomwin].
            Thanks to everyone for coming and we will certainly return to kill many more.<br>

            Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar of Velketor's Labrynth fell this evening to the forces of
            Crimson Talon. Drops were: Frozen Turban (25ac 15agi 0.0wt w/ resist cold) [Altus] and a
            Doljonijiarnimorinar (2hs 33/44 w/Doljons Rage- 140 cold dd). <br>

            Acrylia Circle raid today, and it can be summarized in two words:&nbsp; very cool. &nbsp;
            If you are not familiar with the ring, there is an empty room in Acrylia with a ring of
            totems sticking out of the ground. Once someone steps inside the ring, a few
            non-attackable grimlings appear that regularly summon undead mobs to attack you.&nbsp; If
            you step out of ring, it ends, and if you leave the room, you will get a ton of adds.
            After about twenty minutes of constant attacks, a boss will spawn, and then the next round
            begins, this time, even harder.&nbsp; This is absolute non-stop fighting with changing
            mobs and tactics.&nbsp; We made it up to the third boss and even though the loot wasn't
            great, we had a great time trying something new and different.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JAN 12, 2002</strong><br>
            Raid on the Juggernaughts of Seblis for spells.&nbsp; With so many of our casters hitting
            58 and 60 and staring at empty spell slots, we decided to do something about it.&nbsp; We
            fought down and cleared the Juggs a few times and managed to get about a dozen spells.
            Then, we decided to try a spawned Trakanon.&nbsp; The attack went very smoothly and we had
            Trak down to 10 percent, when, he started warping all over the place. He was in his lair,
            down in the hallway, near the bridge, and then just started cycling between all three and
            sometimes nowhere to be found.&nbsp; A very fustrating fight. We never could get him
            nailed down to finish him off.&nbsp; Later, we found out this was a bug when you: send
            someone in to sacrifice, Trak ports them, Trak tries to follow (appears in hallway near
            bridge where we attacked), and if anyone attacking him steps on the rocks, he starts
            warping.&nbsp; We are adapting our pull/attack strategy and should own him in the next
            fight. Brewall is writing up a strategy guide and is looking for input in the guild-only
            area of forum.<br>

            <strong>JAN 10, 2002</strong><br>
            Servers came back up after the emergency patch and we killed Phinny again for chances at
            epic items. After Phin, we dispersed for an hour until we decided to hit VS.&nbsp; We
            assembled in record setting time, derailed a few trains, killed just about every mob we
            could get our hands on, and then moved into staging room.&nbsp; Quickly cleared all nearby
            mobs, and then took out VS without losing a single person.&nbsp; Great discipline and
            smart fighting from everyone! Drops were a sshisar staff and a diamond encrusted staff.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>JAN 09, 2002</strong><br>
            Large group of us took up residence in Chardok again this evening at the Iksar Betrayer
            camp. We killed everything within a massive pull range and descimated the Sarnak forces
            yielding quite a few minor upgrades.&nbsp; Having spent 8 hours camping this monk epic mob
            the other day, we were hoping our luck would change.&nbsp; After 18 place holders, and
            with just two remaining groups by 11:30pm, we decided to do one more spawn and call it a
            night -- and the Betrayer spawned!&nbsp; Grats to Chiun for finally getting his pipe!
            &nbsp; He completed the robe quest last night and is just a few mobs away from epic.<br>

            Whacked Phinny when the servers came back up from the patch. He dropped a piece of ore
            that Chadmoe needed for shoulder quest item and a crappy shaman staff.&nbsp; We then
            decided to hit VS in the hopes of getting another epic piece.&nbsp; There was a small
            force already there, so we decided to pool together and let each guild roll for dropped
            items. Killed VS without losing a single person and his drops were pretty poor: just
            beastlord and bard legs. Tomwin won roll for us and chose the bard legs [Brewall]. Other
            good developments this evening is Ointmennt got item from Chardok King and is now just an
            Ixiblat and a Rage from a cleric epic.<br>

            Phinny wasn't up this evening so we decided to finish off another epic, this time for
            Skalee (Rezzie's monk). Very successful kills of epic mobs in Lake of Ill Omen, and there
            were no deaths (aside from the token ranger).&nbsp; We are all looking forward to
            finishing off a slew of epics in the coming months. Off to a great start so far this year!

            Raid on the Hole with minimal forces, and yet we were still able to defeat Master Yael for
            the first time. We had a high body count, but with just 16 of us, 2 clerics and 1
            insta-killed DT enc, we still managed to kill him. Yael just didn't bite on our ranger
            sacrifice...&nbsp; Grats to Chadmoe for getting another piece for epic quest! We learned a
            lot with this first kill and will do much better next time.<br>
            <br>

            Big spell raiding day today. With all our recent high-level caster dings, we decided to
            try to get some high level spells. Started in Skyfire with guardians and managed to get a
            few nice spells. Moved on to Juggs in Seblis and got a few other level 60 spells. &nbsp;
            Easily made our way to Trak's lair and waved at the Undead Bard. With a little more resist
            gear and a full raiding force, we will be ready for a spawned Trakanon. Brewall can hardly
            wait!<br>

            <strong>JAN 04, 2002</strong><br>
            Decided to kill General V'Ghera in Kithicor this evening to try to finish Muscled's epic.
            We successfully killed the general for our second time, but we were unlucky on drops.
            Muscled needs to do a little side quest to finish off his ragebringer. Hopefully see
            another epic soon now that the hard part is out of the way. <br>
            <br>

            Congrats to Mysyn for making 60!<br>

            <strong>JAN 01, 2002<br>
            </strong>Raid on City of Mist to finish off Marick's epic.&nbsp;Pets made mincemeat of
            Lord Rak'Ashiir, and after slaying many Black Reavers, we managed to obtain a Jade Reaver
            [Yazz] and an Atramentous Shield. Grats to Marick for our first epic of 2002!<br>
