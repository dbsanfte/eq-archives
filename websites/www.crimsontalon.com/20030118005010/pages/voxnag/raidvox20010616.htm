        <em>Raid Date: June 16 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
        Vox dies yet again at the hands of Crimson Talon and other hearty adventurers 
        who joined us in battle. Interest in the raids is very high, until Brewall 
        started raiding her, she had not gone down for several months, and the 
        attendees were in blood lust. The last five Brewall led raids have eased 
        the oppression of this cruel dragon over the lands of Everfrost, as well 
        as, liberated even more of her property.<br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at 
        how many people showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee 
        that you will have a spot, nor does it indicate the exact starting time. 
        Quite a difference from three weeks ago when I had cobbled together just 
        38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people are showing 
        up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit attendance 
        otherwise things are out of control, people start getting immature, and 
        people don't listen to my instructions.<br>
        <br>
        The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting 
        the hang of it. With only 2 shamans and no 52+ clerics, I had to get inventive 
        with the buffs, but still worked out very well.<br>
        <br>
        Prior attendees are blessing on the raid, and if you wonder why things 
        slow down from time-to-time, I have to deal with some pretty bizarre problems. 
        This raid had quite a few:<br>
        1. Someone did station one buffs, got 14 buffs, and then went to station 
        two and tried to get those...<br>
        2. Had 2 people fall in pits. Nothing I can do until after Vox is dead. 
        Asking me multiple times when I will get it doesn't help. My answer is 
        always - after the fight - and don't fall in pits!<br>
        3. Someone complaining that group disbanded them. Then I find out it was 
        because they missed their group buffing and got 'disbanded' when group 
        camped out.<br>
        4. Over ten people who didn't have peridots or any platinum to pay. Very 
        annoying to deal with on an open raid.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out into middle 
        of room was very well executed. She did get off 1 CH during the fight, 
        but it was a losing battle for her.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Altus for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's 
        guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly 
        appreciate their efforts. And to the buffers that evening as well: Khallin, 
        Bolgor, Loen, Mysyn, Aprisle, Taraddar, Galadriad, Venswayla, Espin, Xiaoling, 
        and Eirye. For all the first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>
        <br>
        My computer is really screwed up right now, and I locked up hard twice 
        last night. Going to get a new hard drive and rebuild and reinstall everything. 
        Died hard right when I was about to do loot, but at least it didn't happen 
        during fight.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ATTENDEES</b><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees. As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        <b><br>
        THE KILL</b><br>
        Vox did manage to get off 1 Complete Heal's during the fight, but went 
        down neverless. Kept her off walls.<br>
        Thanks again go to Altus for pulling corpses out of the pits after the 
        fight and to all the clerics for doing the rezes.<br>
        Vox was dead by 10pm CST and loot completely finished by 10:20.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT</b><br>
        <b>Staff of Forbidden Rites</b> - won by Altus<br>
        <b>Runed Bolster Belt</b> - won by Chiun<br>
        <b>Ice Comet Spell</b> - won by Eiyre<br>
        <b>Ice Comet Spell</b> - won by Guldaenya<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</b><br>
        1. Confirmation that on list for raid. I will hard cap at 40, and keep 
        a few spots open for classes the raid is short on. Hate to tell people 
        no, but going to have to do it. Server gone from 0 kills in 2 months to 
        5 kills in 2 weeks and the word has gotten out that my raids work.<br>
        2. Will kick &quot;BOOK DROP&quot; button. Vox 0-4 on book drops and I'm 
        really feeling sorry for paladins. Vox should drop one every time in my 
        opinion.<br>
        3. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>OLD INFO ON WDS:</b><br>
        5. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of X (will work on this week to come 
        up with factor). I will target the factor so that the collective numbers 
        that bards have is approximately 50% of the total pool of numbers on the 
        roll. So bards have a 50% chance of winning, otherwise a caster wins it. 
        Many of the bards that have won are continuing to attend with hopes of 
        getting other dragon items, so it may be that the only people rolling 
        on WDS are casters.</p>
 <b> Until the next raid,<br>
