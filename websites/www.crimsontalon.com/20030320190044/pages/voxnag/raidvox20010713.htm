        Vox </span><br>
        <em>Raid Date: July 13 2001</em></p>
      <p><b>Report from raid leader Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule</b><br>
        <br>
Vox dies for a eigth time at the hands of Crimson Talon 
        and other hearty adventurers who joined us in battle. Interest in 
        the raids is very high, and I had to turn away no less than 10 people. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Word has definitely gotten out about the Vox raids, and I am amazed at 
        how many people showed up early. Signing up on EverquestRaids is no guarantee 
        that you will have a spot, nor does it indicate the exact starting time. 
        Quite a difference from a couple months ago when I had cobbled together 
        just 38 people, and felt lucky to get that, now, tons of people are showing 
        up. To anyone I had to turn away, I appologize, I have to limit attendance 
        otherwise things are out of control.<br>
        <br>
        The two buff stations worked out well again. People are really getting 
        the hang of it. Great opportunity for capitalists to sell peridots. Always 
        seems to be people around without them.<br>
        <br>
        If you ever wonder what is going on or why things are taking so long, 
        just keep some things in mind:<br>
        1. Pulling Vox's guards without agroing Vox can be tricky. Nothing worse 
        than having Vox agro and start summoning people from goblin king area 
        to their death - and I've seen this happen on one bad raid I was on. If 
        it takes a while, it is well worth it.<br>
        2. As raid leader, I average 1 tell every 10 seconds and I still have 
        to do groups, buffers, and a number of other things. If you are in a temp 
        group, find out if any are new attendees and help them along if you can, 
        explaining loot, warning about traps, and flow helps a lot.<br>
        3. If I say raid is full, it is full. If I say it is too late, it is too 
        late. Sending additional tells won't help. I try to accomodate long-time 
        attendees and work in classes I'm short on, and try to be as fair as possible. 
        Sometimes, I just can't add people and keep things going smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        Excellent job by all listening to instructions. Pulling Vox out from the 
        hallway was tough, but was happy to see people back off and then surround 
        her in the lair. Vox managed two CHs, but did her little good.<br>
        <br>
        Special thanks go out to Cowabunga for pulling of the Ice Giants and Vox's 
        guards. This is an extremely difficult and important task and I certainly 
        appreciate his effort - even if he pulled almost all of them at once. 
        And to the buffers that evening as well: Khallin, Sabore, Kauf, Evelyn, 
        Galadriad, Loen, Greymask, Cilden, Windarii, and Guldaenya. For all the 
        first time buffers that were there, great job!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ATTENDEES</strong><br>
        Below is a list of all attendees.&nbsp; As promised, I am including the 
        loot numbers next to the names (I always do alphabetically) so everyone 
        can see which random number(s) they had for each item. Gaps in the numbers 
        reflect raid points, and the number listed is the max number that person 
        has (e.g. Aprisle Eyepatch number is 1, Aridican had 3, so, Aprisle had 
        #1, Aridican had #2 and #3 on rolls.<br>

        Note: Any mistakes on numbers are accidental, and once loot is divided, 
        final. All raid points are posted on site and if incorrect, let me know. 
        I still like raid points and think they are a lot more democratic than 
        other raids that give items to the 'most deserving' person (usually the 
        level 52 with the best gear) or those that do pure random and attending 
        more than 1 raid means nothing.<br>
        Note 1: Cilden / Ciladin always rolls as paladin. Enc character is an 
        alt that helps with buffing.<br>
        <strong><br>
        THE KILL</strong><br>
        Excellent job getting her out of hallway. Takes a lot of discipline, but 
        was necessary.<br>
        Excellent job keeping her surrounded in middle of room!<br>
        Vox was dead by 10:30pm CST and loot completely finished by 11:00.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>THE LOOT</strong><br>
        <strong>Crystalline Spear </strong>- (1) Won by Borq<br>
        <strong>Staff of Forbidden Rites</strong> - (9) Won by Cellwin<strong><br>
        Dragon Bone Bracelet</strong> - (1) Won by Cowabunga. (donated to Jevrulle)<strong><br>
        McVaxious' Horn or War</strong> - (1) Won by Brewall<strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>WHAT WILL BE DONE DIFFERENT FOR THE NEXT RAID?</strong><br>
        1. People need to report in when I shout for names. If you do not send 
        in your name, you are not even on my radar to be assigned to a group. 
        It takes me a while to go through tells, and I rarely miss someone.<br>
        2. Suggest that Clerics/Enchanters sell peridots for 14pp. At levels 45+ 
        everyone should be carrying a stack of 20 with them at all times. Good 
        habit to get into, if you accept less from guildmates/friends, that is 
        your decision. Hate to see cle/enc tie up tons of pp in peridots for those 
        that don't carry them.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>OLD INFO ON WDS:</strong><br>
        3. As promised when I first started setting raids up, the WDS would open 
        up once the original 4 bards had won scales. I did not foresee 2 dropping 
        last night and did not have my spreadsheet ready for caster/bard odds. 
        On the next raid, the WDS will be open to casters with the following conditions:<br>
        -If 3 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the others will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 2 scales drop, 1 will be bard only, the other will be casters+losing 
        bards.<br>
        -If 1 scale drops, the roll will be bards+casters. However, I will multiply 
        each bard's raid points by a factor of 5. I have targetted the factor 
        so that the collective numbers that bards have is approximately 40%-50% 
        of the total pool of numbers on the roll. So bards have a 50% chance of 
        winning, otherwise a caster wins it. Many of the bards that have won are 
        continuing to attend with hopes of getting other dragon items, so it may 
        be that the only people rolling on WDS are casters.</p>
