            <span class="s2cA"><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br>
            Everyone on a Crimson Talon Vox/Nag raid has a chance at winning loot. Items are open
            loot, with no reserved or claimed items. This is typical of our regular raids and our big
            raids. For our typical raiding during the week, we distribute loot to any attendee based
            on need before greed, we don't use points, and no special treatments.<br>
            <br>
            Dragon raids are a bit different in that it takes a lot of people pull one off, and have
            to do multiple times in order to get a chance at item. This is the reason for the Vox/Nag
            rules and points, with often 40+ attendees, numerous guilds, unguilded individuals, epic
            items, uber-loot, everything needs to be clear so that it is fair and avoids confusion.<br>
            <br>
            This page will: (1) Detail all loot rules, (2) Detail how the point system works, and (3)
            Talk about Brewall's future raiding plans<br>
            <br>
            <strong>HOW IS LOOT DONE? DO I HAVE TO DO A RANDOM?</strong><br>
            As people check-in for the raid, their name, class, and level are entered into a
            spreadsheet that tracks prior attendance and calculates loot numbers.&nbsp; Some items are
            simply 1 person = 1 number, for special items it is 1 person = 1 number + raid points.
            This is done so everyone has a chance at an item, but multi-raid attendees have improved
            odds (reflecting their prior risk and raiding effort).&nbsp; Note that even new attendees
            have a chance at anything!<br>
            <br>
            The raid leader assigns everyone a sequential number based on their name (done
            alphabetically) and does a&nbsp; &quot;\random 1 N&quot; and the person whose name matches
            the number wins. This allows people who participated in raid, but are still being rezed/LD
            a chance at loot.<br>
            <br>
            After each raid, all raid points and a recap of the loot numbers for each item rolled is
            posted to the Crimson Talon website if anyone wants to check later. Those that have
            attended prior raids can attest to my honesty in handling loot - 3 bards I did not know
            prior to the Vox raids won White Dragon Scales prior to my winning, and as raid leader, it
            was the 4th raid before I won one (and was the main reason I started the raids!).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>VOX LOOT RULES &amp; ROLLS:</strong><br>
            <strong>*Book of Scale</strong>: Paladins 50+, 1 number + BOOK raid points<br>
            <strong>*Crystaline Spear</strong>: Bard, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Dragon Bone Bracelet</strong>: Monk, if monks have one, will go to all
            melee/hybrid. Extremely nice item for monk due to low weight, and most tanks have better
            items. <br>
            <strong>*Kayrull's Mystic Pouch</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*McVaxious Horn of War</strong>: Bards. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Runed Bolster Belt</strong>: Bard, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Warrior. 1 number + raid points<br>
            <strong>*Scimitar of the Mistwalker</strong>: Druid, Ranger. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Staff of Forbidden Rites</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Necro,
            Shaman, Wizard. 1 number + raid points<br>
            <strong>*Warhammer of Divine Grace</strong>: Cleric. 1 number.<br>
            <strong>*White Dragon Scale</strong>: Special item. See explanation below. Casters &amp;
            bards. Bards 50-52 will have their numbers factored <strong>5x</strong> to reflect
            importance of epic. If I ever hear of bard from my raid selling their WDS, they will never
            receive a potentially sellable quest item on any future raid I host, if this is their
            intent, they should inform me, and I will unfactor their numbers. If a caster wins, and a
            bard is present with a Heirophant cloak, White Dragonscale cloak or better, <strong>a
            trade will be enforced</strong>. The white dragonscale cloak is a nice item, but there are
            better cloaks in the game, and the Heirophant's all-around statics coupled with the 200
            int/wis mana cap, make it superior in many ways.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>NAG LOOT RULES &amp; ROLLS:</strong><br>
            <strong>*Book of Scale</strong>: Paladins 50+, 1 number + BOOK raid points<br>
            <strong>*Bladestopper</strong>: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Shaman, Warrior. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Blight, Hammer of Scourge</strong>: Shaman. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Cloak of Flames</strong>: Bard, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Warrior. 1 number + raid points <br>
            <strong>*Gauntlet of Firey Might</strong>: Monk. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Gold Plated Koshigatana</strong>: Bard, Enchanter, Magican, Necromancer, Ranger,
            Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Heirophant's Crook</strong>: Druid. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Orb of Tishan</strong>: Bard, Enchanter, Magican, Necromancer, Wizard. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Prayers of Life</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Red Dragon Scale</strong>: Bard &amp; Warrior 50+. 1 number + RDS raid points<br>
            <strong>*Red Dragon Tooth</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Selo's Drums of the March</strong>: Bard. 1 number.<br>
            <strong>*Treasure Hunters's Satchel</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <br>
            <strong>*Crown of King Tranix</strong>: Bard &amp; Enchanter. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Polished Mithril Torque</strong>: Paladin, Ranger, Shadow Knight. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Polished Mithril Mask</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer,
            Ranger, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Wizard. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Rokyl's Channeling Crystal</strong>: Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Wizard. 1
            number<br>
            <br>
            *If you ever win an item, you are ineligible to <u>ever</u> receive another of the same
            item.<br>
            *It is possible to win multiple items on raid IF you win a nice item and are then the only
            class eligible to win the second item (e.g. A cleric wins eyepatch and is the only cleric
            on raid that does not have a Warhammer, Bard wins WDS and is only bard that does not have
            a horn).<br>
            *If a person wins 1 item, I will usually say numbers they have when a second item come up,
            just because of my spreadsheet calculations, if their number is rolled on second item, the
            random will simply be done again (e.g. BardX wins a WDS and 'wins' again on roll for horn.
            If there are other bards on raid that do not have a horn, the random is thrown-out and
            redone. If all other bards on the raid already have a horn, however, they could win the
            horn as well on the same raid).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>SELLING DRAGON ITEMS</strong><br>
            1. Selling the following items won at one of my dragon raids, is seriously frowned upon:
            Runed Bolster Belt, Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch, White Dragon Scale, Red Dragon Scale,
            Cloak of Flames, and Gauntlets of Firey Might (because roll to is monk-only). Selling one
            of these items, will result in loot exclusions from future raids.<br>
            2. Beginning raid #7, when I opened the Rez Stick to all (from mnk/shd only), it is ok to
            sell, but you would not be welcome on any Crimson Talon plane raids. It is far more
            appropriate to donate to guild or to keep for any plane raid you go on. If you ever plan
            to go on a plane raid, I suggest you do not sell this item. The rez stick is a critical
            item for most plane raids and other big-encounter raids.<br>
            3. Selling any of the remaining items is acceptable.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>RAID POINTS</strong><br>
            Everyone attending the raid is given 1 Raid Point. The Raid Leader (Brewall) is given 2
            extra Raid Points for leading the event. For history buffs, eighteenth century pirate
            captains usually divided treasure out equally to all crew members, and they themselves
            took a 3x share. Rather democratic in my opinion, and I follow the same tradition, giving
            myself just 2 extra shares/points, far more fair than reserving items (which I will only
            do if multiple of the same item drop - otherwise, I treat myself the same as anyone else).<br>
            <br>
            For those that have never hosted a raid, doing so is an enormous amount of work. I average
            1 tell every 10-15 seconds for almost an hour before the fight and still have to work out
            groups, buffers, final strategy, and making sure the loot calculations are correct. I
            don't like to guarantee items, instead preferring everyone to get a chance at it, but as a
            raid leader, will have slightly better odds to reflect the work to put raids together.<br>
            <br>
            The raid leader, at their discression, can award additional points to individuals for
            service above and beyond the call of duty. <br>
            <br>
            <u><em>What are the points for?</em></u><br>
            Dragon raids take a lot of people to pull off and usually only a few (very nice) items
            drop, and even then, not all the time (RBB &amp; Eyepatch). Attend 1 raid, you may not win
            anything, attend more than 1, you stand a better chance.<br>
            To pull this off, I give out raid points to encourage people to attend more than one raid.
            The more you attend, the better chance you have at winning nice items, but there is still
            a chance for a new attendee to win as well (why attend is you stand zero chance at
            winning?). People who have attended more raids have taken more overall risk. Someone who
            has attended 5 raids should stand a better chance at winning an item than a first timer.
            Plus, multi-attendees are more experienced, need fewer instructions, usually get better
            resistance gear, and ease the work done by the raid leader.<br>
            <br>
            <em><u>How do the points help?</u></em><br>
            Each time you come to a raid you get 1 point. The points are used to give you an extra
            number in the rolls for the good loot items. The first time you come to a raid, you have 1
            number, people who have attended a prior raid have 1 number + 1 number for each raid
            point.<br>
            <br>
            (2001.07.24) Those with 10+ raid points get a point bonus on the raid point items. The
            bonus is 1 number for raids 11-20, 2 numbers for 21-30, 3 numbers for 31-40, etc. Items
            are still not reserved, but this increases odds for the die-hard attendees. This bonus
            works on BOOK points as well. Note: there are still no reserved items.<br>
            <br>
            <em><u>Ugh! Sounds complicated, Give me an example.</u></em><br>
            It's actually very easy. Say JoePaladin attends raid #1, he gets 1 raid point. No book of
            scale drops on raid #1. JoePaladin and MaryPaladin come to raid #2, and if a book of scale
            drops, JoePaladin would get two numbers (#1 and #2), MaryPaladin would get one number
            (#3). If they were the only paladins on the raid, the raid leader would do a \random 1 3
            to determine the winner. Mary still has a chance at the book, but Joe has a better chance
            reflecting his prior attendance.<br>
            <br>
            If Joe lost to Mary on the roll for raid #2, he has a lot of motivation to come to raid #3
            (3 numbers now on rolls: 1 number+2 raid points), <strong>and to bring along some friends
            to make sure the raid isn't short of people</strong> because he has some good odds at
            winning. Hopefully, Mary will also return to the next couple raids to help fellow paladins
            who did not win a book.<br>
            <br>
            <u><em>What items are the points for?</em></u><br>
            For the <strong>Dragon Scales, Runed Bolster Belt, Cloak of Flames, and Tobrin's Mystical
            Eyepatch</strong>. If you win an item, you go back to 0 points. Once you win an item, you
            are ineligible to receive another of the same item <strong><u>ever</u></strong>. You do
            not lose your points if you win another item (pouch, bracer, horn, etc). <br>
            <br>
            (2001.07.24) Paladin Books are based on separate pool of BOOK points. These count toward
            either the burnt or frost book and have no bearing on the regular raid points used for
            haste items.<br>
            <br>
            (2001.08.11) Red Dragon Scales are based on separate pool of RDS points. These count
            toward the Red Dragon Scale and have no bearing on the regular raid points used for haste
            items.<br>
            <br>
            I treat CoF &amp; RBB as 1 item. If you win one, you cannot win the other.<br>
            <br>
            All other items are 1 person = 1 number.<br>
            <br>
            The raid leader, at their discression, can use their points on these 1-point items to
            increase odds. If they win, loses all points to date (e.g., bard hosting raids has a WDS
            and decides to use points on future rolls for horn to increase odds). This still allows
            others chances at the item, and keeps the raid leader motivated to not freeze out new
            attendees of same class.<br>

            <em><u>How is the White Dragon Scale treated?</u></em><br>
            For bards, this is the critical item needed for the epic quest.&nbsp; Personally, I hate
            the way VI did the bard epic, it hurts casters and it hurts bards. On other servers, it
            has meant that casters that win the WDS have been turning around and selling it for over
            100k to high level bards instead of turning it in for a cloak, and yes, the epic would be
            worth that much.&nbsp; I've tried to come up with an alternate system that is fair to
            bards and yet benefits casters as well.<br>
            <br>
            *For the first couple raids, the rolls for the WDS will be bard only (level 50+). <strong>DONE,
            5 BARDS HAVE SCALE.</strong><br>
            *These bards are expected to use the WDS for epic. If they ever sell the WDS, they will
            never be eligible to roll again for a WDS. They will also <strong>never</strong> be
            eligble to receive another non no-drop item used in a quest on any future raid I host. If
            you plan to sell it, refuse to roll and wait until opened to casters.<br>
            *Casters will get a raid points for each raid.<br>
            *(Old info) Until all the bards from the first raid have won a WDS (2 bards still have not
            won), the roll will remain bard only. A new bard coming to the raid at this point would
            still have a chance to win, but at lesser odds because of the accumulated raid points of
            the other bards. I'll note that the odds are still better than waiting till level 60 and
            taking out Gore...<br>
            *Now that the remaining two original&nbsp; bards have won, the roll is open to casters.
            &nbsp; However, bards 50-52 will get their raid points factored up by <strong>3x</strong>
            to improve their odds. &nbsp; Remember, raid points are used! So, on raid #4, a caster who
            has attended every raid will have 5 numbers, a first-time caster would have 1, a
            first-time bard would have 3, and a third time bard would have 9.<br>
            *If multiple scales drop, I will do 1 exclusively to bards and others to casters (losing
            bards in on this roll). If 3 drop, 1 will go to bards, 2 to casters (losing bards will be
            in roll as well).<br>
            *To avoid scalping the WDS to high level bards (for 100k+), I will allow high-level bards
            to offer a cloak trade at the conclusion of the fight (if a caster wins). A cloak of equal
            or greater value for the WDS <strong>will</strong> be traded 1-for-1 for the scale.&nbsp;
            Casters do not have a choice, the trade will be forced. If more than one bard is present
            offering to make the trade, I will randomly select one. I don't want to see high level
            bards trying to outbid each other on this.<br>
            &nbsp; Exceptions:<br>
            &nbsp; 1. I will not force the trade if the caster is the alt of a 50+ bard that needs the
            scale for their epic. They need to tell me prior to any loots. The WDS will be given
            directly to the bard.<br>
            &nbsp; 2. Caster only wants WDS in order to give, without any compensation, to a 50+ bard.
            They should tell me prior to any loots. The WDS will be given directly to the bard.<br>
            <br>
            *<u>53+ Bards // 53+ Bards with alternate characters</u>. I've gotten a number of messages
            from 53+ and those with alts in the 45-52 range wanting to know how to get the scale. They
            have a number of options to get a scale:<br>
            1. Attend raids and take chance (like everyone else) on winning a scale. If you win (and
            tell me you are the alt), I will not force you to take a trade if a high-level bard is
            present and wanting to trade.<br>
            <br>
            2. Come to raids with a group of friends (casters). If any of them wins the roll (and tell
            me that they are part of your odds), I will not force them to take a trade if a high-level
            bard is present and wanting to trade. Getting a group of 4-5 casters on a few raids to
            attend would give you a nice chance at the scale.<br>
            <br>
            3. Get a greater or equal cloak and offer it for trade at end of the fight (to raid
            leader). I will ensure that the items are traded. You must attend 1 raid in person to help
            with mana and then name is entered on list and in event that caster wins, I will check to
            see if you are on-line and available to trade.<br>
            <br>
            4. Come to raids as buffing alt (shm/clr/enc/dru). If you are needed for buffing on 10+
            raids and can participate in the fight, your alt's class can be switched to a bard on
            raids 11+ and you request it. Participation at this level means that you have positively
            benefitted a significant number of raids. It is strongly suggested that you do not take
            any items that would affect your points until after raid 10. This is a rather rare
            exception, but occassionally may happen with hard to find classes such as clr/enc.<br>

            <i>(2001.08.15 NEW- POINT TRANSFERS- starting raid #21)</i><br>
            <strong>POINT TRANSFERS</strong><br>
            On a limited basis, point transfers of Raid, Book, and RDS are allowed between one
            character and another. Conditions below:<br>
            1. Transfer between main and alts. Allowed at any time. Warning: If I perform such a
            transfer and find out later it is not an alt (trust me, people will rat on you in a
            heartbeat), all points are wiped and I will not look favorably upon you for future raids.<br>
            &nbsp; a. Can transfer all 3 point types to an alt (e.g. came as cleric to 5 raids and
            want to give points to warrior alt, you can transfer 5 raid &amp; 5 rds points to your
            alt).<br>
            2. Transfer between you and someone else. Allowed, but only if other person has 5+ raids.
            This is to prevent a complete dragon newbie getting a lot of points, causing problems,
            winning an item, and causing ill-will from prior attendees.<br>
            &nbsp; a. Can only transfer point types that the transferer has (e.g. a monk could give
            raid points, but no book/rds points to someone else).<br>
            &nbsp; b. The person who currently has the most points-to-date is the ceiling for all
            other transfers.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. You can transfer unlimited points to the person with most
            points-to-date. This effectively raises the point ceiling.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. You cannot give someone points if it would bring that person to
            within 1 point of the person with most points-to-date (e.g., PlayerX has most
            raids-to-date with 25. You could give points to PlayerY up to a max 24, but no more). This
            allows the person with max-points to feel relatively secure in their position.<br>
            3. I must receive a tell from the person giving points prior to the raid. I will not
            accept tells from the recipient.<br>
            4. Once transfered, you can never get them back from the recipient. They become their
            points.<br>
            5. <br>
            <br>
            <i>(2001.08.13 CLARIFICATION)</i><br>
            <strong>ROLLING AS DIFFERENT CLASS</strong><br>
            On a case-by-case basis, the raid leader may allow someone to roll as a different class.
            In all cases, change is made prior to any loots. Scenarios below:<br>
            1. Raid is short on buff class. Buffer is not interested in rolling for that class, and is
            instead only interested in rolling for an alt level 45+. Can roll as the other class, and
            if wins, item will be given directly to the alt.<br>
            2. Person comes to raid with 2 characters. The person prefers to play one class, but other
            class is needed by raid (e.g. person brings warrior&amp;cleric to raid. Prefers to play a
            warrior, but cleric alt is needed). Can play one class and roll as if were other class.<br>
            3. (from 53+ bard section above) Come to raids as buffing alt (shm/clr/enc/dru). If you
            are needed for buffing on 10+ raids and can participate in the fight, your alt's class can
            be switched to a bard on raids 11+ and you request it. Participation at this level means
            that you have positively benefitted a significant number of raids. It is strongly
            suggested that you do not take any items that would affect your points until after raid
            10. This is a rather rare exception, but occassionally may happen with hard to find
            classes such as clr/enc.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>HEY BREWALL, HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU PLAN ON KILLING DRAGONS?</strong><br>
            For those that don't know me, I'm a 52 bard that hopes to see an epic some day. I lacked
            the 100k+ pp to buy a white scale and killing the only alternate source (Gorenaire) looked
            like a remote possibility at best when I hit 60. I waited around for Vox raids, but no one
            was making an effort to kill her. After two months of Vox living happily every day, I
            decided to do something about it. I went through every piece of Vox raiding information I
            could find, combined it with my knowledge and expections of how a Vox raid should be done
            (including loots), wrote a guide, and scheduled some raids. Now as a host, I find myself
            constantly improving my guide (found on this site in the guide area) after every raid with
            my own observations and suggestions from others.<br>
            <br>
            Thrice I had been a victim to my own idealistic open looting rules (before I finally got a
            WDS), and am probably only one of the few bards on <strong>any</strong> server to hold
            THREE (3!) white dragon scales and then hand them to others. Then, I even lost a roll for
            a RDS on raid #9 (1 of 2 remaining items for my epic). If anyone doubts my integrity and
            fairness in handling loot, I think this alone says that I am honorable and trustworthy.
            Granted, I could make a mistake when doing the numbers, but not intentionally, and my
            spreadsheet that calculates the numbers is extremely solid.<br>
            <br>
            I plan on holding dragon raids until I, at a minimum, get a white scale, red scale, a
            mcvaxious horn, and a selo's drum. After that, I will likely do several more to get other
            bards a WDS, and melees &amp; casters a RBB/Eyepatch/WDS (many CT members have been
            attending raids and have a decent total pool of numbers, bound to win sometime with enough
            raids). Perhaps I will also get a haste item, but time will only tell on that. I probably
            play EQ as it was meant to be played, I rarely camp for experience and spend my time
            exploring as much of the game as I can (which is easy to do a bard speed+track), because
            of this, I level pretty slowly, so 53 is still a ways off. When I do get to 53, I will
            likely push to get to 55 and then host other big encounter raids.<br>
            <br>
            I'll continue to keep scheduling the raids when I believe dragons are up and can get
            enough attendees. The raids are always listed at Everquestraids.com. If I miss a week, the
            risk of dragon not being up is too great or I'm on vacation somewhere. Dragons are on a
            random 7-10 day timer, and I got burned on raid 2a when we waited for hours after more
            than 8 days passed.<br>
            <br>
            There is no real way to 'reserve' a dragon, and I try to work with other guilds to come up
            with rotations that are mutually agreeable. The last thing I want is a race every week and
            fighting among guilds.<br>
            <br>
            In the event of a patch, I will reschedule raids to maximize kills. There may be a raid
            that day or the following day.<br>
            <br>
            When I do stop having raids, I will write a hosting guide, a listing of all the keyboard
            shouts I use (over 40), how to form groups, tactics (especially when short on classes),
            and the spreadsheet I use to do groups &amp; loot.<br>
