      <p><strong>SEP 30, 2002</strong><br>
        ToV Hall of Testing raid. Quite a few drops including a chain bp. Afterwards, 
        we killed Escorpa and Tantor in WW.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 29, 2002</strong><br>
        Brewall is starting to take apart the website and rebuild it so it is 
        more flexible and maintainable. Updates will be infrequent for the next 
        few weeks until it is converted over.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 28, 2002</strong><br>
        Quite a few people have been finishing off key quests of late.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 23, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Trakanon again to obtain more teeth. Drops were: 2 Teeth [Klaminar, 
        Lumper], Donal BP [Aorthin], and a Cobalt BP [Guild bank].</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 21, 2002</strong><br>
        Finished Aorthin's epic this evening. Grats to Aorthin for the water sprinkler! 
        Ragefire also dropped 3 red dragon scales. Would have preferred 3 cloak 
        of flames. From there, we did a bit more epic work in the Hole.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 20, 2002</strong><br>
        Experience night after a lot of raiding. A few of us went over to skyfire 
        and managed to obtain 2 more shards within an hour using Brewall's patented 
        camping technique. Aorthin is just a Ragefire away from epic!</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 19, 2002</strong><br>
        Another night in ToV. Got off to a slow start, but then we cleared the 
        Halls of Testing in record time. Drops were very light for plate, but 
        the other classes were very happy. Loots: Chain BP [Shcammer], Leather 
        Gloves [rotted], Silk Wrist [Chantress], Chain Helmet [Dreamthief], Chain 
        Legs [Klaminar], White Symbol [Brewall], Leather Legs [for MQ], and a 
        Silk Turban [Kestel].</p>
      <p>After we zoned out of ToV, we realized that Escorpa was up, and with 
        information consisting of 'has a drop I need', we decided to attack. On 
        our first attempt, we had Escorpa down to under ten percent when it gated 
        on us. We quickly recovered and pummelled Escorpa on the second attempt 
        without losing a single person. Not bad for learning a mob on the fly, 
        and testifies to the good players within the guild. Drops were a Talisman 
        [Groovit] and a Book.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 17/18, 2002</strong><br>
        Played around with Grieg a couple times. Good learning experience for 
        us, and perhaps with a bit more weapons and armour we will try again in 
        the near future.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 16, 2002</strong><br>
        ToV, The Halls of Testing. Cleared the entire east side of the zone without 
        difficulty. Drops were: Chain Boots [Khallin], Plate Bracer [Gish], Ruby 
        Symbol [Klaminar], Poison Symbol [Kestel], Silk Arms [Zionmaster], Plate 
        Gaunts [Devaberiel], and Runed Symbol [Maxist]. We were resoundingly successful 
        killing Dozekar a second time as well.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 14, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Khandrahcir for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 11, 2002</strong><br>
        Dozekar perished to our hands for the first time this evening. Having 
        never fought him before, we devised a strategy and then attacked. In our 
        first attempt, we had him down to 70, but decided to camp out in an organized 
        fashion and reattempt with a different strategy and groups. The second 
        attempt was significantly smoother and we were able to kill him with only 
        a stray death. Drops were a Poison Tear [Klaminar] and White Tear [Machedor].</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 10, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to the halls of testing and cleared the east wing several times 
        for armour drops and symbols.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 09, 2002</strong><br>
        More cleric epics. This time for Ceeni and Bormer. Now that the Ragefire 
        camp-a-thon has been removed guilds that can't be on 24x7 have been taking 
        advantage of this welcome change. Nice to see all the different guilds 
        finishing off shards and working with one another to line up spawn order.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 07, 2002</strong><br>
        Finished off Ixibalt so more clerics are ready for Ragefire. A lot of 
        shard camping the last couple nights.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 04, 2002</strong><br>
        Unbelievable day. With the changes to Ragefire spawn, we decided as a 
        guild to concentrate our efforts and finish off some of our cleric epics. 
        Over 45 members formed an army and laid waste to hundreds of wurms, drakes, 
        and other dragon-ilk. Our clerics collected the the precious shards as 
        we worked out spawn arrangement order with other guilds in the zone. The 
        effort was well worth it:<br>
        Grats to Skylynn for obtaining the cleric epic!<br>
        Grats to Awll for obtaining the cleric epic!</p>
      <p>Amongst the loots were a Treasure Hunter's Satchel [Altus], Red Dragon 
        Scale [Tresten], and several other items.</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 03, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Riverwake for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 02, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Sylvanna for finishing our first Shadow Knight epic!</p>
      <p><strong>SEP 01, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Gilthanus for reaching 60!<br>
        Grats to Kandrahcir for finishing his epic!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 29, 2002</strong><br>
        The Dain needed help with an accessory and Kestel decided to help. Excellent 
        turn-out once again by the Crimson Talon forces to help Kestel beat back 
        the horde of giants and protect a clueless dwarf. Grats to Kestel for 
        completing the Eigth Shawl. Grats to Kestel!</p>
      <p>Brewall achieves the original inspiration of his name and is now a grandmaster 
        brewer - 250 (the other inspiration was brewing 4 batches of beer/ale 
        in RL and receiving EQ from his brother as a b-day present the same day, 
        but that is a much longer story...)</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 28, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Kenatal for finishing the necro epic! QUACK QUACK!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Second day in the Plain of Air. Obtained numerous warrior blades and the 
        necessary paladin and necro items. Overall, a successful raid. We were 
        tempted to press higher, but with no mages needing the seventh isle, we 
        decided to return back to the mortal world.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 24, 2002</strong><br>
        The long-awaited return to the plain of air. Excellent turn-out from the 
        guild in support of those that need epics. Definitely a guild where everyone 
        puts aside personal gain to help others. Pulvarized mobs up to the third 
        isle in record time. Goal is to obtain some warrior, paladin, and necro 
        items.</p>
      <p>Alone missed the port to Luclin and decided to meet out some vengance 
        upon the gatekeeper. The body was later mistaken by the coroner as a porcupine 
        from all the arrows in it. Details here.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 23, 2002</strong><br>
        Trakanon's lease on Seblis expired and we went into his lair to evict 
        him. Instead of throwing him out, we decided just to slay the foul beast. 
        Drops were: Donal's BP [Bormer], Cloak [Kilwean], and 4 Teeth [Physst, 
        Silvercaster, Proetus, and Ceeni].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 22, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Gilthanus for finishing the ranger epic for Earthcaller!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 21, 2002</strong><br>
        This night's raid was Hate in order to get a ranger stone. We quickly 
        cleared our way through the first level and proceeded to work on the second. 
        Drops on the second floor were very light (as always - that zone really 
        needs a better drop rate). After dozens and dozens of kills, we managed 
        to get a Darkmetal Falchion. Innoruuk seemed to be aware of our presence 
        and just before we pulled him, he ran out of the building to another spot! 
        We rescouted and then fought an epic battle with the god. Overall great 
        fight and only one death. Drops were: Eye [holding], Icebelt [Denor], 
        Pauldrons [Karrzem-guest], Triumphant Mask [Machedor], Ring of Pure Blood 
        [Awll], and a Shattered Emerald [Gilthanus].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 20, 2002</strong><br>
        Started the night in ToV, but another guild was already present. We did 
        the right hallway for a bit, until we decided to try Vindicator. We ported 
        other quickly and barely paused from our sprint to the arena to kill the 
        giants in our way. Then, a flawless pull and a well executed fight later, 
        we divided up Vindi's loot: Living Thunder Earring [Signarius] and Head 
        [Dunskye].</p>
      <p>Our posse then moved on to Fear to kill all the minis in the hope of 
        getting a SK epic piece. The mobs seemed to drop everything else except 
        what we were looking for including: Shield, Claws, Puppet Strings, and 
        a Trunk.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 19, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to ToV and the Halls of Testing for the night. Drops were very 
        light even though we cleared it multiple times: Plate Arms [Machedor], 
        Silk Arms [Talonclaw], Chain Legs [Zoranna], 2 Plate Bracer [Aorthin, 
        Maxist], 2 Chain Arms [Denor, Maemura], Leather Arms [Polyneices], and 
        Chain Bracer [Wildfern]. </p>
      <p><strong>AUG 18, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Denor for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 17, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Goratrix for completing the wizard epic!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 15, 2002</strong><br>
        Trakanon is dead again, another flawless killing. Drops were Bard BP, 
        SK BP, Hardened Clay Bracelet [Kestel], Peacebringer [Barelil], and 4 
        teeth [Tippe, Altus, Skylynn, and Ippit].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 14, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Talendor to start the evening. He actually died so fast, most of 
        the tanks hadn't even gotten the chance to get one hit in. Drops were 
        excellent: Torbins Eyepatch [Dunskye], Cloak of Flames [Tico], Runed Bolster 
        Belt [Maxist - handdown from Tico], Runebranded Girdle [Lisner - handdown 
        from Maxist], Shield of the Red Dragon [undecided], Orb of Tishan [undecided].</p>
      <p>From there, we went up to the moon and killed the Servitor of Luclin. 
        Drops were: Wand of Musing [Silvercaster] and Sombrous Claidmore [Uggabuga].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 13, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Vindicator. Drops were Boots [Khandrahcir] and Head [Polyneices].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 12, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Sylvanna for reaching 60! Our newest Grave Lord.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 10 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Kenatal for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 09, 2002</strong><br>
        Open experience night. Brewall used the time to do a detailed map of Jaggedpine 
        Forest. All but the darkpaw cave and neriad caves are done. Will be posting 
        to guild board early next week.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 08, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Trakanon again this evening. The raid was flawless, and even though 
        we had minimal manaburn crew, we still killed him with ease. Drops were: 
        Beastlord BP [randomed for sale], Rogue BP, Spells, and 5 teeth [Kuriosity, 
        Windarii, Azenyth, Dodja, and Maxist].</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 07, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Zoranna for reaching 60!</p>
      <p>Raid on the Hole for some epic items.</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 04, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Kilwean for reaching 60!</p>
      <p>Raided Chardok this evening to kill the royalty. We easily slayed the 
        prince, king, and queen. Congrats to Machedor for finishing the warrior 
        epic!</p>
      <p><strong>AUG 03, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Dunskye for reaching 60!</p>
      <p>Found Venril up and cobbled together a minimal crew with what we had 
        on to kill him. Grats to Goratrix for getting wizard staff, just a broken 
        golem away from epic.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 31, 2002</strong><br>
        Another clearing or two of the Halls of Testing. Loots: 2 Plate Legs [Kilwean, 
        Brewall], Plate Helm [Lilsong], Plate Bracer [Machedor], Leather Gloves 
        [Windarii], Plate Boots [Tarrask], Poison Symbol [Zypheal], and a Silk 
        Wrist.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 30, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to ToV and the Halls of Testing. A very odd night, very few armour 
        drops, but we killed an enormous number of named mobs. Loots were: Silk 
        Legs [Immolar], Flame Kissed Symbol [Lisner], White Symbol [Machedor], 
        Serrated Symbol [Maxist], Black Symbol [Polyneices], Chain Tunic [Yakkai], 
        Leather Legs [Proeteus], Runed Symbol [Altus], Silk Arms[Jheball], and 
        Emerald Symbol [Gilthanus].</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 29, 2002</strong><br>
        Trakanon perished again to the forces of the Crimson Talon. Flawless killing 
        with only 1 death due to the shroom port. Drops were: Wildlord Tunic [Kuriosity], 
        SK BP [banked], Undead Dragon Sinew [Proetus], 4 Teeth [Polynecies, Chadmoe, 
        Khandrahcir, and Zoranna]. </p>
      <p><strong>JUL 27, 2002</strong><br>
        Sev was roaming around in Emerald Jungle and we decided to quickly take 
        him down. Killed him again so that another one of our warriors could get 
        a coveted green scale. Loots were: Green Dragon Scale [Machedor], Shield 
        of the Green Dragon [Azenyth], Mask of the Hunter [Dunskye], and Spirit 
        of Oak [Windarii].</p>
      <p>GM event in the Swamp of No Hope in the tunnel to Trakanon's Teeth. A 
        dragon was in the caves where the frogloks used to be and was red to level 
        60's. Although we were able to assemble 3+ full groups with 3 MB wizards, 
        we didn't have any clerics on. Simply bad timing as several got on later 
        that night. Another guild played around with the mob for a few hours before 
        finally killing him; loot was a ranger belt.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to cut down his minions and 
        slay the undead dragon himself. We decided to fight Trak on the bridge 
        and even though he ported on us at 0.001 percent health, we still killed 
        him losing only 1 person (from the shroom port). Excellent fighting and 
        heads-up thinking by everyone dealing with Trak's escape. Drops were 5 
        teeth [Minmin, Immolar, Barelil, Chantress, and Kestel], Cleric BP [Skylynn], 
        and a Cloak of Piety [Khandrahcir]. Grats to all.</p>

        Grats to Kestel for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 23, 2002</strong><br>
        Big raid on Akheva Ruins. Crawled the entire zone from end-to-end. Another 
        exciting evening as we tackled lots of new mobs and brand-new encounters.</p>
      <p>Grats to Maemura for completing the ranger epic for Swiftwind!</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 22, 2002</strong><br>
        Guild raid to crawl Grieg's end. Went from Dawnshroud to Scarlet and a 
        few detours along the way. The guild map of the zone is definitely getting 
        better, but if anyone sees missing information, please tell Brewall.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 21, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Lumper for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 18, 2002</strong><br>
        Another big raid on Siren's Grotto. This time to explore the temple area. 
        Definitely fun to see new areas and enrich our gem coffers.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 16, 2002</strong><br>
        Took a long tour tonight of Siren's Grotto. We crawled around the zone 
        making quite a few loops. Was a lot of new content for many of us and 
        few of us had seen all the sights. Gem drops were excellent and we replenished 
        our guild gem bank quite well.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 09, 2002</strong><br>
        ToV again. Plate BP [Khandrahcir], Plate Gauntlets [Maxist], Plate Boots 
        [Saulk], Chain Arms [Gilthanus], Plate Bracer [Gish], Silk Bracer [Imotep], 
        Plate Boots [Skylynn], and Plate Helm [Lumper].</p>

        Miscellaneous epic questing and experience questing for a few days while 
        people are off for the holiday weekend.</p>
      <p><strong>JUL 01, 2002</strong><br>
        We were killing some guardian wurms in skyfire this evening, when Talendor 
        decided to make an appearance. Having slain this beast several times, 
        we resolved to repeat his demise. Grats to Khandrahcir for burnt book!</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 30, 2002</strong><br>
        Large guild raid on Cazic-Thule this evening.</p>
      <p>Congrats to Physst for reaching 60!<br>

        Returned to ToV for some more armour.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Large raid on Dragon Necropolis. Toured the zone and collected some gems.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 21, 2002</strong><br>
        Quick trip into Fear this evening to get the Wraith of Shissar that Chantress 
        has been camping for weeks now. Grats to Chantress for getting our second 
        enchanter epic in just days! While we were there, Yain showed up and needed 
        the broken golem. Since we were there, we killed broken golem for him.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 19, 2002</strong><br>
        Finished Kestel's enchanter epic this evening with a quick trip to kill 
        the Tangrin and final turn-in's. Grats to Kestel for getting his epic!</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 18, 2002</strong><br>
        We needed a few epic items from Hate and decided to raid it this evening. 
        On the first floor, we managed to get Kestel's vampire essence, 2 Eyes 
        of Innoruuk [Imotep &amp; Kenatal] and Alone's Ranger stone. After laying 
        waste to the first floor, we decided that we wanted our first Inny kill. 
        We ventured out to the second floor and cleared the way to the god of 
        hate. One excellently executed fight later, Inny lay dead at our feet. 
        Grats to Immolar for the Pauldron's of Power!</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 13, 2002</strong><br>
        ToV again this evening. Drops: Leather BP [Aerayn], Plate Bracer, Leather 
        Gloves, Plate Legs [Lilsong], Leather Boots [Physst], Silk Turban [Immolar], 
        Plate Boots [Sylvanna], Runed Symbol [Altus], Leather Boots [Ippit], Leather 
        Boots, Leather Legs [Altus], Chain Gloves [Barelil, no, Denor, no, Dreamthief, 
        no, Dodja, ok, Klaminar], and Chain Legs [Dodja]. </p>
      <p><strong>JUN 12, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to Halls of Testing. Drops: Silk Boots [Mmatil], Plate Legs [Zypheal, 
        Awll, Lisner], Silk Bracer [Mmatil], Silk Arms [Jarheuu, Groovit], and 
        Leather Arms [Aerayn].</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 11, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Kilwean for obtaining the bard epic singing short sword!</p>
      <p>We also decided to try the Grimling High Priest in Acrylia. We brought 
        two groups (spoiler sites suggested three), and we were complete overkill. 
        Mobs barely lasted 5 seconds as we killed the would-be repelers. After 
        over an hour of killing them, watching the blood dry, and playing gems, 
        the Grimling High Priest finally took matters into his own hands. Only 
        problem was that once we had him down to 10 percent, he poofed. Not gated. 
        Poofed. At least we got a few bone chips. Still, Brewall is making a few 
        adjustments to his map from the explorations.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 10, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Denor for finishing the Shaman epic! At the same time as the 
        CoM raid, we broke into Fear and proceeded to clear the zone. Lot of BP 
        drops, too bad no one needed them.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 08, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Dreamthief for reaching 60!</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 07, 2002</strong><br>
        Cleared out Fear this evening for some epic loots: Broken Golem [Minmin], 
        Amy whip [Kilwean], and Shissar [Kestel]. After that, we went to Kael 
        arena to slay giants once again and came away with chain legs, plate legs, 
        and a plate bp.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 06, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed both Severilous and Talendor today. Sev was stingy and dropped 
        a dragon bone bracer [Chadmoe], Pouch [Greymask], and 6 spells - no green 
        scale though. We followed that up with Talendor, but no books. Loots from 
        these raids, even with our mana burning crew, is always given to guildmates 
        - and are never sold. These two kills on top of a big dungeon crawl of 
        Grieg's End. If you have never done a crawl of a dungeon before, you are 
        really missing out. We've gotten much faster as a guild on quick assembly 
        and rapid fire take out of the Kunark dragons. We have killed all 4 within 
        the past 3 days - and yes, we are killing them because we want the items, 
        not to sell them.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 05, 2002</strong><br>
        We decided to raid the Hole to get a slew of needed epic items. We quickly 
        fought our way down to Nortlav and dispatched the rusty weilding fighter. 
        Grats to Kilwean for the Red Dragon Scale. Also killed many other epic 
        mobs on the way back up for everyone else who needed something.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 04, 2002</strong><br>
        As a guild, we have been working hard and refining our tactics. Looking 
        back on the last few months, we have steadily moved up the ladder of difficulty, 
        and tonight was no exception. Coming off last nights two dragon raids, 
        we wanted more. First, we decided to make our first attempt on Vindicator, 
        and we were wildly successful. Loots were: Head [Tomwin], and Boots of 
        the Vindicator [Awll].</p>
      <p>After we plowed Vindicator into dust, we decided to make our first attempt 
        on Velketor. With no one with any prior experience with the fight, we 
        still managed to kill him. Two big mobs in one night - again. Loots were: 
        Shield of Freezing Wind [Chadmoe], Vermillion of Refraction [Mmatil], 
        Crystal Crown of Confusion [Jarheuu], and 5 spells.</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 03, 2002</strong><br>
        The dragon hunting force was in full swing last night. We started in Dreadlands 
        with Gorenaire, and dispatched the dragon with much fanfaire. Drops were 
        nice for epics: WDS [Kilwean] and 2 Frost Books [Hawkien, Khandrahcir]. 
        After Gore, we decided to do Juggs for more spells, only to discover that 
        Trakanon himself was up. We then decided to dispatch him as well and killed 
        him in record time. Drops were: Jaundice BP [Khallin], Deepwater BP [Chadmoe] 
        and 2 Teeth [Brewall, Mmatil]. Along the way, we also managed to get 2 
        Dragon Sinews [Greymask, Kestel]. After Trak, we then rolled on some extra 
        Kael armour to MQ: Plate legs [Tico], Plate arms [Kilwean], and Plate 
        gaunt [Zypheal]. Excellent raiding by everyone with very minimal deaths 
        (ZERO deaths on Gore and just 2 on Trak).</p>
      <p><strong>JUN 02, 2002</strong><br>
        Small plate raid run in Kael this evening, and the drops were very good 
        for a change: 2 bracers: [Devaberiel, Lilsong], 2 legs: [Awll], 2 gaunts, 
        2 boots [Sylvanna, Khandrahcir], arms [Hawkien], and a Rune Etched Icewurm 
        Fang: [Windarii].<br>

        <strong>MAY 30, 2002</strong><br>
        While it may seem quiet on the newsfront, the guild has actually been 
        very busy of late with some major raiding in many new zones.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Brewall for reaching 60! A new virtuoso!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 24, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Immolar for reaching 60! A new archmage!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 22, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Hate this evening to go after some of the mini bosses for epic 
        items and some other epic mobs as well.&nbsp; Grats to Czad on a rogue 
        bp.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 20, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Greigs End this evening.&nbsp; Killed nearly all the named mobs 
        with the exception of Greig himself.&nbsp; Among the victims were: Occisor 
        Pimorus, Prast Ianitor, and Praetorian Myral.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 19, 2002</strong><br>
        Working on a a few monk and rogue epics this evening. Actually starting 
        to run low on epics to complete.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 17, 2002</strong><br>
        Another large raid on Cazic-Thule. Penetrated deep within the zone and 
        managed to come away with a couple interesting items.&nbsp; Everyone is 
        enjoying playing in a new place.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 15, 2002</strong><br>
        Large scale raid on Cazic-Thule this evening. Laid waste to the zone.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 14, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid in Iceclad to finish Greymask's eigth shawl.&nbsp; With 30+ players 
        there showing support (and not wanting anyone to lose the seventh shawl), 
        the wandering dwarf was scarcely touched.&nbsp; Other loots dropped as 
        well from the attacking mobs, including a helmet and a caster primary 
        hand item.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 12, 2002</strong><br>
        Crimson Talon returned to Grieg's and slayed Praetorian Myral.&nbsp; Nothing 
        like killing a 300k HP mob that wields a weapon that procs divine aura.&nbsp; 
        A very long fight to kill him, but he went down neverless.&nbsp; Dropped 
        a very nice 1hs weapon.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 10, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Grieg's End this evening.&nbsp; Fought our way in and managed 
        to obtain the key to rest of the zone.&nbsp; Very interesting zone with 
        mob traps and shifting appearances. &nbsp; Zone would get a lot more use 
        from players if it was itemized better.&nbsp; Still, it is a fun change 
        of pace.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 07, 2002</strong><br>
        Devaberiel did final hand-ins for bard epic this evening - grats on the 
        new Singing Short Sword!<br>
        <br>
        Grats to Barelil for reaching 60! <br>

        <span class="s2cA"><strong>MAY 06, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed spawned Trakanon for Devaberiel to finish his bard epic.&nbsp; 
        After clearing the lair, we spawned Trakanon and killed him within 20 
        seconds. Fight was over so fast one of our manaburn wizards didn't even 
        have time to get off her nuke. Grats to Dreamthief for rogue BP.&nbsp; 
        This will be quiet week as many of us are working on exp prior to another 
        big raiding week.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAY 01, 2002</strong><br>
        Grats to Wyntyr for finishing the wizard epic quest this evening.&nbsp; 
        Phinny was very stubborn for her and he finally decided to reward her 
        for her efforts. In looking over our guild news from the past month, it 
        is easy to see we've been rampaging on epics of late. &nbsp; With 10 in 
        just the last 30 days, including some of the toughest in the game (magician, 
        warrior).&nbsp; For a guild of our size, this is an epic achievement of 
        its own, and demonstrates how well we all work together. There aren't 
        many epics left to get, and if could just catch Ragefire...<br>
        <br>
        Also this evening, the Halls of Testing: Chain Bracer [Dreamthief], Plate 
        Boots [Gish], Silk Boots [Groovit, Silvercaster], Plate Gauntlets [Stien], 
        Silk Wrist [Jarheuu], and Chain Gauntlets [Shcammer].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 30, 2002</strong><br>
        ToV again. Killed twice as many mobs as the night before, but far fewer 
        loots: Silk Bracer [Zionmaster], Chain Helm [Barelil], Plate Bracer [Chadmoe], 
        Leather Legs [Physst], Plate Helm [Maxist], and Plate Arms [Ceeni].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 29, 2002</strong><br>
        Big raid on The Halls of Testing this evening and we came away with quite 
        a bit of loot: Leather legs [Ikana], 3 Plate Legs [Machedor, Aorthin, 
        Khandrahcir], 2 Plate Bracers [Awll, Uggabuga], Chain Tunic [Alone], and 
        2 Silk Turbans [Mmatil, Silvercaster].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 28, 2002</strong><br>

        the monk epic! &nbsp; Also raided Siren's Grotto for some gems.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 27, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Kael.&nbsp; Quite a few drops: Plate Arms [Grumpie], Plate Bracer 
        [Khandrahcir, Stien], Silk Sleeves [Greymask], Plate Boots [Tarrask], 
        and a few quest items.&nbsp; Killed Phinny later that night and dropped 
        nothing of value, just 1 item short of another wizard epic - and we are 
        waiting.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 26, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Ssra Temple this evening.&nbsp; Easily cleaned out first floor 
        with little difficulty. Came away with some nice spells and next time 
        will progress much deeper into this dungeon.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Stevenfost completed Shield of Bane quest. The first time he tried to 
        do the quest, the mob ran off at end of the fight and died in a rock.&nbsp; 
        When he tried to get help from customer support, they didn't do anything 
        to help him, even when he offered to just roll back his character.&nbsp; 
        Hats off to Tilol though, he checked the logs and saw that Stevenfost 
        did get to this point in the quest and restored his items.&nbsp; Steven 
        did last fight this evening and kept the mob snared and far away from 
        rocks.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 24, 2002</strong><br>
        Hawkien completed 8th ring quest this evening.&nbsp; Ippit also attained 
        his Robe of the Whistling Fist and then finished the monk epic!<br>

        wizard epic.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 16, 2002</strong><br>
        Finished up on the Plane of Sky this evening by decimating bee island 
        and then moving up to the seventh, sphynx island.&nbsp; There, we killed 
        drakes until we had our sought after item - the crown of elemental mastery.&nbsp; 
        Congrats to Immolar for finishing the magician epic!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 12-14, 2002</strong><br>
        Climbing the islands in the Plane of Sky the last few nights and have 
        been clearing each one repeatedly in order to get some quest drops before 
        moving on to the next one.&nbsp; By Sunday, we made it to the Spiroc Lord 
        and defeathered the bird several times to get items for our warriors.&nbsp; 
        Valstorm obtained the last item he needed to complete the warrior epic, 
        and at the end of the evening, dropped down and did the turn-in.&nbsp; 
        Grats to Valstorm!&nbsp; Soon, we will move up and work towards finishing 
        off a magician epic.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 09, 2002</strong><br>

        Dragonfish died again today. Congrats to Morc on druid epic!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 04, 2002</strong><br>
        Hate raid today to get some resist gear gems and take down as many epic 
        mobs as possible. Non-stop killing, and very quick pace. Most of the first 
        floor was cleared within an hour, and by the second hour, pickings were 
        rather slim.&nbsp; Still, managed to come away with a nice number of gems 
        and a few epic pieces.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 03, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Chardok royals. Killed prince, king, and queen with very few losses. 
        Grats to Lumper for warrior epic item. We are very close to our first 
        warrior epic.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 02, 2002</strong><br>
        This was our last night of ToV for a few weeks. Planning on some other 
        activities and trying to finish up some epic quests.&nbsp; Drops were 
        very kind tonight: Plate BP [Maxist], Plate Legs [Lumper], 2 Plate Gauntlets 
        [Khandrahcir, Ceeni], 2 Plate Helms [Valstorm, Brewall], Leather Cap [Tomwin], 
        Leather Boots [Tomwin], and a Black Symbol [Altus].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>APR 01, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to ToV. Drops were a bit light tonight: Plate legs [Sylvanna], 
        Chain Legs, Plate Boots [Aorthin], and a Ruby Symbol [Skylynn].<br>
        </span><br>
        <span class="s2cA"><strong>MAR 31, 2002</strong><br>
        Instead of ToV this evening, we went to Dragon Necropolis and decided 
        to do a crawl of the zone. About midway through the raid, we realized 
        that Zlandicar was up and sent a tell to Unseen Hand if they would be 
        interested in teaming up to take him down. Everyone moved into position 
        and we took down Zlandicar with only a few deaths from the DoT.&nbsp; 
        Drops were: Cowl of Mortality [Valstorm], 2 Talisman of Zlandicar [Unseen 
        Hand], Heart of Zlandicar [Mmatil], and 4 spells (2 Focus, Protection 
        of the Glade, Call of the Preditor). &nbsp; Valstorm passed down his RBG 
        [Maxist], and Maxist's FBSS went into the guild bank.<br>

        <strong>MAR 29, 2002</strong><br>
        Lot of people were out and about tonight. Switched night from raid to 
        just open experience and faction.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 28, 2002</strong><br>
        Definitely getting better at ToV.&nbsp; Cleared the halls of testing repeatedly 
        and came away with more items than last two nights combined. Drops were: 
        Plate BP [Kilwean], Plate Helm [Aorthin], Chain Boots [Alone], Plate Legs 
        [Hawkien], Chain Sleeves [Dodja], Silk Robe [Kestel], Silk Pants [Xamren], 
        Chain Tunic [Denor], 2 Silk Bracer [Silvercaster, Fenik], 2 Plate Gauntlets 
        [Skylynn, Sylvanna], and Plate Arms [Xamia]. Made our way to exit and 
        zoned back out. Grats to all the winners!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 27, 2002</strong><br>
        Another night in ToV's Hall of Testing.&nbsp; Many dragons fell this evening 
        and we were amply rewarded with loots: Plate Boots [Maxist, Lisner], Plate 
        Bracer [Sylvanna], Chain Helm [Khallin], Plate Breastplate [Awll], Silk 
        Sleeves [Silvercaster], and Silk Boots [Kestel].&nbsp; At the end, we 
        medded up and then began walk towards zone exit, only to have 4 mobs appear 
        on us at once (nothing like bad agros through walls and bad pathing...).&nbsp; 
        We had planned well though, and nearly all the groups were able to evac, 
        a few corpses had to be summoned, but overall, great preparedness. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 26, 2002</strong><br>
        Came back to ToV with a vengance. This time, we cleared large portions 
        of the East Hall. Lots of loots this evening! Plate Boots [Valstorm, Kilwean], 
        Plate Helm [Lisner], Leather Boots [Chiun], Plate Gloves [Nato], Glowing 
        Drake Orb [Shcammer], and a few other drops. &nbsp; Made our way to the 
        exit and zoned back to the start.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 25, 2002</strong><br>
        Crimson Talon's first raid on ToV! We did portions of the East Hall. Still 
        getting our feet wet, but still managed to get a chain arms, chain legs, 
        and 2 plate boots [Valstorm &amp; Kilwean].<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 23, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Dragon Necropolis. Camped near entrance and managed to get some 
        minor loot.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 22, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Siren's Grotto. Went to bottom of the well and came away with 
        numerous velious breastplate quest gems.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 21, 2002</strong><br>
        Severilous was up again tonight, and Lumper was waiting for him.&nbsp; 
        He quickly put out the word in guildchat and we came scrambling from Siren's 
        Grotto to help our warrior out. &nbsp; We quickly dispatched Severilous 
        for the second time this week.&nbsp; Drops were: Green Dragon Scale [Lumper], 
        Selos Drums of the March [Devaberiel], Rune Bolster Belt [Machedor], Dragon 
        Bone Bracer [Dreamthief], and 4 nice spells.&nbsp; Machedor passed down 
        his sash of the dragonborn, and a fbss was passed down after that.&nbsp; 
        Grats to everyone and thanks to the guests that tagged along with us.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 18-20, 2002</strong><br>
        Coming off a few days in Kael Drakkal to work on faction. Camped different 
        area of the zone each night and came away with some nice armour drops. 
        Lots of plate drops last night and had enough items go get something to 
        almost every plate user and some extras. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 17, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on Chardok.&nbsp; Went after the royals and killed the prince and 
        king with ease. Some other nice items dropped in the library off some 
        named spawns.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 16, 2002</strong><br>
        Severilous was up this morning and we were lucky enough to see him. We 
        hastily assembled a few groups and killed this wurm. Much easier to kill 
        than some of the other dragons, just unfortunate he is insta-killed on 
        every spawn. Drops were: Green Dragon Scale [Valstorm], McVaxious Horn 
        of War [Devaberiel], weight bag [Barelil], and 5 spells (2 spirit of raptor, 
        spirit of oak, word of redemption, visions of granduer).&nbsp; As a guild, 
        we can now say that we have killed all the Kunark dragons.<br>

        With Frost book and Burnt book in hand, Chadmoe finished off the rest 
        of the paladin epic quest this evening and is now the proud holder of 
        a Fiery Defender!&nbsp; Grats to Chadmoe for obtaining his epic!<br>

        Big raid on Seblis for spells this evening and we came away with quite 
        a haul; including some rare spells.&nbsp; Thanks to all that came to help 
        our casters flush out the spell books a bit more.<br>
        <br>
        Congratulations to Dreamthief for finishing the rogue epic last night! 
        Our epic rampage continues! <br>
        <br>
        <strong>MAR 10, 2002</strong><br>
        The royals of Chardok were trash-talking once again, and we decided to 
        end their reign. &nbsp; In quick order, we dispatched, the prince, king, 
        and even the queen.&nbsp; Great job by everyone and congrats to all the 
        people who got epic items.<br>
        <br>

        Lot of news and epics this week!<br>
        <br>
        Grats to Khallin for making 60!<br>
        <br>
        Trip to Hate resulted in mage staff for Immolar and Klaminar finishing 
        the second ranger epic Earthcaller!<br>
        <br>
        Trip to Fear to kill the broken golem resulted in Silvercaster finishing 
        her wizard epic!<br>
        <br>
        Trip to Hole, for 2 enchanter epic items, 1 paladin item, and Tenara finishing 
        her first ranger epic, Swiftwind!&nbsp; This after, a quick trip to CoM 
        and luckily getting a jade reaver to finally drop.<br>
        <br>
        Killed General in Kithicor to get Dreamthief to within one item of rogue 
        epic, just need to get an SMR now.<br>
        <br>
        Slayed the dragonfish again, resulting in Azenyth getting a druid epic!<br>
        <br>
        Biggest news of all, was Crimson Talon leading a raid on Gorenaire herself 
        with just 33 people (some close friends helped us a lot) and completely 
        owned her with just 2 deaths. &nbsp; This, with limited cleric and bard 
        support. Solid tactics and smart playing - the Crimson Talon way. &nbsp; 
        Drops were: Frost Book [Chadmoe] and White Dragon Scale [Devaberiel]. 
        Chadmoe is now in homestretch for paladin epic!<br>

        Grats to Klaminar for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind! Crimson Talon's 
        8th epic this year!<br>
        <br>
        Talendor was happily surveying his territory of wurm-infested lava calderas 
        of Skyfire, when Crimson Talon decided to do some landscaping.&nbsp; We 
        sent Devaberiel out to pull the beast to our trap, and slayed him losing 
        only a couple people to the DoT not being dispelled in time.&nbsp; Brewall 
        was a little dissapointed anyone died, but there is no greater glory than 
        being slain by a dragon. Drops were Burnt Book [Chadmoe], Gauntlets of 
        Firey Might [Ippit], and about six spells.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FEB 22, 2002 </strong><br>
        Congrats to Gilthanus for obtaining his first epic, Swiftwind!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FEB 21, 2002</strong><br>
        Spawned Faydedar this evening and cut him into some nice dragonfish steaks 
        so Yazz could finish his epic. Venril Sathir was up as well, so we killed 
        him to get Wiz epic staff, shaman legs, and a cleric weapon.&nbsp; From 
        there, we moved on to kill mob for enchanter epic.&nbsp; Overall, a very 
        good epic night.&nbsp; Congrats to Yazz for obtaining the Nature Walkers 
        Scimitar!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FEB 19, 2002</strong><br>
        Another guild was clearing fear tonight, so we had another open experience 
        night. Killed Uulump for Yazz and now within Faydedar of epic.<br>

        The real Trakanon was up this evening and we decided to take him down.&nbsp; 
        Excellent job fighting down to the lair and great job on the battle.&nbsp; 
        Trak collapsed into a pile of rotting flesh with minimal losses to our 
        small force of 33.&nbsp; Drops were 2 SK Breastplates, 4 teeth [Groovit, 
        Greymask, Shcammer, and Khallin], and some very nice spell drops.&nbsp; 
        Although it took a while to kill him, we made off with some incredible 
        spells and the glory of beating this foul wurm.<br>

        Raid on Dragon Necropolis this afternoon. Several nice gem drops and some 
        other nice loots: Spirit Talkers Headdress [Denor], 4 Pabella Fetish, 
        and several batskull earrings. <br>

        Crimson Talon was just starting to assemble for guardian wurm killing 
        in Skyfire Mountains when we quickly realized that something was amiss. 
        &quot;Who will challenge me?&quot; boomed an NPC wurm named Scales. &quot;Who 
        is brave enough to fight me?&quot;.&nbsp; We opted to take on the dragon 
        runt and make him pay the price of his empty boasting.&nbsp; A few seconds 
        into the fight, however, something was really, really wrong.&nbsp; People 
        were vanishing virtually every second and appearing in random, mob-infested 
        areas of - drumroll please - The Deep.&nbsp; After a few GM rezzes and 
        some teleportations, we were back in Skyfire, attacked again (sans buggy 
        summoning), and&nbsp; dispatched this wurm. &nbsp; Drops were molten cloak, 
        diamondine earrings, and 2 non-magical swords.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FEB 10, 2002</strong><br>
        Returned to the plane of air to finish off Fenik's necro epic. Grats to 
        Fenik for obtaining the Scythe of the Shadowed Soul! Later that evening 
        we went to the Hole and killed Master Yael in addition to getting some 
        epic mobs along the way. <br>

        Got necro epic drop this evening and moved a couple alts to the zone so 
        we can resume at a higher island more quickly the next time we try this 
        zone.&nbsp; Also helped some non-guild people get some epic items before 
        we fell down.&nbsp; Fenik now has a few turn-ins to do and a revisit to 
        3rd island and we should have our first necro epic!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FEB 03, 2002</strong><br>
        On Friday, we decided to hit the plane of air.&nbsp; By Sunday, we had 
        made our way up to the sixth island and killed necro mob epic, but he 
        failed to drop the item.&nbsp; We logged for the night and will try him 
        again on Monday. Some of the drops today included: Sphere of Swirling 
        Color (rng epic) [Klaminar, Riverwake, Ronthen, Gilthanus, Maemura], Belt 
        of Pine (rng haste belt) [Riverwake], Belt of Contention (war haste belt) 
        [All warriors on trip], Belt of Concordance (brd haste belt) [Devaberiel], 
        Weight of the Gods (clr shoulder item [Skylynn + 2more). <br>

        Emergency patch provided ample opportunities for slaying this evening: 
        Phinny (junk loots), Venril Sathir (paly legs, bard legs, wizard epic 
        staff [Silvercaster]), Ixiblat, and then the Tangrin [Mysyn].&nbsp; Went 
        to kill Uulump, but he wasn't up, so instead moved on to kill reavers 
        in CoM for a while, but no jade reavers dropped. Great job mobilizing 
        and getting several epic components in one night!&nbsp; Now have 3 clerics 
        waiting on Ragefire...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 29, 2002</strong><br>
        Killed Ixiblat this evening to get Ointmennt to within 1 item of cleric 
        epic. With two clerics now waiting on Ragefire, we are eager to get our 
        first click-sticks.&nbsp; After Ix, we cleared the remaining guardian 
        wurm in SF, and then moved on to OT to kill cliff golems. No good spell 
        drops, but the adventurers in OT were fairly safe while we buried goons 
        of the indigo brotherhood.<br>

        Small raid on the Hole. Drops were: Soulbound Hammer [Ronthen, Gilthanus] 
        and Imbued Granite Spaulders [Klaminar].<br>

        Killed spawned Trakanon again this evening.&nbsp; Managed to get a cobalt 
        breastplate this time [Swolore] and another set of guts [Kilwean].&nbsp; 
        Brewall did turn-in for bard epic, Singing Short Sword: 1HS 16/26 str15 
        dex10 sta5 cha20 hp100 resists10 with Dance of the Blade proc (55% haste 
        30str 30atk 150' radius). Perhaps the best feature of the sword is that 
        acts as though you are holding a store-bought instrument of every type 
        in your hand and even magnifies the strength of voice skill songs. This 
        item completely changes how a bard is played, song selection, and melee 
        capabilities.<br>

        </strong>The resident dragon of Seblis, Trakanon, met an untimely death 
        this evening to the forces of Crimson Talon.&nbsp; The night got off to 
        a good start with numerous spell drops and even a cobalt helm [Swolore]. 
        We finished off Jumpy who dropped wizard epic piece and a robe [Imotep].&nbsp; 
        After some buffing, Brewall spawned Trakanon and were able to kill him 
        with only a couple deaths.&nbsp; Flawless execution of the plan by the 
        well-seasoned dragon hunting crew led by Brewall's research and everyone's 
        desire to see this beast dead. Drops were Guts [Brewall's last item for 
        epic] and a Druid BP [Tomwin]. Thanks to everyone for coming and we will 
        certainly return to kill many more.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 14, 2002</strong><br>
        Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar of Velketor's Labrynth fell this evening to 
        the forces of Crimson Talon. Drops were: Frozen Turban (25ac 15agi 0.0wt 
        w/ resist cold) [Altus] and a Doljonijiarnimorinar (2hs 33/44 w/Doljons 
        Rage- 140 cold dd). <br>

        Acrylia Circle raid today, and it can be summarized in two words:&nbsp; 
        very cool. &nbsp; If you are not familiar with the ring, there is an empty 
        room in Acrylia with a ring of totems sticking out of the ground. Once 
        someone steps inside the ring, a few non-attackable grimlings appear that 
        regularly summon undead mobs to attack you.&nbsp; If you step out of ring, 
        it ends, and if you leave the room, you will get a ton of adds. After 
        about twenty minutes of constant attacks, a boss will spawn, and then 
        the next round begins, this time, even harder.&nbsp; This is absolute 
        non-stop fighting with changing mobs and tactics.&nbsp; We made it up 
        to the third boss and even though the loot wasn't great, we had a great 
        time trying something new and different.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 12, 2002</strong><br>
        Raid on the Juggernaughts of Seblis for spells.&nbsp; With so many of 
        our casters hitting 58 and 60 and staring at empty spell slots, we decided 
        to do something about it.&nbsp; We fought down and cleared the Juggs a 
        few times and managed to get about a dozen spells. Then, we decided to 
        try a spawned Trakanon.&nbsp; The attack went very smoothly and we had 
        Trak down to 10 percent, when, he started warping all over the place. 
        He was in his lair, down in the hallway, near the bridge, and then just 
        started cycling between all three and sometimes nowhere to be found.&nbsp; 
        A very fustrating fight. We never could get him nailed down to finish 
        him off.&nbsp; Later, we found out this was a bug when you: send someone 
        in to sacrifice, Trak ports them, Trak tries to follow (appears in hallway 
        near bridge where we attacked), and if anyone attacking him steps on the 
        rocks, he starts warping.&nbsp; We are adapting our pull/attack strategy 
        and should own him in the next fight. Brewall is writing up a strategy 
        guide and is looking for input in the guild-only area of forum.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 10, 2002</strong><br>
        Servers came back up after the emergency patch and we killed Phinny again 
        for chances at epic items. After Phin, we dispersed for an hour until 
        we decided to hit VS.&nbsp; We assembled in record setting time, derailed 
        a few trains, killed just about every mob we could get our hands on, and 
        then moved into staging room.&nbsp; Quickly cleared all nearby mobs, and 
        then took out VS without losing a single person.&nbsp; Great discipline 
        and smart fighting from everyone! Drops were a sshisar staff and a diamond 
        encrusted staff.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 09, 2002</strong><br>
        Large group of us took up residence in Chardok again this evening at the 
        Iksar Betrayer camp. We killed everything within a massive pull range 
        and descimated the Sarnak forces yielding quite a few minor upgrades.&nbsp; 
        Having spent 8 hours camping this monk epic mob the other day, we were 
        hoping our luck would change.&nbsp; After 18 place holders, and with just 
        two remaining groups by 11:30pm, we decided to do one more spawn and call 
        it a night -- and the Betrayer spawned!&nbsp; Grats to Chiun for finally 
        getting his pipe! &nbsp; He completed the robe quest last night and is 
        just a few mobs away from epic.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JAN 08, 2002</strong><br>
        Whacked Phinny when the servers came back up from the patch. He dropped 
        a piece of ore that Chadmoe needed for shoulder quest item and a crappy 
        shaman staff.&nbsp; We then decided to hit VS in the hopes of getting 
        another epic piece.&nbsp; There was a small force already there, so we 
        decided to pool together and let each guild roll for dropped items. Killed 
        VS without losing a single person and his drops were pretty poor: just 
        beastlord and bard legs. Tomwin won roll for us and chose the bard legs 
        [Brewall]. Other good developments this evening is Ointmennt got item 
        from Chardok King and is now just an Ixiblat and a Rage from a cleric 
        epic.<br>

        Phinny wasn't up this evening so we decided to finish off another epic, 
        this time for Skalee (Rezzie's monk). Very successful kills of epic mobs 
        in Lake of Ill Omen, and there were no deaths (aside from the token ranger).&nbsp; 
        We are all looking forward to finishing off a slew of epics in the coming 
        months. Off to a great start so far this year! <br>

        Raid on the Hole with minimal forces, and yet we were still able to defeat 
        Master Yael for the first time. We had a high body count, but with just 
        16 of us, 2 clerics and 1 insta-killed DT enc, we still managed to kill 
        him. Yael just didn't bite on our ranger sacrifice...&nbsp; Grats to Chadmoe 
        for getting another piece for epic quest! We learned a lot with this first 
        kill and will do much better next time.<br>

        Big spell raiding day today. With all our recent high-level caster dings, 
        we decided to try to get some high level spells. Started in Skyfire with 
        guardians and managed to get a few nice spells. Moved on to Juggs in Seblis 
        and got a few other level 60 spells. &nbsp; Easily made our way to Trak's 
        lair and waved at the Undead Bard. With a little more resist gear and 
        a full raiding force, we will be ready for a spawned Trakanon. Brewall 
        can hardly wait!<br>

        Decided to kill General V'Ghera in Kithicor this evening to try to finish 
        Muscled's epic. We successfully killed the general for our second time, 
        but we were unlucky on drops. Muscled needs to do a little side quest 
        to finish off his ragebringer. Hopefully see another epic soon now that 
        the hard part is out of the way. <br>
        <br>

        Congrats to Mysyn for making 60!<br>

        </strong>Raid on City of Mist to finish off Marick's epic.&nbsp;Pets made 
        mincemeat of Lord Rak'Ashiir, and after slaying many Black Reavers, we 
        managed to obtain a Jade Reaver [Yazz] and an Atramentous Shield. Grats 
        to Marick for our first epic of 2002!<br>
