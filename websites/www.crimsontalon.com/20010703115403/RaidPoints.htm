            <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">Everyone on
            a Crimson Talon Vox/Nag raid has a chance at winning loot. Items are open loot, with no
            reserved or claimed items. This is typical of our regular raids and our big raids. For our
            typical raiding during the week, we distribute loot to any attendee based on need before
            greed, we don't use points, and no special treatments.<br>
            <br>
            Dragon raids are a bit different in that it takes more than just one guild to pull one
            off, and have to do multiple times in order to get a chance at item. This is the reason
            for the Vox/nag rules and points, with often 40+ attendees, numerous guilds, unguilded
            individuals, epic items, uber-loot, everything needs to be clear so that it is fair and
            avoids confusion.<br>
            <br>
            This page will: (1) Detail all loot rules, (2) List everyone's raid points to date, (3)
            Talk about Brewall's future raiding plans, and (4) Detail how the point system works.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>HOW IS LOOT DONE? DO I HAVE TO DO A RANDOM?<br>
            </strong>The raid leader assigns everyone a sequential number based on their name (done
            alphabetically) and does a&nbsp; &quot;\random 1 N&quot; and the person whose name matches
            the number wins. This allows people who participated in raid, but are still being rezed/LD
            a chance at loot. Some items are simply 1 person = 1 number, for special items it is 1
            person = 1 number + raid points. This is done so everyone has a chance at an item, but
            multi-raid attendees have improved odds (reflecting their prior risk and raiding effort).
            After each raid, all raid points and a recap of the loot numbers for each item rolled is
            posted to the Crimson Talon website if anyone wants to check later. Those that have
            attended prior raids can attest to my honesty in handling loot - 3 bards I did not know
            prior to the Vox raids have wons scales, and as raid leader, it was the 4th raid before I
            won one (and was the main reason I started the raids).<br>
            <strong><br>
            VOX LOOT RULES &amp; ROLLS:</strong><br>
            *<strong>Book of Scale</strong>: Paladins 50+, 1 number + raid points<br>
            *<strong>Crystaline Spear</strong>: Bard, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior. 1 number<br>
            *<strong>Dragon Bone Bracelet</strong>: Monk, if monks have one, will go to all
            melee/hybrid. Extremely nice item for monk due to low weight, and most tanks have better
            items. <br>
            *<strong>Kayrull's Mystic Pouch</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            *<strong>McVaxious Horn of War</strong>: Bards. 1 number<br>
            *<strong>Runed Bolster Belt</strong>: Bard, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Warrior. 1 number + raid points<br>
            *<strong>Scimitar of the Mistwalker</strong>: Druid, Ranger. 1 number<br>
            *<strong>Staff of Forbidden Rites</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            *<strong>Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Necro,
            Shaman, Wizard. 1 number + raid points<br>
            *<strong>Warhammer of Divine Grace</strong>: Cleric. 1 number.<br>
            *<strong>White Dragon Scale</strong>: Special item. See explanation below. Casters &amp;
            bards. Bards will have their numbers factored <strong>5x</strong> to reflect importance of
            epic. If I ever hear of bard from my raid selling their WDS, they will never receive a
            potentially sellable quest item on any future raid I host, if this is their intent, they
            should inform me, and I will unfactor their numbers. See additional comments below if bard
            wanting to trade is present.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>NAG LOOT RULES &amp; ROLLS:</strong><br>
            <strong>*Book of Scale</strong>: Paladins 50+, 1 number + raid points<br>
            <strong>*Bladestopper</strong>: Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Shaman, Warrior. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Blight, Hammer of Scourge</strong>: Shaman. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Cloak of Flames</strong>: Bard, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight,
            Warrior. 1 number + raid points <br>
            <strong>*Gauntlet of Firey Might</strong>: Monk. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Gold Plated Koshigatana</strong>: Bard, Enchanter, Magican, Necromancer, Ranger,
            Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Heirophant's Crook</strong>: Druid. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Orb of Tishan</strong>: Bard, Enchanter, Magican, Necromancer, Wizard. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Prayers of Life</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Red Dragon Scale</strong>: Bard &amp; Warrior 50+. 1 number + raid points<br>
            <strong>*Red Dragon Tooth</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <strong>*Selo's Drums of the March</strong>: Bard. 1 number.<br>
            <strong>*Treasure Hunters's Satchel</strong>: All. 1 number<br>
            <br>
            *If you ever win an item, you are ineligible to <u>ever</u> receive another of the same
            item.<br>
            *It is possible to win multiple items on raid IF you win a nice item and are then the only
            class eligible to win the second item (e.g. A cleric wins eyepatch and is the only cleric
            on raid that does not have a Warhammer, Bard wins WDS and is only bard that does not have
            a horn).<br>
            *If a person wins 1 item, I will usually say numbers they have when a second item come up,
            just because of my spreadsheet calculations, if their number is rolled on second item, the
            random will simply be done again (e.g. BardX wins a WDS and 'wins' again on roll for horn.
            If there are other bards on raid that do not have a horn, the random is thrown-out and
            redone. If all other bards on the raid already have a horn, however, he could win the horn
            as well on the same raid).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>CURRENT RAID POINTS:<br>
            </strong>Points shown are reflective of the follwing raids: Vox 1, Vox 2a (canceled due to
            no spawn, but everyone given points), Vox 2b, Vox 3, Vox 4, Vox 5, and Vox 6<br>

            HEY BREWALL, HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU PLAN ON KILLING VOX?</strong><br>
            For those that don't know me, I'm a 52 bard that hopes to see an epic some day. I lacked
            the 100k+ pp to buy a white scale and killing the only alternate source (Gorenaire) is a
            remote possibility at best when I hit 60. I waited around for Vox raids, but no one was
            making an effort to kill her. After two months of Vox living happily every day, I decided
            to do something about it. I went through every piece of Vox raiding information I could
            find, combined it with my knowledge and expections of how a Vox raid should be done, wrote
            a guide, and scheduled some raids. Now as a host, I find myself constantly improving my
            guide (found on this site in the guide area) after every raid with my own observations and
            suggestions from others.<br>
            <br>
            Thrice I had been a victim to my own idealistic open looting rules (before I finally got a
            WDS), and am probably only one of the few bards on any server to hold THREE (3!) white
            dragon scales and then hand them to others. If anyone doubts my integrity and fairness in
            handling loot, I think this alone says that I am honorable and trustworthy. Granted, I
            could make a mistake when doing the numbers, but not intentionally, and my spreadsheet
            that calculates the numbers is extremely solid.<br>
            <br>
            I plan on holding Vox raids until I, at a minimum, get a white scale and a mcvaxious horn
            (is the only upgrade to store-bought brass instrument which I still use). After that, I
            will likely do several more to get other bards a WDS, and melees &amp; casters a
            RBB/Eyepatch/WDS (many CT members have been attending raids and have a decent total pool
            of numbers, bound to win sometime with enough raids). Perhaps I will also get a RBB, but
            time will only tell on that. I probably play EQ as it was meant to be played, I rarely
            camp for experience and spend my time exploring as much of the game as I can (which is
            easy to do a bard speed+track), because of this, I level pretty slowly, so 53 is still a
            ways off. When I do get to 53, I will likely push to get to 55 and then host other big
            encounter raids.<br>
            <br>
            I'll continue to keep scheduling the raids when I believe Vox will be up and can get
            enough attendees. The raids are always listed at Everquestraids.com and usually on a
            Fri/Sat/Sun. If I miss a week, the risk of Vox not being up is too great or I'm on
            vacation somewhere. She is on a random 7-10 day timer, and I got burned on raid 2a when we
            waited for hours after more than 8 days passed.<br>
            <br>
            In the event of an emergency patch, I will reschedule raids to maximize kills. There may
            be a raid that day or the following day.<br>
            <br>
            When I do stop having raids, I will write a hosting guide, a listing of all the keyboard
            shouts I use (over 40), how to form groups, tactics (especially when short on classes),
            and the spreadsheet I use to do groups &amp; loot.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>RAID POINTS</strong><br>
            Everyone attending the raid is given 1 Raid Point. The Raid Leader (Brewall) is given 2
            extra Raid Points for leading the event. For history buffs, eighteenth century pirate
            captains usually divided treasure out equally to all crew members, and they themselves
            took a 3x share. Rather democratic in my opinion, and I follow the same tradition, giving
            myself just 2 extra shares/points, far more fair than reserving items.<br>
            <br>
            For those that have never hosted a raid, doing so is an enormous amount of work. I average
            1 tell every 10-15 seconds for almost an hour before the fight and still have to work out
            groups, buffers, final strategy, and making sure the loot calculations are correct. I
            don't like to guarantee items, instead preferring everyone to get a chance at it, but as a
            raid leader, will have slightly better odds to reflect the work to put raids together.<br>
            <br>
            The raid leader, at their discression, can award additional points to individuals for
            service above and beyond the call of duty. <br>
            <br>
            <u><em>What are the points for?</em></u><br>
            Dragon raids take a lot of people to pull off and usually only a few (very nice) items
            drop, and even then, not all the time (RBB &amp; Eyepatch). Attend 1 raid, you may not win
            anything, attend more than 1, you stand a better chance.<br>
            To pull this off, I give out raid points to encourage people to attend more than one raid.
            The more you attend, the better chance you have at winning nice items, but there is still
            a chance for a new attendee to win as well (why attend is you stand zero chance at
            winning?). People who have attended more raids have taken more overall risk. Someone who
            has attended 5 raids should stand a better chance at winning an item than a first timer.
            Plus, multi-attendees are more experienced, need fewer instructions, usually get better
            resistance gear, and ease the work done by the raid leader.<br>
            <br>
            <em><u>How do the points help?</u></em><br>
            Each time you come to a raid you get 1 point. The points are used to give you an extra
            number in the rolls for the good loot items. The first time you come to a raid, you have 1
            number, people who have attended a prior raid have 1 number + 1 number for each raid
            point.<br>
            <br>
            <em><u>Ugh! Sounds complicated, Give me an example.</u></em><br>
            It's actually very easy. Say JoePaladin attends raid #1, he gets 1 raid point. No book of
            scale drops on raid #1. JoePaladin and MaryPaladin come to raid #2, and if a book of scale
            drops, JoePaladin would get two numbers (#1 and #2), MaryPaladin would get one number
            (#3). If they were the only paladins on the raid, the raid leader would do a \random 1 3
            to determine the winner. Mary still has a chance at the book, but Joe has a better chance
            reflecting his prior attendance.<br>
            <br>
            If Joe lost to Mary on the roll for raid #2, he has a lot of motivation to come to raid #3
            (3 numbers now on rolls: 1 number+2 raid points), <strong>and to bring along some friends
            to make sure the raid isn't short of people</strong> because he has some good odds at
            winning. Hopefully, Mary will also return to the next couple raids to help fellow paladins
            who did not win a book.<br>
            <br>
            <u><em>What items are the points for?</em></u><br>
            For the <strong>Books of Scale, Dragon Scales, Runed Bolster Belt, Cloak of Flames, and
            Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch</strong>. If you win an item, you go back to 0 points. Once you
            win an item, you are ineligible to receive another of the same item <strong><u>ever</u></strong>.
            You do not lose your points if you win another item (pouch, bracer, horn, etc). Paladins
            are faced with a decision if they win a RBB/CoF since they would lose all their points,
            thus reducing odds on future book drops.<br>
            <br>
            All other items are 1 person = 1 number.<br>
            <br>
            The raid leader, at their discression, can use their points on these 1-point items to
            increase odds. If they win, loses all points to date (e.g., bard hosting raids has a WDS
            and decides to use points on future rolls for horn to increase odds). This still allows
            others chances at the item, and keeps the raid leader motivated to not freeze out new
            attendees of same class.<br>

            <em><u>How is the White Dragon Scale treated?</u></em><br>
            For bards, this is the critical item needed for the epic quest.&nbsp; Personally, I hate
            the way VI did the bard epic, it hurts casters and it hurts bards. On other servers, it
            has meant that casters that win the WDS have been turning around and selling it for over
            100k to high level bards instead of turning it in for a cloak, and yes, the epic would be
            worth that much.&nbsp; I've tried to come up with an alternate system that is fair to
            bards and yet benefits casters as well.<br>
            <br>
            *For the first couple raids, the rolls for the WDS will be bard only (level 50+). <strong>DONE,
            5 BARDS HAVE SCALE.</strong><br>
            *These bards are expected to use the WDS for epic. If they ever sell the WDS, they will
            never be eligible to roll again for a WDS. They will also <strong>never</strong> be
            eligble to receive another non no-drop item used in a quest on any future raid I host. If
            you plan to sell it, refuse to roll and wait until opened to casters.<br>
            *Casters will get a raid points for each raid.<br>
            *(Old info) Until all the bards from the first raid have won a WDS (2 bards still have not
            won), the roll will remain bard only. A new bard coming to the raid at this point would
            still have a chance to win, but at lesser odds because of the accumulated raid points of
            the other bards. I'll note that the odds are still better than waiting till level 60 and
            taking out Gore...<br>
            *Now that the remaining two original&nbsp; bards have won, the roll is open to casters.
            &nbsp; However, bards will get their raid points factored up by <strong>5x</strong> to
            improve their odds. &nbsp; Remember, raid points are used! So, on raid #4, a caster who
            has attended every raid will have 5 numbers, a first-time caster would have 1, a
            first-time bard would have 5 , and a third time bard would have 15. The bards from the
            first raid plan on attending a few more for chances at McVaxious Horn, so this may wind up
            being open to casters soon. If multiple scales drop, I will do 1 exclusively to bards and
            others to casters (losing bards in on this roll). If 3 drop, 1 will go to bards, 2 to
            casters (losing bards will be in roll as well).<br>
            *To avoid scalping the WDS to high level bards (for 100k+), I will allow high-level bards
            to offer a cloak trade at the conclusion of the fight (if a caster wins). A cloak of equal
            or greater value for the WDS will be traded 1-for-1 for the scale.&nbsp; <strong>I have
            already received offers for trading White Dragon Scale Cloaks, Heirophant cloaks, and a
            Crimson Robe of Alendine when we get to this point!</strong> If more than one bard is
            present offering to make the trade, I will randomly select one. I don't want to see high
            level bards trying to outbid each other on this.<br>
            <br>
            *<u>53+ Bards &amp; Alternate characters</u>. I've gotten a number of messages from
            high-level bards (and those with alts) in the 45-52 range wanting to know how to get the
            scale. They have a number of options to get a scale:<br>
            1. Attend raids and take chance (like everyone else) on winning a scale. If you win (and
            tell me you are the alt), I will not force you to take a trade if a high-level bard is
            present and wanting to trade. Showing favoritism to someone because they have an alt that
            is a high-level bard wouldn't be fair to people on the raid without an alt. I've kept my
            bard at level 52 for over 4 months to try to get a white scale. This works if you have a
            caster alt / puller alt.<br>
            <br>
            2. Come to raids with a group of friends (casters). If any of them wins the roll (and tell
            me that they are part of your odds), I will not force them to take a trade if a high-level
            bard is present and wanting to trade. Getting a group of 4-5 casters on a few raids to
            attend would give you a nice chance at the scale.<br>
            <br>
            3. Get a greater or equal cloak and offer it for trade at end of the fight (to raid
            leader). I will ensure that the items are traded.<br>
            <br>
            4. Come to raids and help with mana song during buffing. After assisting on two raids,
            I'll allow rolls on WDS when it is opened up to casters. Just like I would with any 53+
            buffer.<br>
            <br>
            5. Under any of these scenarios, it helps you to get some other attendees to arrive to
            make sure the raid isn't short of people and gets cancelled. No one gets the scale then.</span></td>
