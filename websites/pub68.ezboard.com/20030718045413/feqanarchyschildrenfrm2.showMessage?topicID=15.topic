If you need a spell or two please post here so I can gather up the info. My plan is to see if we can get a raid or multi groups to go out and get these spells for people in need. They often cover three zones. This could really be our first event together as a guild. I would also like to extend this to anyone who has a char in another guild (ie. their main toon) and an alt in ours. Or if you have a friend that would like to come along please bring them. I would however like to place the quests in order of people who post here or let me know in advance that way we know our goals! This is not to say  that we will not go for mobs other than our set goals but I would like to get them first as that is our goal! So either post here or send me a tell in game and we will see what we can do! I have not set a date for this yet as I want to gather more info first so bring it on!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The info I have is:<br>
<br>
Talk to Millius Darkwater (euridite Paladin) near the lighthouse in Gunthak. Hailing him will give me the quest.<br>
<br>
I need to get a deep water emblem (in dulak harbor and that it may drop from Stormwave deckhand) and turn it into the paladin.<br>
<br>
He should give me &quot;alina's Emblem&quot; to take to Alina's Spirit.<br>
<br>
From there I need to look for an Euridite spirit that is a random spawn on the beach in gunthak. <br>
<br>
I shouldnt be KOS to the spirit but will prolly take a beating from everything else out there. <br>
<br>
I turn in the emblem to the spirit and should receive the spell.<br>
<br>
From what I understand it is 800hp and I believe 48?? AC <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I'm available anytime during the week after 6pm CST and pretty much anytime on the weekends. <br>

Also I've heard that this is the same quest for a druid spell? Not sure though.<br>

<br>
The Cannibalize 2 Quest<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WARNING: This quest is not quite intended for a level 39 character, even though Cannibalize 2 is a level 39 spell. If you plan to get the spell while still in your lower 40's, you will probably need higher level friends to help out. However, the items used in the quest are either no drop or lore, being useless to the average player who obtains them. They are often left sitting on the corpse to rot or simply destroyed. One way to get the items is to just go to the entrance of the respective zone and politely ask in ooc if you can loot the item if it drops. You might even luck out and get an escort to the corpse. This method, however, can be very time consuming and yield nothing. If you really want to take some initiative, ask if you can tag along with a group that is killing the monsters you need, buffing them and support healing, only asking in return that you are able to loot the respective item. <br>
If you are a good aligned character, the quest begins with Marlyn McMerin, a female Barbarian herb vendor located on the docks of Firiona Vie (at location -3800, +1650). If you are evil, then head to the Great Oowomp at the ogre camp in the Timorous Deep (location +5800, +3000). <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Marlyn McMerin' <br>
<br>
Marlyn McMerin says 'Greetings, hearty adventurer! Searching for the components necessary for fine shaman spells, are we? I have come to Kunark in [search of rare alchemist components], but I have found the dangers of Kunark are far too great for me.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What search for rare alchemist components?' <br>
<br>
Marlyn McMerin says 'I have heard word of four rare components - the clay of Ghiosk, crushed dread diamonds and powder of Yun. Most rare are chips from the bones of one who has touched the Bath of Obulus.' <br>
<br>
If you are evil, the conversation with the Great Oowomp is as follows. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, The Great Oowomp' <br>
<br>
The Great Oowomp gestures as if casting a powerful spell. 'Come forward, adventurer! Come and [see the dancing skeleton]. I shall cast a powerful spell and bring forth this operatic, clattering jumble of bones and he shall do a fine dance for you. From the nether regions and planes beyond, I call forth this bardic, magical, rhyming, tap-dancing hunk of undead!! I am Oowomp the Great!!' <br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to see the dancing skeleton.' <br>
<br>
The Great Oowomp says 'Oh!! You wish to see the great Oowomp perform his magic!! I have studied with the grand mages and wise [McMerin clan] of Norrath, as my speech implies. I can call forth the skeleton with but a twinkling of my power and five of your gold.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is the McMerin clan?' <br>
<br>
The Great Oowomp says 'Clan McMerin were wise shamans from the North. They allowed me to study with them. I learned many spells while I communed with them. From them, I sto.. I mean, I learned, the secret of McMerin's Feast. If you want to know the secret, you could [help gather components] for future rituals.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will help gather components.' <br>
<br>
The Great Oowomp says 'Actually... Not so much help as do - ALL - of the gathering. In the lands of Kunark are clay of Ghiosk, crushed dread diamond and powder of Yun. A rare find would be the bones of one who touched the Bath of Obulus. Find and return these to me and the shaman secret of McMerin's Feast is yours.' <br>
<br>
So, you must travel throughout Kunark and find the 4 items. <br>
<br>
1) Crushed Diamonds <br>
<br>
Go to the Timorous Deep. The item you need spawns on the ground at Gorla Island (location -8850, -6100). On the island, you guessed it, are Gorlas, which can range from level 25-36. Thankfully, they don't see through invisbility so take advantage of this and simply walk around the island until you spot the bag. <br>
<br>
2) Strange Ochre Clay <br>
<br>
Drops from &quot;an Army Behemoth&quot; in the City of Mist, which range from level 40-44. You can find behemoths throughout the City of Mist but I suggest hunting at the stables, as you can do the reports part of the epic quest at the same time. Check out this map from EQ Atlas. The stables are #6. <br>
<br>
3) Shaman Powder <br>
<br>
Drops from &quot;Froglok Yun Shaman&quot;, which are level 37-41. You can find these frogloks by the ruins entrance, in the east part of the zone. Check out this map from EQ Atlas. Make sure the powder is black, not white, as only the black will work for this quest. <br>
<br>
4) Greyish Bone Chips <br>
<br>
Drops from the &quot;skeletal warlord&quot; in Karnor's Castle, who is level 45. Check out this map from EQ Atlas. The warlord can spawn at #9 and #11. The good thing about this is that the warlord drops his bones every time. <br>
<br>
Return the 4 items to either Marlyn McMerin or the Great Oowomp. You are rewarded with the spell McMerin's Feast, which becomes Cannibalize 2 when you scribe it. <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 And (Tumultuous Strength) which is dropped off of many NPC's in Velious. And (Remove Curse) drops off of &quot;The Great Saprophyte&quot; in Echo Caverns. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/beqanarchyschildren.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kathileegrifflord>Kathilee Grifflord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/6/03 5:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub68.ezboard.com/feqanarchyschildrenfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: LOY Spells Quests</span><hr size=1> Yeddy - <br>

Inchy needs the shaman nok powder (drops in FV, but black as well) for her Illusion:  Iksar spell.  Just so you're aware..<br>
<br>
And good news, sort of.  The skeletal warlord spawns in a place Kathi needs to camp.  That area is where the drolvarg pawbuster spawns, who drops a pipe I need for her epic.  Not to mention the fact that the warlord's rare drop is the Tranquil Staff....   Heehee!<br>
<br>
Pawbuster is a pretty rare spawn.  Not Raster rare, but not common at all.  I've been needing to go there to camp it for a long time, but I really need a healer and a slower to be able to succeed there.  So Kathi is ready to go with you any time to help you with this part.<br>
<br>
Tumultuous Strength, we can go camp for; same with Remove Curse.  I'd be happy to help you there, too.  One thing:  You might want to start checking NPC vendors for them, too.  Inch has found a couple of her high level drop-only spells for about 7-10 plat on the vendors in PoK.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/beqanarchyschildren.showUserPublicProfile?gid=svyndian>Svyndian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/6/03 4:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub68.ezboard.com/feqanarchyschildrenfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: LOY Spells Quests</span><hr size=1> We have been doing well on completeing many of these Quests I beleive.
