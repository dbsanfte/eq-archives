<h1>Important announcement about the next patch</h1>
	Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast.<P>The important part of the message is not that, though.  It's this:<P>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<P>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<P>Thanks.<P>- The EverQuest Team<BR>

<hr>

<B>Can't help but think of the following:<P>(Bring out your dead) <BR>Here's one for ya.<BR>I'm not dead yet. <P>Malark of Betoxxulous</B><P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Trillig wrote:<P><B>I just wanted to thank you for the early heads up about the upcoming patch.  While I can't say I'm thrilled about even the smallest chance of losing a corpse, I can understand that some conflicts cannot be avoided.<P>I appreciate the proactive approach and hope you continue to use it in the future.  Some people may get upset over hearing about potential problems, but it beats trying to clean up afterwards!<P>The last week of May is sounding like a good time to work on my trade skills.  I may not be the best baker around, but I haven't killed anyone with my cooking yet.</B><P>Well, it's better for everyone if you know this might happen.  The more folks that can clear out their corpses before the patch, the less corpses that might be lost.  The less corpses lost (and we're not really expecting many at all, if any), the faster we can help those that do have a problem.<P>We don't want anyone to lose anything.  We just foresee that there might be a problem with the next patch, and we want to prevent any problems we can.<P>And, on a similar note, here is an update to the above message.  Note that the new stuff is in bold.  It is very important that you get on and look for any corpses you were worried about right after the patch.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>May 14th, 6:30 pm<BR>------------------------------<P>** Important announcement about the next patch **<P>Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast.<P>The important part of the message is not that, though.

In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it right away after the patch.</B><P>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.
