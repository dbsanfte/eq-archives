		<h2>
			17.1
			Camera Views
		</h2>
	
	During gameplay you can view your
  character from several different camera angles, zoom in and out, or pan up
  and down. <BR><BR>To cycle between available views, press <STRONG><EM>F9</EM></STRONG>. <BR><BR><EM>First-person view (default)</EM> - View straight ahead (you can't see your
  character).<BR><BR><EM>Overhead (rotating)</EM> - View from above (camera rotates as you turn).<BR><BR><EM>Rear (rotating)</EM> - View from rear (camera rotates as you turn and stays
  behind you).<BR><BR><EM>Overhead (fixed)</EM> - View from above (camera does not rotate when you
  turn).<BR><BR><EM>Rear (fixed)</EM> - View from rear (camera does not rotate when you turn).<BR><BR>You can also toggle the interface on and off (turning off the interface makes
  for cleaner screenshots). To cycle through interface views, press <STRONG><EM>F10</EM></STRONG>.

	
		<h2>
			17.2
			Panning and Zooming
		</h2>
	
	You can pan the camera in
  different directions, either with the keyboard (press <STRONG><EM>Alt</EM></STRONG> + <STRONG><EM>the
  arrow keys</EM></STRONG>) or by right-clicking the mouse. To pan with the mouse,
  right-click-and-drag in any direction (this works in all views except for
  fixed overhead and rear views - in these, the mouse zooms the view in and
  out). <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>F12</EM></STRONG>: Enable/disable mouse panning<BR><BR>Here are some useful keyboard camera commands: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 5</EM></STRONG> or <STRONG><EM>Home</EM></STRONG>: Re-center view<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 9</EM></STRONG> and <STRONG><EM>3</EM></STRONG> or <STRONG><EM>Page-Up</EM></STRONG> and <STRONG><EM>Page-Down</EM></STRONG>:

			17.3
			Enabling/Disabling Windows
		</h2>
	
	Every window in can be enabled or disabled for viewing by engaging
  the customizable hot-key combination for that feature and window. The only
  exception is the main Chat Window, which can never be disabled. The defaults
  are: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - B</EM></STRONG>: Buff/Spell Effects Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - P</EM></STRONG>: Party (Group) Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - S</EM></STRONG>: Spell Gem Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - H</EM></STRONG>: Hot Button Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - T</EM></STRONG>: Target Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - Y</EM></STRONG>: Self-Status Window<BR><STRONG><EM>ALT - M</EM></STRONG>: Menu Window<BR><EM><STRONG>ALT - C</STRONG></EM>:&nbsp;Compass Window

	
		<h2>
			17.4
			Hot Buttons
		</h2>
	
	To make any interface button
  accessible at all times, there's a Hot Button bank to the left of the screen with
  ten different sets of ten blank buttons (the arrows cycle you through each
  set). This means that you can program up to 100 Hot Buttons (though you can
  only view 10 at once). <BR><BR>Hot Button shortcuts are a good idea - you can copy any interface button function
  (any interface button, skill, spell, or Ability/Combat/Social/Main button)
  onto a blank Hot Button. <BR><BR><EM>To create a Hot Button:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click-and-hold on the button you want to copy.<BR>* Wait for a floating button to appear on your cursor (about 2 seconds).<BR>* Click on a blank Hot Button slot.<BR><BR><EM>To remove a Hot button:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click-and-hold on the Hot Button you want to delete.<BR>* Wait for that Hot Button to float on your cursor.<BR>* Click anywhere in your front view to &quot;drop&quot; the button.<BR><BR>You can cycle through the Hot Button sets by clicking the arrows, or by
  pressing <STRONG><EM>Shift + 1</EM></STRONG> through <STRONG><EM>0</EM></STRONG>. The number of the
  currently selected bank appears between the arrows. <BR><BR>You may want to consider placing the following actions on Hot buttons: <BR><BR>* Sit/Stand<BR>* Run/Walk<BR>* Combat skills you often use (Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, etc.)<BR>* Spells you often use (any spell you've memorized)<BR>* Skills you often use (Fishing, Lay Hands, etc.)<BR>* Social actions you often use (such as &quot;/shout&quot;)
