  computer?</EM> I play on a
  Desktop.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> I access with Dial-up.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My first
  EQ character was (a short lived) Half-Elf Ranger who happened to step out of
  Surefall just in time for a GM event, at level 1 and naked.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> My first (graphical) online game was The
  Realm, at the time offered by Sierra.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> My highest level in EQ is 70.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> I enjoy being able to play both in a group
  and solo.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> What I like most about the class I have chosen as my main (for now,
  Cleric) is the ability to Help other players, be it buffs healing or
  rezzing.&nbsp; It's great to find
  someone who is frustrated over a death or losing a fight they can't escape
  and turn things around for them, sometimes making their day.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> My main character(s) are guilded.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> All of my
  character spaces are taken on my chosen server (Nameless)</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> All of my characters chose deities
  relevant to their class and nature, except my Gnome Enchanter who could find
  no Clockwork deities.</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> The only classes I have not played in EQ
  are Beastlord and Berzerker.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> The most platinum I have spent at one shot
  on a single item for a character would be 45k for a Stone of Focussed Rage.
  (though I was tempted by Rejuvinating Shield of War at 70k)</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> My favorite expansion had to be
  Luclin.&nbsp; While it had much in the
  way of unfinished quests/broken content, and numerous graphics issues, it
  offered the best overall mix of content for the widest range of levels and
  play styles.&nbsp; Whether you were a
  casual soloer or a high end raider and no matter your level, Luclin had
  content for you.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> My favorite zone is Erud's Crossing.&nbsp; Fun music, good fishing, seahorses,
  and vampire bats.&nbsp; What more could
  you want in a vacation spot?</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> My favorite NPC is Kizdean Gix.&nbsp; He's just misunderstood I tell you!</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> The expansion I liked the least has been
  PoP.&nbsp; It had some good triggered
  events and raid encounters, but the flagging system it used, and the fact
  that except for PoK it excluded what was at the time a huge portion of the
  player base, made many feel left out.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> The Zone I like the least is the revamped
  Mistmore.&nbsp; Pathing issues.&nbsp; Need I say more?</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> The NPC I like the least is Discordling
  Warfiend.&nbsp; I think he has tracking
  and watches for me heading to MPG or Anguish.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM>&nbsp; <EM>If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> I keep my 7th coldain
  shawl and the issue kit and marching orders, more for nostalgia than the
  thought that I will ever complete the 8th.&nbsp; I have better already but the weeks I
  spent on tradeskills and collecting the pieces to get there are difficult to
  send to the destroy button.&nbsp; And
  the Qeynos Badge of Nobility on the off chance there is ever an additional
  stage added to it, since that quest series was quite fun.</P>
