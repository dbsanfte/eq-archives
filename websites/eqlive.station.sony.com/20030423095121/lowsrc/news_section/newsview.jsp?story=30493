	<h2>Patch Message Addendum</h2>
	
	April 17th, 1:00 pm<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Just a few notes to clear up some questions and some errors in the patch message.<br>
<br>
<b>** Food Changes **</b><br>
<br>
Along with the other changes mentioned in the patch message, some player-made food items will now have an effect on your character beyond just keeping him from being hungry.  We'll leave it up to you to discover the rest.<br>
<br>
We've also added the ability to right-click food to 'force' your character to eat it.  This will cause the food to be eaten immediately (though your character can only eat so much food at one time).  Food eaten this way will only last half as long as food eaten naturally by the character.<br>
<br>
<b>** Run the Velious Patch **</b><br>
<br>
If you want to see the new Monk textures you will need to make the changes mentioned in the patch message.  But you will also need to run the Velious Patch in order to get those textures to show up.<br>
<br>
<b>** Skewer Change **</b><br>
<br>
We didn't actually change the weight of Skewers, we changed the weight of Spits.  Sorry for the confusion.
