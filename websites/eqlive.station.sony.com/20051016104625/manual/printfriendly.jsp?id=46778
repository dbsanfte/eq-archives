			13.8
			Developing Magical Skills
		</h2>
	
	Some skills relate directly
  to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination,
  Evocation, Meditate and Specialization (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=skillsmagic">Magical Skills</A>,
  for a listing and definition of each skill type). You gain some of these
  skills through experience, while you're born with others.
