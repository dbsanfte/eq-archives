			Player Window
		</h2>
	
	The Player Window is in the
  upper right of your screen. It has the name of your character at the top, and
  two or three colored bars below it. Each bar is a gauge that represents a
  resource for your character. As the resource is depleted the bar will shrink.
  <BR><BR><EM>Red Gauge</EM> - Health - shows your character's level of health. If your
  character controls a pet, the red health bar will be split - the top part
  remaining red while the bottom part turns yellow. The red portion still represents
  the character's health, while the yellow portion shows the health of the pet.<BR><EM>Blue Gauge</EM> - Mana - shows your character's mana amount. This bar will
  not be visible if your character is of a class that does not have mana (such
  as a warrior).<BR><EM>Yellow Gauge</EM> - Stamina - shows your character's stamina. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: The tool tip for these gauges will show you the percentage of
  the resource that remains.</EM>
