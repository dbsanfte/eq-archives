<h1>Access to the Plane of Time - part II</h1>
	We've been keeping a close eye on the progress of high-end guilds towards the Plane of Time, and have made difficulty adjustments over the past few weeks to improve the Rathe encounter. Guild Afterlife of the Mithaniel Marr server were the only players to defeat the Rathe council, and we'd like to congratulate them on their success. While Afterlife was successful in beating the Rathe council, we felt the encounter was still harder than it should be, and made one last adjustment to make it an easier encounter. Since we made that change, a few other guilds have also managed to beat the new easier Rathe council and we look forward to their adventures in the Plane of Time. We feel that this encounter is now well balanced and don't anticipate further changes to the event. <BR><BR>Now that the Plane of Time has been entered, it's given us an opportunity to look at what's involved in getting there. One issue that's been brought up is that once a guild gets into the the Plane of Time, it's a bad idea to have them going to kill lower-tier gods to get story flags for their new members. This has two real issues - first, it means the Plane of Time capable guild is killing gods they wouldn't normally fight anymore, and second, they're taking those gods away from lower-tier guilds who are interested in experiencing them. <BR><BR>We're making some changes to zone entrance requirements throughout Planes of Power soon, in order to make the lower tiers much more accessible to players and to help with the feeling of being "left behind" if you miss certain raids or events. We'll be detailing those changes in the next week or so, but we're going to make this change to Plane of Time access tonight: <BR><BR>In order to gain access to the Plane of Time, each character simply needs to have killed the four elemental gods and have a Quintessence of Elements. <BR><BR>This change should maintain the difficulty of gaining Plane of Time access, but decreases the amount of lower-tier content needed for reflagging new members. This leaves the gods in the lower planes for the guilds who want to experience them, and keeps the Elemental Planes guilds in zones more appropriate to their power level. We feel this is a good change for the game and benefits high-level guilds of all types. As noted above, we'll be announcing additional Planes of Power changes next week that address many of the common concerns we've heard about planar progression. <BR><BR>Thanks for playing, <BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team <BR><BR>
