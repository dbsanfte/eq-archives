	When you die, your corpse is "locked." No one else can take what's in your inventory. The only trick is that you have a limited amount of time in which to find your body and transfer items to your inventory. <BR><BR>Corpses only remain in the world for a short while. Player corpses have a timer on them, and when that timer expires they will disappear. This is the corpse timer for player characters (please note that all times are in real time, not game time): <BR><BR>Level 1 - 9: 30 minutes<BR>Level 10+: 7 days <BR><BR><I>Note: It is advised that you get your corpse right away. Also note that the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</I><BR><BR>
