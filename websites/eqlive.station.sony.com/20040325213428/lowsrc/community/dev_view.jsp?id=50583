<h1>Submit Comments and your topics</h1>
	<B>suggestion for boards<P>Could you guys make it so there was some tracking information automatically put in the subject line of the Submit Comment form?  So that the post we were responding to (if we were responding to a post on the boards) would be clearer.  Just a though....I really like the new boards overall, they've become a place to visit again!<P>Tali</B><P>Actually, I think a lot of people misunderstand how the "Submit Comments" thing works.  I should have explained it.  Thanks for bringing it up.<P>When you hit the "Submit Comment" button, you are opening a web form.  That form does not know the title of the subject that you are replying to.  So when you are sending in your comments, if you want to refer to a specific post, please list it in the subject.  The form does not know which subject you are replying to, and so it can't tell us.  We've received several messages from people that spend several paragraphs talking about a particular item.  By the end of the message I still don't know what there are referring to because they didn't mention it specifically in the message, and it wasn't in the subject line.<P>So please, make sure to be clear with your subject line when sending comments.<P>In the mean time, I'll see if the web team can get your suggestion implemented.  Thanks.<P>Alan<BR>
