			Corpses Decay
		</h2>
	
	When you die, your corpse is
  &quot;locked.&quot; No one else can take what's in your inventory. The only trick
  is that you have a limited amount of time in which to find your body and
  transfer items to your inventory. <BR><BR>Corpses only remain in the world for a short while. Player corpses have a
  timer on them, and when that timer expires they will disappear. This is the
  corpse timer for player characters (please note that all times are in real
  time, not game time): <BR><BR>If they are under level 10, all corpses decay in 3 minutes. <BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above and have no items on them, they decay in 3
  hours.<BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above with items, they decay in 7 days.<BR><BR><EM>Note: It is advised that you get your corpse right away. Also note that
  the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</EM>
