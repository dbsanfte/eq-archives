<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Broadband Connection Troubleshooting</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left>The following are things to check if you are having connection problems while playing EverQuest when using some form of Broadband connection (Cable Modem, DSL, etc.). </P></DIV>
<P>The first thing that you would want to check if you are losing connection to the game while playing is whether or not your network adapter is sharing an IRQ with your Video or Sound card. To check for this, right click on the "My Computer" icon on your desktop and choose "Properties" from the menu. Next, choose the "Device Manager" tab and double click the "Computer" entry at the top of the device list. This should bring up the IRQ Resource window. If your network card is sharing an IRQ with your Video or Sound card then you will need to move one of those devices to a different slot on your motherboard to resolve the conflict.</P>
<P>If you have a modem installed in your computer along with the network card for either your Cable or DSL modem then it may cause troubles. We recommend that you remove the modem from your computer completely, or at least disable it, so there is no conflict there between the modem and your network card.</P>
<P>There is a file in your EverQuest directory that is named Datarate.txt. This file determines the size of the packets of information that you receive during gameplay. The default value in the file is 5.0, but we recommend that you try setting it at 7.0. This should speed up certain aspects of the game such as zoning times. If you are encountering severe packet loss at either of those settings then you may want to try setting it at a value lower then 5.0. If you are using a standard dial up modem, do not set the value in that file higher then 5.0.</P>
<P>Remember that if you are running a firewall, then it could cause connection troubles to our servers. You will either need to disable any firewalls you may have running, or visit our Firewall/Proxy Support page for all the necessary modifications you would need in order to connect to EverQuest from behind your firewall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you are still having problems after visiting this support section, you can contact our Technical Support Department through an email via our <A href="http://www.station.sony.com/en/services/help/premiumGames.jsp" target=_blank>online form</A>.<BR></P><!-- #EndEditable -->
