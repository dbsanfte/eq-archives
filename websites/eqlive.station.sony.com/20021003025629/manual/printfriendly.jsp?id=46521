			Using Emotes
		</h2>
	
	You can appear to bow, be bored, point, or convey other visible gestures by using other special commands. EverQuest has a lengthy <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=emotelist">list of built-in emotes</A>, and some even trigger animations. <BR><BR>If you don't want to use pre-defined emotes, you can type in virtually anything. (Your character won't perform a visible action, but other players can see text that indicates your action). <BR><BR><I>To use the built-in emotes, simply type in the appropriate command, such as:</I> <BR><BR>/sit<BR>/dance<BR>/bow <BR><BR>These emotes may give different messages if you have a character targeted and if you have nothing targeted. <BR><BR><I>To create your own emote:</I> <BR><BR>/em [text] <BR><BR>For example (our sample character's name is Fippy): <BR><BR>/em scratches his nose.<BR>Would appear to those around you as:<BR>Fippy scratches his nose.<BR><BR>
