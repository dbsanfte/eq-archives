<h1>UI Labels on Test</h1>
	We patched Test today.  Ill put the patch message at the bottom of this post so youll have some reference for what Im about to tell you.  This wont be too important to most of you, but I wanted to get this out to those of you that are mucking around with the interface on Test.<P>For those of you that have already started to test out the new labels, I need to let you know that there are some problems with them.<P><B>28 and 29 will cause you to crash if you dont have a target (dont use them...)</B><BR>The Pet Hit Points and Pet Name labels are missing<BR>The Group Members Pet Hit Points percentage is currently returning the Group Members Hit Point percentage instead.<P>Well have all of that fixed with the next patch to Test.<P>----<P>** Tuesday, July 09 2002.<P><BR>We wanted to first thank those of you that are putting our UI and the Bazaar to the test.<P>We have good/bad news for those of you that have been modifying the UI.  The bad news first you say?<P>Today we've made a change that might require you to change your modifications.<P>The good news is that we're adding another level of customization to the UI.<P>We're turning many of the existing displays into labels.  This will make it possible for you to put these numbers anywhere you want them on your customized interface.  For those of you that aren't worried about modifying the interface, just be aware that we've changed the way the interface deals with things like your character name, class, level, attributes and all that.  Please let us know if you see anything odd about any of the numbers or names displayed.<P>For those that are, here is a list of the label types that are available in the new UI with a rough description of how they work.<P>Put simply, a &lt;EQType&gt;#&lt;/EQType&gt; tag in any label will cause the text of that label to be ignored, and the # will determine what value is placed in that label when drawn.  Note that certain labels determine their coloring dependent on the data (such as STR, which is either green, grey, or red depending on buffs/debuffs), while others will retain the label coloring from the XML.  Hopefully the label names are self-explanatory.<P>	Name = 1<BR>	Level = 2<BR>	Class = 3<BR>	Deity = 4<BR>	Strength = 5<BR>	Stamina = 6<BR>	Dexterity = 7<BR>	Agility = 8<BR>	Wisdom = 9<BR>	Intelligence = 10<BR>	Charisma = 11<BR>	Save vs Poison = 12<BR>	Save vs Disease = 13<BR>	Save vs Fire = 14<BR>	Save vs Cold = 15<BR>	Save vs Magic = 16<BR>	Current Hit Points = 17<BR>	Maximum Hit Points = 18<BR>	Hit Point Percentage =19<BR>	Mana Percentage = 20<BR>	Stamina Percentage = 21<BR>	Armor Class = 22<BR>	Attack = 23<BR>	Weight = 24<BR>	Maximum Weight = 25<BR>	Experience Percentage = 26<BR>	Alternate Experience Percentage = 27<BR>	Target Name = 28<BR>	Target Hit Point Percentage = 29<BR>	Group Member 1 Name = 30<BR>	Group Member 2 Name = 31<BR>	Group Member 3 Name = 32<BR>	Group Member 4 Name = 33<BR>	Group Member 5 Name = 34<BR>	Group Member 1 Health Pecentage = 35<BR>	Group Member 2 Health Pecentage = 36<BR>	Group Member 3 Health Pecentage = 37<BR>	Group Member 4 Health Pecentage = 38<BR>	Group Member 5 Health Pecentage = 39<BR>	Group Pet 1 Health Pecentage = 40<BR>	Group Pet 2 Health Pecentage = 41<BR>	Group Pet 3 Health Pecentage = 42<BR>	Group Pet 4 Health Pecentage = 43<BR>	Group Pet 5 Health Pecentage = 44<BR>	Buff 1 = 45<BR>	Buff 2 = 46 <BR>	Buff 3 = 47 <BR>	Buff 4 = 48 <BR>	Buff 5 = 49 <BR>	Buff 6 = 50 <BR>	Buff 7 = 51<BR>	Buff 8 = 52<BR>	Buff 9 = 53<BR>	Buff 10 = 54<BR>	Buff 11 = 55<BR>	Buff 12 = 56 <BR>	Buff 13 = 57 <BR>	Buff 14 = 58 <BR>	Buff 15 = 59 <BR>	Spell 1 = 60 <BR>	Spell 2 = 61<BR>	Spell 3 = 62<BR>	Spell 4 = 63<BR>	Spell 5 = 64<BR>	Spell 6 = 65<BR>	Spell 7 = 66<BR>	Spell 8 = 67<BR>
