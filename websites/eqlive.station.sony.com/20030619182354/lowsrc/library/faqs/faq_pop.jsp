<DIV align=center><BR><B>EVERQUEST:<SUP><FONT color=#cccccc>&reg;</FONT></SUP> THE PLANES OF POWER<FONT color=#cccccc>&#153;</FONT> </B></DIV>
<P class=link align=left><B><U>GENERAL INFORMATION</U></B><BR><B><BR>What is EverQuest?</B><BR>EverQuest is a real-time 3-D massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) with fantasy elements featuring dragons, wizards, vast continents and dungeons full of treasure and mystery.</P>
<P class=link><B>What is EverQuest: The Planes of Power?</B><BR>EverQuest: The Planes of Power is the latest game expansion in the best-selling EverQuest series. This expansion will focus mainly on providing content to the highest levels of the game, allowing players to become even more powerful. We plan to add twenty zones to the existing world in this expansion.</P>
<P class=link><B>When was the original EverQuest released?</B><BR>EverQuest was released March 16, 1999.</P>
<P class=link><B>What is an RPG?</B><BR>RPG stands for Role-Playing Game. When you play EverQuest, you'll first create a character. Immerse your character into our virtual world and make of it whatever you wish. You define your character's destiny in the lands of EverQuest. How well you play that role it is up to you. </P>
<P class=link><B>What is a "massively multiplayer online game"?</B><BR>While many modern computer games support multiplayer gaming, few are designed to support well over 1,000 simultaneous players. With EverQuest, you don't start the server program on a local network and invite a few of your friends over to play. Instead, you run the EverQuest client program and use the Internet to connect to our world servers. Call or email your friends and tell them what city or dungeon to meet you in or, better yet, log on and encounter hundreds of other people from all over the world and make a slew of new acquaintances. To date EverQuest has more than 98,000 simultaneous users during peak gaming hours.</P>
<P class=link><B>How many people play EverQuest?</B><BR>Currently, EverQuest has more than 420,000 monthly subscribers.</P>
<P class=link><B>What other EverQuest expansions have been released?</B><BR>EverQuest&reg;: The Ruins of Kunark&#153; expansion was released April 24, 2000. Since then it has become a part of the basic EverQuest package, giving players more than twenty new zones, a new playable race of lizard men called the Iksar and selling over 400,000 copies to date. The second expansion, EverQuest&reg;: The Scars of Velious&#153;, was released on December 5, 2000. It provides 19 more zones of content designed for level 30 characters and above and has sold more than 300,000 copies since its release. Selling over 120,000 copies it's first day at retail, the third expansion, EverQuest&reg;: The Shadows of Luclin&#153; takes players to the enchanting moonscape of Luclin--offering over 27 new adventure zones, all-new items, creatures and spells, a new playable character race and rideable horses. Supported by a complete graphic overhaul, the enhanced gameplay featured in Luclin allows players to witness their world in unprecedented splendor. </P>

<P class=link><B>Like EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, will I need a level 35 character or above to play the game?</B><BR>The Plane of Knowledge is available to players of all levels and is a source of many new quests, making travel throughout Norrath far more convenient. All other new planar zones require players to be level 46 or above to enter. </P>
<P class=link><B>How can this expansion engage a level-60 player that has played EQ for the last 3 years, yet also appeal to a"newbie"?</B><BR>Veteran players have access to new content that provides months of exciting gameplay. And players at all skill levels benefit from the Plane of Knowledge and its scores of new and challenging quests. </P>
