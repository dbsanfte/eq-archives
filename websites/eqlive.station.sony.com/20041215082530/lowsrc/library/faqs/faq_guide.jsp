<h1>Guide FAQ</h1>


<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Guide FAQ</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left>This FAQ is to better explain what the Ever Quest Guide Program. The EverQuest Guide Program covers EverQuest PC, EverQuest Online Adventures, EverQuest Mac, and EverQuest 2. To find out more information about any of the specific games for guiding on please contact your local Guide Team.</P>
<P><B>What is the Guide Program?</B><BR>The EverQuest Guide Program is a group made up of volunteer players. They offer you a way to expand your in-game play experience. The Guide Program has been around since EverQuest PC's beta and has done wonders in helping expand the play experience for many EverQuest customers. They currently run in game quests, events, and persistent characters. Ever felt like trying your hands at Bartending or feel like a lonely Cyclops? Maybe Guiding is right for you.</P>
<P><B>How is the Guide Program organized?</B><BR>There are four levels of Guides that a customer may run into while playing EverQuest: Apprentice Guide, Full Guide, Senior Guide and Elder Guide. Each of these levels has one common goal, and that is to enhance your experience.</P>
<P><B>Apprentice Guide:</B><BR>These are the newest members of the Guide Program. An Apprentice Guide's duties mainly consist of learning how the world of Norrath works, they may not have every answer for you. <BR>Things an Apprentice can do: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Answer basic in-game questions, not including spoiler information. 
<LI>Assist in the performance of dynamic quests and events. 
<LI>Interact with the world around them providing role-playing experiences including weddings. 
<LI>Learn as much as possible from the world and people that populate it. </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Full Guide:</B><BR>The next level of access is Full Guide. They can handle most every issue that you may need assistance with. The majority of members in the Guide Program are Full Guides and are the most commonly found. <BR>Things a Full Guide can do:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Answer basic in-game questions, not including spoiler information. 
<LI>Assist in the performance of dynamic quests and events. 
<LI>Interact with the world around them providing role-playing experiences including weddings. 
<LI>Learn as much as possible from the world and people that populate it. 
<LI>Assist during emergency situations (server drops, stuck under the world, etc.) </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Senior Guide:</B><BR>The Senior Guide access level is the highest level you will most likely see online. Senior Guides are Guides who are willing to invest extra time in the Program. They handle the more difficult problems, and the administration of their server. Senior Guides continue to assist players with requests for assistance and are also responsible for communicating with the Elders and SOE to administrate their servers. A Senior Guide can do everything a Full Guide can, and more.<BR>What a Senior Guide can do:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Everything a Full Guide can do. 
<LI>Manage the Guide Program on their server. 
<LI>Train and mentor Guides and Apprentices. 
<LI>Assit the Program and Elders as needed. </LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Elder Guide:</B><BR>Elder Guides are the consulting and management arm of the Guide Program. They are responsible for the welfare of the Guide Program as a whole. Elder Guides are the highest escalation point in the Guide Program. Elders jointly share the responsibilities, each being responsible for a portion of the issues that arise on the servers, and for the team or teams that fall under his/her sphere of influence. Elders will periodically rotate their responsibilities in order to maintain an overall perspective of the issues of the Program as a whole. An Elder Guide can do everything a Senior Guide can do. As a player, you will most likely not see an Elder Guide, as they are mainly responsible for handling issues within the Guide Program.</P>
<P><B>How do I contact a Guide?</B><BR>A Guide may be contacted by using the /guidehelp command. Guides may assist via /tell on a case-by-case basis however they may not assist with communication via /tell, /shout, /ooc, /auct or /emote.</P>
<P>Once the /guidehelp command is used it will add your petition to a queue for a Guide to answer. Petitions are answered in order that they are received. It is desired by the Guide Program to answer every petition, even if the answer is that they cannot help. </P>
<P><B>There are no Guides online when I play, what can I do to get help?</B><BR>If you find that there are no Guides online when you play, you may wish to still file a /guidehelp ticket. Sometimes Guides may appear to be invisible.</P>
<P><B>What do I do if I have a complaint against a Guide?</B><BR>You can email <A href="mailto:eqcs@soe.sony.com" target=_blank>eqcs@soe.sony.com</A> to make a formal complaint. Please make sure to have proof of your claim, such as logs or a date that you have done a /report. We take these seriously and will follow up on each claim.</P>
<P><B>How can I become a Guide?</B><BR>To become a Guide, you will need to fill out the application located at <A href="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/" target=_blank>https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</A>. This application is graded on knowledge, grammar and spelling. You must be 18 years or older to join the Guide Program. </P>
<P>Once you fill out an application, a team of Guides will grade it. At times, this can take close to a month. If you are accepted, you will be sent a welcome letter and dates on which you must train. You will need to go through this training before you are given access as an Apprentice Guide. You will also receive e-mail if you are not accepted into the Guide Program.</P>
