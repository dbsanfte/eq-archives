	<h2>A Very Warm Thank You</h2>
	
	<b><i>This letter was sent to us by a player, and we thought that in light of recent events, we'd post it with the player's permission.</b></i><br>
<br>
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the EQ players that helped my fiance and myself find my future brother in-law. We are all players of this great game and for the first time in my experience here I have seen just how powerful this community can be. I will not use real names except my own.<br>
<br>
After that horrible event in New York we were frantic when we learned that he was visiting or going to visit a cousin in tower one. Here in Canada we watched with growing horror all day as people were removed from various locations around the site and transported to area hospitals. With no way to get in touch with anyone there we waited two days to finally get news that was almost credible. We were told by friends there that they had located him at a hospital just outside the city after many phone calls. It turned out not to be him.<br>
<br>
To escape the pain and anguish of continued waiting my fiance escaped to EQ as there was nothing we could do except wait. While on line he explained to on line friends what was happening. Many players apparently live in and around the New York area or have friends there. Those that were unaffected directly started to do what we could not from here. Well thanks to EQ'ers we found our loved one for real and I will forever be grateful. My fiance was even invited down by a player who shall remain nameless who is in law enforcement in the US and was not attached directly to this event. He is there now as I type this.<br>
<br>
Before I say anymore I am so sorry for the thousands that died in this  tragedy. Yet I cannot help but feel relief that our loved one was so lucky to survive with livable injury's. I would like to say THANK YOU to all the people on The Rathe server on the Bertoxxulous server and the server that started the search the Ayonae Ro server. You know who you are and I love you all. My heart breaks and my prayers go out to all those affected by this monsterous crime commited on all of us. We lost one family member who will sorely be missed. But thanks to the heroes of that day and EQ players we found and rejoiced in the life of another.<br>
<br>
P.S I have no way of acknowledging all those involved from this game but I just wanted you to know Verant that you have a wonderful and surprisingly generous group of people in your world. Who returned to the real world  steadfast and determined who unselfishly went out of their way to help. God Bless.<br>
