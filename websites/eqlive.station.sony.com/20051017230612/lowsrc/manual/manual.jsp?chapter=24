		<h1>
			24
			Melee Disciplines
		</h1>
	
	In addition to the many
  automatic skills and abilities that characters will receive past 50th level,
  we've added player-controlled fighting &quot;disciplines&quot; to the
  repertoires of the pure melee (Warriors, Monks, and Rogues) and hybrid
  (Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, and Bard) classes. These disciplines are
  listed&nbsp;on the combat UI screen which you can bring up by hitting Ctrl+C.
  You cannot use any other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used
  discipline has expired. The window will show&nbsp;which disciplines you have
  learned as well as the reuse times for any you have&nbsp;used.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long duration, have a disadvantage
  in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline. In all cases where
  this happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage. For
  instance, where the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his
  opponent less by a factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less,
  but only by a factor of 15%. In the interest of exploration, further formulae
  will not be provided.

	
		<h2>
