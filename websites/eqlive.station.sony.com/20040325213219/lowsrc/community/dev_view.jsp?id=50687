<h1>Flowing Thought</h1>
	Danyela wrote:<P><B>I posted a comment about this yesterday, but I did not get an email response letting me know it had been received, so I am submitting it again.<P>Many months ago, when enchanters were getting defensive about the dillution of their defining class abilities, a promise was made rather vehemently that no items would ever be placed in the game that granted the wearer a clarity effect.  This was to guarantee that enchanters would always have something unique they could do, especially in light of all the illusions and other versatility given to other classes that used to be the domain of the enchanter.<P>Now, with the upgrade of the planes, Cazic Thule himself drops items that grant the effect of Flowing Thought.  Ok, that isn't officially clarity, but 'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet' should come to mind.  It may not be clarity, but it sure acts like it.  Even better in many respects as it never wears off.</B><P>Well, I can only guess that you're not very familiar with the actual effect of Flowing Thought.<P>I'm an advocate of the whole idea of not blurring the class lines.  But here your are concerned about something that if rubbed vigorously on that line, with much force and perseverance, won't even smudge it.  If Flowing Thought acts like clarity, then I act like a Pulitzer Prize winning author...<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>'a rose by any other name would smell as sweet'<P>This is true, however the difference between Flowing Thought I and Clarity II is more like the difference between a rose and a dandelion.<P>- L. Poe<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To top all that off, we're talking about the New Cazic here, not the little baby Cazic that you used to know...<P>And I wanted to let you all know that we won't be sending individual e-mail responses to every comment.  We don't have the resources for that.  There is a confirmation page that you'll see when you successfully send in a comment.  If you see that, rest assured that we have received your comment.  There's no need to send it in again.  I'm sorry that we can't respond to every comment.  I'd like to, but it's just not possible.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>First, Guys be honest, you created item with mana regen on it and therefore broke the promise the you wouldn't do this.  It does not matter that it's not as good as clarity 2 (neither is clarity 1) and is dropped by one of the most powerful mobs in the game.  Just admit you did it and go on.<P>Second, Does this cheapen the enchanter class?  As I understand the item, it is basically like the haste items the melee types covet.  So as long as Flowing Thought stacks with clarity (which I understand it does), it should make the enchanter even more desirable for the fastest mana regen possible.<P>Third, Perhaps you should stop making promises as you tend to have to break them...<P>Just my 2cp<BR>Nalenye dell'Arte<BR>Level 52 Enchanter of the Tribunal</B><P>I am being honest.  We DID add an item that give mana regeneration.<P>But we did not promise never to do so.  That's the part where there is some misunderstanding.<P>Flowing Thought IN NO WAY reduces the desire for, or the usefulness of, enchanters and their ability to cast Clarity spells.  The implication that it does (even if every character on every server had an item that gave Flowing Thought) is wrong.  I find it offensive that people are unwilling to actually examine the effects of this item before calling us liars and thieves and other less than polite names.<P>Flowing Thought stacks with all enchanter and bard mana regeneration spells and songs.  It won't stack with other items that regenerate mana.<P>It provides far, far less mana than Clarity.<P>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop.  So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this.<P>But, oddly, those of you that decided to be offended by this item made no effort to discover the truth of the matter first.  This might be because Flowing Thought is hard to get a hold of.  Being offended at the addition of an extremely rare item that, indeed, has no impact on you or your chosen class is pretty silly, now isn't it.<P>I'm sorry for the rant.  But being painted the villain, having our product and our reputations attacked without cause, is not something that I'll accept.<P><BR>happ7 wrote:<P><B>um i hate to tell ya but bards were the first to have the mana regen ability. honestly you should not consider clarity a chanter defining spell id say you are much more a illusion spell specialist if you are an enchanter</B><P>The timeline for the arrival of the abilities of a class are completely irrelevant to any determination as to whether those abilities are 'class defining' or not.  The fact that bards did, indeed, get the first ability to regenerate mana for others has nothing at all to do with whether or not that ability defines the enchanter class.<P>It IS a defining ability of the class, as it is for bards.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>The fact is Verant DID make the statement about only allowing bards and enchanters to do mana regen.  I remember it.  It was during the big fight that occurred after you nerfed the manastone.  Arguments were made about giving mana regen to wizards.  Verant said they would never do that as it defined the enchanter and bard.  I wish I had a copy.  oh well.<P>Quen</B><P>It sure would be nice if you did have a copy.  What you say that we said and what you are upset that you think we said don't match at all.<P>I wasn't here then, so I don't know either.  But what you say that we said was that Wizards were not going to get a mana regeneration ability, not that we would never give anyone such an ability.<P>And, well, in the long run it doesn't really matter how you or we twist what was said in the past.  All that really matters is what makes for a better game.<P>It would be a bad thing for us to introduce and item or a spell that would reduce the value of the Enchanter and Bardic abilities to give mana back to others.  This would be a good principle for us to follow, and I'm pretty sure that we have and will continue to follow that principle.<P>Flowing Thought does not reduce the value of the Enchanter or Bardic abilities to give mana back to others, for the reasons I've already stated.<P><BR>Sscaley wrote:<P><B> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Cazic Thule resides in the Plane of Fear. There is also at least one reward from completing the quests in Temple of Veeshan that results in a buckler with Flowing Thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Other than that, I applaud that you have taken steps to remedy the abysmal gap between the effect of melee and casters. But it needs some tuning, caster-haste drops from Cazic Thule and melee haste drops from a frenzied ghoul in lower guk, I'd call that a minor discrepancy in risk/reward...</B><P>Sorry, my error there.  I get Hate and Fear confused often enough as it is, I should be more careful when I post about them.<P>And I would guess that a quest in the Temple of Veeshan would be hard enough to warrant this as a reward...<P>I don't foresee any items with a greater 'caster haste' on them than this one.  There are plenty of ways for casters to regain mana faster than natural.  If we fill in the gap that you describe (and I think using the word 'abysmal' is an exaggeration), we'll use other methods than caster haste.  Keep in mind that mana is used for more than just damage by a caster, where as a melee only does damage with his haste items...<P><BR><B>You may not have said anything about never adding mana regen items into the game. But Gordon sure has, on many occasions, stated that mana regen items will never be added to the game as it would be too unbalancing. Here's a quote of his from 8/7/2000:<P>&gt;&gt; What is with meditation? I've noticed that it is taking forever to med with my skill stuck at 255 (or 252?). We continue to get more mana intensive spells and more mana past the level 50 mark, but I am stuck with the same med capability I will have at level 60 that I had at level 50. So is there a fix proposed for this? How about an item that casts... or has the effect of clarity? If you can do the effect of SoW for J Boots.... why not clarity for another type of item? Seems only fair since the value of SoW is not near what clarity is anymore.<P>The 'solution' for what you are mentioning is grouping with classes that have the ability to increase your regen rate. Bards and enchanters can do this for you, and can certainly increase it at a rate beyond what it was at level 50. <BR>Putting in other ways to increase mana regeneration would unbalance the game. The methods available to increase the rate of regeneration do so to the greatest extent that we've designed for the game. <P>- Gordon &lt;&lt;<P>Gotta love those news archives at Caster's Realm!! He followed up on it on 8/8/2000 restating the same thing. So, to conclude, yes Verant has stated on numerous occasions that there would NEVER be any mana regeneration items added to the game as it would be too unbalancing, and yes Verant has gone back on their word by adding this item with Flowing Thought, no matter how minimal the effect is on mana regen. Just thought you should know.<P>Miladian 'the rat saver' Dratsaver<BR>Xev</B><P>Ah, an actual quote.  Thanks.<P>Let me update that statement then.<P>We certainly don't anticipate adding any effects that would increase mana regeneration greater than that of Flowing Thought, though it most certainly might happen.<P>And even should it happen, it won't be done in any way that reduces the value of the classes that can currently increase mana regeneration.  And it will not be done as a method of increasing damage output for casters (other methods will be found, increasing mana regeneration does not target any specific weakness of a caster class, it improves all casting abilities of that class).<P>So, I guess I accept that we did once say that we would never do what we did.  But I'm so overwhelmed by the volume of concern over this one extremely weak effect that I'm shocked anyone would be upset over it.<P>And, you know what, if we need to do something to make the game better, it won't matter that we said we wouldn't do it in the past, we'll do it anyway.<P>Look at these rather recent changes and tell me that you think we shouldn't have made them because we might have said that we never would:<P>Removal of Hybrid experience penalties.<BR>Divine Aura line of spells prevents stunning.<BR>More Bind points.<P>And I'm sure that there are many others, those are just the three that were at the top of my head at the moment.<P>I see no point in continuing to argue about this.  The effect of Flowing Thought has no negative impact on any class, as it stacks with EVERY mana regenerating spell, and is a positive thing for all casters.<P><BR><B>Oh no! <BR>You said that the bard has a class defining ability to "play the mana song"! ... Ohh, you'll get flamed for this, i'm sure.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P>/hug Absor<P>Delphi Aegis, Paladin of Thudner<BR>47th Storm of Karana<BR>Quellious Server</B><P>Shouldn't you be playing a mana song instead of pestering me?<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>/em runs from all the bards in the world<BR>/em realizes that they are all faster than he is<BR>/sit<BR>/camp desktop<P>Alan<BR>

I make mistakes too, ya know.<P><BR>Electrae wrote:<P>[/b]I'm actually happy you all are willing to eat crow and go back and revisit those things you said would "never, ever, ever change in a million years".  Those changes have helped to keep me interested in EQ for nearly 2 years now.  Turbo-looting your own corpse is one too.<P>Now lets discuss putting mana regen on baked goods... /snicker[/b]<P>I've never seen a baked good that really needed mana that badly.<P>...<P><BR>I'll have to answer this next one within the post.  My comments are the ones that are not bolded.<P><B>Regarding the balancing of Melee vs Caster Haste items, to rebut your arguments:<P>1. Most caster spells are offensive in nature, at least for certain classes.</B><P>I agree.  For some classes a lot of spells are offensive.  But only for some casters.<P><B>2. If a class has some utility spells to burn mana on as well, how does that make a mana regen spell more unbalancing?</B><P>Because they could cast more of those spells than they can currently.  When looking for a solution for a specific problem, I want answers that only target that particular problem.  Since even without reading further I know where you're headed, let's state the perceived problem.  Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious.  This is the issue you're heading at.  And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it.  But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting.  To 'balance' that out, we'd have to increase the mana cost on all non-damage wizards spells.<P>I'd rather find a more specific solution.  And the bane spells are a good solution.<P><B>3. Casters are totally mana dependant, melees are not totally attack speed dependant (their HP/AC is as useful as their damage output in tank cases)</B><P>Not true.  Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else.  It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters.<P><B>4. So long as they stack w/ Bard/Chanter spells, they do not hurt the other classes.</B><P>Agreed.<P><B>5. Flowing Thought I is so miniscule it's ridiculous... imagine a melee getting a drop from Cazic that gave +0.5% haste...</B><P>Also agreed.<P><B>6. If you're worried that giving us a decent mana regen item would make us too powerful when we have C2 in a group, that can be worked around while still allowing us to have some solo mana regen.</B><P>When did we ever identify a need for casters to be more able to solo?  That's not a problem that we intend to address.  A lack of ability to solo is not an issue that needs to be addressed<P><B>Fact is, our mana regen is not sufficient for soloing in the high levels.  It is somewhat acceptable in groups w/ C2.  Give us a mana regen item effect that stops working when grouped or something.  Or give us mana regen items that don't stack (effect overwritten by chanter/bard) and have lower regen than a Clarity of appropriate level (say for a Fear item, give us 1/2 to 3/4 of C2).</B><P>Yes, we could create some sort of mana regeneration thing that only works when in groups.  In fact, we already have.  They are called bards and enchanters (and sometimes necromancers).  Hey, that kinda rhymes...<P>Again, increased mana regeneration is not a specific solution for any problem with any caster class that we've identified.  You haven't identified one here either, except an inability to solo (which is NOT an issue for many classes, since many casters can solo very well).<P><B>While I'm on this hotbutton Wizard topic - Wizards all over would really appreciate it if you would give some very straightforward yes/no type answers to the following questions, to help them decide whether to delete their account now or not, so stop beating around the bush...</B><P>I'm not beating around any bushes.  I'm telling you what I've told you before, until we're done balancing things there is nothing to tell.  But I'll give you several probably and maybe answers, if that helps.  Just remember that until all the class balance issues are done, NONE of this is a promise.<P><B>1 - Will our mana regen improve?</B><P>Probably not.<P><B>2 - Will our dmg/time improve?</B><P>Probably not.  Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving.<P><B>3 - Will our dmg/mana improve?</B><P>Bane spells.  Other than that, I don't know.<P><B>4 - Is our single most primary attribute now "Masters of Transportation" for balancing purposes?</B><P>Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future.  Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best.<P><B>5 - If the above isn't a clear yes, is Damage considered the top priority for us, or at least even with transport?</B><P>There is no 'top priority' for any class.  That's very misleading question.<P>Let's look at another class, to help keep perspective.<P>When talking about balancing, let's say, Magicians, yes, the first thing we'll probably look at will be their pets.  But will that be the 'priority' for balancing that class?  Who knows.  What we'll do is look at everything that the class can do, find the holes, and see if we want to fill them.  If we do, then yes, it's likely we'll again look at pets for filling those holes.<P>But you can't fill damage dealing holes with teleportation spells (in much the same way that you don't use a broad thing like mana regeneration to fill damage dealing holes).<P>For some reason people think that we are using the new teleportation spells to as a balancing tool, despite the fact that I've mentioned that these spells are going in as part of a long term plan unrelated to class balance.  Yes, we're including them in the package that is the wizard when we look at the class as a whole, but it's pretty silly to even suggest that we would use a teleportation spell to help wizards sustain their damage potential against high hit point NPCs...<P><B>Thanks,<BR>Cabot of Tholuxe Paells</B><P>Ok, that was of topic and I ranted a bit to boot.  Sorry about that.<P>Alan<P>

<hr>

Let me start here with an apology.  Someone pointed out that I was ranting a bit with my last post, and I was.  I shouldn't be doing that.  I apologize.<P><BR>Aarreran-CrimRen wrote:<P><B>Even though I agree with you that Flowing Thought isn't a bad thing, I though I'd point out that you were dead wrong when you said...<P>"It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this."<P>This is 100% incorrect.  An item was found with Flowing Thought I on a Giant in Great Divide who was apart of the ring quest.  Not only was an item with Flowing Thought I found on him, but an item with Flowing Thought II was found as well.</B><P>Yup, it seems to be the case that there are a few of the super high powered Flowing Thought II items available as well...<P>Flowing Thought II is, well, a little better than Flowing Thought.  It is still far less useful than Clarity (though it might rival Breeze...), and it still stacks with all of those spells, so it's still not much of an issue.  I would agree that an item better than that might be worthy of some concern, even if it does stack with Clarity.<P>And, as one reader has pointed out, there are in fact a few Clarity items in the game.<P>There are perhaps three items in the game that have the ability to cast Clarity II on their wielder (and only on the wielder).  When I say three, I mean three total, across all the servers.  These are, in fact, artifacts given out at two of the gatherings.  As far as I know, no more of these items will ever come into the game (though I suppose they might, it's not part of any current plan, that's for sure).<P>Were these items dropping off any NPC in the game, no matter how rare, I would be concerned.  But having three of them on all the servers should have absolutely no effect on the desire for enchanters or bards.<P><BR>This one is kinda long, so I'm going to respond within the post.  My comments are not bolded.<P><B>Greetings Absor,<P>I was reading over the post you made regarding wizards and I had a couple comments. Forgive me but I dont know the codes for this board.<P>Absor said: "Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. "<P>Mostly true. The wizard community feels it doesn't do enough damage, which is our primary focus. You mention that giving us 'massive' mana regeneration would too greatly benefit our other casting abilities and you would have to compensate.<P>Raising mana cost of non-dmg spells seems reasonable given what a wizard is, dmg caster, but mana regeneration may not entirely be the solution. At least in my opinion it isn't because of other problems wizards experience: ie agro. I dont have a useable skill\spell to lower my agro so typical raid fights entail casting and waiting for melees to rebuild up agro for me to cast again. THIS is why mana regeneration isnt entirely the solution for wizards. It may help, but in raid scenarios wont solve our problems. <P>To put it simply, wizards have 2 problems:<BR>1) Low dmg<BR>2) High agro doing that dmg.</B><P>Ok, I don't agree that wizards have problem #1.  Low damage needs to be qualified with a 'compared to', in other words 'Low damage when compared with what a rogue can do over the course of ten minutes of continuous fighting' or 'Low damage when compared to what any other class can do when dumping mana to finish something off'.  I'd say yes to one and no to the other.  The problem is that when you make comparisons like that it's all in the wording.<P>As for #2, well, no more aggro than anyone else that does the same damage in the same time frame.<P><B>Mana regen solves 1, but makes 2 worse.</B><P>If wizards could suddenly regenerate mana at ten times the rate they do now, they could control their aggro, and in fact aggro control would be the only limit on their damage potential.<P><B>Absor said: "Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters."<P>You should stress this more as it is the crux for grouping in EQ. Unfortunately, if any two of those become too strong the third isn't necessary. Velious fights last minutes and in that duration melee is the most effective damage source. In that context, healer-melee is the only dynamic that matters. Casters just are added to fill in the gaps if necessary. </B><P>Agreed.  And this is the place where the imbalance exists.  But people too easily forget that when you are comparing melee damage to caster damage, you have to keep in mind that there are two people doing that melee damage, the melee and the healer.  Take away the healer and your melee isn't going to live long enough to outdamage the caster in question.<P>But it is this situation where the imbalance exists, and it is these situations that we are aiming to fix.<P><B>Absor said: "Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving."<P>This, to me, doesn't make much sense. You mentioned above it was something being considered as a result of Wizard Talk. So how can we have 'great damage over time ratio'? Maybe explaining your qualifications for this would make it clear because in nearly all raiding fights melees do more than me.</B><P>Perhaps we're thinking of different uses of the term 'damage over time'.  A lot of the responses sent in were telling me that a melee character does a lot more damage over an hour than a wizard.  That's probably true at the upper levels.  But what about over the course of one minute?  If an NPC is fleeing, who finishes it off?  I was thinking of damage over time as it relates to most fights, not the rare long fight one can encounter in Velious, since I've covered that separately.<P><B>Absor said RE dmg/mana: "Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know."<P>I am not sure if you know this Absor, maybe ask Poe about it for further detail, but banes have a very very select group of creatures it can hit. About 10 in game roughly I would guess can be hit by both banes. Being effective on about 10 mobs doesn't make us more attractive. Just means you CoH in the wizards when you are getting ready for the final boss NPC. You also have to be level 60 to use them. </B><P>I know exactly how the bane spells work.  That 'select group of creatures' are exactly the creatures that take a long time to kill.  They are the creatures where the wizard has the greatest problems, and is the exact group of combats that we wanted to target.<P><B>Absor said: "Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best."<P>Cool.</B><P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><B>-Alch</B><P><BR>Ok, I've received a lot of comments that were much less... polite that Alch's comment.  I'm not going to repost them here.  But I'll address their concerns.<P>Too frequently folks get caught up in their current concern and don't step back to look at the big picture (I hate the phrase, someone get me a new one...).  If we do something that allows Wizards to crank out the damage on high hit point NPCs in any way other than bane spells, then the life expectancy of old world NPCs would be nil.  Improve the ratios of damage for Wizard spells to make them effective in the places where they feel weak now, and they destroy the old world with but a thought.<P>And I've noted that every (and I mean EVERY) person that has sent in some numbers showing how their wizard can't do the damage of a melee character sends in data comparing them to a rogue that has Ragebringer and is constantly backstabbing?  Is that a good comparison?  Keep in mind that the rogue is a three person damage dealer.  He needs a tank and someone to heal that tank to do his damage.  It might be fairer to add the damage dealt by all three of those people in a fight and divide by three, then compare...<P>The problem is that we're comparing melee and spell damage, and that's not a good comparison.  The two are very different.<P>Group desirability is the other thing that is most mentioned about Wizards.  They say they aren't.  I argue that if there were no complaints about your ability to deal damage, then there would be no problem getting groups...  But we also have plans that will dramatically reduce the problem with getting groups at higher levels.  I can't tell you about it until we get it working and until we're done with the balancing stuff, but it will make a wizard desirable to groups.<P>I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful...  It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing.  But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you.<P>This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless.<P>I received and e-mail from a friend this morning, saying many of the things that many of you have said.  He said something though, that struck a cord with me.  He mentioned something about Wizards in literature and how they are something to be feared.<P>They sure are.  But, well, Gandalf isn't a balanced character.  He can't exist in Norrath because then there would be a majority of these literature-based character class and few of the others.  Tolkien never needed to balance gameplay with Mithrandir in mind.  We do.<P>I know that what I've been saying sounds like I don't understand your point of view.  But my concern here is that you don't see mine.  There is more to balancing a class than just turning up the damage volume until everyone that plays that class is happy.  It's not that easy.<P>Keep sending in your comments, we'll read them all.  But for now I'm not going to make more comments on balance issues until we're done with our run through of all the classes.<P>Alan<BR>
