	<EM>Show PC Names</EM>: When on
  you will be able to see the names of Player Characters over their heads. <BR><BR><EM>Show NPC Names</EM>: When on you will be able to see the names of
  Non-Player Characters over their heads. <BR><BR><EM>Level of Detail</EM>: When on the detail levels for distant NPCs and PCs are
  reduced. This may improve performance on slower computers. <BR><BR><EM>Video Modes</EM>: This button will bring up another window. In this window
  you will be able to select your game resolution, refresh rate and video
  depth. It is important to note that these options are determined by your
  hardware and the drivers that run them. If you are seeing fewer options than
  you were expecting (such as higher resolutions), the first step to correcting
  this is to see if you can find newer drivers for your video card. <BR><BR><EM>Sky</EM> (3D Sky Off/Single Layer/Double Layer): Toggles the level of sky
  detail. In some cases you may want to alter this to improve performance. <BR><BR><EM>Fade Delay</EM>: Sets the amount of time, in seconds, that all windows wait
  after they have lost focus before they start to fade out. <BR><BR><EM>Fade Duration</EM>: Sets the amount of time, in seconds, that all windows
  take to fade in or out once it starts. <BR><BR><EM>Gamma Correction</EM>: Adjust screen brightness during gameplay. <BR><BR><EM>Clip Plane</EM>: The clipping plane determines how far you can see. In some
  cases reducing the clip plane can improve performance. <BR><BR><EM>Particle Density</EM> (Off/Low/Medium/High): Adjust number of particles
  displayed during spell effects. In some cases a lower setting may improve
  performance. <BR><BR><EM>Window Transparency</EM>: This sets the default transparency (alpha) level
  for all windows when they are active (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=isettings">Window Settings</A>  for more information on alpha settings). Changing this setting will alter the
  setting for all windows, even if you have set the window transparency values
  on specific windows. <BR><BR><EM>Fade to Transparency</EM>: This sets the default transparency (alpha) level
  for all window when they are faded active (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=isettings">Window Settings</A>  for more information on alpha settings). Changing this setting will alter the
  setting for all windows, even if you have set the fade to transparency values
  on specific windows.
