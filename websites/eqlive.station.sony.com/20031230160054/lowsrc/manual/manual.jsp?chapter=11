		<h1>
			11
			Experience Levels
		</h1>
	
	You always begin as a Level I character. As you gain experience in the world (mostly through combat), you progress to the next level. At higher experience levels, you can improve many types of skills and add to your spell casting abilities. <BR><BR>The best way to gain experience is to go out into the wilderness and kill creatures within your ability. You can also gain experience by completing quests. At first, you'll need to take on rats, snakes and other small animals. Once they become too easy for you and stop giving you experience, it's time to move on to something larger. <BR><BR>You can tell whether or not killing a certain creature will give you experience by the color of its text response when you Consider it. Stay away from creatures with red text (too hard). Look instead for light blue responses (easier kill) and blue ones (you'll have the upper hand). See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=beforeatt">Before You Attack</A>, for a list of the Consider response colors and what they mean.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			11.1
			Experience Bar
		</h2>
	
	You can keep track of your experience and view your current experience level in the Inventory screen. Even though your text display sends you a message each time you advance a level, it's a good idea to occasionally check your stats and level status. <BR><BR>The yellow/orange bar is the experience that you've gain toward the next level. The blue line just under the experience bar is a magnification of one of the five graduated lines (bubbles). This way, you can see more accurately your progress towards your next level. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are split among the group members according to their experience levels. The higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.<BR><BR>
