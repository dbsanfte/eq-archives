		<h2>
			25.1
			Need Help?
		</h2>
	
	There may be times during
  play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the
  form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention. During
  these times, your best bet is to turn to EverQuest's battalion of Game
  Masters. <BR><BR>GMs are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character
  if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Game
  Masters is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience
  without the hindrance of unforeseen problems.

	
		<h2>
			25.2
			Contacting a Game Master
		</h2>
	
	To seek help, type /petition
  [text], where [text] is a concise message explaining what you need help with.
  <BR><BR>Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, GMs may be swamped
  responding to other players' calls. Your petition is received and noted as
  soon as you send it, and a GM will help you as soon as he or she can. This
  may take a few moments, so please be patient. Do not send repeated petitions,
  this will actually move you back to the end of the queue. <BR><BR>When you are contacted, explain your situation. The GM will ask for more
  information if necessary. You can help the GM by conducting yourself in a
  calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant
  details. Be patient and your problems will be solved if they fall within the
  rules of the game.

	
		<h2>
			25.3
			Special Game Master Related Commands
		</h2>
	
	<EM>/petition</EM>: Speak to a
  Game Master.<BR><EM>/who gm all</EM>: View list of all Game Masters who are currently in the
  game.

	
		<h2>
			25.4
			The /report Command
		</h2>
	
	The /report command instructs
  your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest
  servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any
  text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the
  EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of
  this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is
  &quot;/report CharacterName&quot;, however the true function of the command
  sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window. <BR><BR>To properly use this command, use <STRONG><EM>Shift-PgUp</EM></STRONG> to scroll until
  the suspect text is in the chat window, then type &quot;/report
  CharacterName&quot;. You should then file a &quot;/petition&quot; (see
  Contacting a <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=supgm">Game
  Master</A>), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief
  explanation of what the /report is meant to show.
