	<h2>Mithaniel's Mirth Raid and Recruiting Event</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Erollisi Marr<br>
	12/26/2002 11:56 am<br>
	<P>Shmueena Thistledown, guild leader of Mithaniel's Mirth on Erollisi Marr announces a guild sponsored raid and recruitment event.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mithaniel's Mirth, a Guild on Erollisi Marr is holding a Raid and Recruiting Event!</P>
<P>Where: Runnyeye Citadel<BR>When: December 28th @ 8pm EST<BR>Who: Members and Guests in the 10 - 25 range</P>
<P>Mithaniel's Mirth is an EverQuest Guild on Erollisi Marr dedicated to the rediscovery of the Lost Age through Guild Events, Role-playing, and a sincere zest for all that Norrath (and Luclin too) has to offer. </P>
<P>If you are looking for a good group of people to spend time with when you are online, feel free to send any of our members a /tell while in game. You can see if any of us are on my using the command "/who all Mithaniel" (without the quotes). </P>
<P>If you have a character or friends that you would like to bring to the event let us know as soon as you can. Several Elders will be on hand for Buffs and CRs/Rezs (not that we will need them!). </P>
<P>Those that are of Good or Neutral alignment (or have the faction) should bind in RiverVale. Others can be bound near the Gypsie camp in Northern Karana (any other place is fine as well) and will be escorted through the Gorge of King Xorbb when needed. This is a fairly safe place, but lingering at lower levels is not advised.</P>
