			Opening and Closing Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	All windows in the interface can
  be closed, with the exception of the Window Selector which is always open. <BR><BR>There are several ways to close windows. Most windows can be toggled on and
  off by clicking the corresponding button on the Window Selector. Any window
  that is not represented on the Window Selector can be closed by clicking the
  X on the right side of the title bar. Also, most windows can be closed using
  the right-click menus, which we'll explain later. <BR><BR>The <STRONG><EM>Escape</EM></STRONG> key will also close most windows (will close the
  window that is active). <BR><BR>A few windows, such as the Target Window, can only be turned on and off using
  keystrokes. Here is a list of the keystrokes for all windows. <BR><BR><STRONG>ALT - B</STRONG>: Buff/Spell Effects Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - P</STRONG>: Party (Group) Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - S</STRONG>: Spells Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - H</STRONG>: Hotbox Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - T</STRONG>: Target Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - Y</STRONG>: Self-Status Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - M</STRONG>: Menu (Actions) Window
