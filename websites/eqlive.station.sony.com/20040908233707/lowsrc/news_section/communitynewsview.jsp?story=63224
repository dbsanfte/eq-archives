	<h2>The Legendary Storytellers Recruiting on Stromm</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	08/20/2004 8:42 am<br>
	Here ye, here ye! 
<P>The PvP roleplaying guild, "The Legendary Storytellers" is now in Phase A for recruiting new members on the Stromm Server. We are looking for any race and class between the levels of 1-10 only. Higher levels will be considered in the future, but for now we only want those between levels 1 and 10. 
<P>Please go to our website at: <A href="http://roleplayersofnorrath.tripod.com/">http://roleplayersofnorrath.tripod.com</A> to read about our rules and fill out a character form for the character you wish to have tagged. Joining our guild is an easy process. Just follow these simple steps: 
<P>1) Read our Guild Fundamentals (rules) and see if this is the right, RP guild for you. 
<P>2) Visit our message board to see our calendar full of RP Sessions throughout the week. It is in Pacific Standard Time, so compare the calendar to your real life schedule and choose a race that would work best for you. This will help get you in the same spots as other roleplayers, so that you have someone to roleplay with. 
<P>3) Create a new character, untwinked, and create a name that is proper for roleplaying. Your character will not be approved if you submit a name such as "Purrtiekitty", "Scalylizzy", "Superwizard", or anything like that. Go to our message board for ideas on how to choose a good name for your character, if you need help. 
<P>4) Fill out the character form on our website. Remember to fill out the backstory section also. This can be as simple or as detailed as you like, but it must have something. Also be sure to select the days and times you are able to be tagged and include an email, so that I can respond with a possible tagging appointment for you. 
<P>5) Your character must be Player Kill (PK) activated and have a "red" name. This is done by doing the simple quest at the Priest of Discord, located in most major cities. You must be "red" before you can get tagged; no exceptions. 
<P>6) Remember to email me with any questions. That's it! It's really simple. You can visit our message board at <A href="http://kurzann.proboards23.com/">http://kurzann.proboards23.com</A> and read the wonderful stories that we have up so far by the characters who have been with us. My email can be found on either site, if you have any questions for me. 
<P>We look forward to hearing from you, and remember to have fun out there! 
<P>Kurzann <BR>"Guild Leader"</P><br>
