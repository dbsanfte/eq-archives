<h1>Where to volunteer</h1>
	GldDrag wrote:<P><B>i would like to become a volunteer guide for everquest, but can't seem to find where it is that i need to send the application to. i talked to a GM on drinal last night and he said that the option is still open and that it is on here somewhere, i guess i just can't find where it is.<BR>Could someone please enlighten me?</B><P>The application is <A HREF="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/" TARGET=_blank>HERE</A>.<P>When filling out the application, remember we don't really expect you to know everything, just a lot of things.  And it is important to make sure you communicate your answers clearly, since being able to communicate is one of the most important skills a guide needs.<P>Also, as a hint, it might be best to write up your answers in a word processor of some sort first, then paste them into the form.  This will prevent you from suddenly losing your work if something bad happens.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>I applied to be a guide a couple of times. I didn't know the answers to some of the questions, so I left them blank. The application process took quite some time, as I wanted to be particularly creative with regards to my origins (think I did a really good job too). I finished the application, and heard nothing for a week or so. I then got a reply that my application was incomplete, and that I should reapply. This also happened to a friend of mine. I may haved missed something that required all fields be filled in, maybe it shold be more explicit. I also noticed that guide applications are partially rated on spelling; how are overseas applicants taken into account? I am in Australia, and (similar to Great Britain, and Canada for that matter) the spelling of many words is not quite same here as it is in the USA (e.g. color = colour). I was (and still am) reasonably keen to become a guide, as I like helping people and there seems to be a distinct lack of guides on during Australian peak times (at least on my server). Sorry for the rant.<P>Michael</B><P>Yes, you do need to at least fill out all the sections of the application.  Leaving blanks isn't a good idea.<P>As for spelling, we're aware of the fact that English isn't exclusive to our little part of the world, and you won't be marked off for using colour instead of color.  However, if you us culor or cular or something like that then you might have a problem.<P>Remember, communication is a large part of what guides do.  Being understood is important.<P>So please, try again and if you don't know something, just say that on the application.  But fill in all the blanks.  We appreciate your desire to help.<P>Alan<BR>

SyngeD wrote:<P><B>One thing that I experienced while filling out my guide application was the fact that I hadn't updated the e-mail address in my everquest account. I believe I was asked for my e-mail address in the application and had provided my current one (at the time). Time passed and I could not understand what the problem was (I know I had answered all questions clearly and correctly). I contacted someone at Verant and was informed that I had been accepted but that I never responded to the offer and so they thought I had changed my mind. It turns out that the offer was sent to my old (non-functioning) e-mail address which was listed in my Everquest Account information instead of the e-mail address I submitted in the application. Thankfully, they corrected my information and I was accepted into the great Guide community.<BR>ALWAYS keep your personal Information Up-to-date!</B><P>Thanks for bringing that up.<P>It is indeed very important to keep your email and other information up to date.  If we need to contact you for any reason, we'll most likely be doing so through the email address you have on account.  This is important also for dealing with these forums.  I often respond to folks in person, and the forms here insert the email address you have on file with us.  If it's wrong and you don't change it in the form, I won't be able to contact you.  Also, we issue account warnings and such to the email on account.<P>Please try to keep your contact information up to date.<P><BR>Neldarae wrote:<P><B>I'm a bit irritated over the spelling requirement myself (since I didn't know about it BEFORE submitting an app) since one of the questions asked me to describe my favorite character's life IN HIS OWN WORDS. Not knowing that my spelling must be perfect, I chose to have my "dum ogur" talk about his life. REJECT</B><P>Not at all.  If you are asked to speak in the voice of your character, we'll be able to tell a spelling error from a dialect.  As long as you didn't fill out the whole form in Ogre speak there won't be a problem.<P>And we're not looking for perfect spelling, good spelling is just fine.<P><BR>Magalore wrote:<P><B>I have been thinking alot about becoming a guide but have held back due to questions that I do not know the answer to.<P>1&gt;a) Are you able to run around the country side killing snakes etc. or is it frowned upon?<P>1&gt;b) Assuming it's a yes to the above and it's not frowned upon do you gain experience from it?<P>If question b has the response yes.<P>1&gt;c) Do you level at the appropriate time or is your level frozen until your no longer a guide?<P>2&gt; What happens to the guild you are in are all ties severed, or are they frozen to be resumed after you are no longer a guide?<P>3&gt; When asked where something or someone is are you supposed to a) Take them to it. b) Point them in the general direction c) Tell them to go to an associated site like Allakhazam or EQAtlas?<P>4&gt; If a problem arrises are you expected to know how to fix it, tell them to go to the technical help forum, or do you escalate the call to you guys?<P>5&gt; Do you get Superhuman powers (Elf, dwarf, as appropriate) to allow you to fly or play chess with Vox, or maybe twister with the sleeper?</B><P>Guide characters are not play characters.  New characters are created for use by the guides, their levels are assigned, and guides are not allowed to 'play' with those characters.  Being a guide does not affect your regular characters.  In fact, you are not allowed to guide on a server that you play on.  We don't want anyone to be put in a situation that might create a personal conflict, it's not fair to the players or the guides.<P>As for #3, it really depends on the question.  Guides and GMs are not there to help people find quests or help them decide which NPCs to fight for the best experience.  They are there to help people with game-related problems.<P>If a problem comes up that a guide doesn't know the answer to, he can always consult his peers or the GMs.  If it's a tech problem it's probably better for the player to use our technical help than the guides and GMs.  And the guides aren't responsible or really in a position to direct game content, so those sorts of things should be posted here.  Though we certainly want our guides to be active in sending their ideas in as well.  And there are some issues that a guide will have to escalate to a GM, though exactly what those issues are I'm not up to date on, and they are certainly situational.<P>Vox cheats at chess, so I don't suggest trying that.  She just eats her opponents and then moves all the pieces until she has him in check.<P>Guides have some powers that regular players do not have, but I'm not going to list them.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>
