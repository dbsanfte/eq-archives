<h2>Game Update, April 8 2003</h2>
<P>April 8, 2003&nbsp; 3:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P>** So You Want to Design Games? ** </P>
<P>The EverQuest team is expanding and we currently have openings for experienced game designers.&nbsp; If you have professional game design experience, at least one level 60+ character and regularly play EverQuest, then we'd love to see your resume.&nbsp; Please go to <A href="http://soe.sony.com/corp/employment.jsp">http://soe.sony.com/corp/employment.jsp</A> and submit your resume online.&nbsp; Please include information about your current characters and your level of knowledge concerning EverQuest.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
<P>- The EverQuest Team</P>
<P><BR>** New Plane of Hate **</P>
<P>The new Plane of Hate is now available on Stormhammer.&nbsp; Enjoy!</P>
<P><BR>** Mitigation Change **</P>
<P>We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather classes, and have made changes as appropriate.&nbsp; For the most part, this change is a reasonable improvement to the ability of monks to absorb damage.&nbsp; At some point in the future we may re-examine the mitigation abilities of chain and plate classes.&nbsp; At this time, and with this final round of changes to cloth and leather classes, we believe that something very close to the appropriate balance is in place.</P>
<P><BR>** Pathing Update **</P>
<P>The first part of our work to update the pathing system for EverQuest is complete.&nbsp; NPC and pet pathing should be much improved.</P>
<P><BR>** Charm Changes **</P>
<P>- Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for the healer.<BR>- Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC killed.&nbsp; This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience they always have.<BR>- Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.</P>
<P><BR>** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **</P>
<P>This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at the EverQuest front end (from the time you log in until you get into the game).&nbsp; With this addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in a window from the moment they click on the EverQuest icon to the moment they log out.</P>
<P>In order to switch to windowed mode on the front end, just hit Alt-Enter.&nbsp; Note that there are no settings in the eqclint.ini file for this, you just have to hit Alt-Enter.</P>
<P>Use Alt-R to release the mouse from the EverQuest window (note that once in the game, you need to use Alt-Shift-R to release the mouse).</P>
<P>And, obviously, Alt-Tab will switch between open programs.</P>
<P>We have also added a Tech button that will take you to our Tech Chat.&nbsp; This only works in windowed mode, as it opens up a new window to display the chat.</P>
<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
<P>- Stoicism now follows the same restrictions as Torpor.<BR>- Trickster's Augmentation and Boon of the Garou can now be cast by characters on horseback.<BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing spells with levitation effects to lose levitation if cast over a spell that also had a levitation effect.<BR>- Bards now receive their first level song at creation.<BR>- Changed the spelling of "Corpal Empathy" to "Corporeal Empathy".<BR>- Changed the hit by message for Torrent of Fatigue recourse to "Your vitality grows."<BR>- Changed the wear off message for Song of Sustenance to "Your hunger returns."<BR>- Adjusted the shaman spell Disinfecting Aura to be in line with Pure Blood.<BR>- The Necromancer line of heal-over-time spells should no longer overwrite Transon's Phantasmal Protection.<BR>- Augment now overwrites Augmentation.<BR>- Brell's Stalwart Shield now has a casting time of 4 seconds.<BR>- Spiritual Vigor now has a casting time of 5 seconds.<BR>- Resurrection no longer gives the "Your strength returns" message two times when the negative effects wear off.<BR>- Fixed a bug that would cause other players to see a character with default face/hair for their race when they turned off an illusion.<BR>- Fixed bug that could cause beards to fail to reappear when an illusion wears off.&nbsp; This may also fix some other appearance bugs as well.</P>
<P><BR>** Illusions/Shape Change **</P>
<P>We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with respect to faction.&nbsp; The new system is a lot easier to understand than the old one, so we'll just explain the new one.&nbsp; When changed into the form of a playable race, characters are treated as if they were a member of that race.&nbsp; When changed into a non-playable race, characters retain their own racial factions.</P>
<P><BR>** PvP **</P>
<P>- If a player is moving when using archery against a PvP target, they have a reduced chance to hit their target.<BR>- Archery in Player vs. Player combat in now reduced to 66% damage.<BR>- Direct Damage spells in Player vs. Player combat can only do up to 75% damage of the target's maximum hit points in a single hit.&nbsp; This modification is done before resists are taken into account.&nbsp; For example, if a player has 1000 hit points when fully healed, no single direct damage spell will do more than 750 damage to him in a single hit.</P>
<P><BR>** Alternate Advancement **</P>
<P>- Alternate Advancement abilities that grant Stamina gains should now update the character's hit points automatically when trained.<BR>- Dire Charm isno longer "used" when trying to affect an NPC under the power of a Dictate spell.&nbsp; It will not work, and the power is not expended.</P>
<P><BR>** Interface **</P>
<P>- Using the "/book" command with no page argument now closes the spellbook if it's already open.<BR>- Added a "Dump" button to Guild Management window.&nbsp; Pressing it creates a text file in the EQ directory containing a comma-delimited text dump of the Guild Management window.&nbsp; The file name will be the guild name with _ instead of spaces, so a guild named "Legacy of Ykesha" would be a file called Legacy_of_Ykesha.txt.<BR>- Cross-server tells are now filtered under the "tells" filter like same-server tells, and in the same colors.<BR>- Music Player volume no longer decreases when zoning.<BR>- The Journal window and Journal Categories window now close when hitting Escape.<BR>- The Map window no longer pops up after zoning if you used Escape to close it in the previous zone.<BR>- Hot button names are once again restricted to eight characters.&nbsp; Being able to make them longer was a bug, and was causing issues with displaying more than eight characters.<BR>- The scrollbar for the Notes window should now update properly when the window is resized.<BR>- Added multi-select capability to the Friends List, Music, Journal NPC, Journal Text and Journal Category windows.&nbsp; Shift-click selects groups of items, Control-Click selects individual items.<BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing the Journal window to lose all information since the last save when logging was turned off.<BR>- Confirmation Dialog window now remembers its position.<BR>- The third person camera view #3 no longer resets when zoning or using the armor tinting feature.<BR>- Fixed an uncommon crash caused by the Music Player window.<BR>- The LFG button in the Group window now toggles the LFG window.<BR>- Fixed a bug that prevented the attack button from working properly when a Centi Warspear was equipped.<BR>- The dialog box for confirmation of a change in video modes now remains open for 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds.<BR>- Added a "Show Offline" button to the Guild Management window.&nbsp; This determines whether or not you want to show offline people in the window, and the setting is remembered when you log out.<BR>- If you sort by anything other than Name in the Guild Management window, the window will sub-sort your list by name.<BR>- Changed the promote button in the Guild Management window to only be enabled when eligible guild member is targeted (not just selected in window).<BR>- Fixed a problem that caused a few people to have the spell particle density revert to default off when they logged off.<BR>-Fixed the Map window to remove a method of avoiding the map restrictions in certain zones. <BR>- Added /getguildmotd.&nbsp; This command allows you to see your guild message of the day at any time.<BR>- /guildmotd now sets or clears the guild message of the day.&nbsp; If used with no text, it clears the existing message of the day.&nbsp; Only leaders and officers can use this command<BR>- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when pressing the U key while in explore mode.<BR>- When under the effects of invisibility, a character that hides and then moves and breaks their hide also breaks their invisibility.&nbsp; The invisibility icon will now disappear under this circumstance so that the player knows he is no longer invisible.<BR>- Closing the AA window no longer causes the resurrection notification box to disappear.<BR>- Updated the category lists in the Bazaar window to be alphabetical.<BR>- Characters will no longer be prevented from being a trader if you quickly click on Begin/End Trader.<BR>- Fixed a bug with the LFG tool that may have been causing some people to crash when zoning.<BR>- New colors should no longer be moving from the armor dye column to the item tint column when a character is saved.<BR>- Hand to hand weapons now "greys out" the melee attack button.<BR>- For those that type quickly, typing %t1 now has the same effect as typing %t 1.<BR>- Fixed a bug that prevented you from purchasing a lore item if you have just purchased that item and destroyed it.<BR>- Setting loot split color now changes the text color when others loot and autosplit, as well as when the player loots.<BR>- Language skills now update in the skills window immediately, and the message given upon skill up includes the name of the language improved.<BR>- Default chat channels should now be saved properly.</P>
<P><BR>** NPCs **</P>
<P>- Corrected an issue with trainers that sometimes caused them to kick a character out of the game.<BR>- Tin Soldiers no longer give stun immune messages to color flux when they are already stunned.<BR>- Sollari Bekines now asks for two vials of Gnoll blood instead of one.&nbsp; She has always wanted two for her quest.<BR>- Corrected some text errors for Avir Sterbla.<BR>- Fixed a spelling error in Paralin Notion's text.&nbsp; "Other" now reads "Others".<BR>- Corrected a spelling error in the Stonefist Clansman's death text.

<P><BR>** Items **</P>
<P>- Added a Brass Instrument modifier to the Horn of Shadows.<BR>- Made Saltwater Seaweed stackable.<BR>- Due to a drop table error, all existing instances of the Market Signet have been changed to have no stats.&nbsp; If you received one legitimately through the quest, you can give the old item to Aid Grimel for a new one with all the correct stats.&nbsp; If you do not meet the requirements, Aid Grimel will not reimburse you.<BR>- Changed the spelling from Mythril to Mithril on Mithril Knuckles and Mithril Edged Skull Splitter.<BR>- Removed the ability to be used in the secondary slot from Club of the Secretive.&nbsp; This is a Cleric, Druid, Shaman only item.<BR>- Removed Bards from being able to equip a Combine Acrylia Halberd and Combine Acrylia Two Handed Sword.&nbsp; These weapons are two-handed slash.<BR>- The name of the Holy Order of Mithanial has been correctly spelled.<BR>- Darksight Dagger is no longer listed as being equipable in the secondary hand.
