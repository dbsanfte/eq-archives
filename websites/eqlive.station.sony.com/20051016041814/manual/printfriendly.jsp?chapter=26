			Appendix A - Various Commands and Emotes
		</h1>
	
	Below is a list of more /commands
  available within game. You can get a complete list of all /commands available
  to you in game by typing /help [type] where &quot;type&quot; is
  &quot;guild&quot;, &quot;emotes&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;. Type /help
  alone to return usage instructions. <BR><BR>When you see [ ] below, the text within those brackets are parameters for the
  command being described. They are the options that you can choose when using
  that command. They will be separated by commas when there is more than one.
  Typing the command and then parameter (without the brackets) will give you
  the result described. If you see [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>] then the command is a
  toggle. That means that you do not need to type on or off, just typing the
  command will change the state of the toggle. So if you are currently
  Anonymous and you type /anon, the command will toggle the state of your
  anonymous flag to OFF (since it was ON before). <BR><BR>[<EM>target</EM>] indicates that you must have a character targeted for the
  command to work. <BR><BR>Also, where you see &lt; &gt;, the information within the brackets is not a
  specific parameter, but is a kind of text that you will need to type. For
  example if you see &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;, then you will need to type
  in a character name as the parameter for the command, without the brackets.
  If it just says &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;, then the nature of the text is up to you
  to determine (though the brackets are not needed).

	
		<h2>
			26.1
			Appendix A - Commands List
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>/anon</STRONG> or <STRONG>/a [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG>  - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, preventing other players from
  seeing your class, level, and current location. <BR><BR><STRONG>/afk [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>] &lt;text&gt;</STRONG> - When activated, all private tells
  sent to the user will auto-respond with the following text, &quot;You told
  &lt;players name&gt;, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away from keyboard) right
  now.'&quot;. If you add &lt;text&gt; then that text will replace the default
  AFK message. <BR><BR><STRONG>/assist [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - if you
  target a character that is within 200', the /assist command will
  automatically target for you whoever that character has targeted at the
  moment- this can be very useful in heavy combat. To be most effective, it is
  best to set this as a Social (see IV.F above) <BR><BR><STRONG>/assist [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the autoattack function associated
  with the /assist function. The default of ON turns on your autoattack when
  you use /assist. If you type /assist off then autoattack will not start when
  you use /assist. This is one case where you <STRONG>must</STRONG> use the parameters on
  and off for this to work. <BR><BR><STRONG>/attack [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles in and out of attack mode. This will
  put you in attack mode even if nothing is targeted. Be careful not to use
  this when near NPC's that you have targeted. By default, this is set to the
  &quot;a&quot; key. Care should also be taken when you are near an NPC that
  you have targeted not to hit the &quot;a&quot; key, as this may cause you to
  attack the NPC. <BR><BR><STRONG>/auction &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows users to send auction messages
  throughout the current zone. Please use this channel only for auctions. <BR><BR><STRONG>/autojoin &lt;<EM>channel-list</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Saves the channels listed and
  automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in. This information
  is saved in your eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section as ChannelAutoJoin=&lt;channel-list&gt;.
  See the section in this manual about Chat Channels for more information. <BR><BR><STRONG>/autosplit [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - automatically splits any loot you get
  with the rest of your party. Each member must do this to split all loot. <BR><BR><STRONG>/book [<EM>1-50</EM>]</STRONG> - Opens your spell book to the specified page. <BR><BR><STRONG>/bug</STRONG> or <STRONG>/b</STRONG> - takes you to a bug-reporting screen. <BR><BR><STRONG>/camp [<EM>desktop/server</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows the player to exit to the
  server select screen or desktop depending on what is specified. You can use
  just /camp by itself as well. You must be sitting in order for this command
  to work. If attacked while camping out, the /camp command will be cancelled,
  thus preventing exit from the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>/cast [<EM>1-8</EM>]</STRONG> - causes your character to cast the spell in the
  specified memorization slot. <BR><BR><STRONG>/channel [<EM>gsay/ooc/shout/guild/auction</EM>]</STRONG> - toggles the chat

  to drag your corpse /consider or /con - gives vital statistics of a targeted
  PC or NPC. <BR><BR><STRONG>/corpse [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - will summon the target's corpse if it is
  within a 50' radius of the character. You can either target the character or
  the character's corpse. This will only work if the targeted character has
  used the /consent command on the character trying to use the /corpse command.
  If no target is selected when the /corpse command is used, it will summon
  your own character's corpse if it is within 50' of the character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/decline</STRONG> - Declines a duel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/disband [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows a character to disband from a group
  if he/she has themselves targeted. This command also allows the group leader
  to disband a targeted member of the group if they are in the same zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/dismount</STRONG> (Luclin Only) - This command allows your character to
  dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so
  using the bridle. There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you
  to mount a horse. <BR><BR><STRONG>/doability [<EM>1-6|7-10</EM>]</STRONG> - 1-6 performs the associated ability
  from the &quot;abilities&quot; page, 7-10 perform the associated combat
  skill. <BR><BR><STRONG>/duel</STRONG> or <STRONG>/d</STRONG> - challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept,
  they have to type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one
  combatant &quot;dies&quot; (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone. Until
  the duel is resolved, the two combatants can't be affected by spells from PCs
  not in the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/dynamiclights [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - When on, this command enables players
  to see specially rendered lighting. This command is most useful when the

  this command to off if you notice low frame rate. <BR><BR><STRONG>/em &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>: &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - emotes the

  players unless to escape from a death bind loop. <BR><BR><STRONG>/facepick</STRONG> (Luclin Only) - this command brings up an interface that
  allows you to choose a new face for your character using the new models for
  Shadows of Luclin. You must have the Luclin character model enabled for the
  race of the characters whose face you are trying to change. Currently this
  command can be used more than once on the same character. In the future it
  will be a once per character command. <BR><BR><STRONG>/fastdrop [<EM>ON/OFF/NEVER</EM>]</STRONG> - Disables or enables the ability to
  drop items on the ground without a confirmation box. The recommended setting
  for this option is the same as the default setting, which is /fastdrop off.
  If set to never, you will never be able to drop any items on the ground. If
  set to on, no confirmation box will come up before dropping the item on the
  ground. Caution is advised as many NPC's (Non player characters such as
  merchants) do pick up items dropped on the ground by players. <BR><BR><STRONG>/feedback</STRONG> - takes you to the feedback/comments screen. <BR><BR><STRONG>/filter [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the profanity filter on and off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/follow [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - When this command is used while targeting

  from your friends list. /friend &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; will add the player
  to your list, and /friend &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; again, for the same
  character, will remove him/her. /friend by itself will list the players in
  your friends list. A /who friend will let you know if anyone on your friends
  list is in the zone you are in, and a /who all friend will let you know if
  anyone on your friends list is on the server you are on. Your friends list
  can only contain 30 names per character. And be aware that in order to remove
  someone from the list, you must type their name precisely. <BR><BR><STRONG>/gems</STRONG> - This command allows a player to play the game Gems. <BR><BR><STRONG>/gsay &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>/g &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - text is

  commands available in area specified. <BR><BR><STRONG>/hidecorpses [<EM>all/none/allbutgroup</EM>]</STRONG> - This command allows the
  player to choose to not see other player's corpses in-game. This allows for
  less lag in situations where there are many corpses around. Keep in mind that
  the <EM>all</EM> and the <EM>allbutgroup</EM> options will hide NPC corpses. Your
  own corpse is never hidden. The default is <EM>none.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>/ignore &lt;<EM>player name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Will block all text from that
  character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/inspect [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles on and off your ability to inspect

  same result by right clicking on a corpse. <BR><BR><STRONG>/lootnodrop [<EM>ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/NEVER</EM>]</STRONG> - This command is used to
  specify how you loot no drop items on corpses. Always is default and will
  cause a prompt box to always be shown when looting no drop items. Set to
  sometimes so only items not usable by your character will show a prompt box.
  When you have this set to never, you will never get a confirmation box to see
  if you want to loot or not. <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol</STRONG> - Allows a player to control sound devices such as cdaudio
  or mp3s to play when in-game. This command will be further developed in the
  future to be more user friendly. Until that point, the following are some

  commands, use the following to open up communications: <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol open cdaudio</STRONG> - opens communications. <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol play cdaudio</STRONG> - To play <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol pause cdaudio</STRONG> - To pause <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol stop cdaudio</STRONG> - To stop <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol step cdaudio</STRONG> - To skip forward <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol back cdaudio</STRONG> - To skip back <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol eject cdaudio</STRONG> - To eject the CD <BR><BR><EM>Note: Though ejecting itself should not cause any gameplay problems,
  putting in a new disk may.</EM> <BR><BR>If you have AutoPlay enabled on your computer (which is windows default), it
  may start your CDaudio program and possibly, switch out of EverQuest, causing
  EverQuest to likely crash, or at the least may cause a phantom cursor to
  appear. <BR><BR>If you have AutoPlay disabled, putting in a disk should not cause any
  problems. <BR><BR><STRONG>/me</STRONG> - Same as <STRONG>/em</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG>/mousespeed [<EM>0-3</EM>]</STRONG> - Changes the mouse travel speed across the
  monitor. 3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse
  moves). Don't set this above 3. Your mouse will move too quickly and you will
  probably not be able to play. <BR><BR><STRONG>/msg</STRONG> - This is the same as using <STRONG>/Tell</STRONG>. <BR><BR><STRONG>/note &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows the player to write notes when
  in-game to be referenced later out of game. This creates a notes.txt file of
  the text. Each line of text sent using /note is appended to the end of this
  file. There is a maximum number of 455 characters when creating a note. <BR><BR><STRONG>/ooc &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - allows you to say something as yourself,
  not as your character, heard throughout the zone. Please only use this
  channel for out of character speech, and please try to limit your out of
  character speech to this channel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/Pet Commands</STRONG> - See <A HREF="http://eqlive-new-test.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?id=47075">Pet
  Commands</A>. <BR><BR><STRONG>/petition &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Used to request assistance from a GM.
  The more detailed &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt; is, the quicker the assistance can be
  rendered. To prevent 'spamming' of the petition queue, each character can
  only send in one petition (for as long as that petition is in the queue). <BR><BR><STRONG>/played</STRONG> - Returns the birth date and hours played for the current
  character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/quit</STRONG> - Immediately exits the game. However, when you exit in this
  manner, your character has not 'camped out' in the proper fashion, and he or
  she will remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit.
  Your character will be under the control of the server, and may very well die
  while you are not there to tell it what to do. So only use this command when
  you are in a rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you
  can't get out of with the standard sit and camp method. The risk you take
  when using this shortcut to exit the game is all yours. <BR><BR><STRONG>/random [<EM>x, x y</EM>]</STRONG> - /random x generates a random number between
  0 and x. /random x y will generate a random number between x and y. This can
  be used to decide things randomly, for instance, who gets a recently acquired
  treasure. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reply &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - If a &quot;/tell&quot; is received, the
  user may respond by using this command. /reply will reply to the very last
  person to send you a /tell. The default shortcut for this function is the <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG>  key. <BR><BR><STRONG>/report &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows a player to report the
  text that is currently being displayed in the chat window. If you are
  reporting harassment, bad language, threats, or other actions by another
  player, use their character name for the &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; in the
  report. If you are reporting falling for 10,000 points damage, or other
  irregularities that affect your character, then use your character's name.
  You should then use /petition and let a GM know that you have used /report so
  that they will know to look for your reported text. To prevent 'spamming',
  you can only send one report at a time. You can do another /report only after
  zoning. Please make sure to have the text you want to report in the chat
  window when you use this command, /report will only send the bottom ten lines
  of text that are actually shown in your chat window. Use <STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Up</EM></STRONG>  and <STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Down</EM></STRONG> to move through your chat text until you
  see the text you want to report. <BR><BR><STRONG>/resetwindows</STRONG> - Used to reset to default the locations on-screen for
  the different Graphical User Interface (GUI) boxes. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reverb [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the reverb (echo) sounds on or off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reversesound</STRONG> - This command will reverse the left and right channel
  for your sound. <BR><BR><STRONG>/roleplay [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Hides your race, class, and location while
  still displaying your guild tag, and turns your name purple to indicate that
  you prefer to remain &quot;in-character&quot;. <BR><BR><STRONG>/serverfilter [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows player to turn off or on packet
  messages from other players, allowing for less lag in raid situations. <BR><BR><STRONG>/shout &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Shouted text is seen across entire zone.
  Shout is an 'in-character' channel, so please keep your speech in this
  channel in character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/shownames [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - turns on or off visible names above PC's
  and NPC's heads. <BR><BR><STRONG>/showspelleffects [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles spell effects (visuals) on
  or off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/sit [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Causes your character to sit or stand. <BR><BR><STRONG>/split # # # #</STRONG> - splits a defined amount of money with your group
  members in the same zone: platinum, gold, silver, &amp; copper
  respectively...i.e. /split 4 4 2 0 splits 4 plat, 4 gold, 2 silver, and 0
  copper with the rest of the group. For example, /split 4 will only split 4
  platinum with your group members. /split 0 0 0 200 will split 200 copper
  pieces with your group. <BR><BR><STRONG>/stopsong</STRONG> - Bards can use this command in hotkeys to stop singing
  their songs. <BR><BR><STRONG>/surname &lt;<EM>last name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Players with a character level 20
  or over may use this command to assign a last name to their character. Once
  you have chosen a last name, you will not be able to change it. So make
  certain that you choose a name that you like, and make certain that the name
  meets the requirements for our naming policy (see www.everquest.com for more
  details). <BR><BR><STRONG>/targetgroupbuff</STRONG> - This command toggles on and off when issued. When
  on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target but will affect
  everyone grouped (and in range) with that target, even if it is not your own
  group. When it is off your group buff spells will act normally. This will
  only work with group buffs that have a duration, and will not affect heals,
  portals, change form spells or spells cast from items. <BR><BR><STRONG>/tell &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - The text is seen by the named
  character anywhere in the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>/time</STRONG> - gives you the time of day in Norrath and your local time
  (based on the clock on your computer). <BR><BR><STRONG>/trackfilter [<EM>Red/Yellow/White/Blue/Green</EM>]</STRONG> (Ranger only) -
  Specify here what NPC /con colors you do not want to see in your tracking
  display. For example, /trackfilter Red will remove all 'red' (dangerous) NPCs
  from your tracking display. <BR><BR><STRONG>/trackplayers [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows those with the tracking skill to
  indicate whether or not they want player characters to show up in their
  tracking list. <BR><BR><STRONG>/tracksort [<EM>Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider</EM>]</STRONG>  (Ranger only) - This is used by Rangers to control how their tracking display
  sorts targets. Normal is by how long they have been in the zone (oldest NPCs
  first), Distance will put the closest NPC on top of the tracking list,
  Consider will put the highest level NPCs on top, Rdistance will have the
  closest NPC listed last, Rconsider has the tracking list from low level on
  top to high level below. <BR><BR><STRONG>/usercolor [<EM>Chat Type</EM>] Rvalue Gvalue Bvalue</STRONG>. - For example, For
  Guild chat to be yellow, you would type /usercolor 4 0 255 255. This is the
  same as editing the TextColor portion of your Eqclient.ini file, and the list
  of Chat Type numbers can be found in that section of this manual. <BR><BR><STRONG>/vrdelay [<EM>1- 5</EM>]</STRONG> - This command is used to specify the delay
  time for responses when using voice recognition software. <BR><BR><STRONG>/who</STRONG> - lists all player characters in your zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/who corpse</STRONG> - lists all the corpses your character has in the current
  zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/who all</STRONG> - lists all player characters in the world. <BR><BR><EM>Note: /who and /who all are also usable with masks to look for certain
  characters, races or classes online. For example: </EM><BR><BR><EM>/who wiz all</EM> - generates a list of all Wizards online in all zones. <BR><EM>/who 1 5 all</EM> - generates a list of all characters online who are
  between levels 1 and 5. <BR><BR><EM>/who fip all</EM> - generates a list of all characters whose names begin

  who are online (see the /friend command). <BR><BR><STRONG>/whotarget</STRONG> - Does a &quot;/who&quot; on the player character targeted.

  later, to change the color and transparency of the background for all of the
  window boxes for the updated user interface. <BR><BR>Format: /wincolor &lt;window name&gt; &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt;
  &lt;trans&gt; <BR>&lt;window name&gt; -&gt; CHAT, SPELL, PLAYER, PARTY, TARGET, BUFF, DATA,
  MAIN, INV, TRACK, or HOTBOX <BR>&lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt; -&gt; 0 to 255 <BR>&lt;trans&gt; -&gt; 0 = off, 1 = 25, 2 = 50, 3 = 75, 4 = 100 percent <BR>To reset a window color use /wincolor &lt;window name&gt; reset <BR><BR><STRONG>/yell</STRONG> - will issue a &quot;cry for help&quot; to all players within a

  in the same zone as the player you want to invite into the guild. The letter
  o must be lower cased. If the player you want to make an officer is currently

  command to remove guild members. Keep in mind that if you target yourself
  when executing this command, you will remove yourself from the guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guilddelete</STRONG> - Guild Leaders may use this command to disband a their
  guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildstatus [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG>  Will return the guild status of the targeted or named character (their rank
  within their guild, if any). This command will only work on characters within

  maximum of around 200 characters for this guild motd. Any new guild message
  of the day overwrites the last guild message of the day. When a server goes
  down, all guild messages of the day will be deleted and will need to be
