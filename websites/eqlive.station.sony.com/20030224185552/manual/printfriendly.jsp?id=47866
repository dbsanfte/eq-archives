	p.35: Section should read: <BR><BR>As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and other players can't kill you. (You have to become a player-killer, or PK, to give other player-killers "permission" to attack you. You do this by giving a Priest of Discord the <B>Child of Discord</B> book in your inventory.) If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous guards may immediately come to the rescue, <B>providing that they are fond of you. Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.</B> <BR><BR>*Note: Changes to the original text are in bold text. <BR><BR>
