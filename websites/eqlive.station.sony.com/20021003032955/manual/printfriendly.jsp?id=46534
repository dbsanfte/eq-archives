			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player, see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=giving">Giving/Trading Items</A>. <BR><BR><I>To buy/sell an item:</I> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<I>Note: you will have to be relatively close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only receive the "consider" information for the merchant, not the merchant window</I>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <B>Purchase</B> or <B>Sell</B> to purchase or sell the quantity of items you've selected.<BR><BR><I>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</I> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the Control key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. To buy or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. <BR><BR>
