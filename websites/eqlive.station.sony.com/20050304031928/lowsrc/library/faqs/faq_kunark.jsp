<h1>Kunark FAQ</h1>


<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG><BR><STRONG>Ruins of Kunark FAQ</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>1.0 General questions.</STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>1.1 What is a FAQ?</STRONG></P>  <P>FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. FAQs are designed to cover the
  most common questions and answers regarding a product.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.2 What is EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark?</STRONG></P>  <P>The EverQuest Expansion Pack is essentially an add-on to the massively
  multiplayer game EverQuest.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.2.1 What is EverQuest?</STRONG></P>  <P>EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another equally
  accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical MUD. EverQuest
  was released March 16, 1999.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.3 What are some of the main features of the Expansion?</STRONG></P>  <UL>   <LI>An entire new
       continent, called Kunark, located south of Faydwer.</LI>   <LI>20+ Brand New Zones,
       including newbie zones all the way up to zones filled with dragons.</LI>   <LI>A huge array of new,
       even more visually stunning NPCs.</LI>   <LI>A more detailed
       world, using more polygons and larger textures.</LI>   <LI>More animation of
       objects throughout the new continent.</LI>   <LI>New Playable Race,
       the Iksar (Lizardman).</LI>   <LI>Lizardmen are
       neutral/evil and can be Monks.</LI>   <LI>New ships will sail
       from both Antonica and Faydwer to Kunark.</LI>   <LI>New cover and box
       art by famous fantasy artist Keith Parkinson.</LI>   <LI>The ability for
       players to exceed the previous level 50 limit.</LI>  </UL>  <P><STRONG>1.4 How do I upgrade to the Kunark expansion?</STRONG></P>  <P>Currently, the Kunark expansion comes in a boxed set that includes the
  full version of EverQuest and is available through the <A HREF="https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQROK-HG-SW0399-EQFULLP-GRNBX">Station
  Store</A>.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.4.1 Will purchase of the Expansion affect the monthly
  subscription rate?</STRONG></P>  <P>No.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.4.2 What if I don't purchase the Expansion?</STRONG></P>  <P>You will still be able to play EverQuest as usual. You will be able to
  view characters of the new race and trade/purchase new items from Kunark, but
  you will not be able to create an Iksar character yourself nor will you be
  able to travel to Kunark.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.5.1 Will the graphical upgrades used in the Expansion affect the
  rest of the EverQuest world?</STRONG></P>  <P>No. To take advantage of the advanced techniques used in the creation of
  the Expansion we would have to completely recreate the older EverQuest zones,
  and we've made the decision to focus our resources on new content instead.</P>  <P><STRONG>1.5.2 Will Kunark Allow More Character Slots?</STRONG></P>  <P>No. Kunark is an expansion to the existing game. It contains landmass,
  content, and an additional race. The core game of EverQuest really isn't
  changing as a result of it exept to include quests related to Kunark and the
  boats to get there. Hence, the 8 character limit per server won't change as a
  result of the expansion.</P>  <P><A></A><STRONG>2.0 EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Product
  FAQ</STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>2.0.1 What is the Kunark Expansion Pack Upgrade?</STRONG></P>  <P>The Upgrade allows current EverQuest subscribers the ability to access the
  new features of the Ruins of Kunark. Such new features include the continent
  of Kunark with 20+ brand new zones as well as a new playable race the Iksar.
  The Upgrade comes with a Kunark CD, Upgrade Account Key, and a cloth map of
  the EverQuest world including the new continent. The Upgrade key will allow
  an existing EverQuest subscriber to access the Ruins of Kunark and enjoy all
  the new features.</P>  <P><STRONG>2.0.2 What is the difference between the Kunark Upgrade and the
  retail Kunark Box Edition?</STRONG></P>  <P>The Kunark Box Edition includes both the EverQuest and Kunark software as
  well as an Account Key allowing for the creation of a new EverQuest account.
  The Upgrade only includes the Kunark software and an Upgrade Account Key that
  allows existing players access to the Ruins of Kunark. If you are not
  currently an EverQuest customer we recommend you purchase the Kunark Box
  Edition.</P>  <P><STRONG>2.1 Will I need to order the Upgrade to keep playing EverQuest?</STRONG></P>  <P>No. You can still play EQ, but you won't have access to the new continent
  or the new playable race.</P>  <P><STRONG>2.2 Once I get the Kunark package, what do I do?</STRONG></P>  <P>Install the Kunark software off the CD then register for the Kunark
  service using the account key on the CD. Remember that if you purchased the
  Kunark Updgrade, your key can only update and existing EverQuest account. You
  can update your account from the server selection screen by clicking Register
  Kunark, or by going to the account, change account menus. If you purchased
  the full Retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark you may use your
  key to either create a new EverQuest account with both EQ and Kunark access,
  or update an existing EQ Account. BUT YOU CANNOT DO BOTH.</P>  <P><STRONG>2.2.1 I keep getting &quot;invalid account key&quot; errors when
  trying to register. What should I do?</STRONG></P>  <P>Sometimes zeros can be confused with o's and I's can be confused with 1's.
  With the font used on the key labels, remember that o's appear angular (kind
  of like diamonds) and zero's look more rectangular. Try the combinations. If
  you still have trouble, contact customer service for help.</P>
