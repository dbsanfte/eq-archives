<h2>State of the Game: Part 1</h2>
<DIV align=left><SPAN class=header><BR>EverQuest's Third Anniversary: State of the Game - </SPAN><SPAN class=header>Part 1</SPAN> <BR><BR>Since the launch of The Shadows of Luclin, EverQuest has attracted many new players, giving us our largest number of subscribers ever. </DIV>
<P align=left>Given the sudden arrival of so many new adventurers into the world of Norrath, which greatly exceeded our expectations, we've taken time to enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels.</P>
<P align=left>At the same time, we're in the process of making a number of changes aimed at improving the game for players of all levels. Stay tuned to this page for a more detailed report.<BR><BR>Some of the changes we are making are substantial and sweeping, others are more cosmetic and fun. At their core they all have the same goal: To allow more entertaining and less frustrating access to the rich and rewarding world for which EverQuest is famous.<BR><BR>We had assumed that such design revisions for lower levels would not be necessary for a three year old game. Indeed, we had already <A class=hiddentext href="http://www.planesofpower.com/">begun a great task</A> designed primarily for the most seasoned of adventurers, which we will explain soon. However, our upsurge in new subscribers has convinced us otherwise. </P>
<P align=left>This update is the first of several designed to revise the entry game of EverQuest. These changes should make our many new adventurers' journeys and tales even more exciting. To our many new adventurers in Norrath we say, "Welcome!"<BR><BR>We sincerely hope that our loyal EverQuest veterans will be pleased by the changes in the coming weeks aimed specifically at the higher levels. <BR><BR>In addition, we would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, both old and new, for their support since the launch of Luclin. We hope you have noticed the many improvements we have made over the past months. However, we are certainly not done fixing problems and updating content as you will see in the months to come.<BR><BR>Thank you for helping the population of Norrath reach new heights. The adventure has just begun!<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team</P>
