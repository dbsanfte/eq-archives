No-Drop items that are also Magic or Lore will continue to behave as they did prior to this patch.<P>- The EverQuest Team<P><BR>** Tales **<P>Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights.  The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was.  The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest.  The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<P>Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck.  He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying.  The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand.  Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently.  There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol.  Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror.  It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire.  Glox looked down at his pupil again.  "Where did you get this?"  The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin.  "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned..."<P><BR>** A Call to Arms! **<P>Have you long dreamed of aiding your fellow adventurer? Do you enjoy travelling the world and meeting new and interesting people? Are you over the age of 18 with an EverQuest account in good standing and some free time? If so, then the EverQuest Guide Program may be for you! If you feel compelled to join our ranks, point your web browser to <A HREF="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/" TARGET=_blank>https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</A> and fill out an application!<P>February 4th<BR>------------------------------<P>** Changes to the EverQuest patcher **<P><BR>A little while ago we combined our Test patcher with our Live patcher.  The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can cause and to encourage more people to play on the Test server.<P>Well, we're going back to the old way.  We are going to split the Test patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.<P>This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory.  To play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.<P>There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers.  Splitting them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are headed to the right server when you double click the icon.  It's also a little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two directories.<P>Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive space.  However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work.  Using the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch.  The data on the Test Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.<P>And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers.  It gives us one more step for testing.  Now we can push a patcher to the Test Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes to the Live servers.<P>In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way.  Starting on Monday, February 4th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play on the Live servers.<P>* Patch Message Addendum *<P>The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on the Test Server.  Anyone using this should remove this argument from their shortcut.  Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced Options window to use the Test Server.  On Monday, February 4th, TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test Server.<P><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR>

<hr>

I have it on good authority that we missed mentioning the following in the patch message:<P>* Try Levant at high noon - You'll like it.<BR>* QVoX had the illusion removed to fix stacking issue.<P>Just in case you don't know about it already.<P>Nizanko wrote:<P><B>- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on your cursor as if you had left clicked on it<P>Doesn't this leave open the possibility that you're left standing there holding an item on the mouse cursor for which you no longer have room in your inventory (due to any number of possibilities, including item changes that make an item non-wearable but you hadn't removed it since the change)?</B><P>Absolutely.<P>But the alternative was occasionally dropping the item on the ground or, in some rare cases, the item would just vanish.<P>Once it's on your cursor you are free to do with it as you will.  You can drop it or destroy it, but at least doing so will be your choice not the whim of the software.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR><B>GOOD MORNING!,<P>- Renamed all will-o-wisps and will o' wisps to Fred. <BR>- Reconsidered and changed Fred to willowisp.<P>Normally I read through patch messages and it is all business. It was nice to see a change to the norm with the above. Very humorous. <P>One thing. In the future can you give us advanced warning? A sudden burst of laughter can be dangerous when you are suppossed to be using your pc to work, and not to mention the weird looks my co workers gave me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-DaxD</B><P>You know we can't do that.  The risks v. reward factor for the whole humor thing would be ruined if we warned you about it first.<P>You gets your humor, you takes your chances.<P><BR><B>Good Morning!!<P>I just read over the patch message and I like what I see.<P>After seeing the following line:<BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>Made adjustments to the Whistling Fists quest <BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>I had to run off to monkly-business and see if anybody had a clue.<BR>There's much speculation, but nothing going anywhere.<P>Would it be possible to get a bit of clarification on that?<P>Is it in regard to the Robe of the Whistling Fist quest?<BR>or<BR>Is it in regard to the long un-finished Whistling Fists(reputed to be a Leezard-only Monk weapon).<P>The storyline at the end has me itching to get out of work and go home to talk to Glox, but alas I have to wait..<P>Thanks in advance for any info you can spare.<P>Casulty<BR>54 Leeeeezard Monk<BR>Raiders Haven  Torvo</B><P>You folks will figure it out soon enough.<P>Finding out the ins and outs of these sorts of things is part of the entertainment value for a lot of players, so we don't give away all the secrets.  Sometimes we're downright cryptic.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR><B>Hiya!<P>Just wanted to take the time to thank you for changing the Dark Cloak of Sky back to its original functionality for rangers only. Thank you so much for listening to the community, and such a quick change. Cheers!<P>Alexzander Heavytree<BR>Adventurers Anonymous<BR>60 Warder of the Prexus server</B><P>We just flipped the wrong switch when changing the item.  We're sorry for the trouble.<P><BR>h1h0 wrote:<P><B>wheres the guildwipe part in the patch message ?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>Sorry about that.  Somehow guild information didn't make it when the servers came back up.  Nothing was 'wiped', and we'll have it back up right away (if it isn't already...).<P><BR>Alan<BR>

Saratae wrote:<P><B>It states that Shock of Frost was given to Beastlords, this was unfortunately incorrect. I haven't verified but someone said the actual spell is Blast of Frost that was given to us. Mind correcting which spell we are getting or supposed to be getting?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>It does indeed look like the spell is called Blast of Frost.<P>A rose by any other name...<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

I guess the first thing that I need to do is apologize for telling you that Levant had been changed.  It hasn't.  I'll make sure that the person that said it is exposed to some sort of horrible Troll odors or something.<P><B>Hello   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>In the latest patch, you said:<P>- Pets no longer pace. Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.<P>Why, oh why, was that done?  /Gems, while fun at first, gets a bit repetitive after a while and the only thing left to do while meditating is to watch that pet walk back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth...  It's not much, but it's infinitely better than staring off into empty space!<P>Pleeeease change that back, or at least make it optional?  Perhaps there can be a "/pet pace on" and a "/pet pace off" type thing?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks, hoping you'd at least consider it   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-A player</B><P>We told the pets to stop pacing primarily because it saves us resources.  Moving NPCs around takes up resources.  As part of our ongoing attempt to make the game more efficient we started to look at things that NPCs do that they don't need to do.  This was one of them.<P>It also has the added bonus of being a ton less annoying for many people.<P>Maybe you can find a friend that will pace for you...    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Dera wrote:<P><B>Thank you for finally addressing the issues of high level conctested NPCs, finally North American guilds are no longer at such a disadvatage as before in the high level game.</B><P>Well, the idea is to make things as equitable as we can for everyone.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

I'm sorry that they didn't get updated.<P>And I've passed on your concerns to the person that designed the new Whistling Fists stuff.<P>Thanks for the comments.<P><BR>Mafkace wrote:<P><B>Quoting from the patch message:<P>"- Added water flasks to two merchants in the Bazaar<BR>- Added high quality ore vendors to Bazaar, Kaladim, and Qeynos that sell a limited supply of HQ Ore"<P>Yes, no, no.<P>Yes, the Merchant in Qeynos opened up shop as of the latest patch (/cheer, this makes me REALLY happy!). No, no, the other two seem to have delivery problems? Neither the Kaladim Merchant nor the Bazaar Merchant appeared on the live servers. Water is also still missing from the Bazaar zone.<P>Another quote:<P>"- Increased the drop rates of cultural armor temper components"<P>After the Smiths of Norrath read this message, they were overjoyed (yes, me too!)! The hunting season opened on the various MoBs that drop these components. After many people spent hours and hours hunting these, they found roughly the same droprate as before. Was the increase only marginal ( 1% or 2% more maybe?) or did this not make it into this patch either?</B><P>Probably the same issue with the temper components.  There seems to have been a bit of miscommunication internally and the zones for the trade stuff didn't make the list.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

Once loaded up, it just does its thing.  The server never has to track where those trees are because they don't move.  The swaying isn't really movement, it's just frames of an animation.<P>The pet's movement, though, not only has to be tracked by the server, it has to be sent to everyone (you've already got all the data you need for those trees once you zone in).  Each time the pet moves, the server has to tell all the clients in visual range that it's moved.  But if the server knows the pet is sitting there in one place... well, then it acts much more like a tree.<P>I can only hope that made sense.<P>Alan<BR>
