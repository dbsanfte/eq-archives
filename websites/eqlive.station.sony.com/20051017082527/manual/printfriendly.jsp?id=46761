		<h2>
			13.3
			Spell Types
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has literally hundreds
  of spells that you can acquire and cast at various levels of experience.
  They're far too numerous to list here, but for the most part they can be
  classified into four types: <BR><BR><EM>Offensive</EM>: Spells that are, or add punch to, combat attacks. Examples
  are Shock of Frost, Burst of Flame and Enfeeblement. <BR><BR><EM>Defensive</EM>: Spells that boost armor ratings or give added protection or
  advantage during battle - for instance, Courage, Skin Like Wood and
  Invisibility to Undead. <BR><BR><EM>Healing</EM>: Spells that restore health and stamina, like Minor Healing,
  Cure Disease, Endure Poison and Mend Bones. <BR><BR><EM>Utility</EM>: Spells that are neither offensive nor defensive. For example,
  you can cast Calm, Sense Magic, Summon Food and Bind Affinity. None of these
  spells is harmful or helpful in a combat situation, but they each have a
  specific purpose and provide some benefit.
