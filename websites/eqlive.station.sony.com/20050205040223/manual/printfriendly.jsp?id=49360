			Pet Info Window
		</h2>
	
	The Pet Info Window is not
  open by default. It is designed to help characters with pets by providing a
  single window for pet information and commands. <BR><BR>At the top of the window will be the name of the pet (or No Pet if you have
  no pet). Below that is a gauge that represents the pet's health. Below that
  are buttons that activate the most common pet commands. For more information
  about pet commands, see <A HREF="http://eqlive-new-test.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?id=47075">Appendix
  A</A>.
