<h1>Charm Change</h1>
	<B>-Prior to the 5/8 patch when I recharmed a mob it immediately went back to it's target.<P>-Since the 5/8 patch I always either have to order the pet to attack the previous target, or take a hit.<P>-Is this intentional, or a bug?<P>Mercuria Cestlavie<BR>55 Troubador, The Nameless</B><P>That was intentional, and most certainly something we should have mentioned.  Sorry about that.<P>Yes, when charm breaks and you re-charm the target, you will have to command it to attack again.  We're changing this as part of something larger that is, basically, an exploit.  The extra step of hitting the /pet attack macro is something that we had to do to make something else work right.<P>Sorry that I can't be more precise, but we're still working on it, and exploit fixes aren't always things we announce.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>This doesn't seem to much of a noticable change.<P>Many times before, the creature I charmed would forget who it's target was. Thus i'd have to reorder it to attack.<P>I'm not happy with this change, because it makes a very popular method of bard soloing called "charm kiting" much more difficult to perform.<P>But, I guess there's worse things you could do.<P>/wave<P>Doofy &lt;level 55 bard of drinal&gt;</B><P>I'm sure there are worse things we could do.  But looking for the worst things to do isn't really in the schedule for this year...<P><BR><B>I dont know what Exploit you guys are talking aboot, but this change has made Charm songs useless. The fact that charm can wear off at any point makes it possible for charm to break as you target and make your pet attack a mob. If the mobs have the same name your cant tell which was your pet. plus the wasted time it takes retarget and make pet attack. I know its only like 2 seconds. We are talking 2 seconds of a 18 second song.<P>Like to thank all you for once again not thinking aboot how players would react to such changes.<P>Pinene 58 bard  BB</B><P>Calm down.  You're getting your facts confused.<P>It's a 12 second song.<P>If it could wear off at any time now, then it could before.  All of the issues that you bring up are unrelated to the change we made, with one exception.<P>Yes, you could lose 2 seconds of your 12 for the charm.<P>We are looking at increasing the duration of Bard charm songs.  We're going to look more closely at it after E3.  But adding a tick (6 seconds) to the duration of this song would give it a 50% increase in duration.  While 6 seconds seems like a short time to many, bards know that it's a long time (especially those that see the potential loss of 2 seconds as a major setback...).  So we're not sure that this is what we want to do.<P><BR>Charles48 wrote:<P><B>Is this just for Bards? Or do chanters get the same change?  If it is just for bards, why do we get the special attention?</B><P>I'm pretty sure I stated this earlier, but I'll do so again.  This affects ALL charms.  It is only negatively impacting bards because of the short duration of their charm songs.<P><BR><B>Still anxiously awaiting any insights into whether or not charm will be fixed for bards, or some other concession is in the works to compensate for the accidental removal of charm as a viable bard solo tactic. Please don't leave us in the dark, many bards feel very very strongly about this.<P>Thanks.<P>-Eiro, 56 Bard, 7th Hammer</B><P>Keep in mind that, though we do plan to examine ways to help fix this problem, repairing broken soloing tactics isn't always going to be a high priority thing for us.  Remember that this is a group focused game, especially where bards are concerned.<P>In any case, I'll update you when we've recovered from E3 (no, don't expect a response on Monday at 10 in the morning...  after we've <I>recovered from</I> E3 and had a chance to examine the increased duration...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  )<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>perhaps the bard above did not phrase it properly.  Yes, it removes charm kiting as a solo method for bards, but that is because it practically removes charm as an effective bard too (I have played a bard, and I will vouch for this).<P>This means that bards have real trouble charming while soloing OR in groups.  Actually, its a little easier soloing because the bard can simply keep swapping charmed targets.  This is not viable in groups.<P>I understand the need to fix exploits, but please take a close look at this soon.  Bard charm was a great part of crowd control when an enchanter was not available (hey, I can't be EVERYWHERE at once), and I would hate to see them lose this.<P><BR>Thanks,<BR>Leirra</B><P>Oh, don't misunderstand me.  We certainly understand how this change affects group play to.  My only point was that the fact that the change makes soloing harder isn't a very persuasive argument.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>
