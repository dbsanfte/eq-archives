<h1>Left Handed</h1>
	<B>I know this is an extremely low priority, and I do not know if it has even been considered as the tompic was always mass flooded with flames, but has it ever been discussed on the possibility of creating a Left Handed character?  <P>It just feels odd to me (being left handed) to see a view of my characters with their weapon in the right hand.<P>Also, I am pleased with the way the boards have turned out.  I have been visiting the boards since September of 1999, and this relief from the flames is well deserved.  Congrats.<P>Mazteer Cazteer &lt;Avengers of Light&gt;<BR>40 Erudite Enchanter<BR>Home: Bristalbane</B><P>This would certainly be a nice feature.  But the reality is that in order to add left-handed characters we would have to recreate the animations for all of those characters.  It's certainly a great idea, though, and I'll mention it to the team.  It's just that with the resources we would need to make this work, we could probably add a lot of content in other places.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Regarding the post on creating a Left-Handed character, I have a question. My memory may be a little fuzzy since I've been awake for way too long (playing EQ of course *smile*) but I think that I remember either this topic, or something else, coming up awhile back. And the answer was that while yes it could be done, it would require a change to the way characters are stored on the servers and the would implicitly require a player wipe of the live servers. So, in regards to this request, do you belive that it would be possible to do this without a player wipe?<P>Serian<BR>Rogue of Ayonae</B><P>Yes, something like that could be done without a character wipe, I'm pretty sure.  But it would be very complicated and time consuming.  There are certainly other things that we can accomplish with our resources that would probably be more interesting.  If it was a matter of just flipping things over, we would have already done it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<B>I saw this post just a few min ago. I know in the game "Counter Strike" for HAlf Life. They had a similar problem! I seem to remember something about just mirroring the current model's. No new modeling or animations.<P>Might be something to look into?<P>Luclin<BR>Divine Levitation<BR>Phamyn - Erudite<BR>21st Mage<P>Kjeldon Darkoak - Wood Elf - (Retired)<BR>51st Wanderer</B><P>I sorta looked into it on accident.  I was talking to a programmer that had read the original post.  He told me that it didn't work that way for EverQuest, unfortunately.<P>Alan<BR>
