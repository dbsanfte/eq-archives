  computer?</EM> Desktop. </P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable!&nbsp; I'd use DSL as well, but broadband is
  the way to go!</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My very
  first character was a Gnome Wizard.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> No</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> My highest character is my main, Sissl
  N`Burn who is level 70.&nbsp; I'd have
  higher but Prathun and Zajeer won't let me. They kept mumbling something
  about &quot;against the rules&quot;. Pfft! I'll work on Rashere next, and if
  that fails, I'll try bribing Brenlo and the other halflings with pie.</P>  <P>Do you prefer to
  solo or group? Personally I enjoy both solo and group, but if push comes to
  shove, even though my main is definitely good at soloing, I prefer a good
  group.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I like the flexibility and survivability.&nbsp; Watching as everyone around me is
  dying while I (usually) remain alive and safe and around to help pick up the
  pieces can be a lot of fun, if you look at it with the right attitude.
  Necromancers are a fun class that can perform very well in a wide variety of
  situations from soloing things that I'm *sure* the devs never really intended
  us to solo, to raiding, to grouping; they're a ton of fun.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes, my guild on Prexus is Nameless Order
  (http://www.namelessorder.com/).&nbsp;
  Our leader is the infallible Perplex, a Gnome mage who loves to tank
  mobs he has no business tanking, and has a love of singing during raids.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> Currently
  only three and the others don't really count ;)&nbsp; I play my main pretty much
  exclusively. </P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Technically I worship Cazic Thule, however
  Cazic and I have had a falling out of sorts, ever since a few pals of mine
  came along with me to kill him and all his friends.&nbsp; They seem to have left the building
  since. </P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I have not played a cleric, druid,
  paladin, warrior, or mage.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> Something on the order of 140k, getting
  the base gem for a player crafted augment. </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> I'd have to say it's a tossup between
  Planes of Power, and Omens of War. I enjoyed the storyline in both.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> I'd have to say for it's time, Old Sebilis
  was a really, really fun zone. Of the current crop, I'd have to say
  Riftseeker's sanctum, just because it's so pretty.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> My absolute favorite NPC has to be Sirran
  the Lunatic from Plane of Sky. </P>  <P>Sirran the Lunatic
  says, 'What?! Now you've done it! The bunnies are angry! ANGRY I TELL YOU!&#8217;</P>  <P>A good second
  place would be Prince Thirneg in Plane of Growth.&nbsp; If you happen to have a chat with him,
  ask him if he has any phat lewt..... </P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> I'd have to put that as Legacy of the
  Ykesha.&nbsp; It was chock full of content
  that wasn't appropriate for the stage of the game I was at at the time, so I
  pretty much got it for the features, and not the content. It's one thing to
  buy an expansion that has content that you'll grow into eventually (i.e.
  tougher than you can currently do). It's quite another to get an expansion
  that has content that you've already outgrown.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> I'll say that among the zones I liked the
  least were the ones that had constant non-stop trains in them. Maiden's eye comes
  to mind.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> That has a sort of complicated answer. EQ
  was and still is full of NPC's I love to hate.&nbsp; I hated Dorn B'Dynn, until I returned
  at a later level and took great delight in killing him over and over and
  over....&nbsp; My current object of
  hatred (until I can kill him repeatedly -- with help of course) would be
  Overlord Mata Muram.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> I don't think that I do, but my bank seems full of junk all
  the time anyhow. ;) </P>  <P><STRONG>StBern</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM>&nbsp;
  In March of 2000</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM>&nbsp; I play solely on a desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM>&nbsp;
  Sorry missed this question.&nbsp;
  I started on dial-up, have played on DSL, and am currently using
  cable, which I like best.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM>&nbsp; My first Character was and is a Human
  Paladin&#8230;still my main too!</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> My first online game was Archmage, a turn
  based text game.&nbsp; I was then
  introduced to Lineage which was my first real online game.&nbsp; A coworker then introduced me to EQ
  which quickly became my game of choice.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM>&nbsp;
  My highest level is still on my first character, a 58 Paladin</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM>&nbsp;
  I prefer to group, however, due to time constraints, I find myself
  more often soloing.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM>&nbsp; I like the Paladin
  because of its versatility and utility to be able to tank solo or in
  groups.&nbsp; The healing isn&#8217;t
  great but it allows me to solo and back-up heal in groups.&nbsp; I have capable buffs to throw out an
  emergency HP or AC buff and can save the day with my LoH.&nbsp; I like being thought of as the moral
  class and try to play the role.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM>&nbsp;
  StBern is a member of the Guardians of the Throne on Maelin Starpyre</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM>&nbsp; I currently have 7 characters on my
  main server.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM>&nbsp;
  StBern worships Mithaniel Marr</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM>&nbsp;
  I have yet to play a Bard or a Mage, and have just recently started an
  enchanter with the new tutorial.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM>&nbsp;
  I think the most I spent so far is 7K on an Architect's Bejeweled
  Chestplate</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM>&nbsp;
  I liked the content that the Luclin expansion delivered, but I enjoyed
  LDoN the most so far.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM>&nbsp;
  By far, I&#8217;ve enjoyed Unrest the most.&nbsp; I have spent time there with almost
  every one of my characters.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM>&nbsp;
  I can honestly say, I don&#8217;t have a favorite.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM>&nbsp;
  GoD, I bought the expansion and have never used any of the content.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM>&nbsp;
  My least favorite zone is without a doubt, west Karana.&nbsp; All I can ever remember is the
  drudgery of running through that zone and also the monotony of killing
  bandits to get sashes for faction turn-ins to proceed with my epic.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM>&nbsp;
  Again, no one that really comes to mind.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM>&nbsp;
  The velium claidhmore that was given to my paladin when he was very
  young still sits in my bank.&nbsp; Sure
  I could sell it or give it away, but it was the first &#8216;uber&#8217;
  weapon that I held in my early pally teens.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m still looking for
  the original character who gave it to me to return.</P>  <P><STRONG>WingRider_01</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> the first time I entered Norrath was July
  of 1998, I was one of the original few to see Norrath. Still have the CD that
  was sent to me for testing.&nbsp; My
  first real character was created march 19, 1999</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable modem</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Human
