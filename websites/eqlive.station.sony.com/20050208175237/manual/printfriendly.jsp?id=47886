		<h2>
			29.2
			Appendix D - Skill Levels and Skill Points
		</h2>
	
	Once you have gained enough
  experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience
  bar) you will earn one skill point. It is these skill points that allow you
  to purchase alternate advancement abilities. Each ability will require a
  certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability.
  <BR><BR>Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill
  level associated with it. For many of these abilities there is only one skill
  level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the
  skill available for that ability. But several abilities have more than one
  skill level. Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability
  will improve that ability. However, it is important to note that a second
  skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly
  than the second. That expense is rewarded, however. If additional skill
  levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power
  of that ability. <BR><BR><EM>Let's look at two examples</EM>: <BR><BR>Improved Natural Strength has five skill levels. However, each skill level
  for this ability costs one skill point. Each time you raise your skill level
  with this ability you gain two points of strength. <BR><BR>Healing Adept (from the Priest Archetype) has three skill levels. Each skill
  level costs progressively more skill points. The first skill level costs two
  skill points for a 2% improvement in healing spells. The second skill level
  costs four points, but improves that percentage to 5%. The third skill level
  costs six skill points, but raises the percentage to 10%.
