	<h2>Bristlebane's Battle of the Craftkeepers</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Bristlebane<br>
	10/21/2002<br>
	<P>It was a contest of skill in MAGIC. Casters of all shapes and sizes attended, to test what others were capable of.&nbsp; As the contest was being prepared, all of the noble contestants were greeted by Bristlebane's own servants as each entered to partake in this epic event.&nbsp; A few thought they could outwit the likes of the lookouts, but it did not come to be. They had been ripped from their perches and sent to the fiery depths of no return.</P>
<P>After everyone had finish arriving from the long swim through Lake Rathear and had settled in, and the participants prepped and ready, and the Gods willing... it began. 19 hopefuls started... only 3 would be declared the winners.&nbsp; Three who could prove they possessed an Arcane mastery over all others.</P>
<P>It was a very intense battle that pit caster against caster until the death.&nbsp; With this known, the magic users began with caution.&nbsp; However, after a few fireball's in the face, the chaos of battle ensued.&nbsp; The final three were Riizz, a Wizard with 33 years of practice, Pyee, a Wizardress who had achieved 29 years of expierience, and Mornin, a Druid with 31 years of training.</P>
<P>Mornin was the first to drop in this battle of three.&nbsp; What followed between Riiz and Pyee could only be described as spectacular.&nbsp; Wizard against Wizard.&nbsp; Riizz was eventually able to use his four years experience over the Wizzardress to win the match!&nbsp; And the winners collected their prize. To Riizz, a hefty sum of 570 Platinum pieces... to Pyee... A very generous 351platinum... and to Mornin.. 219 Platinum.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The event was enjoyed by all who participated and those who didn't. Lord Bristlebane sends his congratulations to all of the winners and his condolences to those who fell this great day.</P><br>
