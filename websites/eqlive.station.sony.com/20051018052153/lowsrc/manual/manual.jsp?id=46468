		<h2>
			4.8
			Server Selection
		</h2>
	
	<P>Choosing a server is one of the first decisions you must
  make when you enter EverQuest. Though it is true that many people who have
  friends in game will choose the server where their friends are, it is
  generally recommended that unconnected people choose the least populated
  server for play. <BR><BR>There are also special servers with different rules from those of the
  majority of our servers. New players will want to take care before choosing
  to play on these servers, and read the rules for them before starting. Each
  server has a different theme and should you choose to play on one, the
  following information should be considered. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Rallos Zek Server (PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Rallos Zek Server is the oldest PvP server in EverQuest. On this server,
  everyone has the ability to attack each other subject to a 4 level limit. For
  instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41
  through 49. <BR><BR>In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server,
  the loot rules are &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot;. You may loot (or have looted
  from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item. Items in bags, in a melee
  slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be
  looted. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers (PvP Teams, Coin Only)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers is what we call PvP-Teams servers. Only races
  on opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.; The four teams are: <BR><BR>Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls<BR>Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.<BR>Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.<BR>Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians. <BR><BR>Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other
  three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can
  attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they
  are on opposing teams. <BR><BR>The loot rules on these servers differ from Rallos Zek. Only coin may be
  looted from a fallen opponent. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Sullon Zek Server (Deity based team PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this
  server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In
  general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon
  and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character
  worships rather than the race of the character. <BR><BR><STRONG>Sullon Zek rules: </STRONG><BR><BR>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are
  not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack
  and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his
  alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply. <BR><BR>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough
  strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to
  participate in PvP combat, unless they stray from city and newbie zones. As
  soon as a character 'dings' into 6th level he or she will become PvP enabled.
  <BR><BR>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character
  that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be
  the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your
  corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience. <BR><BR>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then
  only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character
  getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse. <BR><BR>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means
  that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new
  one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release
  of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that
  wish to explore these new characters. <BR><BR>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their
  Deity Team. <BR><BR>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is
  not on their Deity Team. <BR><BR>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players
  current level. <BR><BR>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player
  characters. <BR><BR>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player
  characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or
  'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they
  are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels. <BR><BR>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on.
  Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally'. <BR><BR>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their
  racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a
  faction loss with the locals. Freeport,
  Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of
  Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves
  (high elves and wood elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both
  starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of
  their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other
  cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a
  certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is
  not a dwarven home town. <BR><BR>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server.
  Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts
  through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters
  is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. <STRONG>HOWEVER: All
  rules regarding general decency still apply</STRONG>. Cursing, threats and other
  such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior
  on any PvP server. <BR><BR>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team. <BR><BR>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones. <BR><BR>16. 'Buff' spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than
  the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will
  supercede this rule. <BR><BR>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th
  level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be
  turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined
  at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal
  reward. <BR><BR>18. Naked corpses will disappear when looted by a player character. If you
  are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse <STRONG>will</STRONG> disappear
  when it is looted. <BR><BR><STRONG>The 'Teams':</STRONG> </P>  <P>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr,
  Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <BR>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos
  Zek<BR>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus,
  Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan. <BR><BR>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods,
  those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed.
  Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the
  god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics. <BR>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel
  Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the
  good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good. <BR><BR>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some
  ancient writings that opened up new avenues. <BR><BR>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon
  Corpse or something similar. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Firiona Vie (a roleplayint preferred server)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Firiona Vie server is a roleplaying preferred server. To motivate players
  to take advantage of the roleplaying atmosphere, the following feature list
  was implemented. <BR><BR>This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player)
  server. In other words, it's a standard &quot;blue&quot; server with the same
  rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. it is
  not one of teh &quot;Zeks&quot;. <BR><BR>* Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the
  caster. <BR><BR>* The Common language will not exist. A Human language will be added and only
  made easily available to certain races. <BR><BR>* Only one character can be created on each account. <BR><BR>* The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. <BR><BR>* Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as
  newbie notes and epic weapons. <BR><BR>* Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where
  melee characters can bind on other servers. <BR><BR><STRONG>* Trivial Loot Code *</STRONG> <BR><BR>Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC
  and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes
  effect. This can happen when either a member of your group is too high in
  level to receive experience from killing the monster, or when a member of
  your group is outside of the level range of the group for receiving
  experience from the kill. If any member of a group does not get experience
  for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code
  prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal
  items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Antonius Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Antonius Bayle is physically located in the United Kingdom. The rules for
  this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The only
  difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Kane Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Kane Bayle is physically located in Amsterdam.
  The rules for this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The
  only difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Test Server</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Test Server is a server maintained for testing new ideas, spells, NPCs,
  zones and many other new concepts. You can access the Test Server by running
  the testeverquest.exe file located in your EverQuest directory. <BR><BR>Because this is a functioning test server, you may find that you are
  downloading patches frequently from this server. If you play on a standard
  server, you may also have to patch files from those servers to play there to
  replace files altered by the Test Server patch process. <BR><BR>If you plan to play on the Test Server, please read the following disclaimer.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Test Server Disclaimer</STRONG> <BR><BR><EM>Playing on the Test server will give users an opportunity to experience
  changes firsthand before they are made available to the live world servers.
  However, it should be noted that due to frequent changes and revisions,
  enhancements made to the Test server will not necessarily make it to the live
  servers. In addition, the Test server has NO official Game Master support,
  therefore, if an item(s) is lost due to a bug, server outage, or any other
  reason, there will be NO reimbursement for the lost goods. It should also be
  noted that due to the nature of testing, the Test server may be brought down
  at anytime, without notice. Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to
  execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity
  of the test platform.</EM></P>
