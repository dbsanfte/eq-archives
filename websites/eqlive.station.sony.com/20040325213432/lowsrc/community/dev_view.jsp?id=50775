<h1>Gloves of Fire and tinting</h1>
	<B>Greetings gentlemen there.<P>My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that &lt;censored&gt; drops in &lt;censored&gt;.<BR>If you put these gloves on HIE or GNM they are awesome looking. The colour is bright , even neon red. _The_ best looking gloves in the game.<BR>I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when I put them on. They have a reddish, quite dark brown colour when they are on Dark elf hands.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them look on DEF the same as they look on HIE? Is this a bug or just a bad feature because of some shading in graphics or such?<P>I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have been exellent for my outlook. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these gloves look like they should on Dark Elfs?<P>You know the saying (CP 2.0.2.0): Style before everything.<P>Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there.<P>Sincerely<BR>*******************<BR>Dthamilaye K'Tang, 54th magician in Tunare<P>PS. I wouldn't say no if You could give us mages the improved invis too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>The answer is a little complicated.<P>Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces.  When tinting a piece of armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with it, sorta).  So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform for each race that wears it.  This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to the armors that we create.  But it also means that there is no way to get a uniform look across all the races.<P>And, well, sorry about the Improved Invisibility thing.  You get advantages, and you get disadvantages.  Not having Improved Invisibility is one of the disadvantages.<P>Alan<BR>
