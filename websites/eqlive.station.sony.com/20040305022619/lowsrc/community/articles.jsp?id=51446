<h2>Baelish of Casters Realm</h2>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 188px; HEIGHT: 237px" height=230 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/baelish.jpg" width=188 align=left></P>
<P><A href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">Casters Realm</A></A> is one of the most popular EQ fan sites on the net today. With an abundance of information primarily geared towards casters, it is nonetheless a site suitable for all types of players. </P>
<P>In this Community Leader interview, we get to know more about the person responsible for the birth of Casters Realm. His real name is Greg, but we all know him best as Baelish.</P>
<P><EM>(Special Note: This interview was conducted with Baelish shortly before the EverQuest Boston Fan Faire.)</EM> <BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>I know you. Many others know you. But for those few who have yet to meet you, tell us a little about yourself. Who is Baelish?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Well my name is Greg. I am a 25 year old Australian currently living in San Diego.&nbsp; I've been involved with computer games way back to the Apple 2e and Atari-2600 era and began my multiplayer online gaming with MUD's and then Ultima Online.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I started my involvement with EverQuest during the final phase of beta and started my first character Baelish, a dark elf enchanter on Povar, when I got my copy from EB a week or so after launch in 1999.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I was pretty much a full time player through till 2001 when the site started to require more time and I couldn't play as much.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>Will you summarize the goal of Casters Realm?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Originally Casters Realm was known as EverQuest Enchanters and was a small site run off a little server space I had with my ISP.&nbsp; At that time (early 1999) there was only spell lists from Beta (which were out of date at release) and very little information in relation to how the game systems worked, what the role of classes was etc.&nbsp; I found myself looking over a number of sites to try and get information and was even more frustrated that most of it was from beta and now out of date.&nbsp; So I made my own website to provide information for people who played enchanters.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The website's primary wealth of information was with its spell lists, which are still our main area today.&nbsp; We were also the first site to have a complete Jewelry chart and kept in close contact with Geoff and Matt to ensure we provided the best information we could in these two areas.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Over time we developed class strategies, frequently asked questions, some discussion forums and before I knew what was happening we were getting close to a million hits a month on the website.&nbsp; My ISP told me to move to a bigger backbone and at that stage we decided to provide resources to all the pure caster classes, so we came up with Casters Realm.&nbsp; A place for casters to get all the information they would need.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Since August 1999 when Casters Realm fully launched we have expanded our EverQuest site to provide news, spell lists, FAQ's, item lists, map lists, and tradeskill info.&nbsp; Short of providing quest walkthroughs we cover just about every aspect of EQ nowadays.&nbsp; We also try to work with the Dev team at SOE to provide insights into expansions or answer other high profile game issues.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>How much time do you spend keeping Casters Realm updated? Is this a full time job for you?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Casters Realm has been a full time job for me since May of 2000.&nbsp; Since then I have been working on expanding the network to cover more games while still keeping our aim of having only high quality information on the sites.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The challenge has been to keep the sites running without going to a subscription or pay service since the ad revenue which pays for hosting has dropped so much since the dot-com crash.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We are still here though and hope to continue being here and being free for all people to get their game information.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>Ok, gotta ask. What is the green stuff you served me at the Seattle Fan Faire?</STRONG> <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Ahh the famous 'Ectoplasm'.&nbsp; This one actually came from a friend of mine named Joel.&nbsp; The Casters Realm team has a bit of a tradition of throwing room parties at the Fan Faires and we decided to really go all out at the one in San Diego.&nbsp; Joel brought a blender with him, I filled up the bath tub with ice and 'beverages' and as the people arrived Joel started mixing up the famous green glowing drink!&nbsp; Since then we've been keeping the tradition going whenever we can and hope to do so once again in Boston.</P>
<P><EM>(Another Special Note: Rest assured, the tradition lived on in Boston.)</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Speaking of Fan Faires. What do you think of them? Lot of fun?</STRONG> <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Fan Faires are a very different experience than many people expect.&nbsp; The first Fan Faire I went to was in Las Vegas in the middle of summer.&nbsp; I partied a little too hard and spent most of the actual fan faire day in recovery (back then the main day started around 10:00 am, thankfully it's around 1:00 pm now).&nbsp; It was an awesome day doing trivia, solving EQ quests and puzzles and generally having a good time meeting people.&nbsp; Since then I have been to Fan Faires in Baltimore, San Diego, Dallas, Seattle, and soon I'll be attending to Boston.&nbsp; I've only missed two of the Fan Faires so far and the launch party for Velious (I was living in Australia at the time and it was a bit too far to travel for one night).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Nowadays we mainly attend the Fan Faires to meet both the people who play the game and those behind it: Developers, Customer Service and the like.&nbsp; Cindy puts in an enormous amount of work to make each Fan Faire better and we are really looking forward to the upcoming one in August which sold out back in June.&nbsp; We will also be selling some shirts with a print from our recent art competition to help fund the site.&nbsp; If you come to Boston make sure you come and say hello.</P>
<P><STRONG>What is your most memorable moment regarding your EverQuest experience?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Wow that's a hard one.&nbsp; I have a few moments which really stick out in my memory.&nbsp; I made my first 10 or so levels in Nektulos Forest and I remember the first time I zoned into East Commons and saw a blue sky.&nbsp; I went there to help a troll shadow knight who needed me to buy a combine sword for him with my illusion from the vendors in Oasis.&nbsp; Back then combine swords were highly prized because they could hit magical mobs and most people were using rusty swords, giant snake fangs or runed totem staffs.&nbsp; So we went out and after being amazed the sky could be blue and there were places other than Nektulos Forest he told me to keep my eyes in the sky because Griffins attacked (I was paranoid of them for the next couple of months until I managed to kill one by myself), we finally made it to Oasis and purchased his items.&nbsp; He gave me 1 gold for helping him out (which has a lot to me at level 9 or so) and then we both met a simultaneous demise underneath the foot of a sand giant.&nbsp; It was however my first 'group' experience as an enchanter and it certainly made me excited to start playing in zones other than Nektulos.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Other than that my fondest memories are being the first on my play server to get an Insidious Robe, an awesome day in Sky when myself and some enchanters almost mezzed enough Azaracks to clear the isle (before Kunark raised the Level Cap), helping my guildmates camp Guk for two weeks back in late 1999 so every one of us had an SMR (we were almost all casters at that time) and of course the dinging 50 with my first main character.</P>
<P><STRONG>Thanks Baelish!</STRONG></P>
