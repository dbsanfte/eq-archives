			Skills
		</h2>
	
	Your character possesses a few basic skills
  at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense Heading and Bind
  Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally known to
  those of a specific race or class, while others that you don't originally
  know can be learned over time (such as Meditation if you are a spell caster).
  <BR><BR>In order to use a skill you'll want to place it on an easily accessed hot key
  button. <BR><BR>To do this: <BR><BR>* Click on the Skills Tab (the hand) of the Actions Window.<BR>* Right-click on an empty hot button slot.<BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* Click that Hot Button to use the skill. <BR><BR>Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and click <STRONG>Skills</STRONG> to see how
  proficient you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better
  you become at it. When your skills improve messages appear in your chat
  window.
