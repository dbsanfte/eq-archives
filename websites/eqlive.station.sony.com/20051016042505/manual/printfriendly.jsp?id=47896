			Appendix D - Priest Archetype Abilities

	<STRONG>Priest Archetype Abilities</STRONG>  <BR><BR>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Clerics, Druids and Shaman, as
  well as Beastlords, Paladins and Rangers. The first skill level of each
  Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each
  Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each
  Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are
  passive. <BR><BR><BR><EM>Channeling Focus</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
  chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. The first skill
  level reduces the chance of interruption but 5%, the second skill level
  increases the reduction to 10% and the third brings the reduction to 15%. <BR><BR><EM>Healing Adept</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the
  character's effectiveness with instant effect healing spells. The first skill
  level increases the effectiveness of the character's healing spells by 2%,
  the second skill level raises the healing increase to 5% and the third raises
  the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><EM>Healing Gift</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character
  a chance for a 'critical' healing effect when casting instant effect healing
  spells. A critical effect will double the healing granted by the spell. The
  first skill level grants a 3% chance for a critical healing spell, the second
  skill level raises the critical healing chance to 6% and the third raises the
  chance to 10%. <BR><BR><EM>Mental Clarity</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the
  character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the
  character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds. <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Fury</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to
  do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level increases
  the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. The first skill
  level gives a 2% chance for critical damage, the second increases the chance
  to 4% and the third increases the change to 7%. <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Mastery</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the
  caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell
  he is casting. This works for all spell types. The result is a reduced chance
  of spell failure (fizzle) and a greater chance of a reduction of the mana
  cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use
  his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill
  level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability
  because they do not have the specialization skill. <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Reinforcement</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level
  increases the duration of caster's &quot;buff&quot; spells. The first skill
  level increases the duration of buffs by 5%, the second raises the increase
  to 15% and the third raises the increase to 30%.
