			5.14
			Main Chat Window
		</h2>
	
	The Chat Window is located in the bottom and center of your screen and has a title bar labeled Main Chat. <BR><BR>The chat bar has two basic parts. The larger section at the top of the window is where all incoming text for that chat window will be displayed. The smaller section at the bottom is the chat bar, and that is where you type in any text that you want to send to other players in the game. <BR><BR>All conversation, informational messages and other text will be displayed here. Though you have a lot of options to customize this feature. <BR><BR><B>Right-click options</B> - along with the standard window options, there are several options unique to the Chat Window. <BR><BR><I>New Chat Window</I> - this option creates an additional chat window in the default location (this means that if you have not moved your Main Chat Window the new chat window will appear on top of the Main Chat window). New chat windows have all the options available to the Main Chat Window. But new chat windows start out with all filters on by default. This means that no chat will appear in new chat windows unless you turn at least one of the filters off. <BR><BR><I>Filters</I> - Selecting Filters will display a list of the types of text messages that you can filter (say, tell, group, guild, OOC, auction, shout, emotes, chat channel, melee, spells, skills and other: other is everything not listed previously). Selecting an item from the list toggles the text type on or off. Remember, by default your Main Chat Window shows all text and New Chat Windows show no text. <BR><BR><I>Channel</I> - the Channel selection sets the default channel that your character speaks to (say, tell, group, guild, OOC, auction and chat channel). By default this is set to Say. So if you just type into the chat bar you will be speaking in /say. If you change the channel to OOC, then your default chat will be sent to the /ooc channel. <BR><BR><I>Language</I> - the Language selection sets the default language for the chat window. The option will list all languages that your character can speak. Choosing a language from the list sets it as your default chat language. Common is set as the default all chat windows. <BR><BR><I>Usage Tip: One really handy use of multiple chat windows is to keep track of guild (or group) chat independent of other chat. This is easy to do. Just right-click the Main Chat Window and select New Chat Window. Position the new window where you want it, then right-click in that window and choose Filters then Guild. The new window will now only show you messages from your Guild. At this point you may also want to switch the filter for Guild in you main chat window so that it will not show up there.</I> <BR><BR>Using Shift-Page Up and Shift-Page Down will allow you to scroll through chat windows in much the same way that the mouse wheel does. <BR><BR>
