<h2>Masters of the Quest</h2>
<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG>Masters of
  the Quest</STRONG></P>  <P>Check your reality at the door, this is Dreamland, and you're in their
  world now. They are the Quest Masters of EverQuest, and like the mythical
  Norns, these three weave the history of Norrath-past, present, and future.</P>  <P>The Quest Masters-QMs for short-are responsible for spinning the stories
  of this hugely popular massively multiplayer online roleplaying game
  (MMORPG). They hold in their hands the cosmos in which Norrath exists,
  shaping it, changing it, and enriching its history and background to make it
  an evolving-and involving-world for players. Their stories are then brought
  to life through dynamic quests run by the Quest Masters, with assistance from
  Game Masters.</P>  <P>Adventures can take place anywhere, and anything can happen. Mark Halash,
  one of the three original QMs, says, &quot;if we decide that Cazic-Thule has
  become displeased with his followers and slays them all, we can recommend a
  change to the Temple of Cazic-Thule  zone to have a bunch of zombies in it. The change to Kithicor Wood is an
  example of this kind of change.&quot;</P>  <P>Mark, Amanda Flock and Lydia  Pope are the Quest Masters. Mark and Lydia  both worked as Lead Game Masters before the team was assembled. Amanda, the
  &quot;baby&quot; of the group as she refers to herself, worked as a Game
  Master as well.</P>  <P>In May of 2000, Jeff Butler, the Producer for EverQuest Live and the
  forthcoming Shadows of Luclin Expansion, tapped all three to join the
  fledgling team. &quot;The Quest Masters were chosen for their talent at
  writing original dynamic storylines, online roleplaying ability, and
  organizational skills.&quot;</P>  <P>The team has run many historical quests for numerous ongoing storylines.
  One such storyline, called &quot;<A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/quests/index.jsp">The Child of
  Hate</A>&quot; progressed for over a year. The team gave us a look behind the
  scenes of an event from this storyline last year:</P>  <P>&quot;We have four plot lines running now,&quot; says Amanda Flock as she awaits
  the arrival of the other actors who will help enact this newest installment
  of the story. The server is E'ci (pronounced Ee-see). Amanda is in the
  character of the Emissary D'Velu, a sharp-tongued and imperious dark elven
  matriarch.</P>  <P>&quot;Trying to base quests around players is difficult,&quot; she says.
  &quot;Predicting their actions while, at the same time, keeping the story
  moving forward is hard.&quot; Players have important roles in the dynamic
  quests, despite this unpredictability, and can often find themselves as
  pivotal elements in the history of Norrath. &quot;We try to get the players
  involved as much as possible. The actors call out to the players for
  assistance during the quests to bring them into it.&quot;</P>  <P>There are two forms of quests in EverQuest. The first is referred to as
  the &quot;static quest.&quot; This is a hard-coded quest that remains in the
  game for an indefinite period, and runs independent of human game master
  control. Players can often give a friendly hail to a Non-Player Character
  (NPC) that will trigger an introductory response, usually hinting at some
  problem the NPC has, or a task he or she needs help completing. It is up to
  the player to take key words from the NPC's revelations and recast them in
  questions or replies, which will unlock the full story.</P>  <P>Static quests are the province of the Development Team, and are usually
  permanent fixtures in the game, which can be accessed by as many players as
  are able to trigger the correct responses from the NPC and successfully
  complete the mission. Several of these types of quests were added just
  recently, each being geared toward a specific class. They are not easy by any
  means, but the rewards for successfully finishing them are well worth the
  effort.</P>  <P>The other form of quest in the game is the dynamic quest. These events are
  the sovereignty of the Quest Masters, and can often lead to massive changes
  in the game world. They are performed in the game just once, and then become
  recorded history. They require the assistance of the Game Masters and
  volunteers, as well as a specialized team known as the Quest Troupe to enact.</P>  <P>&quot;We don't announce the dynamic quests ahead of time,&quot; says Mark
  Halash. &quot;We want them to be a surprise, but also don't want two thousand
  people showing up in one zone for the event. Even though the new network code
  is really robust, that's just too much for one zone to handle.&quot;</P>  <P>All of the actors have assembled for today's installment in the Child of
  Hate plot line, and it begins in the dark elf forest   of Nektulos. A small group has
  formed around the Emissary D'Velu, played by Amanda. She asks if any Teir'Dal
  (the name of the dark elven race) are willing and worthy to assist their
  Master Innoruuk, the god of Hate. Several players come forward and Emissary
  D'Velu considers each one. This part of the story is designed to involve
  lower level players, who often feel they are left out of these big events.
  Amanda checks their classes and levels to find those most suited to the task,
  and looks for someone who is playing his or her role well. A young male named
  Amarizzt is picked to assist.</P>  <P>Some players are more interested in disrupting the action during a dynamic
  quest than participating. Unfortunately for one High Elf cleric on this
  particular day, brashly attacking a high-ranking emissary outside of the Dark
  Elven hometown by himself proves not to be a prudent move. Amanda roleplays
  the attack, however, and the Emissary quickly vanquishes her attacker. The
  player does not lose valuable experience points, but does learn to be more
  discriminating when picking his battles in the future!</P>  <P>The story unfolds dramatically, as Emissary D'Velu faces off against Lanys
  T'Vyl, the one-time Chosen of Innoruuk. &quot;We're getting away from
  scripts, letting the actors role-play it out,&quot; says Mark.</P>  <P>Instead of a word-for-word script to follow, the actors are provided with
  a loose outline, broken into numbered sections to help keep everyone
  synchronized. It is working well today as Amanda fires off sharp accusations
  in the voice of Emissary D'Velu at Lanys T'Vyl, who retorts with indignant
  fury. &quot;Using scripts lead to the feeling that we were just acting out a
  'school pageant' for some players. This way of doing it is less mechanical
  and allows for more player interaction.&quot;</P>  <P>&quot;Our desire is to tell the story of Norrath, and to advance the
  history of our game world in general,&quot; says Jeff Butler. &quot;Dynamic
  events created by the team can also include risks beyond that found in the
  normal game, giving us the opportunity to introduce artifacts and unique
  treasures.&quot; At the conclusion of today's quest, Amarizzt, the Teir'Dal
  roleplayer who assisted the Emissary, is rewarded for his loyalty with a
  magical cloak.</P>  <P>&quot;The Quest Masters have nearly complete freedom with the
  stories,&quot; says Jeff Butler. &quot;I continue to make an effort to shape
  the unfolding storyline, and put forth as many original ideas as possible.
  It's the Quest Masters themselves, and their predecessors, who really make it
  all come to life.&quot;</P>  <P>To learn more about EverQuest's dynamic quests, exciting history, Game
  Masters, and current events, portal yourself over to <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/index.jsp">Harpy's Head
  Tavern&#8482;</A> and find your own place in the pantheon of Norrath's
  heroes!</P>  <P><BR><BR></P>
