<P><SPAN class=header><STRONG><BR>Scars of Velious FAQ</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><U class=header>Zones and Design</U> </P></DIV>
<P align=justify><B>Is it true that the zones of Velious are structured in a linear fashion, and as such, does it require various quests and keys to move from one zone to the next? (Ruoker Bochfury, Erollisi Marr)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The new zones are not linear, though exploration may uncover some specific areas which <I>could</I> be considered so.</P>
<P align=justify><B>How many zones will there be? (Eleets, wizard on Druzzil Ro)</B></P>
<P align=justify>At the time of shipping, the continent will have 19 new zones.</P>
<P align=justify><B>I have heard that barbarians will receive a new starting city. Is this true? (Jaeden, Solusek Ro)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No. The zones of the new continent will be geared to adventurers of approximate levels 30 through 60, so there would be no place for young ones to "grow" safely.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will there be quests for all levels? (Eleets, wizard on Druzzil Ro)</B></P>
<P align=justify>As was mentioned above, the zones will be geared to levels 30-60, so though some quests could be performed by lower level players, they are not exactly designed for them.</P>
<P align=justify><B>What are the levels required to play the Velious expansion when it comes out? If it is only 35th level and above why would someone without a character that high want to buy it? (Keveri Gatecaller, Bertoxxulous)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Though the expansion is designed for higher level characters (30-60), there are no actual <I>requirements</I> for entering the zones, other than those which may exist in the planes. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Will there be any additions to the weather in SoV like hail, wind, or tornado storms? (Artistikone, Barbarian Warrior of the 35th Battle, The 7th Hammer Server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No.</P>
<P align=justify><B>What will the new planes in Velious be and what gods will be in them? (Naeadil of Bertoxxulous)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Planes of Growth and Mischief, along with their deities Tunare and Bristlebane will finally be reachable by the adventurers of Norrath. What those planes will hold is up to you to discover.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will there be banking and merchants in Velious for all races? (Binben, Lanys)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes, but don't forget that factions will have some effect in this department, as always.</P>
<P align=justify><B>How will adventurers go to and from the new continent? (Neplian of Tarew Marr)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The remarkable ship known as the Icebreaker will be put into service as a means of transportation to that continent. It is currently the only ship capable of making the journey. Eventually, those adventurers who are capable of more exotic means of travel will no doubt find other methods.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Where will the Ice Breaker boat dock be located, and will it be the only boat to Velious? (Akherat Nahk'Magus, 44th Magician, Sentinels of Chaos, The Tribunal)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes, the Icebreaker is the only boat capable of making the trip. The dock will be in the Northern Desert of Ro.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Is it true that the characters will carry on their factions with the Ring of Scale to Velious, thus making you automatically an enemy to the Dragons if you've killed enough of their cousins in Antonica and Kunark? (Chromwel Lacdana, Terris-Thule Server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The whims of dragonkind are a mystery to most mortals. Caution is recommended whenever such dangerous creatures are encountered. More than that, however, you will have to discover for yourself.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Are there areas where you cannot be bound? (Eleets, wizard on Druzzil Ro)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Aside from the obvious class restrictions on binding one's self to a location, there will very likely be other areas in which it is not possible.</P>
<P align=justify><B>As this is an ice &amp; snow based continent does that mean the inhabitants have a stronger resistance to cold spells and weapons, and less resistance to Heat &amp; Fire type ones? (Eleets, wizard on Druzzil Ro)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Ahhh... another question whose answer will come with exploration and experimentation.</P>
<P align=justify><B>What is the relative size of the Velious zones when compared to Kunark and then to the old-world? (Dimuyen Sylvanesty, Keeper of the Art, Shadowed Fates)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Some are very large, and others are not. It's hard to give an "average" description that would be meaningful regarding individual zones, but the overall addition to the world of Norrath is over 20%.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will Velious feature more "one-way zones" like Chardok's? (Dimuyen Sylvanesty, Keeper of the Art, Shadowed Fates)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Exploration is the key! Exploration and experimentation!</P>
<P align=justify><B>Are these expanded lands the 'home' to any particular race or species? (Genny of Terris-Thule)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Coldain dwarves have lived there for centuries, and there are many other species being discovered every day.</P>
<DIV align=center></DIV>
<P align=center><IMG src="/images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>
<P align=center><U class=header>New Features</U> </P>
<P align=justify><B>Are all races receiving new armor textures, Iksar included? (Ancalagon, Iksar warrior of Drinal)</B></P>
<P align=justify>There will indeed be new armor textures for all. Six per race per gender. In other words, twelve for each race, divided into six for male characters and six for female characters.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will there be a variety of new skills in the Velious expansion? (Webilo Fyreshot, 45 season ranger of Rodcet Nife)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No truly <I>new </I>ones are planned, but you will find that many of those with which you may already be familiar are being greatly enhanced.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will players who don't own Kunark be able to pass level 50 if they purchase Velious? </B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes.</P>
<P align=justify><B>If I do not buy Velious can I still trade for items from there? (Binben, Lanys)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes. If an item is possible to be traded (i.e., not "no-drop"), it can be traded anywhere in Norrath. </P>
<P align=justify><B>I've heard many rumors about the level cap going up to 70. Is this true? (Kiriskhon, Enchanter of Brell Serilis)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No, this is just a rumor, as you said. In fact, there are no plans to make this happen in the foreseeable future.</P>
<P align=justify><B>I have heard a rumor that the spells in Velious will only work while in the Velious zones. Now I know some of these cannot be (TP spells for one) but what about the others? (Fizzlebee Tinyfoot, Archmage, Mithril Heart Brigade, Tribunal Server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The nature of magic is transitory. While it is difficult to predict what may be discovered in that field of study, at present, there is no knowledge of any such restriction (other than the obvious ones you mentioned).</P>
<P align=justify><B>Velious was shaped long ago by the claw of Veeshan, why has it taken so long for these lands to be discovered? (Gnoya Weebad, Leader of "Eternal Geas," 51 Elementalist, Mith. Marr)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Until recently, the continent remained a mystery to the rest of the civilizations of Norrath because of the nature of the Iceclad Ocean. As its name suggests, it is filled with jagged icebergs and expansive ice floes - a <I>very </I>dangerous body of water. Before the gnomes of Ak`Anon created an ocean vessel with the capability of navigating the roughest seas and breaking through the ice. There is a particularly rough stretch of ice known as the Frigid Barrier, which has prevented travel to that continent since time immemorial. Isn't science wonderful?</P>
<P align=justify><B>We have seen the soul-bound items before, such as certain keys to high level dungeons. With the release of Velious, will we see other types of soul bound Items/weapons? (Gnoya Weebad, Leader of "Eternal Geas," 51 Elementalist, Mith Marr)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Anything is possible in this land of discovery and wonder. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Can you explain more about this "velium" substance that items will be made out of? Rumor has it, it only works on the continent of Velious. (Kiron Larethian of the Prexus server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The use of velium by the Coldain dwarves has, so far, been limited to the island of Velious. Until the gnomish scientists have an opportunity to study it thoroughly, in and out of its native location, it would be premature to speculate.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Are those stingy gnomes going to charge us for a ride on their nifty ship? (Lianna, Quellious)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No, no, of course not. Though, knowing them, they'll likely make up for this generosity when you visit them in Velious. *grin*</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="/images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>
<P align=center><U class=header>Purchase, Availability, and Use</U> </P>
<DIV align=center></DIV>
<P align=justify><B>Will current EQ players be able to buy the new expansion from the on-line store? (Jabak, Bristlebane)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes, though the timing on having it available there is not certain as of the time this question was asked.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will it be necessary to have the Ruins of Kunark expansion to be able to utilize the Scars of Velious expansion? (Jeremy Ramsey, Veeshan, as Nowun Yewnough)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No, each expansion is separate. Neither is required to make use of the other.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will current EQ players be able to just buy an upgrade for SoV rather then buying a whole new game (similar to what they did for RoK)? If so, where can we buy this upgrade? What will the cost be? (Kiron Larethian of the Prexus server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Yes, the upgrade is being sold separately. Stores are already accepting pre-orders for it, and it is being sold online as well. The cost will be around $20.00 (not including tax, of course).</P>
<P align=justify><B>What happens if someone without the expansion tries to zone into a Velious-only area? (Jericho Foehammer, Shiny-Armored Do-Gooder, Saryrn)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The player will be bounced to a designated area of the zone they are trying to leave, as if the zone they attempted to enter were down.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will I be able to visit Kunark if I purchase the Scars of Velious upgrade and not the Ruins of Kunark one? (Callee McVeal, Erollisi Marr)</B></P>
<P align=justify>No. Each expansion is a separate product and only provides access to that area of the world.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Will Velious include Kunark zones, so that if we didn't purchase the RoK expansion we'd be able to visit these zones if we buy Velious? (Jacara Larse of Morell Thule)</B></P>
<P align=justify>Velious is packaged <I>only</I> as an add-on expansion. There are no plans to package it as a complete product as was the case with Kunark.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="/images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>
<DIV align=center>
<P><U class=header>Technical</U></P></DIV>
<P align=justify><B>What are the minimum system requirements needed to run Velious? (Kiron Larethian of the Prexus server)</B></P>
<P align=justify>The minimum requirements are: Windows&reg; 98/00, a Pentium&reg; 200 processor, 64 MB of RAM, Direct 3D or Glide compliant graphics accelerator card with 8 MB of video RAM, a DirectX 8.1a compatible sound card, 28.8k bps internet connection, 2X speed CD-ROM, and 600MB+ of hard drive space. Naturally, the recommended specs are a bit higher, including a Pentium&reg; 350 or greater processor, 128 MB or RAM, 16 MB of video RAM, and a 4X speed CD-ROM.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Is this an upgrade to the game engine in any way? (Genny of Terris-Thule)</B></P>
<P align=justify>There are changes to the graphics that you will notice, such as the interface itself, but the game engine itself is not being changed other than the changes that are made here and there on an ongoing basis.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="/images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>
<DIV align=center>
<P><U class=header>Crystal Ball Section</U> </P></DIV>
<P><B>Is this the last expansion for EverQuest, and if not, what are future plans? (Dolumar Lifespring, Woodlands Elf druid, Morell-Thule)</B></P>
<P>Keep your eyes on the Station website for news on this kind of thing. Right now, it's too soon to comment.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
