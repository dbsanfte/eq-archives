<h1>New Interface now on Test</h1>
	So if you've got the time and desire, please check it out.<P>Here's the patch message from Test.<P>(By the way, don't forget this is the Test server, and that entails).<P>---<P>** Monday, June 24 2002.<P>Welcome to the open beta phase of testing for EverQuest's new interface!<P>It still has a few rough edges and some pieces that aren't complete, but after using it in-house for a couple weeks, we'd like to see how well it does in front of a larger audience.<P>By now, you've downloaded all of the graphics and layout files.  If you choose to run the new interface, please edit your EQCLIENT.INI file and, under the defaults section, add the line:<P>NewUI=TRUE<P>...and feel free to have a look around!  <P>As always, your feedback is welcomed through the Developer's Corner.  <P><BR>* Random new toys worth checking out in the new interface:<P>- Item Inspection: Alt-Leftclick now pops up the inspect box and keeps it there.<P>- Quantity Selection: You can now type numbers when referring to stackable items and coins.<P>- Key Mapper: Every top level window still has a hotkey you can use to open and close it, and all of the keys can still be remapped through the Options screeen.  (The hex nut icon in the window selector, or Alt-O by default).  To turn the window selector itself on and off, the default key is Alt-W.<P>- Mousewheel: ...should automatically work in every UI screen that has a scroll bar. (including Chat, Merchants, Looting, etc.)<P><BR>* For those interested in developing custom skins for the interface:<P>You'll notice that there is now a directory called UIFiles beneath your EverQuest install directory.  <P>The default skin (aka "The New UI") is stored in the directory called, predictably "default," and we've included a document called "AboutSIDL.doc" in the UIFiles directory.<P>If you make yourself a new skin, please create a separate directory for it in the UIFiles directory.  Once the skin is in there, you can switch to it by typing "/loadskin &lt;directory_name&gt;"<P>Working with the skins at this point is not an activity for the faint of heart, but if you're inclined to hack around in those files, AboutSIDL will hopefully help out a bit.<P>This one we definitely can't just sign "- The EverQuest Development Team."  <P>Many, many people have contributed to this effort, be it artwork, technology, or suggestions.<P>So, for now, we'll sign it this way:<P>- The EverQuest Team<BR>- The Sovereign Team<BR>- The SOE Platform Art Team<BR>- The SOE Testing Department<BR>- The SOE Game Operations Team<BR>- The SOE Customer Service Department<BR>- The SOE Platform Coding Team

I have mine (Druid) very organized, and I know of others who also have their books organized.<BR>Could you please let me know what the development team's thoughts are with this.<BR>BTW I love the rest of the new interface!</B><P>Spells will remain in the same general order, but their page numbers will change.<P>So, yes, youll probably have to reorganize your spell book once the interface goes live.  But the ability to see more spells on one page seems like a good trade off for the one-time expense of reorganization.<P>Alan<BR>
