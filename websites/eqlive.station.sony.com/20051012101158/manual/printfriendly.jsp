  created <BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Play</STRONG> after the patcher program is done downloading any files <BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Account</STRONG>, then click on <STRONG>New Account</STRONG> to register and
  set up a name and password for your new account. You will need your CD Key
  here to set up the account <BR><BR>* Choose a password that NO ONE will know. Account security is the
  responsibility of the account holder. Please note EverQuest accounts are not
  to be shared. Each family member should have their own account. The exception
  to this that parents may purchase an account for a child. Please refer to the
  End User License Agreement, which you click <STRONG>I Accept</STRONG> to every time you
  play EverQuest, for a detailed description of policies regarding account
  sharing. Please be sure to let us know if your email address changes in the
  future by changing your account information from www.station.sony.com if it
  happens to change due to switching ISPs, etc. Keeping your email address up
  to date is important, as it is our primary method of contact with you. <BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Change Account</STRONG> to set up a billing option. You will need a
  credit card to do this.<BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Connect</STRONG> to start the game.<BR><BR>* Select a server on the list, then click <STRONG>Play EverQuest</STRONG>.<BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Create New Character</STRONG>. At this point, you will be
  required to choose a race, class and deity. You will also need to invest your
  ability points into your attributes. The recommended attributes to add to are
  colored green.<BR><BR>* Before your character is done, you need to choose a name. It is strongly
  suggest you read the EverQuest naming policy before choosing a name. In order
  to protect our role playing environment, the naming policy is necessary.
  Please refer to the naming policy at www.EverQuest.com before selecting a
  name for your character. Also, you can choose to click on <STRONG>Get Name</STRONG> for
  our random name generator to suggest some names you might like. Be aware that
  some of these names have been taken by other players, so you may not get a
  random name approved every time. <BR><BR>* Once you have chosen a name, you may or may not be able to change your
  starting city (most races only have one starting city, though some have two).
  After a deity and starting city has been determined, click <STRONG>Enter World</STRONG>  to start the game.

	
		<h2>
			3.3
			Arriving in Norrath
		</h2>
	
	You begin the game in your
  starting city with these items (press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to view them): <BR><BR>* 20 Bread cakes and 20 skins of milk<BR>* Spells (for some classes)<BR>* Standard weapon (dagger, sword, or club)<BR>* Scroll with instructions (a tattered note: right click on the scroll to
  read it)<BR>Next, read the scroll (right-click on it) and follow the instructions.
  Usually it will ask you to give your message scroll to your Guild Master. He
  or she will then give you a basic item of clothing and more information about
  what to do next. <BR><BR>To equip the new item: <BR><BR>* Press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to open your inventory<BR>* Click on the clothing item to pick it up<BR>* Click on the central area of the inventory screen in order to wear it <BR><BR>The central area of your inventory screen is an auto-equip area. Dropping an
  item into the auto equip area will equip the item, provided there is nothing
  in the slot the item goes in and your class, race, and deity can wear or use
  it. If the item cannot be worn it will automatically go to one of the main
  inventory slots. If those are full, the item will go into the first
  container, starting in the upper left most portion of your inventory. If all
  main inventory slots and containers are full, the item will drop to the
  ground. Be aware that some merchants and NPCs are greedy and might pick up
  items they see lying on the ground. This also can be said about other players
  as well.

	
		<h2>
			3.4
			Moving Around
		</h2>
	
	The keyboard is your main control
  for movement in EverQuest, while the mouse controls the cursor and your
  current point of view. <BR><BR><STRONG>Running and Walking</STRONG> <BR><BR>To walk forward and backward, press the arrow keys on the keyboard or the
  Numpad keys. <BR>Other helpful movement keys: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Control-r</EM></STRONG> to toggle Run and Walk mode.<BR><BR><STRONG>Number Lock</STRONG> to toggle AutoRun.<BR><EM>Note: hitting forward or backward movement keys (arrows) will also end
  AutoRun.</EM><BR><BR><EM><STRONG>Control-Right </STRONG></EM>or<EM><STRONG> Left Arrow</STRONG></EM> to step sideways.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Spacebar</EM></STRONG> to jump.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>d</EM></STRONG> to duck down.<BR><BR>Looking around using the mouse or numpad keys to change your current point of
  view: <BR><BR>Right-click-and-drag mouse to look around.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 9, 3</EM></STRONG> Pan view up, down.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 5</EM></STRONG> Re-center view.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 7, 1</EM></STRONG> Zoom view in, out.<BR><BR><STRONG>Swimming</STRONG> <BR><BR>Most cities in Norrath are conveniently located near ponds or large bodies of
  water, and some even have fountains and underwater aqueduct systems. You can
  swim in water for a short period of time. The better you are at swimming, the
  longer you can hold your breath. <BR><BR>To swim: <BR><BR>* Walk into the water.<BR><EM>Notice that a new gauge appears. This is an important gauge; it indicates
  how much air you have left. When it runs out your character will begin to
  suffocate.</EM> <BR>* Pan your view down and move forward to swim down.<BR>* Watch your air gauge. When it gets low, emerge for air.<BR>* Pan your view up and move forward to swim up to take a breath.<BR><EM>Note: You can swim with your head above water by panning the view up
  slightly.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			3.5
			Communicating
		</h2>
	
	<P>EverQuest provides an ongoing source of social interaction. You can chat
  with fellow players on message boards, or talk to NPCs and other players
  within the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity
  &quot;hear&quot; you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text
  portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send
  private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and
  all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>To send messages to characters near&nbsp;you&nbsp;in the game:</EM> <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text
  cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message.<BR><EM>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode,
  which is the default setting.</EM></P>  <P><EM>To send messages only to a specific character:</EM></P>  <P>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to
  activate the text cursor.<BR>* Type /tell [charactername] [your message].<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. </P>  <P>Use the <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> key to reply to the last person that sent you a
  /tell. <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> puts /tell [charactername] into your chat bar for you.
  All you have to do then is type the message and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>.</P>  <P><EM>To talk to a non-player character (such as
  a shopkeeper NPC):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the
  Target Window), then press <EM><STRONG>h</STRONG></EM>.<BR><EM>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</EM><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate
  keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using
  those words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><EM>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using
  inappropriate language.</EM> </P>

	
		<h2>
			3.6
			Attacking with Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in
  EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally easiest
  if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target, you
  can simply press <STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> (or whichever key you've remapped this
  function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your
  only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> Initiate auto-attack (on current target). <BR><EM><STRONG>Esc</STRONG></EM>ape Remove current target from Target Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long
  as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another
  swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot). </EM><BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If
  you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says
  &quot;Your target is too far away.&quot; Be sure to remain facing your
  target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow.
  Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and
  whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage,
  you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent
  is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and
  weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on
  your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A> for information on how damage affects you.

	
		<h2>
			3.7
			Using Magic
		</h2>
	
	Some classes start out with
  one or more spells. To learn (scribe and memorize) a spell: <BR><BR>* Click the spell book icon at the bottom of your Spells Windows to open your
  spell book.<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory to place the scroll on your cursor
  (you can right-click and hold&nbsp;on a scroll first to view its contents).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe (write) the spell.<BR><BR>Scribed spells are permanently recorded in your spell book. But you can't
  cast every spell in your book. You must first choose to memorize those
  spells. Characters can only memorize eight spells, so at higher levels it
  becomes a tactical decision as to which spells to keep 'in-mind'. <BR><BR>* Once it's scribed, click on the spell icon in your spell book.<BR>* A &quot;spell gem&quot; will appear on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the spell gems (the octagonal slots in your Spells Window)
  to memorize the spell.<BR><BR>To cast a spell: <BR><BR>* Click on a target. The target's name should appear in the target window
  (spells that affect only you don't require a target).<BR>* Click on a spell gem that is holding a memorized spell.<BR>* A casting timer will appear. This indicates the time your character needs
  to finish casting the spell.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to disappear, then cast again if you'd like.

	
		<h2>
			3.8
			Quick Cash
		</h2>
	
	When you start, you've got
  enough food and drink to last for a while. But eventually you will need more,
  and you might want to purchase better armor and equipment from a merchant. To
  do this, you'll need money. <BR><BR>By far the best way to gain that money is by defeating enemies. In the areas
  just outside of the city that you start in you will be able to find small
  creatures, often in plague proportions. You can aid your fellow citizens and
  earn cash in the process by defeating these pests and looting their corpses.
  Merchants will buy most of these items for a few copper pieces. It's not
  much, but it's a start. And at the same time you will be earning some
  experience, practice for much greater deeds to come. Just don't wander too
  far from your friendly guards until you've gained a few levels, or if you're
  feeling very brave. <BR><BR>FYI: 1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 silver = 1000 copper

	
		<h2>
			3.9
			Skills
		</h2>
	
	Your character possesses a
  few basic skills at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense Heading
  and Bind Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally
  known to those of a specific race or class, while others that you don't
  originally know can be learned over time (such as Meditation if you are a
  spell caster). <BR><BR>In order to use a skill you'll want to place it on an easily accessed hot key
  button. <BR><BR>To do this: <BR><BR>* Click on the Skills Tab (the hand) of the Actions Window.<BR>* Right-click on an empty hot button slot.<BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* Click that Hot Button to use the skill.<BR><BR>Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and click <STRONG>Skills</STRONG> to see how
  proficient you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better
  you become at it. When your skills improve messages appear in your Chat
  Window.

	
		<h2>
			3.10
			Experience
		</h2>
	
	You start out at Experience Level
  1 in whichever class you choose. As you gain experience through combat, you
  progress to the next level. <BR><BR>Open your inventory to view your current level and how much experience you
  need to advance to the next level. To gain experience; find your guild, kill
  creatures and complete quests. <BR><BR>You can learn more by reading <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=experiencelevels">Experience
  Levels</A>.

	
		<h2>
			3.11
			Acquiring, Selling and Buying Items
		</h2>
	
	The most common method of acquiring
  items is to defeat monsters in battle and take their stuff. It is important
  to note that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage you and/or your
  group did to that NPC was greater than anyone else or their group. It is
  considered good etiquette not to interfere in a combat unless asked (or you
  ask if the person needs aid and they say yes). <BR><BR><STRONG>To loot the corpse of an NPC (monster) or player you've killed:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It &quot;floats&quot; on your
  cursor.<BR>* Click on a free slot in your inventory.<BR><BR><STRONG>or you can use the shortcut method:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Right-click on an item in that inventory and the game will 'auto-equip' it
  by trying to place it in the most appropriate spot in your inventory (if
  there is room).<BR><BR><STRONG>To buy/sell an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (Note: you will have to be relatively close
  to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only receive
  the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the merchant
  window).<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click Trade to give them the item (the person receiving
  your gift will also have to click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>. <BR><BR><STRONG>If you accidentally drop an item, you can pick it up:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or
  as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot.

	
		<h2>
			3.12
			Exiting the Game
		</h2>
	
	Your character does not
  require food, drink or rest whenever you're not playing. The next time you
  start the game, your character's previous condition is restored. (For
  example, if you were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when
  you resume playing.) <BR><BR>To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Click <STRONG>Sit</STRONG>  on the Main Tab in the Actions Window, then <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> (this takes
  approximately 30 seconds). Then, click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>. <BR><BR>Or: <BR><BR>* Type /sit and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to make your character sit down<BR>* Type /camp and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to start the 30 second camp
  timer <BR><BR>When you return to the game later your character will be where you left him.
  Keep that in mind when choosing your campsite.

	Once your subscription is set
  up, you simply need to connect to a game server: <BR><BR>1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on the desktop. <BR><BR>2. Type in your Sony Station password and then click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG>. The
  screen that displays lists all of the available game servers. <BR><BR>3. Click on <STRONG>a server name</STRONG>, then click the large <STRONG>Play EverQuest</STRONG>  button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. <BR><BR>Your next step is to create a character. You can store up to eight characters
  on each game server. When first starting out, it might be a good idea to jot
  down the name of the server that you created your character on so that you
  can find it again. If you choose a different server you will find only a
  fresh set of empty character slots.

			Exiting the Game
		</h2>
	
	Your character does not require
  food, drink or rest whenever you're not playing. The next time you start the
  game, your character's previous condition is restored. (For example, if you
  were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when you resume
  playing.) <BR><BR>To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Click <STRONG>Sit</STRONG>  on the Main Tab in the Actions Window, then <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> (this takes
  approximately 30 seconds). Then, click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>. <BR><BR>Or: <BR><BR>* Type /sit and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to make your character sit down<BR>* Type /camp and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to start the 30 second camp
  timer <BR><BR>When you return to the game later your character will be where you left him.
  Keep that in mind when choosing your campsite.

	Once you log in and select a game
  server, the Character Select screen appears. It lets you create, manage and
  delete characters. Each of the eight Create New Character slots can store a
  single character that you create. The rest of this section shows you how to
  create a character, step-by-step. <BR><BR>* Click any <STRONG>Create New Character</STRONG> slot to begin. This displays the
  Character Creation screen. <BR><BR>* Follow the steps in the rest of this section to create a character. When
  you finish, you will return to this screen, and your character's name will
  appear in the slot you just chose. (In the future, you must select a server
  each time you log in, then click on a character slot to activate it.) <BR><BR>* Then click <STRONG>Enter World</STRONG> to start playing.

			Character Creation Screen
		</h2>
	
	This screen lets you build your
  character through a series of steps: <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 1 - Pick a Race</STRONG> <BR><BR>Norrath has 13 known races, each of which was established in a specific
  region of Norrath. All have unique talents and professions - for example,
  Humans are relatively smart and can pursue nearly all professions, while
  Ogres have fewer options, but excel in physical strength. <BR><BR>* Click a race to select it. (Notice that the starting statistics and the
  list of available Classes change for each race.) <BR><BR><STRONG>Races of Norrath</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Barbarian</EM></STRONG>: Warriors at heart, most of the Barbarians' history
  revolves around one war or another. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Halas <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (Shadows of Luclin only), Rogue, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dark Elf</EM></STRONG>: Dark Elves share the heritage and features of other
  elves in Norrath, but they are more evilly aligned. Home is almost always
  underground, so darkness poses no obstacle for Dark Elves. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Neriak <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow
  Knight, Warrior, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans,
  Iksar, Wood Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dwarf</EM></STRONG>: Short but strong, Dwarves outperform Humans in nearly
  all physical tasks. Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded
  by their dexterity. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kaladim <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erudite</EM></STRONG>: Self-pride and intellect persuade most Erudites to
  forego physical activity in favor of mental challenges. Social grace is their
  forti, and they believe themselves to be the pinnacle of evolution. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Erudin or Paineel (determined by class) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard,
  Shadow Knight <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Froglok</EM></STRONG>:
  Frogloks are a short race of sentient amphibians. Although they can swim
  underwater for long distances, they're clumsy on land and can only hop from
  place to place.<BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Gukta/Grobb,
  Antonica<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Cleric, Shaman,
  Paladin, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksars, Ogres,
  Trolls, Dark Elves<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Gnome</EM></STRONG>: Distant cousins to Dwarves, Gnomes tend to burrow in the
  hillsides in underground communities. A lack of surface light lends a pale
  hue to their skin tone, and they rarely emerge to mingle with other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Ak'Anon <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Rogue,
  Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Half Elf</EM></STRONG>: As Human-Elf hybrids, Half Elves share the prominent
  physical features of both races. Their intellect is a notch above most other
  races, though they suffer a lack of strength as compared to the other
  Norrathian races. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport,
  Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Halfling</EM></STRONG>: Short and Human-like, Halflings are by far the most
  nimble and mobile race in the world. Outstanding dexterity and agility come
  naturally, and they're natural travelers. Because of this, Halflings have
  developed peaceful relations with most other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Rivervale <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>High Elf</EM></STRONG>: Though they have physical traits in common with Wood
  Elves, High Elves are far more developed in the ways of the mind. Pale and
  thin, they prefer to spend their time exercising the confines of the mind,
  and not the body. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Felwithe <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Human</EM></STRONG>: Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport  <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: All but Shaman and Beastlord <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Iksar</EM></STRONG>: A tribal race, these lizard-like warriors carry on a
  rich heritage of conquest, enslavement and destruction. Iksar are quite
  intelligent (despite their large size and warrior-like ways) and prefer to
  socialize within their own circles. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: New Sebilis (also known as Cabilis) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight,
  Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial Tensions</EM>: All other races. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ogre</EM></STRONG>: Ogres spend as much time on the battlefield as Erudites
  and High Elves do exploring their intellect. With their gargantuan size and
  strength, they pass most of their days munching on available game and rarely
  give any thought to pursuing other interests. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Oggok <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Troll</EM></STRONG>: Despite a two-foot height difference, Trolls get along
  famously with Ogres, sharing similar likes, dislikes and pastimes. Outdoorsy and
  not quite bright, they're easily recognizable due to their skin's natural
  green tinge. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Grobb <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Vah
  Shir</EM></STRONG>: Vah Shir are a feline race that walks upright. They're as tall
  as Barbarians, and are selfless and focus only on the good of others. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Shar Vahl<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Rogue, Shaman,
  Beastlord, Bard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Indifferent to all
  other races<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wood Elf</EM></STRONG>: Yet another variation on the Elven-Human theme, Wood
  Elves are slightly weaker than Humans, but highly dexterous and agile.
  Despite their tendencies to be wild and secretive, they are very dedicated to
  the good of society. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 2 - Pick a Class</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your class (your characters occupation) describes your career goal in the
  game. You can pursue any life you choose in EverQuest, so long as your race
  permits it. <BR><BR>* Click an occupation to select it. (Note that each occupation gives you
  specific attributes that are marked with green numbers. When allocating
  ability points, concentrate on these characteristics.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bard</EM></STRONG>: The Bard has the unusual ability to play magical songs
  whose supernatural effects last as long as the Bard continues to sing. He has
  some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (self-defense), but his main focus
  is always his art. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Dexterity, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Beastlord (only available with Shadows of Luclin)</EM></STRONG>: Beastlords
  are the spiritual warriors of the primitive cultures of Norrath and Luclin.
  Like the Shaman, the Beastlords have a close relationship with the spirit
  world. The Beastlord's fighting style is derived from tactics used by wild
  beasts thus they prefer to fight unarmed or with only small piercing weapons.
  But the Beastlord is best known for his life-long animal companion. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +5 Agility, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Berserker</EM></STRONG>:
  Berserkers are fearsome fighters, wielding two-handed axes and hurling
  throwing weapons. They have the best throwing arms of all Norrath classes.
  Their innate rage causes them to reach a frenzied battle state known as
  &quot;berserk&quot;.<BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cleric</EM></STRONG>: A Cleric is a holy woman born with the power to heal,
  and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of her deity to smite her foes.
  Prayer is how the Cleric gains her ability. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Druid</EM></STRONG>: A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all
  flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He
  is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to
  call upon Nature for aid and defense. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Enchanter</EM></STRONG>: The primary focus of this art can be summed up by
  the name of the arcane order to which it belongs - enchantment. Spells are
  crafted to enchant people, places and things. An Enchanter can charm beings
  and make them fight for a new master, or magically enhance the capabilities
  of a sword-welding warrior. She even has some proficiency in offensive
  spells. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Intelligence, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Magician</EM></STRONG>: The Magician is the summoner of the arcane arts, and
  can conjure up everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to
  fight on his behalf. While not as offensively adept as a Wizard, a Magician
  still possesses considerable spell power. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Monk</EM></STRONG>: The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure
  weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor. She's very religious as
  well, and the gods are known to bless Monks by magically enhancing their
  attacks. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Necromancer</EM></STRONG>: The Necromancer belongs to the dark brotherhood of
  the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spells, he can animate dead
  bodies and skeletons to do his bidding, as well as cast spells to leach life
  from his victims. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Paladin</EM></STRONG>: A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of
  good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights
  nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to heal
  simply by Laying on Hands. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +5 Wisdom, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ranger</EM></STRONG>: The Ranger is a hybrid mix between a Warrior and a
  Druid, sharing the skills of both. He's most at home in the great outdoors. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rogue</EM></STRONG>: Falling somewhere between an assassin and a thief, the
  Rogue belongs to the secretive class of Norrath. She's quite skilled in
  weaponry, but prefers to make sudden attacks from behind. Shadier skills
  include Pick Lock and Pick Pockets. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shadow Knight</EM></STRONG>: The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight
  derives power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part
  Necromancer and has the innate ability to damage flesh with his Harm Touch. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Intelligence, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shaman</EM></STRONG>: Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch
  doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary
  focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells
  as well. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Warrior</EM></STRONG>: A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its
  forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much
  punishment as he doles out. By nature, Warriors have more health points than
  any other class. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +10 Stamina, +5 Agility <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wizard</EM></STRONG>: The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is
  spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar
  and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her
  a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of
  destruction. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 3 - Allocate Ability Points</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your character has primary and secondary statistics. Primary ones are bright
  green, and represent abilities most beneficial to your chosen occupation. The
  others are secondary, which means they still affect you, but aren't quite as
  important. <BR><BR>The box in the top right corner of the screen shows your bonus ability
  points. The amount differs by race and/or occupation. You can add these
  points to any ability - but you should probably add most of them to your
  green &quot;primary&quot; abilities. <BR><BR>* Click &quot;+&quot; to add a bonus point to an ability.<BR>* Click &quot;-&quot; to remove a bonus point from an ability. (You can't
  decrease any ability below its starting value, however.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Agility</EM></STRONG>: Physical agility; affects your probability of being
  hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Charisma</EM></STRONG>: How various factions react to you; affects prices for
  some merchants. Also affects spell effects for Enchanters and Bards, and
  helps Bards successfully play more notes. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dexterity</EM></STRONG>: Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver
  with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain
  skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects
  some skills and Bard songs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wisdom</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn specific skills. For a
  Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at
  each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Intelligence</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn many skills. For a
  Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard, it also
  affects maximum mana at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Stamina</EM></STRONG>: Health and constitution; affects your maximum number
  of hit points at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Strength</EM></STRONG>: Physical strength; affects how much you can carry,
  how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 4 - Pick a Facial Appearance</STRONG> <BR><BR>To change your character's face, click <STRONG>Set Face</STRONG> just above the picture
  of your character. Click the arrows to cycle through different facial
  appearances. To return to the full view of your character, click <STRONG>Accept</STRONG>.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 5 - Pick a Name</STRONG> <BR><BR>Either type in a name, or click <STRONG>Get Name</STRONG> to let the computer pick a
  name for you. You can't use spaces, dashes or special characters (#, ?,
  etc.). <BR><BR>* Click in the name field and type<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> to proceed <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 6 - Pick a Deity</STRONG> <BR><BR>The Deity Selection screen displays once you click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> from the
  Character Creation screen. Depending on your occupation and race, you can
  either choose from several of 18 specific deities, or remain agnostic (not a
  follower of any one god, perhaps unwilling to acknowledge their power). <BR><BR>* Click a deity to select it. The name of the god appears in the text to the
  right. <BR><BR><STRONG>Here are some generalizations about the followers of each of the available
  gods.</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bertoxxulous</EM></STRONG>: Lovers of decay and disease; dedicated to
  spreading both. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Brell Serilis</EM></STRONG>: Choose to inhabit the underground; generally a
  bit solitary. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe</EM></STRONG>: True believers of fun and mischief;
  doctrine disregards trust and honesty. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cazic-Thule</EM></STRONG>: Followers are ruled by fear; hate, cruelty and
  torture abound. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erolissi Marr</EM></STRONG>: Defend justice and innocence; love always
  overcomes hate. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Innoruuk</EM></STRONG>: Fervid proponents of hate; no loyalty exists between
  followers, and all that is Good is weak. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Karana</EM></STRONG>: Disciples of rain; respectful of the power of weather
  in the woodlands. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Mithaniel Marr</EM></STRONG>: Seek courage, honor and good; leave
  frivolousness to others. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Prexus</EM></STRONG>: Watchguards of the water; doctrine upholds that this
  deity will one day wash away all of Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Quellious</EM></STRONG>: Masters of inner peace and enlightenment; knowing
  one's true self will help bring peace to Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rallos Zek</EM></STRONG>: Warriors to the end; emphasizes survival of the
  strong and the true value of conflict. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rodcet Nife</EM></STRONG>: Selfless servants to the weak and diseased;
  preaches healing and cleansing as one's life work. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Solusek Ro</EM></STRONG>: Devoted followers of all things aflame; aggressive
  and purposeful in all that they do. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Tribunal</EM></STRONG>: Bringers of justice; the world is
  black-and-white, and all wrongs deserve an even revenge. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Tunare</EM></STRONG>: Trustees of Nature; the land Norrath is to be protected
  at all costs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Veeshan</EM></STRONG>: Worshippers and servants of all Dragonkind; doctrine
  calls for sacrifice and dedication. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 7 - Pick a Starting   City</STRONG> <BR><BR>The world of Norrath is populated with many cities, but not all are friendly
  to all races, occupations and beliefs. Race is the primary factor that
  determines your starting city - you'll always be able to start in at least
  one of the cities listed in Race. However, choosing a certain deity or
  occupation may affect your starting city. <BR><BR>You can start from any city with a yellow or white name. (You may be able to
  choose between two or more cities, or you might only have a single option.)
  The currently selected city's name is yellow; cities you cannot start from
  are faded out.<BR><BR>* Click a city to select it (you may or may not have more than one choice)<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> twice to return to the Character Selection screen <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're planning on playing with your friends in a new city, make sure
  everyone has a compatible race, class and deity.</EM>

			4.8
			Server Selection
		</h2>
	
	<P>Choosing a server is one of the first decisions you must
  make when you enter EverQuest. Though it is true that many people who have
  friends in game will choose the server where their friends are, it is
  generally recommended that unconnected people choose the least populated
  server for play. <BR><BR>There are also special servers with different rules from those of the
  majority of our servers. New players will want to take care before choosing
  to play on these servers, and read the rules for them before starting. Each
  server has a different theme and should you choose to play on one, the
  following information should be considered. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Rallos Zek Server (PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Rallos Zek Server is the oldest PvP server in EverQuest. On this server,
  everyone has the ability to attack each other subject to a 4 level limit. For
  instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41
  through 49. <BR><BR>In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server,
  the loot rules are &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot;. You may loot (or have looted
  from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item. Items in bags, in a melee
  slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be
  looted. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers (PvP Teams, Coin Only)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers is what we call PvP-Teams servers. Only races
  on opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.; The four teams are: <BR><BR>Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls<BR>Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.<BR>Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.<BR>Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians. <BR><BR>Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other
  three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can
  attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they
  are on opposing teams. <BR><BR>The loot rules on these servers differ from Rallos Zek. Only coin may be
  looted from a fallen opponent. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Sullon Zek Server (Deity based team PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this
  server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In
  general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon
  and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character
  worships rather than the race of the character. <BR><BR><STRONG>Sullon Zek rules: </STRONG><BR><BR>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are
  not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack
  and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his
  alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply. <BR><BR>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough
  strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to
  participate in PvP combat, unless they stray from city and newbie zones. As
  soon as a character 'dings' into 6th level he or she will become PvP enabled.
  <BR><BR>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character
  that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be
  the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your
  corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience. <BR><BR>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then
  only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character
  getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse. <BR><BR>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means
  that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new
  one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release
  of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that
  wish to explore these new characters. <BR><BR>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their
  Deity Team. <BR><BR>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is
  not on their Deity Team. <BR><BR>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players
  current level. <BR><BR>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player
  characters. <BR><BR>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player
  characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or
  'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they
  are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels. <BR><BR>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on.
  Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally'. <BR><BR>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their
  racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a
  faction loss with the locals. Freeport,
  Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of
  Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves
  (high elves and wood elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both
  starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of
  their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other
  cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a
  certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is
  not a dwarven home town. <BR><BR>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server.
  Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts
  through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters
  is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. <STRONG>HOWEVER: All
  rules regarding general decency still apply</STRONG>. Cursing, threats and other
  such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior
  on any PvP server. <BR><BR>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team. <BR><BR>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones. <BR><BR>16. 'Buff' spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than
  the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will
  supercede this rule. <BR><BR>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th
  level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be
  turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined
  at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal
  reward. <BR><BR>18. Naked corpses will disappear when looted by a player character. If you
  are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse <STRONG>will</STRONG> disappear
  when it is looted. <BR><BR><STRONG>The 'Teams':</STRONG> </P>  <P>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr,
  Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <BR>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos
  Zek<BR>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus,
  Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan. <BR><BR>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods,
  those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed.
  Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the
  god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics. <BR>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel
  Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the
  good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good. <BR><BR>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some
  ancient writings that opened up new avenues. <BR><BR>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon
  Corpse or something similar. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Firiona Vie (a roleplayint preferred server)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Firiona Vie server is a roleplaying preferred server. To motivate players
  to take advantage of the roleplaying atmosphere, the following feature list
  was implemented. <BR><BR>This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player)
  server. In other words, it's a standard &quot;blue&quot; server with the same
  rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. it is
  not one of teh &quot;Zeks&quot;. <BR><BR>* Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the
  caster. <BR><BR>* The Common language will not exist. A Human language will be added and only
  made easily available to certain races. <BR><BR>* Only one character can be created on each account. <BR><BR>* The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. <BR><BR>* Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as
  newbie notes and epic weapons. <BR><BR>* Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where
  melee characters can bind on other servers. <BR><BR><STRONG>* Trivial Loot Code *</STRONG> <BR><BR>Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC
  and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes
  effect. This can happen when either a member of your group is too high in
  level to receive experience from killing the monster, or when a member of
  your group is outside of the level range of the group for receiving
  experience from the kill. If any member of a group does not get experience
  for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code
  prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal
  items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Antonius Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Antonius Bayle is physically located in the United Kingdom. The rules for
  this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The only
  difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Kane Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Kane Bayle is physically located in Amsterdam.
  The rules for this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The
  only difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Test Server</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Test Server is a server maintained for testing new ideas, spells, NPCs,
  zones and many other new concepts. You can access the Test Server by running
  the testeverquest.exe file located in your EverQuest directory. <BR><BR>Because this is a functioning test server, you may find that you are
  downloading patches frequently from this server. If you play on a standard
  server, you may also have to patch files from those servers to play there to
  replace files altered by the Test Server patch process. <BR><BR>If you plan to play on the Test Server, please read the following disclaimer.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Test Server Disclaimer</STRONG> <BR><BR><EM>Playing on the Test server will give users an opportunity to experience
  changes firsthand before they are made available to the live world servers.
  However, it should be noted that due to frequent changes and revisions,
  enhancements made to the Test server will not necessarily make it to the live
  servers. In addition, the Test server has NO official Game Master support,
  therefore, if an item(s) is lost due to a bug, server outage, or any other
  reason, there will be NO reimbursement for the lost goods. It should also be
  noted that due to the nature of testing, the Test server may be brought down
  at anytime, without notice. Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to
  execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity
  of the test platform.</EM></P>

			The EverQuest Interface
		</h1>
	
	The EverQuest interface
  engine is designed to be easy to use and adjust for every player. With a few clicks
  of the mouse any player can customize the interface to meet their needs. But
  it also offers some very powerful customization ability for those that have
  some experience using XML. This manual only covers the options available
  within the interface. Those wishing to delve into the XML and 'skin' the
  interface for themselves should read the AboutSIDL.doc located in the
  EverQuest directory. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Many items in the interface have tool tips attached to them.
  Where appropriate we'll let you know what these tool tips will show in game
  with a little note like this one.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.1
			Working with Windows
		</h2>
	
	The EverQuest interface is, basically,
  a selection of windows that provide information and tools that you'll need to
  play the game. Many of these windows have special purposes and special
  features. But there are some properties that most of these windows have in
  common. So the first thing we'll cover here are the very basic features of
  the windows themselves. We'll move on to describe individual windows later. <BR><BR><STRONG>For all of the descriptions that follow, we'll be assuming that you are
  using the default windows settings.</STRONG> If a window isn't where we describe
  it, it has either been moved or turned off. You'll have to look around to
  find it. <BR><BR><STRONG>What is a Window?</STRONG> <BR><BR>A window is a container that holds a group of items. For example, on the left
  hand side of the EverQuest game screen you will see a tall narrow box with
  eight hexagonal items in a column and a tiny book at the bottom. This is the
  Spells Window. Those eight little hexagons and the spell book icon are held
  within that window. They go where the window goes. <BR><BR>But each window is independent of every other window. You can't move one of
  those hexagonal spell gems away from the other seven, but you can move the
  Spells Window around the screen without affecting the other windows directly.

	
		<h2>
			5.2
			Resizing Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	You can change the size of
  some windows with a simple click and drag of the mouse. Other windows can't
  be resized at all. <BR><BR>Look at the borders around the windows. If the border is a simple, solid
  line, that window can't be resized. If the border has a bit of flare around
  the corners it can be resized. <BR><BR>To resize a window, simply point your mouse at the edge of the window that
  you want to change. Your mouse cursor will change into a two-headed arrow (if
  it turns into a four-headed arrow, that window can't be resized, only moved).
  Simply click and hold the left mouse button, then drag the mouse left and
  right or up and down to change the size of the window. <BR><BR>Notice the directions that the arrows point. You can only drag the window in
  the directions of the arrow. If you want to make the window taller or
  shorter, you need to drag it from the top or the bottom. If you want to make it
  wider or thinner, drag it from one of the sides. If you point at the corners
  of the window, the arrows will be diagonal to the window. This allows you to
  drag the window in both directions at once.

	
		<h2>
			5.3
			Moving Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	Every window in the EverQuest
  interface can be moved and placed wherever you want it on the screen. <BR><BR>To move a window, point your mouse at the title bar (at the top of the
  window&nbsp;- contains the name of the window, such as Main Chat) or at the
  border of the window. When the mouse cursor changes into the four-headed
  arrow, just click and hold down the left mouse button. Then drag the window
  to wherever you want it to be and release the mouse button. <BR><BR>As noted above, pointing your mouse cursor at the borders of windows that can
  be resized will cause the pointer to turn into the two-headed resizing
  cursor. To move these windows you need to grab them by the title bar, not the
  border.

	
		<h2>
			5.4
			Opening and Closing Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	All windows in the interface
  can be closed, with the exception of the Window Selector which is always
  open. <BR><BR>There are several ways to close windows. Most windows can be toggled on and
  off by clicking the corresponding button on the Window Selector. Any window
  that is not represented on the Window Selector can be closed by clicking the
  X on the right side of the title bar. Also, most windows can be closed using
  the right-click menus, which we'll explain later. <BR><BR>The <STRONG><EM>Escape</EM></STRONG> key will also close most windows (will close the
  window that is active). <BR><BR>A few windows, such as the Target Window, can only be turned on and off using
  keystrokes. Here is a list of the keystrokes for all windows. <BR><BR><STRONG>ALT - B</STRONG>: Buff/Spell Effects Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - P</STRONG>: Party (Group) Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - S</STRONG>: Spells Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - H</STRONG>: Hotbox Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - T</STRONG>: Target Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - Y</STRONG>: Self-Status Window<BR><STRONG>ALT - M</STRONG>: Menu (Actions) Window

	
		<h2>
			5.5
			Scrolling through windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	A few windows, such as chat
  windows, have scroll bars on the right side that allow you to scroll through
  text or options. You can click the down or up arrows at the top and bottom of
  the scroll bar to scroll the text up or down incrementally. You can also
  click on the bar itself to scroll in larger increments. Or you can click and
  drag the scroll bar up or down. <BR><BR>Players with a wheel mouse can use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down in
  these windows as well.

	
		<h2>
			5.6
			Window Settings
		</h2>
	
	Each window has a settings
  menu that can be accessed by right-clicking on the title bar or on an
  'inactive' part of the window (for example, you won't be able to open the menu
  if you click on one of the spell gems in the spells window, but you can click
  on the space between the gems). <BR><BR>Some windows have unique options on their setting menus. We'll discuss those
  under the description of those windows. But there are four options that you
  will always see when you open the settings menu for a window: Background,
  Alpha, Minimize and Close. Some of these options may be disabled for certain
  windows (for example, you can't close or minimize the Window Selector), and
  they will be 'grayed out'. Options that you can select will be displayed
  using white text.

	
		<h2>
			5.7
			Background (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	The Background option allows
  you to easily customize the background of the window you are working with.
  There are two options that you can change in regarding the background. <BR><BR><EM>Texture</EM>: This option toggles on and off the background texture of the
  window.<BR><EM>Tinting</EM>: This option allows you to tint the background of the window.
  In a window with no texture, the tinting color becomes the background color
  for that window. You can either choose one of the preset color options or set
  the red, blue and green color values using the sliders or the text boxes. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Choosing white as a tint color is the same as having no tinting
  selected. So if you want to return the texture to its untinted color, choose
  to tint it white.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.8
			Alpha (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	The 'alpha' value determines
  the transparency of the window. An alpha value of 50 would make the window
  50% transparent. There are two alpha settings for windows: <BR><BR><EM>Normal Level</EM>: The Normal Level is used when the window has focus,
  meaning that your cursor is over the window or you are actively using the
  window.<BR><EM>Faded Level</EM>: The window uses the Faded Level when it is not the active
  window. The alpha level designated for the Faded window is a percentage of
  the Normal Level. This means that if the window is Normally at alpha 50 (50%
  transparent) and the Faded alpha is set to 50 as well, then when the window
  fades it will fade to 50% of the normal level (or alpha 25).

	
		<h2>
			5.9
			Minimize (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	Not all windows can be
  minimized. Minimizing a window shrinks it down to only display its title bar.
  The window can me restored to its normal size by right-clicking on the title
  bar and choosing 'minimize' again. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Minimize is not the same as resize. If you drag the window borders
  to make the window smaller, minimize will not restore it to its normal size.
  You will need to drag the borders back out to return the window to its
  original size.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.10
			Close (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	Not all windows can be closed. Closing a window removes it
  from your view. See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iwopening">Opening and
  Closing Windows</A> for more information about opening a window once it's
  closed.

	
		<h2>
			5.11
			Player Window
		</h2>
	
	The Player Window is in the
  upper right of your screen. It has the name of your character at the top, and
  two or three colored bars below it. Each bar is a gauge that represents a
  resource for your character. As the resource is depleted the bar will shrink.
  <BR><BR><EM>Red Gauge</EM> - Health - shows your character's level of health. If your
  character controls a pet, the red health bar will be split - the top part
  remaining red while the bottom part turns yellow. The red portion still represents
  the character's health, while the yellow portion shows the health of the pet.<BR><EM>Blue Gauge</EM> - Mana - shows your character's mana amount. This bar will
  not be visible if your character is of a class that does not have mana (such
  as a warrior).<BR><EM>Yellow Gauge</EM> - Stamina - shows your character's stamina. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: The tool tip for these gauges will show you the percentage of
  the resource that remains.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.12
			Target Window
		</h2>
	
	The Target Window is located
  just below the Group Window on the right side of the screen. The word Target
  shows up in the title bar for this window. The Target Window shows the
  relative health of the character that you currently have targeted.

	
		<h2>
			5.13
			Group Window
		</h2>
	
	This window appears just
  below your Player Window and has the word Group in the title bar. If you are not
  in a group, the only thing visible in this window will be the Invite and
  Disband buttons. When you join a group this window will display the health
  bars of your party members. If those party members have pets, the health of
  the pets will be shown in the same way they are displayed in the player
  window. <BR><BR><EM>Invite</EM> - this button is unavailable (visible, but grayed out) unless
  you have a player character targeted and can invite them to your group. You
  can only invite players to your group if you are the group leader (or not in
  a group at all - making you the leader by default), and your group must have
  room for one more member.<BR><BR><EM>Disband</EM> - this button is unavailable unless you are a member of a
  group. Disband removes you from your group. If you were the leader of the
  group, someone else will be randomly assigned leadership when you disband.
  But you can also use the /makeleader command to assign a new leader before
  you disband.<BR><BR><EM>Follow</EM> - The Invite button will become a Follow button if someone
  invites you to join a group. Clicking Follow puts you into that group.<BR><BR><EM>Decline</EM> - The Disband becomes the Decline button if someone invites
  you to join a group. Clicking Decline turns down the invitation. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: The tool tip for these health gauges will show you the percentage
  of the health remaining for your group members or their pets.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.14
			Main Chat Window
		</h2>
	
	The Chat Window is located in
  the bottom and center of your screen and has a title bar labeled Main Chat. <BR><BR>The chat bar has two basic parts. The larger section at the top of the window
  is where all incoming text for that chat window will be displayed. The
  smaller section at the bottom is the chat bar, and that is where you type in
  any text that you want to send to other players in the game. <BR><BR>All conversation, informational messages and other text will be displayed
  here. Though you have a lot of options to customize this feature. <BR><BR><STRONG>Right-click options</STRONG> - along with the standard window options, there
  are several options unique to the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>New Chat Window</EM> - this option creates an additional chat window in the
  default location (this means that if you have not moved your Main Chat Window
  the new chat window will appear on top of the Main Chat window). New chat
  windows have all the options available to the Main Chat Window. But new chat
  windows start out with all filters on by default. This means that no chat
  will appear in new chat windows unless you turn at least one of the filters
  off. <BR><BR><EM>Filters</EM> - Selecting Filters will display a list of the types of text
  messages that you can filter (say, tell, group, guild, OOC, auction, shout,
  emotes, chat channel, melee, spells, skills and other: other is everything
  not listed previously). Selecting an item from the list toggles the text type
  on or off. Remember, by default your Main Chat Window shows all text and New
  Chat Windows show no text. <BR><BR><EM>Channel</EM> - the Channel selection sets the default channel that your
  character speaks to (say, tell, group, guild, OOC, auction and chat channel).
  By default this is set to Say. So if you just type into the chat bar you will
  be speaking in /say. If you change the channel to OOC, then your default chat
  will be sent to the /ooc channel. <BR><BR><EM>Language</EM> - the Language selection sets the default language for the
  chat window. The option will list all languages that your character can
  speak. Choosing a language from the list sets it as your default chat
  language. Common is set as the default all chat windows. <BR><BR><EM>Usage Tip: One really handy use of multiple chat windows is to keep track
  of guild (or group) chat independent of other chat. This is easy to do. Just
  right-click the Main Chat Window and select
  New Chat Window. Position the new window where you want it, then right-click
  in that window and choose Filters then Guild. The new window will now only
  show you messages from your Guild. At this point you may also want to switch
  the filter for Guild in you main chat window so that it will not show up
  there.</EM> <BR><BR>Using Shift-Page Up and Shift-Page Down will allow you to scroll through chat
  windows in much the same way that the mouse wheel does.

	
		<h2>
			5.15
			Window Selector
		</h2>
	
	The Window Selector is
  located at the top of your screen in the middle. It is a simple tool that
  allows you to quickly open and close the most frequently used windows. Each
  window is represented by an icon. From left to right they are: Actions,
  Inventory, Options, Friends, Hot Buttons, Spells, Pet, Effects and Help.
  Clicking an icon/button will toggle the window open or closed. The Window
  Selector cannot be closed. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Pointing your mouse at any of the icons will tell you the name
  of the window that the icon represents.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.16
			Actions Window
		</h2>
	
	The Actions Window is at the
  lower right of your screen. This window has four tabs across the top (under
  the title bar). Clicking on each of these tabs (indicated by little icons -
  silhouette, hand, crossed swords and a chat bubble) will bring up a different
  group of actions. <BR><BR><EM>Main Tab</EM> (silhouette) - This tab holds buttons for six of the most
  common actions (who, invite, disband, camp, sit and run). Clicking on these
  buttons will cause the action. The Who button activates the /who function
  with no other parameters. <BR><BR><EM>Skills Tab</EM> (hand) - This tab allows you to set up buttons for your
  character's skills (such as fishing or sense heading). To do so, just
  right-click on one of the buttons and pick a skill off of the list. That
  skill will be assigned to the button, and clicking the button will now
  activate that skill. The skills listed here will include all skills, even
  combat skills. It is probably best not to assign combat skills to these
  buttons, though, as the Combat Skills Tab has buttons designated exclusively
  for combat skills. <BR><BR><EM>Combat Skills Tab</EM> (crossed swords) - This tab works just like the
  Skills Tab. Right-click on a button and pick a combat skill from the list to
  assign it to that button. Unlike the Skills Tab, the list of skills displayed
  here will only include combat skills (bind wounds, bash, kick and others). <BR><BR><EM>Socials Tab</EM> (chat bubble) - This tab gives you buttons to which you
  can assign nearly any function. There are ten banks of twelve buttons
  available. Clicking the left and right arrows cycles through the available
  button banks. The first bank contains twelve preset social macros. You can
  right click on those buttons to see how they are created and alter them if
  you wish. <BR><BR><EM>To Create Socials:</EM><BR>(1) Right-click on a button<BR>(2) This will bring up the social creation window<BR>(3) Click on the Name area and type in a name for the social<BR>(4) If you wish, choose a color for the name (the name will appear on the
  button)<BR>(5) Type in the text for the social (often referred to as a macro) - a social
  macro can contain any of the / commands available in the game. <BR><BR>For example, you might want to create a social that waves at your target,
  says hello to them, and then invites them to join your group. <BR><BR>(1) Name the social Invite.<BR>(2) Click on the green A to turn the text of the name green (color coding
  your socials can be useful).<BR>(3) In the text boxes below the name and the text color choices, type the
  following, each on its own line: <BR><BR>/wave<BR>/say Hello %t, how are you this fine day?<BR>/invite <BR><BR>As long as you have a valid target (and you're close enough), clicking on
  this Invite social button will cause all of those actions to take place. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Pointing at many of the buttons in this window will tell you
  what the keyboard shortcuts are for the various actions.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.17
			Hot Buttons Window
		</h2>
	
	The Hot Buttons Window is
  located at the bottom left of your screen. Hot Buttons can be created from
  any other button in the interface. This allows you to keep the buttons that
  you use frequently in one easy to find location. The Hot Buttons window has ten
  banks of buttons, each bank with ten buttons, so there should be plenty of
  room. <BR><BR><EM>Creating a Hot Button</EM> <BR><BR>* Make sure your Hot Button window is open and the spot for the Hot Button
  that you want to create is visible.<BR>* Locate the button you want to copy. This can be just about any button you
  find on the screen, as well as spell gems and inventory slots. If clicking it
  causes something to happen, then it can probably be made into a Hot Button.<BR>* Left-click and hold on the button. After a second or two a copy of the
  button with pop onto your mouse pointer.<BR>* Point your mouse pointer at the Hot Button spot and left-click. This should
  create a new Hot Button. <BR><BR><EM>Deleting a Hot Button</EM> <BR><BR>* Find the Hot Button that you want to remove.<BR>* Left-click and hold on the Hot Button. After a second or two the Hot Button
  will pop onto your mouse pointer.<BR>* Aim your mouse pointer at a place on the screen that has no windows and
  left-click. This should remove the Hot Button from your cursor.<BR>* Deleting a Hot Button does not affect the source button, so don't worry
  about deleting one you need. You can always make a new Hot Button.

	
		<h2>
			5.18
			Effects Window
		</h2>
	
	The Effects Window is located
  in the upper right of your screen, just inside the Player Window. The window title
  bar says Effects. This window displays the spells, poisons, diseases and
  other things that are currently affecting your character. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Pointing at one of the icons in your Effects Window will tell
  you the name of the effect. Holding down the <STRONG>Alt</STRONG> key while your mouse
  pointer is in the Effects Window will show all the tool tips.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			5.19
			Spells Window
		</h2>
	
	The Spells Window is located
  in the middle of the left side of the screen. If your character is of a class
  that can never cast spells you will not see this window (nor will you be able
  to open it using the Window Selector). This window holds your eight spell
  gems (your memorized spells) and a small spell book icon. Clicking the spell
  book icon will open your spell book. <BR><BR><STRONG>Spell Book</STRONG> <BR><BR>One of a spell caster's main pursuits is the acquisition of spells. In order
  to put a spell into the spell book, a caster needs to have the appropriate
  spell scroll. Once you have a spell scroll it is relatively simple to scribe
  the spell into your spell book. <BR><BR><EM>Scribing a Spell</EM> <BR><BR>* Open up your spell book and your inventory<BR>* Turn the spell book to the page where you want to place the spell (each of
  the boxes in the spell book is a spot for scribing a spell - called a spell
  slot)<BR>* Locate the spell scroll in your inventory and pick it up (left-click)<BR>* Point the mouse at the empty spell slot in your spell book and left-click<BR>* The timer gauge in the spell book indicates the amount of time left until
  your completed scribing the scroll. Most actions at this point will interrupt
  the scribing process, so it's best to wait for the gauge to empty.<BR>* A spell icon will appear in the spell book, with the name of the spell
  under it. <BR><BR><EM>Moving Spells within the Spell Book</EM> <BR><BR>* Locate the spell icon you want to move.<BR>* Right-click on the spell icon.<BR>* Find the spell slot that you want to place the spell icon in (you can click

			Inventory Window
		</h2>
	
	The Inventory Window is not
  open by default. You can click on the second icon from the left (the human
  figure icon) to open your inventory, or you can press &quot;i&quot; on your
  keyboard. We'll describe this window in four parts. The left side, where your
  character's statistics are displayed, the center where your character's worn
  inventory is shown, the right side where your character's general inventory
  is displayed, and the bottom where coins and action buttons are displayed. <BR><BR>a) The left side of the window shows your character's statistic: name, level,
  class, deity, hit points, armor class (ac), attack, experience bar,
  attributes, resistance, weight carried/allowance and Alternate Advancement
  experience. <BR><BR>b) The middle of the window displays your characters inventory worn. The
  larger box in the middle shows how your character looks. The smaller boxes
  surrounding it are the individual body locations. Each body location is
  represented by a picture a body part. For example, the top-most center box
  has a picture of a helmet in it, and that is where items worn on the head
  would be placed. Pointing at the locations will display a tool tip telling
  you what they represent. <BR><BR>c) The right side of the inventory window displays an animated logo that
  represents your character's chosen class. Below that are your character's
  general inventory slots. These are inventory locations not tied to a specific
  body part. Just about any item can be placed into a general inventory slot. <BR><BR>d) Across the bottom of the inventory window are the coins your character is
  carrying (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Copper, in that order). <BR><BR>e) At the very bottom of are four buttons: <BR><BR><EM>Skills Button</EM> - this button will open a window that shows you all of
  your characters skills. It lists the skill name as well as your character's
  rank and numeric value with that skill. <BR><BR><EM>Alt. Advance Button</EM> - this button will open a window that displays the
  Alternate Advancement window. This window gives you access to descriptions of
  and the ability to purchase Alternate Advancement abilities (restricted to
  Luclin owners with characters over 50th level). It also give the character the
  option to send some of their experience points to their Alternate Experience
  pool. See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=appendixd">Appendix
  D</A> for more details on Alternate Experience. <BR><BR><EM>Destroy Button</EM> - use this button to destroy items. If you are holding
  an item on your cursor and you click this button, the item will be destroyed.
  <BR><BR><EM>Done Button</EM> - Closes the Inventory Window. <BR><BR>To inspect any item in your inventory, just right-click on the item and hold
  the mouse button down. When you release the mouse button the inspection
  window will close. If you wish the inspection window to remain open,
  right-click the item and hold the mouse button down. Then move the mouse
  pointer off the item and release the mouse button. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Pointing your mouse at items in your inventory will tell you the

  you will be able to select your game resolution, refresh rate and video
  depth. It is important to note that these options are determined by your
  hardware and the drivers that run them. If you are seeing fewer options than
  you were expecting (such as higher resolutions), the first step to correcting
  this is to see if you can find newer drivers for your video card. <BR><BR><EM>Sky</EM> (3D Sky Off/Single Layer/Double Layer): Toggles the level of sky

	To open a Trade Window pick
  up an item and left-click on another player character. The trade window can
  only be opened between player characters, NPCs use the Give Window. <BR><BR>It is important to know that no transaction is final until both players agree
  to it by hitting the Trade button. <BR><BR>The Trade Window consists mostly of two sets of boxes. The left-hand set of
  boxes will be where you will see items that you are trading to gain, along
  with any coins offered. The name of the character you are trading with
  appears above the left-hand set of boxes. The right-hand side will be where
  you place items that you wish to trade out. <BR><BR>You may add or remove items from the Trade Window at any time up until both
  characters have clicked the Trade button. Any time either participant changes
  the contents of the Trade Window, the Trade button pops back up. Any change
  in the items in the Trade Window will require that both parties click Trade again
  before the trade can be completed. <BR><BR><EM>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window
  are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect
  them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal
  as it is.</EM> <BR><BR><EM>Also Note: Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the
  incoming items! If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold,
  extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them
  up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). NPCs and other characters
  might pick up items that fall to the ground, so it is important to make sure
  your items have a place in your inventory after any trade.</EM>

			5.33
			Give Window
		</h2>
	
	To open the Give Window pick
  up an item and left-click on a Non-Player Character. The Give Window says
  Give in the title bar, and looks a lot like the Banker Window, and it works
  much the same way. There are four slots into which you can place items that
  you wish to give to the NPC, along with four coin slots. To complete or
  cancel the transaction, use the Give or Cancel buttons on the bottom of the
  window. <BR><BR><EM>Important Note: Never stack items when giving them to an NPC to complete a
  quest. The NPC see the items in the stack as a single item.</EM>

	
		<h2>

			Connection Status Bar
		</h2>
	
	In the upper left-hand corner
  of your display is a green bar with four numbers over it. This is your
  Connection Status Bar. It gives you information about your connection to our
  servers through the Internet. This isn't really a good place to try to explain
  the intricacies of the Internet, so we're just going to tell you what the
  numbers are. <BR><BR>Left number - shows the round-trip ping<BR>Second number - shows the packet loss incoming to your machine<BR>Third number - shows the packet loss going to the server<BR>Fourth number - shows the throughput <BR><BR>The main thing to know about the Connection Status Bar is that it changes
  colors. If the bar is green then your connection is generally good. If it
  turns yellow or red then your connection is generally not so good.

	
		<h2>
			5.35
			Modifying the User Interface
		</h2>
	
	<P>The EverQuest interface is designed to be very customizable. Doing so will
  probably require some knowledge of XML, and unfortunately we can't teach XML
  to you through this manual. But we do have a few tips for you. <BR><BR>First, read the AboutSIDL.doc in your EverQuest directory. It has information
  that is very helpful when modifying the EverQuest UI. <BR><BR>Also, as new looks to the interface are created by players, you will
  certainly be tempted to use them yourself. By all means, use them! The whole
  point is to allow you to customize the interface. <STRONG><EM>BUT!</EM></STRONG> You need
  to make certain that any files you download do not contain a virus or any
  other unpleasant things. The security of your computer is your
  responsibility. We can't check every player created file for problems with
  the XML, viruses or things like that. So exercise every precaution when
  downloading anything off the Internet. <BR><BR>Modified versions of the UI need to be kept in their own folders in the
  UIFiles folder in your EverQuest directory. If you modify the files in the
  'default' folder those files will be replaced by our patcher the next time
  you log in. <BR><BR>In order to use a modification, simply type /loadskin FOLDERNAME in the chat
  bar in game. Don't do this in a dangerous situation; loading a new skin can
  cause a long delay in the refresh of your screen. If you're fighting at the
  time your character could be the subject of a sound beating while you're
  refreshing your interface. <BR><BR><BR><EM>Interface Related Commands</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>/viewport [<EM>distance from left, distance from top, width, height</EM>]</STRONG>  - the viewport command allows you to change the size of the gameplay area on
  your screen. The 'gameplay area' is the area in which Norrath is displayed. <BR><BR><STRONG>/clearchat</STRONG> - clears the Chat Window's scrollback buffer. <BR><BR><STRONG>/loadskin [<EM>foldername</EM>] [<EM>1/0</EM>]</STRONG> - the 'foldername' is the
  name of the folder where the skin you want to load is (that folder MUST be in
  the UIFiles folder). The last argument should be 1 if you want to use your
  current INI settings for the new skin, or 0 if you want to load the positions/sizes
  from the XML (and then appropriately modify them for your resolution). <BR><BR><STRONG>Labels:</STRONG> <BR><BR>The interface also provides Labels for some of the information that is sent
  to the interface. This allows you to put that information wherever you need
  it. <BR><BR>Put simply, a &lt;EQTYPE&gt;#&lt;/EQTYPE&gt; tag in any label will cause the
  text of that label to be ignored, and the # will determine what value is
  placed in that label when drawn. Note that certain labels determine their
  coloring dependent on the data (such as STR, which is either green, gray, or
  red depending on buffs/debuffs), while others will retain the label coloring
  from the XML. Hopefully the label names are self-explanatory. <BR><BR>Name = 1<BR>Level = 2<BR>Class = 3<BR>Deity = 4<BR>Strength = 5<BR>Stamina = 6<BR>Dexterity = 7<BR>Agility = 8<BR>Wisdom = 9<BR>Intelligence = 10<BR>Charisma = 11<BR>Save vs Poison = 12<BR>Save vs Disease = 13<BR>Save vs Fire = 14<BR>Save vs Cold = 15<BR>Save vs Magic = 16<BR>Current Hit Points = 17<BR>Maximum Hit Points = 18<BR>Hit Point Percentage =19<BR>Mana Percentage = 20<BR>Stamina Percentage = 21<BR>Armor Class = 22<BR>Attack = 23<BR>Weight = 24<BR>Maximum Weight = 25<BR>Experience Percentage = 26<BR>Alternate Experience Percentage = 27<BR>Target Name = 28<BR>Target Hit Point Percentage = 29<BR>Group Member 1 Name = 30<BR>Group Member 2 Name = 31<BR>Group Member 3 Name = 32<BR>Group Member 4 Name = 33<BR>Group Member 5 Name = 34<BR>Group Member 1 Health Percentage = 35<BR>Group Member 2 Health Percentage = 36<BR>Group Member 3 Health Percentage = 37<BR>Group Member 4 Health Percentage = 38<BR>Group Member 5 Health Percentage = 39<BR>Group Pet 1 Health Percentage = 40<BR>Group Pet 2 Health Percentage = 41<BR>Group Pet 3 Health Percentage = 42<BR>Group Pet 4 Health Percentage = 43<BR>Group Pet 5 Health Percentage = 44<BR>Buff 1 = 45<BR>Buff 2 = 46<BR>Buff 3 = 47<BR>Buff 4 = 48<BR>Buff 5 = 49<BR>Buff 6 = 50<BR>Buff 7 = 51<BR>Buff 8 = 52<BR>Buff 9 = 53<BR>Buff 10 = 54<BR>Buff 11 = 55<BR>Buff 12 = 56<BR>Buff 13 = 57<BR>Buff 14 = 58<BR>Buff 15 = 59<BR>Spell 1 = 60<BR>Spell 2 = 61<BR>Spell 3 = 62<BR>Spell 4 = 63<BR>Spell 5 = 64<BR>Spell 6 = 65<BR>Spell 7 = 66<BR>Spell 8 = 67<BR>Your Pet's Health Percentage = 68<BR>Your Pet's Name = 69 </P>  <P><BR><BR><EM>UI_character_##.ini</EM> <BR><BR>For each character there is a file named UI_charactername_##.ini, where the

	The sit and camp buttons are
  located on the Main Tab of the Actions Window.<BR><BR>Whenever you're resting, you should sit down. This allows your character to
  recover more quickly than standing or walking. <BR><BR><EM>To sit:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click the <STRONG>Sit</STRONG> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> and type <EM>/sit</EM> into the chat bar, then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>  again to have your character sit <BR><BR>Camp when you're ready to exit the game. This process takes about 30 seconds.
  Your character must first sit before he can camp. When you return to the game
  later your character will be where you left him and in the same condition (if
  he was wounded, he'll still be wounded). Keep that in mind when choosing your
  campsite (choose a safe place). <BR><BR>To Camp: <BR><BR>* Click the <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> and type <EM>/camp</EM> into the chat bar, then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>  again to have your character camp <BR><BR><EM>Jargon Note: If you hear other players talking about &quot;camping&quot;,
  they may not be referring to leaving the game. Some players linger
  (&quot;camp&quot;) around an NPC's regeneration point (where they return
  after dying) in order to attack the newly returned monster.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			6.2
			Safe vs. Dangerous Locations
		</h2>
	
	As a new character stay near
  to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters. Once you venture into
  the wilderness, you're fair game for any non-player predators out there.
  Gnoll pups are notorious for ganging up on solo travelers, as are Kobolds. Generally
  speaking, the farther you are from a friendly city the more dangerous the
  area will be.

	
		<h2>
			6.3
			Modes of Transportaion
		</h2>
	
	In EverQuest, you can travel
  via several methods. You've already learned how to walk, run and swim (short
  distances). A few cities have docks from which you can catch a boat. Some powerful
  spell-casters can also cast teleportation spells. <BR><BR><EM>To take a boat:</EM> <BR><BR>* Find a pier and stand or sit nearby. Make sure you can see the end of the
  dock<BR>* When a boat arrives, walk onto it <BR><BR>To be teleported, you must either know a teleporting spell, or find a
  character to cast one on you. Some teleport spells affect only the user or
  target, while others can teleport entire groups of characters.

			Communicating
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest provides an ongoing
  source of social interaction. You can chat with fellow players on message boards,
  or talk to NPCs and other players within the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity
  &quot;hear&quot; you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text
  portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send
  private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and
  all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>To send messages to characters in the game:</EM> <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text
  cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message.<BR><EM>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode,
  which is the default setting.</EM> <BR><BR><EM>To talk to a non-player character (such as a shopkeeper NPC):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the
  Target Window), then press <EM><STRONG>h</STRONG></EM>.<BR><EM>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</EM><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate
  keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using
  those words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><EM>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using
  inappropriate language.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			7.1
			Talking to Merchants
		</h2>
	
	Merchants usually greet you
  when you first walk into their store or selling booth, but they don't often
  like to talk about anything outside of their immediate realm of existence (in
  other words, don't ask a merchant for directions or favors...). <BR><BR>Before talking to a merchant, you must target him or her. To do so, move the
  cursor over the merchant and click. To speak to the merchant, press <STRONG><EM>h</EM></STRONG>.
  To see what the merchant has for sale, right-click on the merchant. <BR><BR>For more about selling items to merchants, see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=buying">Buying/Selling</A>  Items.

	
		<h2>
			7.2
			Editing/Viewing Chat Text
		</h2>
	
	You can move the cursor or
  edit a line of text before sending a message: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Delete</EM></STRONG> = Deletes the current chat line.<BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Insert</EM></STRONG> = Replaces current chat line. <BR><STRONG><EM>Delete-Backspace</EM></STRONG> = Delete character to right / left of cursor. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Left/Right Arrow</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor left / right. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Home</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor to start of chat line. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-End</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor to end of chat line. <BR><BR>You can scroll through your most recent chat by clicking the scroll arrows or
  by using keys: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Up/Down Arrow</EM></STRONG> = Scroll chat history up / down. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Up/Page Down</EM></STRONG> = Scroll up / down through chat text.

	
		<h2>
			7.3
			Chat Modes
		</h2>
	
	You can send messages using
  these chat modes by prefacing your message with the appropriate / command. For
  example, if you wish to Shout &quot;Hello World!&quot; to everyone in your
  current zone, you simply: <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to open the Chat Bar.<BR>* Type: /shout Hello World!<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. <BR><BR>Here some of the available chat modes. <BR><BR><EM>Say</EM> (Default): Use /say [text]. Sends your message to all nearby
  characters. This is the default chat mode, which means that if you do not
  specify a chat mode the game will assume that you want to use /say. <BR><BR><EM>Shout</EM>: Use /shout [text]. Sends you message to all characters in your
  current zone. Use this if you need to tell everyone trouble is coming, or
  need to locate your party quickly. Don't overuse shout, however - it can be
  annoying to other players. <BR><BR><EM>Tell</EM>: Use /tell [charactername] [text]. Sends your message to a single
  character. No matter how far away you are, that character receives your
  messages. <BR><BR><EM>Group</EM>: Use /gsay [text]. Sends your message to your group. This helps
  keep your group organized and informed, and no one outside of your group
  receives your message. All group members hear you, no matter where they are. <BR><BR><EM>Out of Character</EM>: Use /ooc [text]. For speaking out of the context of
  the game and your character. Use this if you're having a problem or have a
  question that doesn't pertain directly to Norrath. These messages can be seen
  by anyone within your current zone. <BR><BR><EM>Auction</EM>: Use /auc [text]. Sends a buy/sell message out to all players
  in the current zone. Use this if you've got something you want to sell to
  other player characters rather than a merchant, or to try to locate an item
  that you would like to purchase. Remember that auction messages are used for
  selling goods and materials, not for chatting. <BR><BR><EM>Yell</EM>: Use /yell. This sends a plea for help to players within very
  short range. You can't specify any text to send with the yell for help.
  Because this is used in emergencies, you might consider using the shortcut,
  /y. <BR><BR><EM>Guild Chat</EM>: Use /gu [text]. Sends your message to you guild. Only
  members of your guild will be able to see the message. Obviously you must be
  a member of a guild for this chat channel to be available.

	
		<h2>
			7.4
			Using Emotes
		</h2>
	
	You can appear to bow, be
  bored, point, or convey other visible gestures by using other special
  commands. EverQuest has a lengthy <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=emotelist">list of built-in
  emotes</A>, and some even trigger animations. <BR><BR>If you don't want to use pre-defined emotes, you can type in virtually
  anything. (Your character won't perform a visible action, but other players
  can see text that indicates your action). <BR><BR><EM>To use the built-in emotes, simply type in the appropriate command, such
  as:</EM> <BR><BR>/sit<BR>/dance<BR>/bow <BR><BR>These emotes may give different messages if you have a character targeted and
  if you have nothing targeted. <BR><BR><EM>To create your own emote:</EM> <BR><BR>/em [text] <BR><BR>For example (our sample character's name is Fippy): <BR><BR>/em scratches his nose.<BR>Would appear to those around you as:<BR>Fippy scratches his nose.

	
		<h2>
			7.5
			Using Different Languages
		</h2>
	
	All player characters in the
  world communicate using a Common Tongue by default, no matter who or what they
  are. However, most races also possess the ability to speak in a native
  language. <BR><BR><EM>To switch languages:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the Chat Window.<BR>* Choose Language from the list.<BR>* Choose the appropriate language.<BR><BR>Once you switch languages, only characters that also speak that language will
  be able to understand what you say. To others, your words will appear as
  gibberish.

	
		<h2>
			7.6
			Communicating with Pets
		</h2>
	
	Some classes can use spells
  to summon or enchant creatures and claim them as pets. Pets protect you and can
  follow a number of commands that you type in. See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=usingpets">Using Pets</A> for
  details.

	
		<h2>
			7.7
			&quot;Feeling Out&quot; Strangers
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest inhabitants can
  detect hostility from a stranger. This ability, called consideration, lets you
  know (through a text message) how a targeted NPC/player/monster feels about
  you. In general, this helps you assess your target's perception of you. It
  also comes in handy when you're considering whether or not to attack a
  monster or other player. <BR><BR>There are two ways to Consider someone. <BR><BR>* Click on the character or monster. Their name should appear in your
  Targeting Window.<BR>* Type /con and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>Or <BR><BR>* Right-Click the target.<BR><BR>You can Consider any NPC, player or monster in the game. When Considering
  merchants, however, you have to do so from a distance (or type in /consider
  with the merchant targeted) - right-clicking on one while standing too close
  displays his shop goods. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Player characters (on most servers) will always appear to be Indifferent.
  Also, if an NPC does not know you are there (through invisibility or other
  means) it will appear to be indifferent. That does not mean that he is
  actually indifferent, it just means that he can't see you. He might like you
  or hate you, however, once he knows you are there.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			7.8
			EverQuest Chat
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest's chat rooms are
  not accessible from within the game. Instead, click <STRONG>Chat</STRONG> from the
  Login screen (which appears when you activate the EverQuest desktop icon).
  You can use chat to speak to other players about the game and ask questions.
  Other players are often a great source of answers.

	
		<h1>
			8
			Manipulating Items
		</h1>
	
	The world of Norrath is an
  abundant world full of items you can pick up, buy, sell, use or transform.
  When your character is &quot;born&quot; he already has several items - a
  basic weapon, some food and water, and a scroll or two (items vary slightly,
  depending on your class and race). <BR><BR>Before long, you'll acquire some valuables. Eventually, you'll want to buy
  containers to store your items, or put items in a bank for safekeeping. <BR><BR>Some items on your person can't be dropped, sold or traded (such as your
  starting food and weapon). To remove these items from inventory, you must
  either store them in a bank or destroy them.

	
		<h2>
			8.1
			Viewing Your Inventory
		</h2>
	
	Inventory management is an
  indispensable skill. If you're a pack rat you'll constantly need to reassess what
  you're carrying and figure out what to do with the items you've accumulated. <BR><BR>You can view your inventory by clicking on the Inventory Icon. <BR><BR><EM>You can also access your inventory by hitting <STRONG>i</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>The detailed view of your inventory is divided into several sections. You can
  place specific items on different parts of your body - hands, fingers, feet,
  etc. <BR><BR>Eight general inventory slots show all items in your possession that aren't
  coins, armor or weapons you're holding (stored weapons do show up, however).
  Use these slots to store items that you aren't wearing, as well as coins and
  weapons that aren't in use. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Backpacks don't fit into your characters &quot;back&quot; inventory
  slot. They only fit into general inventory slots.</EM> <BR><BR>For certain items, you can stack more than one of that item in a single slot.
  The small number in the corner of the slot indicates how many items of that
  type are stacked. A stack can never contain more than 20 items. <BR><BR>The coin window shows how many platinum, gold, silver and copper coins you
  have (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=moneymatters">Money
  Matters</A> for details). Coins can be stacked, and there's no limit to how
  many you can carry. If you're trading with another player or
  depositing/withdrawing funds at a bank, click on a coin slot to display a
  slider. Use the slider to control how many coins you're fishing out of your
  coin purse. You can also type the number of coins you wish to pick up into
  the box provided.

	
		<h2>
			8.2
			Holding and Wearing Items
		</h2>
	
	Items stored in a general inventory
  slot are not in use. If you want to hold a weapon or wear a new item of armor
  or clothing, you've got to move it to the right location slot: <BR><BR>* Click on an item in a general inventory slot.<BR>* Once the item is floating on your cursor, click on an appropriate location
  slot.<BR><BR>Use this same click-and-drop method to take off a wearable item or store a
  weapon.

	
		<h2>
			8.3
			Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items
		</h2>
	
	You can pick up items you
  find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if
  the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped,
  traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the
  item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form
  of a small, brown bag. <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to give them the item (the person
  receiving your gift will also have to click Trade to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>.<BR><EM>Note: Once you destroy an item, it is gone. Make sure you really want to
  destroy the item (and that you have the correct item) before clicking
  Destroy.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>To pick up an item from the ground:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or
  as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot .

	
		<h2>
			8.4
			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to
  EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and
  sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and
  drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The
  following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player,
  see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A>. <BR><BR><EM>To buy/sell an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<EM>Note: you will have to be relatively
  close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only
  receive the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the
  merchant window</EM>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the
  Control key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button. To buy
  or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG>  or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button.

	
		<h2>
			8.5
			Giving/Trading Items
		</h2>
	
	You sometimes find that you
  need (or don't want) a particular item. You can sell or buy from other
  players. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves
  through the Trade Window. <BR><BR>No transaction is final until both players agree to it. <BR><BR><EM>To give away/trade/sell an item to another player:</EM> <BR><BR>* Open your Inventory screen (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and select an item or amount
  of coins (this should 'float' the item on your cursor).<BR>* Click on the character you wish to trade with.<BR>* This will open the Trade Window.<BR><BR>The trade window has two sections, one for the items and/or coin that you are
  trading out and one for the items and/or coin that the other character wishes
  to trade. At this point you may add or remove items or coins from this window
  as you see fit. <BR><BR><EM>Note: The Trade Window will close if you move too far from the other
  person.</EM> <BR><BR>Both players must click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the action. If either player
  puts another item into the trade window after one player clicks Trade, he/she
  will have to click the button again. <BR><BR><EM>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window
  are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect
  them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal
  as it is.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming
  items!</STRONG> If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra
  items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or
  obtain a container (such as a backpack). <BR><BR><EM>Note: Items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other
  Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items,
  and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing
  quests that give items as rewards.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			8.6
			Inspecting Another Player's Inventory
		</h2>
	
	To see if other players have
  something you might want to trade for, click on their characters. This
  targets them and, if you're standing close enough to them, opens their
  Inventory window. It is often considered polite to ask permission before
  doing such an inspection. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A> to learn how to trade.

	
		<h2>
			8.8
			Item Flags
		</h2>
	
	When you inspect an item
  (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags
  printed right below the name of the item: <BR><BR><STRONG>Magic Item</STRONG>: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this
  item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures that can only
  be harmed by magic. <BR><BR><STRONG>Lore</STRONG>: This means that you may only have one of these items in your
  possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not
  be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <BR><BR><STRONG>NoDrop</STRONG>: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player
  nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is
  necessary for many quests. <BR><BR><STRONG>No Rent</STRONG>: A no rent item will disappear from your inventory 30 minutes
  after logging out. <BR><BR><STRONG>Artifact</STRONG>: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you
  play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are
  usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game
  regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see
  one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great
  Power. <BR><BR><STRONG>Item Size</STRONG>: The size of any item will be listed (and for containers it
  will show what sized items it will hold). This should make organizing your
  inventory a little easier. <BR><BR><STRONG>A Deity's Name</STRONG>: If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means
  that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <BR><BR><STRONG>Weight Reduction</STRONG>: If a percentage for weight reduction is listed on a
  container, that container will reduce the weight of any item placed into it
  by that percentage while it is in the container.

	
		<h2>
			8.9
			Auctioning Items
		</h2>
	
	As you advance in the game, you'll
  find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need
  an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have
  just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your
  jewelry-making kit. Or, you could need a spell ingredient yourself - the old
  adage &quot;one man's trash is another man's treasure&quot; holds true in
  EverQuest as well. <BR><BR>Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in
  your playing zone can hear. Unlike &quot;/shout&quot; (which is reserved for
  critical situations), &quot;/auction&quot; is only used for buying and
  selling items. The preferred usage is &quot;WTB&quot; (want to buy) or
  &quot;WTS&quot; (want to sell), followed by a description of the item. <BR><BR>To send a message to the auction chat channel, just type /auction [text].

	
		<h2>
			8.10
			Containers and Banks
		</h2>
	
	You've only got eight general
  inventory slots, several of which are nearly always occupied by food and
  drink. Some items can be stacked on top of one another in a single slot, such
  as fish, bread and arrows. Other items take up an entire slot. All add weight
  to your character. If you don't want to continually sacrifice one item for
  another, try purchasing a container or finding a bank. <BR><BR><STRONG>Containers</STRONG> <BR><BR>Purchase backpacks, bags and other containers to increase your carrying
  capacity. By placing items inside a container, you can fit multiple
  possessions into a single slot. To open a container, right-click on it. <BR><BR>Certain containers also serve as catalysts for creating items - for instance,
  you need a bowl to make bread, and a sewing kit to stitch things together. <BR><BR><STRONG>Banks</STRONG> <BR><BR>Banks will gladly store coins for you, and they're also a great way to store
  inventory items. Banks in Norrath are well connected - even if you travel
  abroad, any banker can instantly conjure up your items. You've got eight bank
  inventory slots at your disposal. If you go to another bank, you don't get
  additional slots. <BR><BR><EM>To put an item in the bank:</EM> <BR><BR>* Find a bank and right-click on the banker. Eight bank inventory slots
  appear for you to use.<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory (it &quot;floats&quot; on your cursor).<BR>* Click on a bank inventory slot. <BR><BR>To withdraw an item from a bank, reverse the steps above. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Bank inventory slots work the same way as your character's general
  inventory slots. This means that you can use containers in the bank to
  increase your storage capacity.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			8.11
			Eating and Drinking
		</h2>
	
	Bread, milk and water are
  staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items,
  along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with
  20 skins of milk and 20 loaves of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at
  the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time). <BR><BR>When you're running low on either item, your text display shows &quot;You are
  low on food&quot; or &quot;You are low on drink&quot;. If you don't find food
  or drink soon you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health
  and stamina suffer. <BR><BR>Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and
  other items (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=buying">Buying/Selling
  Items</A>). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and
  other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they
  temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement
  skills and agility. Such items must be manually consumed. <BR><BR><EM>To eat/drink an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* View your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Right-click on the item you wish to consume.<BR><BR>Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used
  as needed. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item
  will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it.

	
		<h1>
			9
			Money Matters
		</h1>
	
	As a new character, you don't
  have any money. You'll spend most of your early playing sessions earning
  money to buy food, drink and items. You can earn money by looting the corpses
  of small animals you've killed and selling those items. <BR><BR>There are four denominations of coins in Norrath - platinum, gold, silver and
  copper. The exchange rate is 10 coins for each higher-value coin: <BR><BR>1 platinum = 10 gold.<BR>1 gold = 10 silver.<BR>1 silver = 10 copper.<BR><BR>Once you do have some money you may want to deposit it in a bank for
  safekeeping (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=containers">Containers and
  Banks</A> for more details). Most cities have banks in which you can store coins
  and general inventory items. <BR><BR><STRONG>Merchant Prices</STRONG> <BR><BR>When you buy something, coins automatically transfer from your inventory into
  the seller's window. If you sell an item, coins are placed in your inventory.
  <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're in good standing with a merchant, that merchant may offer
  you lower prices on items.</EM>

			10
			Skills and Combat
		</h1>
	
	&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			10.1
			Skills
		</h2>
	
	Your character possesses a few basic skills
  at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense Heading and Bind
  Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally known to
  those of a specific race or class, while others that you don't originally
  know can be learned over time (such as Meditation if you are a spell caster).
  <BR><BR>In order to use a skill you'll want to place it on an easily accessed hot key
  button. <BR><BR>To do this: <BR><BR>* Click on the Skills Tab (the hand) of the Actions Window.<BR>* Right-click on an empty hot button slot.<BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* Click that Hot Button to use the skill. <BR><BR>Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and click <STRONG>Skills</STRONG> to see how proficient
  you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better you become
  at it. When your skills improve messages appear in your chat window.

	
		<h2>
			10.2
			Improving Skills and Training
		</h2>
	
	The more you use a skill, the
  better you become at it. When you improve a skill ranking, a message appears in
  your Chat Window. In order for a skill to improve, your character must know
  the basics (for some skills this will require expending at least one practice
  point in that skill). Skill rankings are tied to your experience level - you
  can only improve a skill so much at Experience Level 1, improve it a bit more
  at Level 2, more at Level 3, and so on. <BR><BR>You can develop as many skills as you like - there's no limit. Some skills,
  however, are better suited for certain races, occupations or experience
  levels. <BR><BR>One good way to increase your proficiency in a certain skill is to visit a
  trainer. Trainers are usually masters of certain skills, and are willing to
  teach you. As a new character, you can visit your Guild hall and spend
  practice points, credits toward training. Later, you'll have to pay for
  lessons. <BR><BR>To approach a trainer: <BR><BR>* Visit your Guildhall (your starting note will usually tell you who to look
  for).<BR>* Right-click on the Guild Master or a trainer.<BR>* The skill page pops up - click on the skill you wish to improve.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Train</STRONG>.<BR><BR>Some skills can't be practiced until you reach a certain experience level
  (noted on the skill when you visit the trainer). For these, you'll need to
  practice at least once to learn the basics of that skill.

			Trade Skills
		</h2>
	
	With a trade skill, you can
  make certain items by assembling the necessary pieces. Some trade skills
  require you to seek out a merchant and buy a book or kit specific to that
  skill. Others (like Fishing) only require you to purchase the proper
  equipment.<BR><BR>Before you can learn most skills, you might want to visit a merchant that
  specializes in that trade. He or she will sell you a book that outlines the
  basics for a certain skill. Once you've read it and acquired the necessary
  kit, components or ingredients, you can make pottery, bows and arrows, bread
  products and more. <BR><BR><EM>To make an item, you need all of the ingredients and the right kind of
  container:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the container (a small window opens).<BR>* Click on the needed items in your inventory (item should &quot;float&quot;
  on your cursor).<BR>* Click on an empty slot in the container to place the item in the container.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Combine</STRONG>.<BR><BR>If you're skilled enough, and lucky enough, you'll succeed in your creation.
  A new item will show up in your inventory. Keep in mind that you'll
  occasionally fail, losing all items in the container. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Never stack items when combining them. All items in the combination
  must be separate.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>Trade Skills:</STRONG> <BR><BR><EM>Alchemy</EM>: Create potions (requires medicine bag - Shaman only).<BR><EM>Baking</EM>: Make a variety of baked goods (requires oven).<BR><EM>Blacksmithing</EM>: Make metal items (requires ore and forge).<BR><EM>Brewing</EM>: Make alcohol (requires still).<BR><EM>Fishing</EM>: Catch fish (requires fishing pole, bait and an appropriate

		<h1>
			11
			Experience Levels
		</h1>
	
	You always begin as a Level I
  character. As you gain experience in the world (mostly through combat), you
  progress to the next level. At higher experience levels, you can improve many
  types of skills and add to your spell casting abilities. <BR><BR>The best way to gain experience is to go out into the wilderness and kill
  creatures within your ability. You can also gain experience by completing
  quests. At first, you'll need to take on rats, snakes and other small
  animals. Once they become too easy for you and stop giving you experience,
  it's time to move on to something larger. <BR><BR>You can tell whether or not killing a certain creature will give you
  experience by the color of its text response when you Consider it. Stay away
  from creatures with red text (too hard). Look instead for light blue responses
  (easier kill) and blue ones (you'll have the upper hand). See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=beforeatt">Before You Attack</A>,
  for a list of the Consider response colors and what they mean.

	
		<h2>
			11.1
			Experience Bar
		</h2>
	
	You can keep track of your experience
  and view your current experience level in the Inventory screen. Even though
  your text display sends you a message each time you advance a level, it's a
  good idea to occasionally check your stats and level status. <BR><BR>The yellow/orange bar is the experience that you've gain toward the next
  level. The blue line just under the experience bar is a magnification of one
  of the five graduated lines (bubbles). This way, you can see more accurately
  your progress towards your next level.

	
		<h2>
			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to
  gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking
  away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one
  on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are
  split among the group members according to their experience levels. The
  higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping
  experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.

	
		<h1>
			12
			Using Weapons
		</h1>
	
	In EverQuest, you can fight using
  short-range melee weapons (swords, clubs and so forth), ranged weapons (bow
  and arrow), or your bare hands. If you've got magical spells, you can use
  those in combat as well - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=magicusing">Using Magic</A>.
  Combat might be dangerous inside a city, as guards are there to protect the
  citizens.

	
		<h2>
			12.1
			Acquiring Weapons
		</h2>
	
	Nearly all classes get a
  basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you do,
  you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure you
  hang onto your original weapon for a while - even a basic sword isn't cheap,
  and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along the
  way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons. <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait,
  you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as
  good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			12.2
			Weapon Types
		</h2>
	
	You start out with a basic
  weapon, but as you progress in levels and earn more money, you'll want to
  upgrade. Even those who specialize in magic usually carry a weapon in case
  their mana supply becomes depleted. <BR><BR>There are five basic types of weapon, and a skill for using each type. All
  except for ranged attacks are melee (close combat) attacks. Some weapons are
  one-handed, meaning that you only need one hand to wield them. If you possess
  the Dual Wield skill, you can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and use
  them simultaneously during combat. Two-Handed weapons require both hands and
  a two-handed combat skill. <BR><BR><EM>Blunt</EM>: Bashing damage delivered by a dull weapon (bruises your
  opponent).<BR><EM>Slash</EM>: Slicing damage delivered by a sharp, edged weapon or a whip (cuts
  your opponent).<BR><EM>Piercing</EM>: Stabbing damage from a pointed weapon (pierces your
  opponent).<BR><EM>Ranged</EM>: Piercing damage delivered from a distance by a propelled
  weapon, such as a bow and arrow.<BR><EM>Thrown</EM>: Projectiles thrown by hand, such as darts and rocks. <BR><BR>With some skills you can deliver manual attacks during combat, such as a Kick
  or Bash. This adds to whatever weapon damage you dish out.

	
		<h2>
			12.3
			Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	Prior to fighting, run
  through a quick, mental checklist: <BR><BR>* Scribe and memorize any offensive spells you possess.<BR>* Program your Combat skills and spells (if any) to Hot Buttons.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key.<BR>* Makes sure you have a weapon in hand.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <STRONG><EM>F8</EM></STRONG>  to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><EM>Green text</EM>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><EM>Light Blue text</EM>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><EM>Blue text</EM>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it
  won't be easy.<BR><EM>White text</EM>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you
  could win.<BR><EM>Yellow text</EM>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><EM>Red text</EM>: You'll most likely die. <BR><BR><EM>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more
  help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a
  greater challenge.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			12.4
			Attacking With Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in
  EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally
  easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a
  target, you can simply press <STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> (or whichever key you've
  remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the
  attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to
  hit it. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> Initiate auto-attack (on current target).<BR><STRONG><EM>Esc</EM></STRONG><EM>ape</EM> Remove current target from Target
  Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long
  as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another
  swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot).</EM> <BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If
  you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says
  &quot;Your target is too far away.&quot; Be sure to remain facing your
  target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow.
  Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and
  whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage,
  you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent
  is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and
  weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on
  your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A>, for information on how damage affects you.

	
		<h2>
			12.5
			Developing Weapon Skills
		</h2>
	
	Several things affect whether
  you get weapon-based combat skills, and whether you can accumulate more
  later. <BR><BR><EM>Class</EM>: Depending on what class you choose, you may already possess one
  or more weapon skills. Most classes with warrior abilities (Warrior, Paladin,
  Ranger and so forth) give you one or more from the very start. <BR><BR><EM>Experience</EM>: You usually gain additional fighting skills as you
  progress through experience levels. <BR><BR><EM>Practice</EM>: You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve
  your weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game
  with practice points available (and you gain five of these with each level).
  Later, you may have to pay cash along with practice points for tutoring
  sessions (right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill
  you want to practice). Some skills can only be practiced if you've reached a
  certain experience level.

	
		<h1>
			13
			Using Magic
		</h1>
	
	Those who cast magic are
  initially more vulnerable than other types of characters. Physical abilities
  are sacrificed for mental prowess, but eventually most spell casters become feared
  and revered citizens of Norrath. Building a life as a Wizard, Magician,
  Necromancer, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric or Shaman might be more difficult than
  pursuing other occupations at times, but the rewards can be great...

	
		<h2>
			13.1
			Spell Book and Mana
		</h2>
	
	All spell casters carry a spell
  book. You can open the book at any time by clicking the book icon. Once you
  copy a spell from a scroll (scribe it), it is permanently recorded in your
  book. <BR><BR>You can &quot;memorize&quot; eight scribed spells at any one time by placing
  them in a spell gem slot. Casting the spell then becomes as easy as clicking
  on its gem. <BR><BR>Spell casting consumes mana, a mystical source of magical energy. Like hit
  points, mana regenerates over time. Your current level of mana is shown by
  the blue mana bar. The longer the blue line in the bar, the more mana you
  currently possess. As you gain experience levels, you gain additional mana.
  Resting or meditating restores your mana faster than standing.

	
		<h2>
			13.2
			Acquiring Spells
		</h2>
	
	Some classes (such as a
  Paladin's ability to Lay on Hands) have one or more spell-like abilities that
  are very much like skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or
  meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells,
  however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spellbook and
  memorize it before you can cast it. <BR><BR>You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell
  caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some
  special quests can also yield spells.

	
		<h2>
			13.3
			Spell Types
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has literally hundreds
  of spells that you can acquire and cast at various levels of experience.
  They're far too numerous to list here, but for the most part they can be
  classified into four types: <BR><BR><EM>Offensive</EM>: Spells that are, or add punch to, combat attacks. Examples
  are Shock of Frost, Burst of Flame and Enfeeblement. <BR><BR><EM>Defensive</EM>: Spells that boost armor ratings or give added protection or
  advantage during battle - for instance, Courage, Skin Like Wood and
  Invisibility to Undead. <BR><BR><EM>Healing</EM>: Spells that restore health and stamina, like Minor Healing,
  Cure Disease, Endure Poison and Mend Bones. <BR><BR><EM>Utility</EM>: Spells that are neither offensive nor defensive. For example,
  you can cast Calm, Sense Magic, Summon Food and Bind Affinity. None of these
  spells is harmful or helpful in a combat situation, but they each have a
  specific purpose and provide some benefit.

	
		<h2>
			13.4
			Learning a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Before you can cast a
  scroll-based spell you have to copy it into your book and learn it. <BR><BR>To learn a spell from a scroll: <BR><BR>* Click on the spell book icon (the picture of a book at the bottom of your
  Spells Window).<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory (to view a scroll's information,
  right-click on it).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe the spell.<BR><BR>The timer gauge (at the bottom of the spell book) appears, measuring how long
  it takes to scribe the spell. You only need to do this step once for any
  spell. Once it's recorded, it's permanently in your book. <BR><BR>Now, memorize the spell by adding it to a spell gem slot (you must do this
  before you can cast it):<BR><BR>* Click on the picture of the learned spell in your spell book. A
  rock-colored gem appears on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the octagonal spell gems in your Spells Window to the left
  of your spell book.<BR>* The timer gauge measuring how long it takes to memorize the spell. When you
  have memorized it, the gem turns colored.<BR><BR>You can memorize up to eight spells at any one time. To &quot;forget&quot; a
  spell (remove its gem), right-click on its gem slot. You can then memorize a
  different spell in the free slot (if you can't remember which spell gem goes
  with which spell, hold down the alt key).

	
		<h2>
			13.5
			Spell Gem Colors
		</h2>
	
	Once you memorize a spell,
  the spell gem will be outlined or highlighted by a color. That color
  indicates something about the spell that is memorized in the slot. <BR><BR><EM>Yellow</EM>: You can only cast it on yourself.<BR><EM>Red</EM>: You can cast it on your current target.<BR><EM>Green</EM>: The spell affects anyone close to your target.<BR><EM>Blue</EM>: The spell has no range, and will radiate out from you.<BR><EM>Orange</EM>: The spell only summons items and doesn't affect anyone.<BR><EM>Purple</EM>: You can cast it on everyone in your group.

	
		<h2>
			13.6
			Before You Cast a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Prior to casting, make sure
  you're ready (especially in a combat situation): <BR><BR>* Make sure that you have the spells you plan to use memorized (remember the <STRONG><EM>Alt</EM></STRONG>  key pops up the names of the spells).<BR>* Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost
  it.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key (you never know when you'll need to hit
  something).<BR>* Make sure that you have already cast any pre-battle spells (armor or
  strength-boosting spells) that you might need.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <STRONG><EM>F8</EM></STRONG>  to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><EM>Green text</EM>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><EM>Light Blue text</EM>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><EM>Blue text</EM>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it
  won't be easy.<BR><EM>White text</EM>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you
  could win.<BR><EM>Yellow text</EM>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><EM>Red text</EM>: You'll most likely die.<BR><BR><EM>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more
  help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a
  greater challenge.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			13.7
			Casting a Spell
		</h2>
	
	<EM>To cast a spell:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on a target (spells that only affect the caster do not require a
  target).<BR>* Left-click the icon that represents the memorized spell you wish to cast.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to expire and the spell gem to brighten up, then
  cast again if needed.<BR><BR>When you cast a spell, a time gauge shows up indicating how long it's going
  to take to cast that spell. If someone hits you or you take a step, casting
  may be interrupted. Improving your Channeling skill helps you recover from
  these situations. <BR><BR>All spells are linked directly to certain skills - Abjuration, Alteration,
  Conjuration, Divination or Evocation. The better you are at that skill, the
  better the chance your spell has of succeeding. If your casting fails, you'll
  see a message in the text display indicating that your spell
  &quot;fizzled.&quot; Failed spells still consume mana, but don't produce any
  effects. Even if your casting is successful, your opponent may be able to
  resist that spell. Generally, higher-level characters are better at resisting
  spells cast by lower-level characters. <BR><BR><EM>Note: If someone casts a spell on you, a message appears in your text
  display. In some cases, a spell icon displays in your 'buff' box. Right-click
  and hold on the spell icon to find out the name of the spell.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			13.8
			Developing Magical Skills
		</h2>
	
	Some skills relate directly
  to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination,
  Evocation, Meditate and Specialization (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=skillsmagic">Magical Skills</A>,
  for a listing and definition of each skill type). You gain some of these
  skills through experience, while you're born with others.

	
		<h2>
			13.9
			Meditating
		</h2>
	
	You can decrease the amount
  of time it takes you to memorize a spell by Meditating. This helps speed up
  the process of scribing and memorizing spells, but it's a skill-based
  ability. If you press the Meditate button but nothing happens, that means
  that you don't yet have the Meditate skill. If you have the skill, it will
  automatically be used whenever you memorize or scribe a spell. <BR><BR>Meditating for long periods of time helps you regain mana faster, and is more
  effective than meditating for short bursts. <BR><BR>To meditate just click on the picture of your spell book in the Spells
  Window.

	
		<h2>
			13.10
			First Level Spells
		</h2>
	
	If you've chosen a magical occupation,
  you can cast certain spells as a beginner. As you gain experience levels, you
  can learn more advanced spells. <BR><BR>Here are a couple of the spells you can learn at Level 1 for each magical
  occupation. <BR><BR><EM>Cleric</EM>: Minor Healing and Courage.<BR><EM>Druid</EM>: Minor Healing and Skin Like Wood.<BR><EM>Enchanter</EM>: Minor Shielding and Shallow Breath.<BR><EM>Magician</EM>: Minor Shielding and Burst of Flame.<BR><EM>Necromancer</EM>: Minor Shielding and Life Tap.<BR><EM>Shaman</EM>: Minor Healing and Inner Fire.<BR><EM>Wizard</EM>: Minor Shielding and Shock of Frost.

		<h2>
			14.1
			Looting a Vanquished Foe
		</h2>
	
	Once you've killed something,
  you can check its corpse for useful items. Many things you recover from dead
  creatures are valuable items that you can sell to merchants or other players.
  <BR><BR><EM>To loot a corpse:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It &quot;floats&quot; on your

		<h2>
			14.2
			Taunting
		</h2>
	
	If you have the Taunt skill,
  you can use it to draw a creature's attention away from whomever it's
  attacking. When you successfully taunt a monster, it turns and starts attacking
  you instead. You'll find that taunting is an indispensable group skill,
  especially if you want to keep the spell casters in your group alive. <BR><BR>Taunt is a combat skill. To use this skill you will need to set up a button
  for it on the Combat Skills tab of the Actions Window. <BR><BR>Once you've done that, all you need to do is click on a creature to target it
  and press the Taunt button.

	
		<h2>
			14.3
			Dueling

	Even if you're not on a
  player vs. player server you can still challenge someone to a duel. Once you
  start a duel, it continues until one player defeats the other, or one player
  leaves the zone. Only player characters can duel. <BR><BR><EM>To start a duel:</EM> <BR><BR>* Target the player you want to duel.<BR>* Type /d and press <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>To accept a duel, your target must follow these same steps. <BR><BR>Dying during a duel is similar to dying in any other manner - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>.
  <BR><BR><EM>Note: For non-player-killers, participating in a duel doesn't give the
  winner the right to loot the loser's corpse.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			14.4
			Combat Damage
		</h2>
	
	Whenever your opponent hits
  you with either a weapon or spell, you take damage and your health is
  depleted. Keep an eye on your red health bar - if it falls below 1/3, you may
  want to consider retreating until you're healed. <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If your party includes a spell caster, that character can spend his
  or her time casting healing and boosting spells on the others while they
  fight.</EM> <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A>, for additional details on taking damage.

	
		<h2>
			14.5
			Guards
		</h2>
	
	Guards immediately kill unfriendly
  creatures if they come too close. This can be good for you (if, for example,
  some creature is about to beat you to a pulp), and bad for you (if a guard
  kills a monster you won't get experience for it nor will you be able to loot
  the corpse). So it's a good idea to know where the local guards are.

	
		<h2>
			14.6
			Retreating
		</h2>
	
	If you do decide that
  retreating is your best option, look for the safest escape route. Sometimes,
  you can run over to other characters in the area, and someone will help
  attack the monster or taunt him away. But those other characters might not be
  willing or able to help you out. In fact, running over to them might get them
  killed. While it's certainly a good thing to find help when needed, it's not
  polite to bring your problems to other unasked. Communicate with those around
  you, find out if they would be willing to help you before you need it. <BR><BR>There is a term, &quot;training&quot;, for rudely running a bunch of
  dangerous NPCs over a group of unsuspecting characters, and it's something to
  avoid. <BR><BR>Guards (as mentioned in the previous section) can also help save your life.

	
		<h2>
			14.7
			Using Pets
		</h2>
	
	Some classes let you develop
  the ability to summon undead pets or elemental forces, or to befriend wild
  animals that aid you in combat. You'll have to find the correct spell for
  your class and purchase it before you can summon or charm a pet. Look for spells
  that begin with &quot;Summon,&quot; &quot;Befriend,&quot; &quot;Charm,&quot;
  or that contain the word &quot;Animal&quot; or &quot;Undead.&quot; A variety
  of pet-related spells also exist that you can use to heal your pet or boost
  its abilities. <BR><BR>Once you have a pet, you can instruct it to taunt your target, attack, follow
  you, guard a location, or protect you as follows: <BR><BR><STRONG>/pet guard here</STRONG> - Tells the pet to guard its current location.<BR><STRONG>/pet guard me</STRONG> - Tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's
  master, or that it's master attacks.<BR><STRONG>/pet follow me</STRONG> - Tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross
  a zone line.<BR><STRONG>/pet attack [target]</STRONG> - Tells the pet to attack the designated target.<BR><STRONG>/pet back off</STRONG> - Tells the pet to stop its attack.<BR><STRONG>/pet as you were</STRONG> - Returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.<BR><STRONG>/pet get lost</STRONG> - Will send the pet back to where it came from.<BR><STRONG>/pet report health</STRONG> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><STRONG>/pet health report</STRONG> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><STRONG>/pet health</STRONG> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><STRONG>/pet taunt</STRONG> - Toggles pets taunting.<BR><STRONG>/pet notaunt</STRONG> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><STRONG>/pet no taunt</STRONG> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><STRONG>/pet taunt off</STRONG> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><STRONG>/pet taunt on</STRONG> - Tells the pet to taunt its opponent.<BR><STRONG>/pet stand</STRONG> - Causes the pet to stand up.<BR><STRONG>/pet sit</STRONG> - Causes the pet to sit down. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Pets have a limited range at which they can hear commands. If a pet
  isn't responding to you, he just might be too far away.</EM>

			PVP: Fighting Other Player Characters
		</h1>
	
	&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			15.1
			Where You Can Fight Other Players
		</h2>
	
	You can fight anywhere outside
  the city's gates, or in arenas within the city. The arena zones are clearly
  marked in your chat window when you enter them. <BR><BR>If you attack another player in the city, the guards might attack and kill
  you.

	
		<h2>
			15.2
			PvP Servers
		</h2>
	
	Several servers have been
  created specifically for player-vs-player (PvP) combat. Currently, there are
  four - Rallos Zek, Sullon Zek, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=server">Server
  Selection</A> for more details.

	
		<h2>
			15.3
			Tips for New PvP Players
		</h2>
	
	Here are a few tips to get
  you started. <BR><BR>* Don't join a PvP server for your first EverQuest experience. It's probably
  a good idea to become familiar with the game before attempting the more
  difficult challenge of a PvP server. <BR><BR>* Learn your way around. It's easy to get lost in EverQuest - which is
  exactly what you don't want to do in times of crisis. <BR><BR>* Find friends you can trust. Other newbies you meet can make great allies in
  the future. <BR><BR>* Find a guild to join. Remember, there's strength in numbers. <BR><BR>* Use the Anonymous option (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iogeneral">Game Options:
  General</A>). The less other players know about you, the better. <BR><BR>* Keep moving. Running is always better than walking, and you can often run
  away from someone or something that's chasing you. <BR><BR>* Make it a habit to target and consider (/con) everyone you run across. <BR><BR>* Use banks to store anything valuable. Likewise, buy bags - no one can loot
  items in them.

			Health, Damage and Dying
		</h1>
	
	&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			16.1
			Dying and Resurrecting
		</h2>
	
	If your character takes
  enough damage, his health bar falls to zero and he dies. The character
  doesn't permanently die - he regenerates near your starting city (at your
  'spawn' or 'respawn' point). <BR><BR>Until a character reaches tenth level, he respawns with all of his items. But
  once reaching tenth level it will be necessary for you to recover your items
  off of your corpse.

	
		<h2>
			16.2
			Binding
		</h2>
	
	Normally, your respawn point
  is near your starting city. Binding (through the casting of a Bind Affinity
  spell) resets your regeneration point to wherever you're standing. Find a
  magically inclined player to bind you to a new location when you travel. Otherwise,
  if you die, you'll resurrect back in your original city, no matter how far
  away you were when you were killed.

	
		<h2>
			16.3
			What If Your Character Dies?
		</h2>
	
	If you've worked long and
  hard, don't worry. Dying won't strip you of your possessions or coins - as
  long as your body is recoverable (for example, don't drown at the bottom of
  an aqueduct - it may be a difficult task to find that exact spot and
  resurface without dying again). <BR><BR>If your character dies he will 'respawn' at his 'bind point', which for new
  characters is just outside their starting city. Characters under level 10
  will respawn with all of their items and can continue their adventures right
  away. But once a character reaches 10th level he will begin to leave a corpse
  on the ground at the location of his demise. In order to recover the
  character's items, you will need to find that corpse. <BR><BR>To reclaim what's rightfully yours, locate your body, right-click on it, and
  put the items into your inventory (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=pickingup">Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying
  Items</A>).

	
		<h2>
			16.4
			Giving Permission to Drag Corpses
		</h2>
	
	You can give permission to
  others to pick up your corpse and drag it to a safer and/or closer spot in
  the same zone (corpses cannot be dragged across zone lines). Permission can
  be granted to another player, a guild, a group, or raiding party. Type in
  &quot;/consent [player name]&quot; or &quot;/consent [guild name]&quot; or
  &quot;/consent [group name]&quot; or &quot;/consent [raiding party
  name]&quot;.&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			16.5
			Corpses Decay
		</h2>
	
	When you die, your corpse is
  &quot;locked.&quot; No one else can take what's in your inventory. The only trick
  is that you have a limited amount of time in which to find your body and
  transfer items to your inventory. <BR><BR>Corpses only remain in the world for a short while. Player corpses have a
  timer on them, and when that timer expires they will disappear. This is the
  corpse timer for player characters (please note that all times are in real
  time, not game time): <BR><BR>If they are under level 10, all corpses decay in 3 minutes. <BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above and have no items on them, they decay in 3
  hours.<BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above with items, they decay in 7 days.<BR><BR><EM>Note: It is advised that you get your corpse right away. Also note that
  the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</EM>

			Quests and Groups
		</h1>
	
	&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			18.1
			Finding Quests
		</h2>
	
	Once you're fairly familiar
  with the game, you may be ready to take on a quest, or an adventure with a
  specific goal. Most quests offer some sort of reward. <BR><BR><EM>Ready-Made Quests</EM>. Many non-player characters have small quests. The
  best way to find out what they are is to hail various NPCs and ask.
  Non-player characters have certain keywords marked in square brackets - for
  example, &quot;I need some help with my [problem].&quot; If you respond with
  a question that includes that keyword, you'll receive more information. <BR><BR><EM>Player-Created Quests</EM>. Players can create their own quests and
  publicize them via chat or message boards. Keep your eyes and ears open for
  any interesting opportunities. <BR><BR><EM>Miscellaneous Events</EM>. Some of the more creative EverQuest players
  organize public events. These include advertised duels, weddings between
  characters, celebrations, and in some cases, even lotteries and contests.

	
		<h2>
			18.2
			Participating in Groups
		</h2>
	
	Adventuring outside the city
  can be dangerous. Joining a group can help you defeat monsters that you normally
  can't kill, carry items that won't fit into your inventory, and progress
  through levels faster than you would alone. <BR><BR>Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience
  received while adventuring is based on the levels of the party members. As a
  general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the
  ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point
  that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>When starting a party, consider the skills of each member that you invite.
  You want a good mixture of combat, spell-casting and healing abilities. At
  the very least, make sure you have a couple of strong fighters, a wizard,
  magician, necromancer or enchanter to cast spells, and someone else with
  healing powers (like a cleric). Use variations of the &quot;/who&quot;
  command to see players of a certain level, race or class. <BR><BR>Groups are temporary groupings, as opposed to Guilds, which allow an ongoing
  affiliation between players.

	
		<h2>
			18.3
			Joining/Leaving/Disbanding a Group
		</h2>
	
	You can either invite someone
  to join your group, or accept an invitation from someone else who has started
  a group. <BR><BR><EM>To invite a player to join your group:</EM> <BR><BR>* Target the player.<BR>* Click the <STRONG>Invite</STRONG> button in the Group Window.<BR><BR>The player you're inviting receives the invitation in the Chat Window, and
  his or her &quot;Invite&quot; button changes to &quot;Follow&quot;. <BR><BR><EM>To accept a group invitation:</EM> <BR><BR>* Ask to join a group or wait for someone to invite you to join.<BR>* Click the <STRONG>Follow</STRONG> button in your Group Window (the button then
  reverts back to &quot;Invite&quot;).<BR><BR><EM>To leave a group (or dissolve a group you started):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Disband</STRONG> button in your Group Window.

	
		<h2>
			18.4
			Group Notes and Tips
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG><EM>F1-F6</EM></STRONG> will
  target group members 1-6 respectively. <BR><BR><EM>Communication</EM>: Keeping in touch with group members is crucial. Before
  combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle. <BR><BR><EM>Group Leader</EM>: Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect
  someone to make decisions about important party matters. <BR><BR><EM>Group Health</EM>: The names of fellow group members appear in the group member
  window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health
  status. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Spells</EM>: Some spells affect all members of a group. If
  you've got a spell caster in your group, it might be a good idea to pitch in
  and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Experience</EM>: Experience points are split between group
  members according to experience level - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=experiencegroup">Group
  Experience</A>. <BR><BR><EM>Splitting Loot</EM>: To split coin treasure evenly, enable autosplit under <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iogeneral">Options / General</A>.
  Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis.

	
		<h1>
			19
			Participating in Guilds
		</h1>
	
	Guilds take the basic idea
  behind forming groups a step further by making the group an official
  organization, complete with a charter, or a written set of intentions and
  purposes. Guilds allow players with similar ideas to form semi-permanent
  groups. <BR><BR>The reasons for joining a guild mirror some of the reasons for joining a
  group - you band together with other players who are interested in pursuing
  the same goals that you are. You develop friendly associations with other
  members. Furthermore, in a tight spot, fellow guild members are nearly
  certain to help you out. The focus generally isn't on adventuring together
  (though it can be). Instead, guild members share primary goals and concerns
  relating to life in Norrath. <BR><BR>Hundreds of player-created guilds exist in EverQuest; finding the right one
  for your character can be a difficult task.

	
		<h2>
			19.1
			Guild Leaders
		</h2>
	
	Usually your first task as a
  new player is to find the proper non-player character guild for your class
  and meet its leader. When you hand over the right scroll, you form a lasting
  association with a group and agree to abide by its charter. <BR><BR>Player-created guilds have a leader (usually the creator) who invites other
  players to join. As the group grows larger, he or she can create officers to
  help manage the guild. <BR><BR>The best way to locate a guild leader for a guild you want to join is to ask
  other players. Search out another member and find out the best time and
  location to contact the guild leader.

	
		<h2>
			19.2
			Guild Halls
		</h2>
	
	Each city has quite a few
  guild halls for non-player (NPC) guilds. This is usually where you'll find
  the NPC guild leader and trainers.

	
		<h2>
			19.3
			Joining/Leaving a Guild
		</h2>
	
	Before you join a player-created
  guild, find out whether the guild's plans are similar to those of your
  character. Most guilds have a web site that lists their charter, goals and
  requirements. To join a non-player character guild specific to your
  occupation, give the correct scroll to the guild master. To join a player
  guild, find the Guild Leader and ask to join. You're not obligated to accept
  a guild invitation, and player guilds aren't obligated to invite you. <BR><BR>Once you join a guild you assume the guild name. This name appears in
  &lt;brackets&gt; after your character's name onscreen. Your guild affiliation
  is also revealed when someone uses the &quot;/who&quot; command. <BR><BR>You can leave a guild at any time by typing the following: <BR><BR>/guildremove [your character's name]

	
		<h2>
			19.4
			Creating a Player Guild
		</h2>
	
	<P>If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are
  looking for, you may create your own guild. In order to establish your guild,
  you must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who
  wish to form this guild.</P>  <P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> You can also use the
  new web-based&nbsp;<A HREF="../../../../../guild_requests/intro_view.jsp">Guild
  Application System</A> to submit a guild creation request or&nbsp;to
  view&nbsp;existing guild requests.<BR><BR><EM>The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for your
  guild:</EM> <BR><BR>1. The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server
  and issue the <STRONG>#makeguild</STRONG> command. This will create a private guild
  channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel,
  although this name can be edited later during the creation process. (You can
  also use the <A HREF="../../../../../guild_requests/intro_view.jsp">Guild
  Application System</A>&nbsp;to make a request or view previous requests.)<BR><BR>2. After the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the
  members of his guild into the channel. To do this, he needs to tell the guild
  members the name of the channel and the password for access. <BR><BR>3. Once 10 or more members are in the channel, they need to issue the <STRONG>#approveguild</STRONG>  command. The guild leader can then issue the <STRONG>#makeguild</STRONG> command. This
  will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. <BR><BR>4. In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of
  the guild's charter. This summary should focus on the guild's role in Norrath
  and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild
  need not be included. You may also edit your guild's name in this screen.
  Once completed, hit <STRONG>Finish</STRONG> and the guild will be submitted for
  approval. It's important that you double-check the spelling of the guild name
  because it could be approved with submitted spelling and then could be very
  hard to change. <BR><BR>5. The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating
  the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for
  revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button.
  Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of
  the guild creation screen. The guild leader can edit the charter and the
  guild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for
  approval. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> If the leader is only viewing the revisions
  needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH, the guild
  will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter
  the guild creation/edit screen. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> If your guild is listed as
  Initial Approval, it is not fully approved yet. Please do not petition on
  server to have your guild created at this point. <BR><BR>6. If the name and charter are approved, the guild leader will be notified
  via email that the guild is ready to be created. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> Please
  verify that your email is correct in our registration information by: A)
  Going to &quot;Account&quot; B) Then going to &quot;Change Account&quot; C)
  Then going to &quot;Edit Registration&quot; from the login screen. <EM>NOTE:
  It is important that you have the correct email address listed, or you will
  not get your approval letter promptly.</EM> <BR><BR>7. After the guild leader has received notification via email that the guild
  has been approved, it is his/her responsibility to petition and meet a GM to
  complete the guild creation process. Only the Creator needs to be present for
  creation.<BR><BR>For fastest service, try to petition between 2PM and 10PM PST. If this is not
  possible, you may either petition and allow a Guide to assist you further or
  locate and request the assistance of the Chat GM. </P>

	
		<h2>
			19.5
			Guild Wars
		</h2>
	
	Conflict may arise between
  guilds from time to time. When this occurs, guild leaders may decide to
  declare war between their guilds. If both leaders agree, they can open
  hostilities by using the <STRONG>/guildwar</STRONG> command. <BR><BR>Guild wars may vary in duration from the default of 1 day to a maximum of 14
  days. During this period of time members from either guild may cause harm to
  each other regardless of their adherence to the tenants of Order or Discord. <BR><BR>If the forces in conflict decide that peace would be a better option before
  the war has run its course an early end to the war may be declared. In order
  to accomplish this, both guild layers must issue the <STRONG>/guildpeace</STRONG>  command.

	
		<h2>
			19.6
			Guild Commands
		</h2>
	
	Guild leaders and members can
  send special (&quot;/&quot;) chat commands to others in their guild. Replace
  items in [brackets] with the indicated information. Valid users are listed in
  parentheses after the definition. <BR><BR>In order for a guild leader to make an officer, the player must not be in the
  guild when using /guildinvite o [playername]. If a guild leader wants to
  promote someone to officer, simply have the player to be promoted target
  themselves and type /guildremove in order to be ready to be promoted to
  officer. This will remove them from the guild, which will allow the guild
  leader to then use the /guildinvite o to make them into an officer. Please be
  careful in choosing who will be the officers in your guild, as only the guild
  leader and officers can invite new members into the guild. Only the guild
  leader can make someone an officer. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildinvite [name] [rank]</STRONG> - Invite a person to join the guild. If
  this person is to be an officer, include the argument [O] (as in Oscar) for
  the rank. Usable by the Guild Leader and Officers, but only the Guild Leader
  can make officers. You would also use this function to promote a member to an
  officer. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildremove [name]</STRONG> - Remove a member from the guild. Only the Guild
  Leader may remove Officers. You may use this command on yourself to leave the

			Information Related to EverQuest Expansions
		</h1>
	
	This section contains
  information that applies to EverQuest Expansions and is new to the original
  game. The bulk of this information regards new or changed skills and
  abilities available to those who have purchased the EverQuest: The Ruins of
  Kunark upgrade or retail box, the EverQuest: The Scars of Velious Expansion
  and/or the EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin Expansion.

	
		<h2>
			20.1
			Sense and Disarm Traps (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	These skills now have use
  within Velious. There are traps, and they range from annoying to deadly
  throughout Velious. They are invisible and can only be detected and disarmed
  by rogues and bards. <BR><BR>Use &quot;Sense Traps&quot; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity. If
  so, you can then use &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; to try to disarm the trap. Once
  disarmed, the trap will remain inactive for a short period of time while your
  group passes through the area. <BR><BR>If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be
  directed towards the closest one.

	
		<h2>
			20.2
			Corpse Dragging (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Due to the importance of
  faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a situation where a group could
  die in an area, and then easily bring in someone with good faction to drag
  all of the corpses out without consequence or risk. As such, there are some
  zones in Velious where dragging a corpse is considered &quot;assisting the
  enemy&quot; by the inhabitants of the area. They will react accordingly.

	
		<h2>
			20.3
			Dragon Circles (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Players in Velious will
  notice &quot;Dragon Circles&quot; in the Iceclad  Ocean, the Great Divide, the Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar. These dragon
  circles are teleport locations for the wizard and druid teleports into
  Velious. <BR><BR>Dragon teeth were needed in order to teleport to these locations. That is no
  longer the case. As long as a druid or wizard has a spell to group gate a
  party to any of these dragon circles, all party members will be teleported as
  well, provided they have the Velious expansion.

	
		<h2>
			20.4
			Tail Rake (Ruins of Kunark)
		</h2>
	
	The &quot;dragon punch&quot;
  skill has been replaced by &quot;Tail Rake&quot; for Iksar characters.

			EQClient.ini
		</h1>
	
	Your EverQuest directory
  contains a file named EQCLIENT.INI. This file contains custom settings for most
  user preferences within EverQuest. The EQCLIENT.INI file is split up into
  several sections.

	
		<h2>
			21.1
			EQClient.ini - Default Section
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>[Defaults]</STRONG> <BR><BR>This section contains general information regarding client setup. Items are
  listed here alphabetically, they may not appear in this order in the .ini file.
  The order of their appearance in the file is inconsequential to their
  function. <BR><BR><STRONG>AttackOnAssist</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want &quot;autoattack&quot; to be automatically
  turned on after issuing the /assist command in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChannelAutoJoin</STRONG> = [channel-list] <BR><BR>Joins you to the listed chat channels when you log in. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChatFontSize</STRONG> = [0-5] <BR><BR>This line controls the size of the text font in your chat window. Default is
  0. When using full screen mode with higher resolutions, it is helpful to set
  this value to 2 or higher, depending on your taste, eyesight, and reading
  comprehension ability. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChatLineSpacing</STRONG> = [0-2] <BR><BR>This line controls the number of spaces between each line of text in your
  chat window. Default is 0. It is not suggested putting this value over 2, or
  it could be very difficult to read text as it scrolls by. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideBuffWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-B function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your buff icons and icons of spells
  cast upon you will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in game
  by hitting Alt-B. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideChatWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-C function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your chat text will not show up.
  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-C. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideHotboxWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-H function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that the six pages of hotkeys will not show
  up. You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-H. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideMainMenuWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-M function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your main menu window with your
  abilities, socials, combat abilities, etc., will not show up. You can easily
  get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-M. <BR><BR><STRONG>HidePartyWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-P function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your group members hit point bar
  and names will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in game by
  hitting Alt-P. <BR><BR><STRONG>HidePlayerWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-Y function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your character name, hit point
  bar, mana bar and stamina bar will not show up. You can easily get it to show
  again in game by hitting Alt-Y. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideSpellsWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-S function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your spells gems (to hit to cast
  spell with mouse) will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in
  game by hitting Alt-S. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideTargetWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-T function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows target's name and hit point bar
  will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting
  Alt-T. <BR><BR><STRONG>InspectOthers</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This line set to TRUE allows you to inspect others. If set to FALSE, you will
  not be able to right-click on their character to inspect. The default value
  is TRUE. <BR><BR><STRONG>InvWinLabels</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This is a Velious only line that enables the labeling to show up when in the
  full screen inventory mode. <BR><BR><STRONG>LastCharSel</STRONG> = [1-8] <BR><BR>This line controls which character is selected at the character select
  screen, so that whichever character you played last will be selected when you
  go to the character select screen the next time you play EverQuest. <BR><BR><STRONG>LoadArmor17</STRONG> through <STRONG>LoadArmor23</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE (Velious Only) <BR><BR>Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with
  Velious into your video card's texture memory. Players with older video cards
  may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you experiencing
  slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in areas with
  many textures. <BR><BR>By default, these are all set to &quot;FALSE&quot;, as it is possible that
  those with lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all
  of the new armor files. At your option, you can switch all or part of them to
  &quot;TRUE&quot; to see the new armor. If you have problems with framerate or
  disk swapping, turn all or part of them back to &quot;FALSE&quot;. <BR><BR>As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries
  if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless
  you are. <BR><BR><STRONG>LockWindows</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as hitting Alt-L in game. This allows windows to
  be rearranged with your cursor if FALSE and locked in place if set to TRUE.
  You can very easily do this in game with using the Alt-L function to toggle
  the lock off/on. <BR><BR><STRONG>Log</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets the default state of chat logging to the log file for your character and
  server. Setting this option to true would have the same effect as logging
  into the game and typing &quot;/log on&quot; at the beginning of every play
  session. <BR><BR><STRONG>MousePointerSpeedMod</STRONG> = [0-3] <BR><BR>This is to allow faster movement across the screen by your mouse. The higher
  the number, the faster the mouse scrolling will be. Default is 0. It is not
  suggested to set this to higher than 3, as it makes it difficult to
  accurately control the mouse movement. <BR><BR><STRONG>RunMode</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want to automatically &quot;run&quot; when you log
  into the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ScreenMode</STRONG> = NORMAL or FULL <BR><BR>Sets the default screen mode for when you enter the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ServerFilter</STRONG> = [0-1] <BR><BR>0=No, 1=Yes. If this line is set to 1, than Server side filtering is occurring.
  Default is 0. If you are having problems with lag in a raid situation, or
  when many other players are in the same general area in EverQuest, it is best
  to have this set to 1. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowDynamicLights</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Setting this line to TRUE enables the player to see special graphics due to
  light sources on your character such as torches, greater lightstones, in a
  new light so to speak. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowInspectMessage</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want the &quot;CharacterName is inspecting you&quot;
  message to be displayed when you are inspected by another character. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowSpellEffects</STRONG> = [0-1] <BR><BR>0=No, 1=Yes. This line allows particle effects to be shown if it equals 1. If
  this line equals 0, no particle effects will be seen in-game when someone
  casts a spell. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackFilterType</STRONG> = [0] <BR><BR>This is another Ranger only line that is best changed in-game. The command in
  game allows you to specify not showing certain conning creatures. Default is
  0. Please refer to the section later in this manual dealing with all of the
  /commands to see the proper use of this in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackPlayers</STRONG> = [TRUE/GROUP/FALSE] <BR><BR>This line shows the current selection (Default is TRUE) for showing players
  in tracking, not showing players, or only group members. It is suggested to
  change this setting in game to change this value. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackSortType</STRONG> = [Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider] <BR><BR>This is a Ranger only ability and is best changed in game. It changes the way
  that tracking is sorted, and how it shows up. <BR><BR><STRONG>UseD3DtextureCompression</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This line turns on/off texture compression. If set to TRUE, it can add much
  time loading to the game between the server select and character select
  screens, but can also improve performance. <BR><BR><STRONG>VideoMode</STRONG> = [0-4] <BR><BR>0 is 640/480 resolution, 1 is 800/600. 2 is 1024/768. 3 is 1280/1024. 4 is
  1600/1200. Players need to have the Velious expansion in order to set this
  line to 3 or 4. <BR><BR><STRONG>VideoModeBitsPerPixel</STRONG> = [16/32] <BR><BR>This line reflects and controls the video mode while in EverQuest. Default is
  16 bits. It is suggested that most players keep this value at 16 as
  increasing to 32 can cause a decrease of performance.

	<STRONG>[TextColors]</STRONG> <BR><BR>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the

			EQClient.ini - Other
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>[WindowsXXX]</STRONG> <BR><BR>Sections labeled in this fashion store the full screen window locations (per
  resolution) as set by you in game. You should not edit this section manually.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>[KeyMaps]</STRONG> <BR><BR>The KeyMaps section stores your keyboard customizations as set in game. It is
  best for this to be edited in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>[WindowColors]</STRONG> (Velious Only) <BR><BR>This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons
  behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode. It can be set using the
  /wincolor command in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>[LoadSocialAnimations]</STRONG> (Luclin Only) <BR><BR>This setting will tell the game to load or not to load (=TRUE or =FALSE) the
  social animations (such as /wave and /cheer) created for the Luclin models.
  If you turn these off you will not see any social animations. Not loading
  social animations can improve load times for those with systems below the
  recommended specifications. <BR><BR><STRONG>[UseLuclinHumanMale]</STRONG> (Luclin Only)<BR><BR>There are a series of lines like this in the ini file, each pertaining to a
  specific race and sex. Setting these lines to TRUE will tell the game to load
  the new Luclin character models for the specific race and sex. Not loading
  some of the new character models might improve performance on systems below
  the recommended specifications.

	
		<h1>
			22
			Social Scripting
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest supports a total of
  120 configurable &quot;socials&quot; in game. Along with these socials, you
  have the ability to develop custom emotes and sequences of commands.

	
		<h2>
			22.1
			Custom Animation Text
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has default text
  for all existing animations. For instance, when typing /point, or /point with
  a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the
  &quot;point&quot; animation and &quot;CharacterName points at [target]&quot;
  will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. <BR><BR>You can use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need
  to specify the &quot;target&quot; after the command as &quot;say&quot;
  followed by your custom text. For instance, typing &quot;/point say points at
  a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; will cause
  your character to execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and display
  &quot;CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is
  ready to kill it&quot; to those nearby.

	
		<h2>
			22.2
			Emote Codes
		</h2>
	
	When creating custom socials,
  you can use a series of &quot;%-codes&quot; that expand into various pieces
  of information when the social is executed. <BR><BR>The %-codes are: <BR><BR><STRONG>%M</STRONG> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet).<BR><STRONG>%T</STRONG> - Returns the current target.<BR><STRONG>%S</STRONG> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (He, She, It).<BR><STRONG>%O</STRONG> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (Him, Her, It).<BR><STRONG>%P</STRONG> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (His, Her, Its).<BR><STRONG>%R</STRONG> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).
  <BR><BR>For example, if you have a target of &quot;a gnoll&quot;, the following
  emote: <BR><BR>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <BR><BR>...Your character will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation with a text
  output of &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready
  to kill it.&quot;

	
		<h2>
			22.3
			Pauses in Socials
		</h2>
	
	You may enter pauses in
  social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to
  600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of
  seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <BR><BR>For example, a social consisting of: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/cast 1<BR>/pause 100<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds
  after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <BR><BR>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another
  social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command
  is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line. <BR><BR>For example: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/pause 100,/cast 1<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that
  the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and
  MUST be specified first on the line.

			Melee Disciplines
		</h1>
	
	In addition to the many
  automatic skills and abilities that characters will receive past 50th level,
  we've added player-controlled fighting &quot;disciplines&quot; to the
  repertoires of the pure melee (Warriors, Monks, and Rogues) and hybrid
  (Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, and Bard) classes. These disciplines are
  listed&nbsp;on the combat UI screen which you can bring up by hitting Ctrl+C.
  You cannot use any other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used
  discipline has expired. The window will show&nbsp;which disciplines you have
  learned as well as the reuse times for any you have&nbsp;used.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long duration, have a disadvantage
  in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline. In all cases where
  this happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage. For
  instance, where the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his
  opponent less by a factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less,
  but only by a factor of 15%. In the interest of exploration, further formulae
  will not be provided.

			Need Help?
		</h2>
	
	There may be times during
  play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the
  form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention.
  During these times, your best bet is to turn to EverQuest's battalion of Game
  Masters. <BR><BR>GMs are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character
  if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Game
  Masters is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience
  without the hindrance of unforeseen problems.

	
		<h2>
			25.2
			Contacting a Game Master
		</h2>
	
	To seek help, type /petition [text],
  where [text] is a concise message explaining what you need help with. <BR><BR>Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, GMs may be swamped
  responding to other players' calls. Your petition is received and noted as
  soon as you send it, and a GM will help you as soon as he or she can. This
  may take a few moments, so please be patient. Do not send repeated petitions,
  this will actually move you back to the end of the queue. <BR><BR>When you are contacted, explain your situation. The GM will ask for more
  information if necessary. You can help the GM by conducting yourself in a
  calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant
  details. Be patient and your problems will be solved if they fall within the
  rules of the game.

			The /report Command
		</h2>
	
	The /report command instructs
  your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest
  servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any
  text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the
  EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of
  this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is
  &quot;/report CharacterName&quot;, however the true function of the command
  sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window. <BR><BR>To properly use this command, use <STRONG><EM>Shift-PgUp</EM></STRONG> to scroll until
  the suspect text is in the chat window, then type &quot;/report
  CharacterName&quot;. You should then file a &quot;/petition&quot; (see
  Contacting a <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=supgm">Game

  of what the /report is meant to show.

			Appendix A - Various Commands and Emotes
		</h1>
	
	Below is a list of more /commands
  available within game. You can get a complete list of all /commands available
  to you in game by typing /help [type] where &quot;type&quot; is
  &quot;guild&quot;, &quot;emotes&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;. Type /help
  alone to return usage instructions. <BR><BR>When you see [ ] below, the text within those brackets are parameters for the
  command being described. They are the options that you can choose when using
  that command. They will be separated by commas when there is more than one.
  Typing the command and then parameter (without the brackets) will give you
  the result described. If you see [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>] then the command is a
  toggle. That means that you do not need to type on or off, just typing the
  command will change the state of the toggle. So if you are currently
  Anonymous and you type /anon, the command will toggle the state of your
  anonymous flag to OFF (since it was ON before). <BR><BR>[<EM>target</EM>] indicates that you must have a character targeted for the
  command to work. <BR><BR>Also, where you see &lt; &gt;, the information within the brackets is not a
  specific parameter, but is a kind of text that you will need to type. For
  example if you see &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;, then you will need to type
  in a character name as the parameter for the command, without the brackets.
  If it just says &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;, then the nature of the text is up to you
  to determine (though the brackets are not needed).

	
		<h2>
			26.1
			Appendix A - Commands List
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>/anon</STRONG> or <STRONG>/a [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG>  - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, preventing other players from
  seeing your class, level, and current location. <BR><BR><STRONG>/afk [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>] &lt;text&gt;</STRONG> - When activated, all private tells
  sent to the user will auto-respond with the following text, &quot;You told
  &lt;players name&gt;, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away from keyboard) right
  now.'&quot;. If you add &lt;text&gt; then that text will replace the default
  AFK message. <BR><BR><STRONG>/assist [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - if you
  target a character that is within 200', the /assist command will
  automatically target for you whoever that character has targeted at the
  moment- this can be very useful in heavy combat. To be most effective, it is
  best to set this as a Social (see IV.F above) <BR><BR><STRONG>/assist [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the autoattack function associated
  with the /assist function. The default of ON turns on your autoattack when
  you use /assist. If you type /assist off then autoattack will not start when
  you use /assist. This is one case where you <STRONG>must</STRONG> use the parameters on
  and off for this to work. <BR><BR><STRONG>/attack [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles in and out of attack mode. This will
  put you in attack mode even if nothing is targeted. Be careful not to use
  this when near NPC's that you have targeted. By default, this is set to the
  &quot;a&quot; key. Care should also be taken when you are near an NPC that
  you have targeted not to hit the &quot;a&quot; key, as this may cause you to
  attack the NPC. <BR><BR><STRONG>/auction &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows users to send auction messages
  throughout the current zone. Please use this channel only for auctions. <BR><BR><STRONG>/autojoin &lt;<EM>channel-list</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Saves the channels listed and
  automatically ;sets you to those channels when you log in. This information
  is saved in your eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section as ChannelAutoJoin=&lt;channel-list&gt;.
  See the section in this manual about Chat Channels for more information. <BR><BR><STRONG>/autosplit [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - automatically splits any loot you get
  with the rest of your party. Each member must do this to split all loot. <BR><BR><STRONG>/book [<EM>1-50</EM>]</STRONG> - Opens your spell book to the specified page. <BR><BR><STRONG>/bug</STRONG> or <STRONG>/b</STRONG> - takes you to a bug-reporting screen. <BR><BR><STRONG>/camp [<EM>desktop/server</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows the player to exit to the
  server select screen or desktop depending on what is specified. You can use
  just /camp by itself as well. You must be sitting in order for this command
  to work. If attacked while camping out, the /camp command will be cancelled,
  thus preventing exit from the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>/cast [<EM>1-8</EM>]</STRONG> - causes your character to cast the spell in the
  specified memorization slot. <BR><BR><STRONG>/channel [<EM>gsay/ooc/shout/guild/auction</EM>]</STRONG> - toggles the chat
  channels on or off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/chatfontsize [<EM>0-5</EM>]</STRONG> - This is for Velious subscribers only. It
  is used in full screen mode only to change the chat font size. <BR><BR><STRONG>/consent &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - gives the character permission
  to drag your corpse /consider or /con - gives vital statistics of a targeted
  PC or NPC. <BR><BR><STRONG>/corpse [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - will summon the target's corpse if it is
  within a 50' radius of the character. You can either target the character or
  the character's corpse. This will only work if the targeted character has
  used the /consent command on the character trying to use the /corpse command.
  If no target is selected when the /corpse command is used, it will summon
  your own character's corpse if it is within 50' of the character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/decline</STRONG> - Declines a duel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/disband [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Allows a character to disband from a group
  if he/she has themselves targeted. This command also allows the group leader
  to disband a targeted member of the group if they are in the same zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/dismount</STRONG> (Luclin Only) - This command allows your character to
  dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so
  using the bridle. There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you
  to mount a horse. <BR><BR><STRONG>/doability [<EM>1-6|7-10</EM>]</STRONG> - 1-6 performs the associated ability
  from the &quot;abilities&quot; page, 7-10 perform the associated combat
  skill. <BR><BR><STRONG>/duel</STRONG> or <STRONG>/d</STRONG> - challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept,
  they have to type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one
  combatant &quot;dies&quot; (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone. Until
  the duel is resolved, the two combatants can't be affected by spells from PCs
  not in the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/dynamiclights [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - When on, this command enables players
  to see specially rendered lighting. This command is most useful when the
  player is holding, or has a light source with them, such as a torch. Turn
  this command to off if you notice low frame rate. <BR><BR><STRONG>/em &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>: &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - emotes the
  text. Most emotes have animations associated with them, though some do not.
  Predefined emotes are listed in the table below. <BR><BR><STRONG>/exit</STRONG> - This command is the same as /quit and should not be used by
  players unless to escape from a death bind loop. <BR><BR><STRONG>/facepick</STRONG> (Luclin Only) - this command brings up an interface that
  allows you to choose a new face for your character using the new models for
  Shadows of Luclin. You must have the Luclin character model enabled for the
  race of the characters whose face you are trying to change. Currently this
  command can be used more than once on the same character. In the future it
  will be a once per character command. <BR><BR><STRONG>/fastdrop [<EM>ON/OFF/NEVER</EM>]</STRONG> - Disables or enables the ability to
  drop items on the ground without a confirmation box. The recommended setting
  for this option is the same as the default setting, which is /fastdrop off.
  If set to never, you will never be able to drop any items on the ground. If
  set to on, no confirmation box will come up before dropping the item on the
  ground. Caution is advised as many NPC's (Non player characters such as
  merchants) do pick up items dropped on the ground by players. <BR><BR><STRONG>/feedback</STRONG> - takes you to the feedback/comments screen. <BR><BR><STRONG>/filter [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the profanity filter on and off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/follow [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - When this command is used while targeting
  another player, the user will automatically follow the targeted character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/friend &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - adds or removes a 'friend'
  from your friends list. /friend &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; will add the player
  to your list, and /friend &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; again, for the same
  character, will remove him/her. /friend by itself will list the players in
  your friends list. A /who friend will let you know if anyone on your friends
  list is in the zone you are in, and a /who all friend will let you know if
  anyone on your friends list is on the server you are on. Your friends list
  can only contain 30 names per character. And be aware that in order to remove
  someone from the list, you must type their name precisely. <BR><BR><STRONG>/gems</STRONG> - This command allows a player to play the game Gems. <BR><BR><STRONG>/gsay &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>/g &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - text is
  seen by all in your group <BR><BR><STRONG>/Guild Commands</STRONG> - See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=appaguild">Guild Commands</A>.

  commands available in area specified. <BR><BR><STRONG>/hidecorpses [<EM>all/none/allbutgroup</EM>]</STRONG> - This command allows the
  player to choose to not see other player's corpses in-game. This allows for
  less lag in situations where there are many corpses around. Keep in mind that
  the <EM>all</EM> and the <EM>allbutgroup</EM> options will hide NPC corpses. Your
  own corpse is never hidden. The default is <EM>none.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>/ignore &lt;<EM>player name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Will block all text from that
  character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/inspect [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles on and off your ability to inspect

  coordinates within the zone. The location will show as x, y, z. <BR><BR><STRONG>/loot</STRONG> - Allows the character to loot a corpse from a short distance.
  The corpse must be targeted when performing this command. You can achieve the
  same result by right clicking on a corpse. <BR><BR><STRONG>/lootnodrop [<EM>ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/NEVER</EM>]</STRONG> - This command is used to
  specify how you loot no drop items on corpses. Always is default and will
  cause a prompt box to always be shown when looting no drop items. Set to
  sometimes so only items not usable by your character will show a prompt box.
  When you have this set to never, you will never get a confirmation box to see
  if you want to loot or not. <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol</STRONG> - Allows a player to control sound devices such as cdaudio
  or mp3s to play when in-game. This command will be further developed in the
  future to be more user friendly. Until that point, the following are some
  commands you can use to play audio CD's: Before using any other of these
  commands, use the following to open up communications: <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol open cdaudio</STRONG> - opens communications. <BR><BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol play cdaudio</STRONG> - To play <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol pause cdaudio</STRONG> - To pause <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol stop cdaudio</STRONG> - To stop <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol step cdaudio</STRONG> - To skip forward <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol back cdaudio</STRONG> - To skip back <BR><STRONG>/mcicontrol eject cdaudio</STRONG> - To eject the CD <BR><BR><EM>Note: Though ejecting itself should not cause any gameplay problems,
  putting in a new disk may.</EM> <BR><BR>If you have AutoPlay enabled on your computer (which is windows default), it
  may start your CDaudio program and possibly, switch out of EverQuest, causing
  EverQuest to likely crash, or at the least may cause a phantom cursor to
  appear. <BR><BR>If you have AutoPlay disabled, putting in a disk should not cause any
  problems. <BR><BR><STRONG>/me</STRONG> - Same as <STRONG>/em</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG>/mousespeed [<EM>0-3</EM>]</STRONG> - Changes the mouse travel speed across the
  monitor. 3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse
  moves). Don't set this above 3. Your mouse will move too quickly and you will
  probably not be able to play. <BR><BR><STRONG>/msg</STRONG> - This is the same as using <STRONG>/Tell</STRONG>. <BR><BR><STRONG>/note &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows the player to write notes when
  in-game to be referenced later out of game. This creates a notes.txt file of
  the text. Each line of text sent using /note is appended to the end of this
  file. There is a maximum number of 455 characters when creating a note. <BR><BR><STRONG>/ooc &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - allows you to say something as yourself,
  not as your character, heard throughout the zone. Please only use this
  channel for out of character speech, and please try to limit your out of
  character speech to this channel. <BR><BR><STRONG>/Pet Commands</STRONG> - See <A HREF="http://eqlive-new-test.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?id=47075">Pet
  Commands</A>. <BR><BR><STRONG>/petition &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Used to request assistance from a GM.
  The more detailed &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt; is, the quicker the assistance can be
  rendered. To prevent 'spamming' of the petition queue, each character can
  only send in one petition (for as long as that petition is in the queue). <BR><BR><STRONG>/played</STRONG> - Returns the birth date and hours played for the current
  character. <BR><BR><STRONG>/quit</STRONG> - Immediately exits the game. However, when you exit in this
  manner, your character has not 'camped out' in the proper fashion, and he or
  she will remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit.
  Your character will be under the control of the server, and may very well die
  while you are not there to tell it what to do. So only use this command when
  you are in a rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you
  can't get out of with the standard sit and camp method. The risk you take
  when using this shortcut to exit the game is all yours. <BR><BR><STRONG>/random [<EM>x, x y</EM>]</STRONG> - /random x generates a random number between
  0 and x. /random x y will generate a random number between x and y. This can
  be used to decide things randomly, for instance, who gets a recently acquired
  treasure. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reply &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - If a &quot;/tell&quot; is received, the
  user may respond by using this command. /reply will reply to the very last
  person to send you a /tell. The default shortcut for this function is the <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG>  key. <BR><BR><STRONG>/report &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Allows a player to report the
  text that is currently being displayed in the chat window. If you are
  reporting harassment, bad language, threats, or other actions by another
  player, use their character name for the &lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt; in the
  report. If you are reporting falling for 10,000 points damage, or other
  irregularities that affect your character, then use your character's name.
  You should then use /petition and let a GM know that you have used /report so
  that they will know to look for your reported text. To prevent 'spamming',
  you can only send one report at a time. You can do another /report only after
  zoning. Please make sure to have the text you want to report in the chat
  window when you use this command, /report will only send the bottom ten lines
  of text that are actually shown in your chat window. Use <STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Up</EM></STRONG>  and <STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Down</EM></STRONG> to move through your chat text until you
  see the text you want to report. <BR><BR><STRONG>/resetwindows</STRONG> - Used to reset to default the locations on-screen for
  the different Graphical User Interface (GUI) boxes. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reverb [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Toggles the reverb (echo) sounds on or off. <BR><BR><STRONG>/reversesound</STRONG> - This command will reverse the left and right channel
  for your sound. <BR><BR><STRONG>/roleplay [<EM>ON/OFF</EM>]</STRONG> - Hides your race, class, and location while
  still displaying your guild tag, and turns your name purple to indicate that

  details). <BR><BR><STRONG>/targetgroupbuff</STRONG> - This command toggles on and off when issued. When
  on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target but will affect

  closest NPC listed last, Rconsider has the tracking list from low level on
  top to high level below. <BR><BR><STRONG>/usercolor [<EM>Chat Type</EM>] Rvalue Gvalue Bvalue</STRONG>. - For example, For

		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Guild Commands:</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildsay &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>/gu &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> -
  Sends a text message to all fellow guild members currently on-line. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildinvite [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this
  command to invite new guild members. In order to make an officer, the guild
  leader must use the following command: /guildinvite o &lt;playername&gt;. You
  can also just have the player targeted and type /guildinvite o. You must be
  in the same zone as the player you want to invite into the guild. The letter
  o must be lower cased. If the player you want to make an officer is currently
  in the guild, they will have to /guildremove themselves (with themselves
  targeted) , in order to be made an officer through this command. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildremove [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this
  command to remove guild members. Keep in mind that if you target yourself
  when executing this command, you will remove yourself from the guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guilddelete</STRONG> - Guild Leaders may use this command to disband a their
  guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildstatus [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG>  Will return the guild status of the targeted or named character (their rank
  within their guild, if any). This command will only work on characters within
  the same zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildleader [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Transfers guild leadership status to
  the targeted guild officer.. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildwar &lt;<EM>guild leader name</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>number</EM>&gt;</STRONG> -
  Allows the guild leader to challenge or accept another guild in guild war.
  Both parameters are necessary, and both guild leaders must execute the
  command. The number is the number of days that the guild war will last, from
  1 to 14. All members of a guild at war with another guild are PvP with each
  other for the duration of the guild war. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildpeace &lt;<EM>guild leader name</EM>&gt;</STRONG>- Allows the guild leader
  to end a guild war. Both guild leaders must execute this command to end the
  war. Guild war will end in any case after the time limit has passed. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildmotd &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Officers of a guilds can specify the
  text to show up after the regular server MOTD (Message of the Day) for each
  of their guild members when they log in. The guild message of the day will
  always be preceded by the name of the guild officer that set it up. There is a
  maximum of around 200 characters for this guild motd. Any new guild message
  of the day overwrites the last guild message of the day. When a server goes
  down, all guild messages of the day will be deleted and will need to be
  reset. There is no other way to delete a guild message of the day.

			Appendix B - Errata for the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark
  Manual
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark was released with a new printed
  manual, which is also available for download on the main EverQuest site at
  www.everquest.com. As with any static printed material associated with
  dynamic games such as EverQuest, information has a potential to be outdated.
  In addition to some obsolete information included in the manual, there were
  also several inaccuracies. These are listed below. Please refer to your
  printed or downloaded manual so that the comments may be taken in context.

	
		<h2>
			27.1
			Appendix B - Player Corpse Decay Times
		</h2>
	
	p.20: The bottom half of this
  page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status. The
  corpse timer has been changed since the manual was printed. The player-corpse
  decay times are as follows. Please note that all times are in real time, not
  game time: <BR><BR>If they are under level 10, all corpses decay in 3 minutes. <BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above and have no items on them, they decay in 3
  hours.<BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above with items, they decay in 7 days.<BR><BR><EM>*Note: It is best advised to get your corpse right away. Also note that
  the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			27.2
			Appendix B - Character Creation
		</h2>
	
	p.24: The starting city for
  the Iksar is listed as New Sebilis. It should be noted that New Sebilis is
  also known as Cabilis.

	
		<h2>
			27.3
			Appendix B - Sitting and Camping
		</h2>
	
	p.34: The &quot;Jargon
  Note&quot; makes reference to player-killers lingering around another
  player-killers regeneration point (bind point, where they return after death)
  in order to attack them again. It should be noted that this tactic (called
  &quot;Bind Point Camping&quot;) is considered un-sportsmanlike conduct in
  Player-versus-Player combat, and is against the rules.

	
		<h2>
			27.4
			Appendix B - Safe vs. Dangerous Locations
		</h2>
	
	p.35: Section should read: <BR><BR>As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and
  other players can't kill you. (You have to become a player-killer, or PK, to
  give other player-killers &quot;permission&quot; to attack you. You do this
  by giving a Priest of Discord the <STRONG>Child of Discord</STRONG> book in your inventory.)
  If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous
  guards may immediately come to the rescue, <STRONG>providing that they are fond of
  you. Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond
  of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.</STRONG> <BR><BR>*Note: Changes to the original text are in bold text.

	
		<h2>
			27.5
			Appendix B - &quot;Feeling Out&quot; Strangers
		</h2>
	
	p.40: It is stated that you
  cannot &quot;consider&quot; a merchant. You can, but you must use the
  &quot;Consider&quot; key (&quot;C&quot; by default) or type /consider on the
  command line.

	
		<h2>
			27.6
			Appendix B - Skills and Combat: Skills
		</h2>
	
	p.49: The next-to-last
  paragraph on this page reads, &quot;You can have anywhere from 0 to 100
  points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher
  skill ranking&quot;. This section is incorrect. This section should read: <BR><BR>Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill
  is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon
  your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill,
  you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain
  skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the
  skill page is &quot;Master&quot;. <BR><BR>If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your
  skill. <BR><BR>p.52: The &quot;Tiger Claw&quot; skill is listed under &quot;Other
  Skills&quot;. It should be listed under &quot;Combat Skills&quot; on p.51.

	
		<h2>
			27.7
			Appendix B - Participating in Parties
		</h2>
	
	p.76: It is stated that,
  &quot;Only people of similar experience levels can join a party. A level 11
  or 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30
  player can't&nbsp;- even if everyone agrees to it.&quot; This information is
  incorrect. Any player can group with any other, however the amount of
  experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of
  the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience
  from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not
  overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging.

	
		<h2>
			27.8
			Appendix B - Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	p.56: The bottom of this page
  references text color associated with &quot;Considering&quot; your target. The
  procession of text colors listed is: Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Red. The
  correct procession is: Green, Blue, White/Black (depending on video mode),

			Appendix C - New Commands and EQClient.ini Settings for
  Shadows of Luclin
		</h1>
	
	<STRONG>/facepick</STRONG> - this
  command brings up an interface that allows you to choose a new face for your
  character using the new models for Shadows of Luclin. You <STRONG>must</STRONG> have
  the Luclin character model enabled for the race of the characters whose face
  you are trying to change. <BR><BR><EM>Note: This command will be reusable for a while after the release of
  Luclin. However, soon after release this will become a one time only command,
  meaning that you will only be able to change your character's face once.
  Please read patch messages for an announcement on the date of this change.</EM>  <BR><BR><STRONG>/dismount</STRONG> (Luclin Only)&nbsp;- This command allows your character to
  dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so
  using the bridle. There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you
  to mount a horse.

	
		<h2>
			28.1
			Appendix C - New EQClient.ini Information
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>New eqclient.ini
  information:</STRONG> There are new lines in the eqclient.ini file for use with
  the Shadows of Luclin expansion. The majority of these settings are for use
  when deciding to turn off some or all of the new character models. This may
  be something that you need to do if your computer does not meet the suggested
  specifications in order to improve the performance of EverQuest. <BR><BR><EM>UseLuclinHumanMale=true<BR>UseLuclinHumanFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinBarbarianMale=true<BR>UseLuclinBarbarianFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinEruditeMale=true<BR>UseLuclinEruditeFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinWoodElfMale=true<BR>UseLuclinWoodElfFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinHighElfMale=true<BR>UseLuclinHighElfFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinDarkElfMale=true<BR>UseLuclinDarkElfFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinHalfElfMale=true<BR>UseLuclinHalfElfFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinDwarfMale=true<BR>UseLuclinDwarfFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinTrollMale=true<BR>UseLuclinTrollFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinOgreMale=true<BR>UseLuclinOgreFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinHalflingMale=true<BR>UseLuclinHalflingFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinGnomeMale=true<BR>UseLuclinGnomeFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinIksarMale=true<BR>UseLuclinIksarFemale=true<BR>UseLuclinElementals=true</EM> <BR><BR>Each of these lines can be used to tell the game to load or not to load
  specific models from the Shadows of Luclin expansion. Each model requires
  some system resources, so turning some or all of them off might improve the
  performance of the game. <BR><BR><EM>Note: If you have a character model turned off (using the old graphics)
  you will not be able to see any character of that type on a horse. Because
  the old models cannot ride horses, turning off the new model for a certain
  race/sex also turns off the ability to see them riding horses.</EM> <BR><BR>This line in the eqclient.ini file: <BR><BR><EM>LoadSocialAnimations=true</EM> <BR><BR>Turns on or off the new Shadows of Luclin character social animations. These
  animations also use up system resources, and turning them off might improve
  the performance of the game. However, if you turn them off you will not see
  any social animations for characters that you are displaying as new models.
  This includes things like /wave and /point animations.

			28.2
			Appendix C - Texture Cache
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Texture Cache:</STRONG> <BR><BR>In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to
  cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that your computer is
  doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and
  putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time you log in or zone the game
  has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during
  gameplay. <BR><BR>This, obviously, takes a little time. <BR><BR>We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard
  drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone. <BR><BR>This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive space to
  store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up as much as 1.5
  GB of hard drive space, though this would be the extreme. It could, however,
  easily use 500 MB of space on your hard drive. And because writing all this
  data to your hard drive takes a little time, the first time you use this
  feature it will take a bit longer to log in. <BR><BR>The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your hard
  drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any problems with a
  shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means that you will need to
  have plenty of hard drive space free to use this option; 500 MB plus the
  amount needed for the texture cache. <BR><BR>Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the
  texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your first
  log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as it writes
  these files to your hard drive. <BR><BR>The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and logged
  in to create the needed files, the game can then read that information
  directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating them each time
  you log in or zone. <BR><BR>What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings above
  those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only use ten
  models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good idea to turn on
  more models. This feature will not change that. Those recommendations are
  based on the amount of RAM you have available and your video card. The hard
  drive cache does not effectively add RAM to your machine, it just allows the
  game to save time creating the textures that your existing RAM and video card
  use. <BR><BR>There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture
  Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the
  eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the eqclient.ini
  file: <BR><BR><EM>TextureCache=TRUE</EM> <BR><BR>This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. The
  more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater the
  potential increase in loading times you will see using the Texture Cache. <BR><BR><EM>Remember</EM>: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain
  that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option on. The
  more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more space you will
  need. <BR><BR>We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a
  lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you
  should expect to see by using the texture cache.

			Appendix D - Alternate Advancement for Shadows of Luclin
		</h1>
	
	The alternative advancement
  system allows anyone who has purchased and installed EverQuest&reg;: Shadows
  of Luclin to further customize their high level (51+) characters. Customized
  features include things such as minor permanent statistic and resistance
  boosts, unique skills based on your class (warrior, magician, etc.) or
  archetype (fighter, magic user, and priest), and general skills available to
  everyone. These skills include anything from enhanced metabolism to
  improvements in skills already available to your class. You can also gain a
  title for your character based on the choices you make when enhancing your
  character. These titles will be visible to other players. <BR><BR>Gaining these alternate skills and powers will require the expenditure of
  experience points. You will be able to funnel incoming experience either into
  your alternative advancement pool or into your standard experience pool. You
  can even choose to have a percentage of your incoming experience go into each
  pool. Once enough experience has entered the alternative advancement pool,
  you will receive skill points that may be used to acquiring your
  enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will
  have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain. Some enhancements
  may have prerequisites. A prerequisite is a skill or skills that you will
  need to obtain before you can get the enhancement. <BR><BR>Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from the
  &quot;Leveling&quot; experience pool, it will not impact your alternative
  advancement pool. <BR><BR>You can access the Alternate Advancement menu by clicking on the ADV button
  in the inventory screen. <BR><BR><EM>Note</EM>: All characters will be able to open the interface screen for
  Alternate Advancement. But only those that actually purchase the Shadows of
  Luclin expansion will be able to earn any of these abilities. <BR><BR><EM>Also Note</EM>: EverQuest is an evolving game. We may add new abilities or
  change existing ones at a future date. We will, of course, attempt to keep
  changes to a minimum and will update this document to reflect such changes.

	
		<h2>
			29.1
			Appendix D - Unlocking Archetype and Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Unlocking Archetypes and
  Class Abilities:</STRONG> <BR><BR>There are three types of Alternate Abilities: General, Archetype and Class
  Abilities. Each is a stepping stone for the next. Attaining a certain number
  of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your
  Archetype. Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of
  abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class
  group. There are also level requirements for each of these levels. Keep in
  mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of
  Luclin. <BR><BR>These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some
  abilities. <BR><BR><EM>General abilities</EM>: A character must be level 51 or higher to open up
  the General abilities. <BR><BR><EM>Archetype abilities</EM>: A character must have spent six skill points on
  General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities.
  <BR><BR><EM>Class abilities</EM>: A character must have spent twelve skill points on
  Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class
  abilities.

	
		<h2>
			29.2
			Appendix D - Skill Levels and Skill Points
		</h2>
	
	Once you have gained enough
  experience points toward alternate advancement (enough to fill the experience
  bar) you will earn one skill point. It is these skill points that allow you
  to purchase alternate advancement abilities. Each ability will require a
  certain number of skill points to purchase one skill level with that ability.
  <BR><BR>Every ability available through the Alternate Advancement system has a skill
  level associated with it. For many of these abilities there is only one skill
  level, meaning that once you purchase the ability you have attained all the
  skill available for that ability. But several abilities have more than one
  skill level. Gaining a second or third (or more) skill level in an ability
  will improve that ability. However, it is important to note that a second
  skill level is usually more costly than the first, and the third more costly
  than the second. That expense is rewarded, however. If additional skill
  levels cost more, the skill level also means a greater increase in the power
  of that ability. <BR><BR><EM>Let's look at two examples</EM>: <BR><BR>Improved Natural Strength has five skill levels. However, each skill level
  for this ability costs one skill point. Each time you raise your skill level
  with this ability you gain two points of strength. <BR><BR>Healing Adept (from the Priest Archetype) has three skill levels. Each skill
  level costs progressively more skill points. The first skill level costs two
  skill points for a 2% improvement in healing spells. The second skill level
  costs four points, but improves that percentage to 5%. The third skill level
  costs six skill points, but raises the percentage to 10%.

	
		<h2>
			29.3
			Appendix D - Titles
		</h2>
	
	Upon attaining enough skill
  ranks with the Abilities of each type (General, Archetype and Class),
  characters will be granted a title to show their efforts. The title for
  anyone meeting the requirements for General Abilities will be given the title
  Baron or Baroness. Other titles will be given as the character progresses
  through their alternate advancement, but we don't want to spoil the fun by
  giving them all away here.

	
		<h2>
			29.4
			Appendix D - Ability Types
		</h2>
	
	There are two types of
  abilities, passive and active. <BR><BR>Passive abilities are always on and always have effect. Most abilities are
  passive. In fact, all General and all Archetype Abilities are passive. <BR><BR>Active abilities need to be triggered by the player. Every active ability has
  a Refresh Timer associated with it. This indicates how long it will be after
  using the ability before it can be used again. Refresh Timers are given with
  two times, in game time and real life time. For every minute that passes in
  the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world.

  cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use
  his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill
  level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability
  because they do not have the specialization skill. <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Reinforcement</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level

  character's chance for a critical hit (or grants a percentage where none
  exists). With all three skill levels, non-warriors will approach the basic
  ability to critical that warriors have. But a warrior with three levels of
  this skill will retain his a significantly greater chance to critical than
  any other class. <BR><BR><EM>Combat Stability</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the

			Appendix E - Chat Channels
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest players can now
  open or join as many as 10 chat channels above and beyond the pre-created channels.
  The commands and discussion below only apply to these player-created
  channels, not to the game-wide channels such as /ooc or /shout. <BR><BR><BR>These are a few of the terms used to describe the chat channel functions: <BR><BR>[] = optional parameters, &lt;&gt; = required parameters <BR><BR>&lt;CHANNEL&gt;= &lt;CHANNEL-NAME 1..10 |&gt;[:&lt;PASSWORD&gt;]<BR>&lt;CHANNEL-LIST&gt;= &lt;CHANNEL&gt;[,...] <BR><BR>This means that any place below where it lists &lt;CHANNEL-ENTRY&gt;you can
  use the &lt;CHANNEL-NAME&gt;with the password after it (don't forget the
  colon between the two), or just the channel name where no password is in use.
  And any place it lists &lt;CHANNEL-LIST&gt;you can use a series of
  &lt;CHANNEL-ENTRY&gt;separated by commas. <BR><BR>For example: /chat set Voxraidleader:seekrit,
  Voxraidgroupleader:notsoseekrit, Voxraidgeneral<BR>That would set three channels (Voxraidleader, Voxraidgroupleader and
  Voxraidgeneral), two with passwords (seekrit and notsoseekrit). Though we
  would suggest shorter channel names... :) <BR><BR><BR>Here is a list of the commands available for using chat channels. After that
  we'll give a few examples. <BR><BR>Note: Chat channel names are not case sensitive. You can use all lowercase
  letters if that makes it easier. The exception is creating channels. When you
  create a channel it will retain the capitalization you use when that name is
  displayed. But for any other use in the commands below you can use lowercase
  letter.

	
		<h2>
			30.1
			Appendix E - Chat System Command List
		</h2>
	
	<EM>/chat set
  &lt;channel-list&gt;</EM> - Makes you a member of all of the channels listed.
  You will be joined to those channels in the order listed (see /join below for
  details on what 'joining' a channel means). This will remove you from all
  previously joined channels. If you just want to join a new channel, use the
  /join command.<BR><BR><EM>/join &lt;channel-list&gt;</EM> - Allows you to join the channel or
  channels listed. If the channel does not yet exist it will create the channel
  and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator
  commands). Note: You may use spaces when creating a channel. But when the
  channel is created those spaces will be removed. So if you &quot;/join fluffy
  bunny&quot; the channel created will be &quot;fluffybunny&quot;. <BR><BR><EM>/leave &lt;channel&gt;</EM> - This will remove you from the channel. Note:
  You must specify a channel, either by name or by number, or the command will
  fail. <BR><BR><EM>/leaveall</EM> - Removes you from all channels. <BR><BR><EM>/list [channel]</EM> - Using this command without the [channel] parameter
  will list all of the channels that you are joined to, the channel number, and
  will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel. The
  channel number is specific to individual users, so two people in the same
  channel may not have the same channel number for that channel. Using the
  command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by
  name. <BR><BR><EM>/announce [on | off]</EM> - Toggles on and off the announcements heard when
  people join or leave channels. This is set OFF by default. <BR><BR><EM>/chat #&lt;channel-name&gt; &lt;message&gt;</EM> - Sends the message to the
  channel named. You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint to use a
  number. <BR><BR><EM>/&lt;1..10&gt; &lt;message&gt;</EM> - Sends the message to the chat channel
  number listed. You can discover the number of the channels you are joined to
  by using /list. If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to

  channels cease to exist once they are empty.<BR><BR><EM>/chat kick &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]</EM> - Kicks the character
  named off of the chat channel listed. If no channel is specified the character
  will be kicked our of your first channel (whichever channel is your channel

  mode. This means that only those given 'voice' in the channel will be able to
  speak in that channel. If no channel is specified your first channel
  (whichever channel is your channel number 1) will be set into moderated mode.
  This is a toggle command, so if you execute this command a second time the
  channel will return to unmoderated status. <BR><BR><EM>/chat voice &lt;character-name&gt; [channel]</EM> - Give the named
  character the ability to speak in a moderated channel. If no channel is

	/hitsmode allows you to
  create separate windows for your combat text. This is a rather advanced feature,
  so it might take a little practice to get the results that you want. <BR><BR>Here is the technical jargon: <BR><BR>Usage: /hitsmode &lt;my|me|other&gt; &lt;on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5&gt; &lt;X&gt;

  2.<BR>&lt;HEADER&gt; is either on or off. 1 to turn on and 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;BG&gt; controls the background. It is either on or off. 1 to turn it on
  or 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;WIDTH&gt; is the width of the background.<BR>&lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty. <BR><BR><EM>note: m5 is only valid for My Attacks. It's ignored for other types and m4
  is used instead.</EM> <BR><BR>off - nothing displayed (turns off all these hit messages, including those in
  the standard chat window)<BR>on - displayed as normal in the chat window (standard/default mode)<BR>M2 - displayed at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given
  font size. (displays all information shown in the chat damage message)<BR>M3 - displayed in condensed form at a given X,Y position for a given number
  of lines in a given font size. (damage type, target damages and damage
  amount)<BR>M4 - displayed as just the damage # at a given X,Y position for a given
  number of lines in a given font size. (only displays damage number)<BR>M5 - displayed in condensed form at given X, Y position (only for My Attacks

  /hitsmode command. <BR><BR>These setting are saved in the INI file and will be persistent. <BR><BR><EM>Special Notes:</EM> <BR><BR>The first time you use this setting, it is best to set all the parameters.
  However, you don't have to reset them all every time you want to make a
  change. <BR><BR>Using -1 in place of any given parameter will default back to the setting
  saved in the INI file. So you can use -1 for any parameter that you want to
  remain as it is while you change others. <BR><BR>You can also stop short of full parameters. If you don't include trailing
  parameters (for example you leave off &lt;WIDTH&gt;, it will use the settings
  for those parameters from the existing INI.
