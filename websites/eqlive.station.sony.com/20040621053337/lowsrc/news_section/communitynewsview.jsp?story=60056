	<h2>Ever Kindred is Now Adopting More on Firiona Vie</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>

	<P>There are many guilds already out there... why one more? Because it's so hard to find a good "fit" sometimes with a guild, one that is just what you're seeking. That is the problem I and several others kept finding ourselves facing, and so we decided to create just what we have been looking for. Maybe it will be just what you have been looking for, too.</P>
<P><A href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/beverkindred">http://pub30.ezboard.com/beverkindred</A></P>
<P>We are Ever Kindred. We are a good/neutral guild, with no restrictions on class, race, or season. First and foremost, we are an RP guild -- and that will carry over from ingame to our forums and back again. We do not just give RP lip service. Second, but just as important, we are a Family. Kindred spirits.</P>
<P>There are many serious guilds, with lofty goals and weighty mission statements. We are simply a circle of friends who share the same vision, and hope to draw in others who seek the same things we do. There will always be evil in Norrath, and we will always fight it -- but we will have fun in between. We have no desire to be a huge guild, or a raiding guild, or a grind-grind-grind guild. We are not about warring, or constant dueling, or politics. We are simply a Family who wants to RP together, foster inter-guild RP together, have fun together. Ale will usually be present. Pie fights are mandatory. </P>
<P>*grin*</P>
<P>For once, have your guild list and your friend list be one and the same. We are Ever Kindred... welcome home.</P><br>
