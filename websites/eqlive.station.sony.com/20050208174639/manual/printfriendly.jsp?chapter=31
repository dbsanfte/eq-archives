			Appendix F - Hits Mode - Combat Text Display Options
		</h1>
	
	/hitsmode allows you to
  create separate windows for your combat text. This is a rather advanced feature,
  so it might take a little practice to get the results that you want. <BR><BR>Here is the technical jargon: <BR><BR>Usage: /hitsmode &lt;my|me|other&gt; &lt;on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5&gt; &lt;X&gt;
  &lt;Y&gt; &lt;COUNT&gt; &lt;FONTSIZE&gt; &lt;HEADER&gt; &lt;BG&gt;
  &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; <BR><BR>my = My Attacks, me = Me Getting Hit, other = Others Attacks <BR><BR>If you choose M2 through M5, then:<BR>&lt;X&gt; and &lt;Y&gt; are the screen location.<BR>&lt;COUNT&gt; is how many lines of text will be displayed. The acceptable
  range is 1 to 10.<BR>&lt;FONTSIZE&gt; is a font size of the text. The acceptable range is 0, 1, or
  2.<BR>&lt;HEADER&gt; is either on or off. 1 to turn on and 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;BG&gt; controls the background. It is either on or off. 1 to turn it on
  or 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;WIDTH&gt; is the width of the background.<BR>&lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty. <BR><BR><EM>note: m5 is only valid for My Attacks. It's ignored for other types and m4
  is used instead.</EM> <BR><BR>off - nothing displayed (turns off all these hit messages, including those in
  the standard chat window)<BR>on - displayed as normal in the chat window (standard/default mode)<BR>M2 - displayed at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given
  font size. (displays all information shown in the chat damage message)<BR>M3 - displayed in condensed form at a given X,Y position for a given number
  of lines in a given font size. (damage type, target damages and damage
  amount)<BR>M4 - displayed as just the damage # at a given X,Y position for a given
  number of lines in a given font size. (only displays damage number)<BR>M5 - displayed in condensed form at given X, Y position (only for My Attacks
  - displays type of hit and damage number) <BR><BR>/clearhits will clear the current setting for the M2-M5 modes of the
  /hitsmode command. <BR><BR>These setting are saved in the INI file and will be persistent. <BR><BR><EM>Special Notes:</EM> <BR><BR>The first time you use this setting, it is best to set all the parameters.
  However, you don't have to reset them all every time you want to make a
  change. <BR><BR>Using -1 in place of any given parameter will default back to the setting
  saved in the INI file. So you can use -1 for any parameter that you want to
  remain as it is while you change others. <BR><BR>You can also stop short of full parameters. If you don't include trailing
  parameters (for example you leave off &lt;WIDTH&gt;, it will use the settings
  for those parameters from the existing INI.
