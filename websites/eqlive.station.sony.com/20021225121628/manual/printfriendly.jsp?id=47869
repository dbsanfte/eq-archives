			27.7
			Appendix B - Participating in Parties
		</h2>
	
	p.76: It is stated that, "Only people of similar experience levels can join a party. A level 11 or 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30 player can't&nbsp;- even if everyone agrees to it." This information is incorrect. Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>
