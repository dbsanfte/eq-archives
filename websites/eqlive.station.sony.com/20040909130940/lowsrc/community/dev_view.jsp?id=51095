<h1>Recommended Level</h1>
	There have been a bunch of rumors about the application of Recommended Level to a few items.  It seems that there has been some confusion about what Recommended Level meant when we introduced this with the launch of Shadows of Luclin.  Some of that confusion is our fault.  So let me clarify how Recommended Levels work and the general philosophy we plan to apply to its use.<P>This appeared in a patch message in January.  <P><I>- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the several items.  All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects.  Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item.  The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely informational</I><P>This has caused some confusion.  Rich Waters wrote something concerning this, and I want to quote part of it here.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>This quote is being misrepresented as to it's meaning. I'll break the change listed in the patch message down more clearly for you - <P><I>Added a Recommended Level equal to the <B>current item use level</B> for several items.<P>All of the items being referred to as changed this patch <B>already required the player to be level 51+ to even equip them or use their effects</B>.</I><P>Adding the Recommended level to these items did not change their utility in any way, as the Recommended Level placed on these items was identical to the level at which they could be equipped. The Recommended Level was added to the items referred to in that patch to show the pre-existing level requirement on the item itself.<P>A good example of an item changed for that patch in January is the "Di'zok Escape Staff ". This item has always had a level limitation of 56 on it. If you were lower than level 56, you were unable to equip the item, or click it to use its effect. In the January patch, I added a Recommended Level of 56 to the item so that someone could look at it and know that it could be used when they got to level 56.<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This had me confused as well (not that its hard to confuse me), so I can see how this could have been misunderstood.  Basically, the items we gave a Recommended Level to with that patch were items that already  had hard level restrictions.  We added the Recommended Level to help make those restrictions more obvious.  No functionality was changed for those items.<P>Now, on to the heart of the matter.<P>The Recommended Level of an item indicates at what level the item will be most effective.  The greater the difference between the Recommended Level of an item and the level of the character using it, the less effective that character will be with the item.  The effect can be very noticeable if the level difference is large.<P>This allows us a lot more freedom when dealing with items that would have received the No-Drop tag previously.  There are, basically, two reasons to use the No-Drop tag on an item (though Im sure there are plenty of other reasons).  One would be instances where we want the item to be obtained by the character in person rather than by purchase from another character.  These can be seen most often with quest items and things like planar gear. Those cases would probably still receive a No-Drop tag.<P>But cases where the item might be tagged No-Drop to prevent twinking the item, that item can now be given scalability by setting a recommended level.  This would allow you to pass items down to characters and those items will grow as they grow.  It also means that if you manage to play above your level and defeat some fearsome foe to gain a Sword of Dragon Slaying, your character can wield that weapon and it will grow as he levels.<P>Recommended Level allows our designers to be a lot more flexible with item creation, an excellent alternative to just making an item No-Drop or a hard level limit (like the Club of the Ice Ocean, where a character cant equip the item unless he is of a certain level).<P>I also wanted to address the rumors about changes to certain items on Test.<P>No, we havent changed the Fungi Tunic on Test.  However, it is possible that we will do so in the future.  We have been following the discussion about this item across the fan sites and from emails sent in to us directly.  The Tunic is a pretty good example of the kind of item that has a dramatic affect on the game when it is used by lower level characters.  We understand that some people see that as a good thing, while others see it as a bad thing.<P>We havent made any decisions about applying the Recommended Level to items like the tunic.  But I wanted to let you know that such a change is not impossible, for the tunic or other items with similar affect when twinked.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]
