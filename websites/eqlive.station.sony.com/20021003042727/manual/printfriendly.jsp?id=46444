			Communicating
		</h2>
	
	<P>EverQuest provides an ongoing source of social interaction. You can chat with fellow players on message boards, or talk to NPCs and other players within the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity "hear" you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><I>To send messages to characters near&nbsp;you&nbsp;in the game:</I> <BR><BR>* Press <B><I>Enter</I></B> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <B><I>Enter</I></B> to send the message.<BR><I>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode, which is the default setting.</I></P>
<P><EM>To send messages only to a specific character:</EM></P>* Press <B><I>Enter</I></B> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text cursor.<BR>* Type /tell [charactername] [your message].<BR>* Press <B><I>Enter</I></B> to send the message.
<P></P>
<P>Use the <B><I>r</I></B> key to reply to the last person that sent you a /tell. <B><I>r</I></B> puts /tell [charactername] into your chat bar for you. All you have to do then is type the message and hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>.</P>
<P><I>To talk to a non-player character (such as a shopkeeper NPC):</I> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the Target Window), then press <STRONG><EM>h</EM></STRONG>.<BR><I>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</I><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using those words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><I>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using inappropriate language.</I> <BR><BR></P>
