<h1>Magician questions</h1>
	<B>I think the mages in this game have waited long enough.  And now the quotes from the Fan Faire are even more disturbing.<P>Explain your passion for hating mages?</B><P>I can't explain it because we don't hate mages.  I can't even imagine how you could think such things.  There is no reason nor point to any one here 'hating' any class.  We don't.<P><B>First off - why are so many zones non-Call of the Hero compatible? </B><P>Because the use of Call of the Hero in those zones allows characters to skip content that we do not wish to be skipped.<P><B>Grodin is quoted as saying he wished they never made the spell.  Well that makes us mages hopeful for anything doesn't it?  You made it.  Now use it.</B><P>Well, based on the fact that Magicians don't like it when we disable the use of the spell in a few zones, and the fact that allowing the spell to work in those zones invalidates the whole risk/reward concept in the zone, I can certainly understand how the existence of this spell could be seen as troublesome.<P>However, we are not prepared to allow this one spell to prevent us from implementing interesting content.  As I've said before, we'd rather disable one spell in a few zones than never explore content that that spell would invalidate.<P><B>It's not like we do much else.  We have basically 2 nukes - fire/magic (some places those are useless), pet pathing is no good almost everywhere (no one wants you to use them thanks to that.)</B><P>Indeed, <I>some</I> NPCs are practically immune to either fire or magic.  Very rarely, however, are both of those magic types highly resisted.  And pet pathing isn't perfect, but it certainly isn't as bad as you make it sound.<P><B>t leaves us two things.  Mod rods and CoH.<BR>Mod Rods - well thats nice.  Use my mana (which I can't use on nukes/pets anyway) for someone else.  Effective yet boring.</B><P>Use your nukes and your pets.  As I said, there are very few places where you can't use them.<P><B>CoH - better.  I can get members into the battle who could not log in earlier due to good reasons. Effective, perfect etc.</B><P>This was the desired use of this spell, to let members of your raid join late.  Sadly, that isn't the only use for the spell.<P><B>Secondly - You increase the drop rate on Magi P`Tasa in hate.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> Wonderful!!  BUt now let's look at something else said.  We don't want many mage epics floating around.  But other classes you do?  If they are epic make them somewhat equal.</B><P>Are you asking us to reduce the power of your epic?<P>The mage epic is hard, that's true.  But it is hard because it's an excellent epic.<P><B>You told us to try things out before asking you about them.  Well we have.  We are upset, you are making mages a pointless class to play.  And we have been asking - just give us a reason.<P>Havneq - 57 mage Tribunal</B><P>Mages are not a pointless class at all.<P>We'll certainly review them when we look at all the caster issues in the near future.  And I'm absolutely willing to hear about your concerns.  I would like to urge you all, however, to try to avoid exaggeration.  Focus on specifics and solutions.<P><BR><B>Fixes for the current mage problems, please consider.<P>First let me start off by saying this, when you increased the Melee of all of classes, rogue, monk, sk/pal, warriors, Bards you forgot the one class that relies on a pet as their main form of damage. Please seriously consider changing them(mage pets) to another table of damage. not making them hit for more damage, but hitting more than 50% of the time. <P>Next let me give a few suggestions for alternate class skills. The first i would like to adress is Mass Group Buff, This skill was given to a class that has 1 line of buffs in the entire game. In place of mass group buff: How about pet casting mastery? this would be a great opposite in place of spell casting fury mastery that wizards recieve. Pet will spawn with 3/11/20 more % of hp, ac, str, dex, instead of the normal pet template? maybe at level 3 the pet will have a chance to Crit like normal melee? <P>Another Skill that needs to be looked into is Frenzied burnout.. Suggestions: Increase the buff duration to 32 minutes. The current buff duration is 36 seconds and a recast of 72 minutes, chances to flurry and rampage, and with no explosion of damage at the end as is described in the advanced skills explanation. In its current form This skill is not completly worthless, but if you'll compare what its supposed to do with other class effects like enchanter dire charm, and the necro undead charm it falls way way short.<P>Thanks <BR>Parsalin D'ayl <BR>Tunare server</B><P>Let me start by responding to you last point first.<P>Frenzied Burnout is bugged.  The explosion isn't working properly.  We're trying to fix that.<P>Admittedly, Mass Group Buff isn't as useful to Mages as others.  I'm not sure we can do something like you described as Pet Casting Mastery.  I'm not sure that we can add power to pets like that.  Even the focus pets don't really work that way.  But I'll pass it on.<P>We didnt really forget pets when we did the melee balancing.  Pets have to be evaluated in conjunction with the caster and his spells.  Evaluating pets will go hand in hand with the caster balancing that we're undertaking.<P><BR>Pirotes wrote:<P><B>Absor,<BR>     I've been playing Everquest before Kunark came out at a time when you had to raid to camp the Sol B Efreeti. Recently I have been wondering what happened to class balance. As a Mage I am horrified by Dire Charm. I worked hard to get my epic and it's effect is outdone by some guy who exp farmed for less time than I camped Quillmane for. I could have sworn that it was a mage's ability to have the best pets and now a class with better mana regen, stuns and messes also has a higher damage output than me. I have seen enchanters charm mobs that hit for 120+ with far more hp than mine, who can buff their pets just as well as I do and slow mobs to boot.<BR>    I'm not calling for a nerf of dire charm, but I think mages deserve to have the best pets. If enchanters are going to be able to charm mobs, we should be able to make pets which can outdo their damage.</B><P>I would love to have some specific examples of NPCs that can be charmed using Dire Charm that are as powerful as you claim.  I need specifics in order to be able to research what you claim.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Thanks for finally responding to Mages Absor.<P>Needless to say Mages have been a little on the heated side since some of the comments were released from the Fan Faire.<P>I don't know if you've followed the thread on the Mage board at all, but the issue that sparked this latest round of "disgust with Verant" was a the comment from Abashi that he still saw mages as overbalanced when it comes to soloing.<P>Needless to say this got us going, because post 50 mages are not good soloers when compared to other classes, Monks with average gear are much better than we are, and I would not consider Monks as good as Druid, Shamen, Necros, Wizzards or Enchanters. To watch a monk lvl 58 be able to farm the entire Lava Duct Crawlers area in SOLB by himself is amazing, spawn after spawn. We are great for farming greens and light blues (better than any other class imo), but not xp soloing. I could go into detail about mages not being able to divert enough damage, but I'm sure you understand the game mechanics better than I do post 50. <P>My point is post 50, mages are middle of the road soloers, and for Abashi to make a comment like that really got mages questioning if Verant really knows what?s happening in the end game when it comes to mages.<P>Please don't read this as an endorsement for more high end soloing abilities, because I hate soloing. <P>I would really appreciate it if you could comment on this issue because I think it?s why many mages think that Verant has it "out for them" as of late.<P>Thanks,<P>Nandail<BR>55th Mage on Tunare</B><P>Well, let me start by apologizing for sounding rough.  It's just that I get frustrated when I get a bunch of commentary that is vague and angry.  Obviously there are issues that folks want to talk about, but I can't address unspecific anger.<P>As for Mages and their solo ability, they are indeed one of the best solo classes.  Up until 50 they can be considered among the top 3.  After 50 perhaps they fall more toward the middle of the pack.<P>If you look at the life of the class, this places them pretty much third or fourth in over all solo ability, by my estimation.  I know that it's tempting to only look at the end game, especially when you're playing it.  But the life of the character is more than that. <P>And if I seem like I'm rattling your cages a bit, maybe I am.<P>I really need you folks to be more precise and less emotional when sending in comments.  It makes it much easier for me to present your ideas to the team.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

I want to thank the many of you that sent in calm reasoned responses to my last comments.  Because there were so many of them, and most of them were rather lengthy (like the one from Citen below), I'm not going to post a bunch of them.  In fact, I'm only going to post one today.<P>But I want to address a few points that came up.<P>Yes, I most certainly could look up all of the NPCs that can be Dire Charmed based on level and make my own list.  But I wanted to address an issue that I suspected was happening.  While a lot of folks sent in lists of NPCs that were rather accurate and useful, some folks sent in lists with NPCs that were significantly too high level for Dire Charm to affect.  Many included NPCs that, while charmable with that ability were in zones where using those NPCs for gaining experience wouldn't be too useful.  This indicates to me that while some folks know the limitations of Dire Charm, some don't.  Now this is perfectly understandable, as not that many characters have attained the ability, and it's not available to Mages at all.<P>Most of the rest of the kinds of comments you sent in are covered below.  It's long, so I'll make comments within the text.<P><BR><B>Greetings.<P>First off, Id like to apologize for the countless emails im sure you get from every other mage in the world that is vague, haughty, and angry. They serve no purpose but to make mages look bad.</B><P>Despite how I sounded, it's not really a problem.  I understand being passionate about the game.  If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.<P><B>Now then. First off, I'm not level 60, and I don't have my epic. Im just an average little 52 mage trying to grind my up through the levels. I haven't parsed my earth pet's damage versus a similar level warrior or poured over the mana ratio of mage and druid nukes because thats really not my idea of fun. The following opinions are just the impressions I have gotten from playing EQ for about 2 years now.</B><P>That works.  Most of your comments matched up well with what others wrote.<P><B>The main 'problem' with mages is their lack of place in a group. This problem becomes compounded in the 50+ levels, but it does exist before then. The cause for this problem, despite what lots of people say, is something thats not really within your sphere of control. Because for such a long time, mages havent trully had a specific group role, at least none like a cleric, enchanters, or wizards role, most players have relagated them to a 2nd rate class..a class you put in your group because you can't find anyone else.</B><P>Pre-50 I don't think Mages have a problem finding a place in groups.  There may be a few places that, due to pathing issues, Mages tend to avoid, but if the player is good, friendly and knows how to work with a group, finding groups pre-50 isn't all that bad.  As many noted, the Mage can solo pretty well pre-50.  This does tend to mean that Mages will solo.  That means that groups don't see too many Mages.  Which leads to them not knowing what a Mage can do, which might lead to Mages finding trouble grouping.  But pre-50 the issue isn't with the class, it's with the social dynamics of the game.<P>Post 50 you are talking more and more about raids (at least you were until Luclin).  And I get the sense that when Mages say that they are never wanted in groups, it's 'raid' groups that they are talking about, not so much experience groups.  We can talk about that 2nd rate class comment a bit later...<P><B>Now, some people say lots of people don't have a definate role in a group, but I have seen that most indeed do. For example:<BR>Clerics offer supperior healing and buffing abilities.<BR>Shaman's offer slow spells, haste buffs, and a very good line of stat buffs.<BR>Druid's offer snare, tracking, healing, buffing, magic damage, and transport/evac abilities.<BR>Warriors offer supreme tanking and melee damage dealing power.<BR>Rogues offer very good melee damage and scouting abilities with hide/sneak.<BR>Monks offer very good pulling skills and melee damage.<BR>Rangers offer tracking and snare, along with some good unique buffs and melee damage output.<BR>Shadow Knights offer good pulling skills and very good aggro management abilities.<BR>Paladins offer very good tanking skills and superb stun abilities, which can be very useful against fast mobs or caster mobs.<BR>Wizards offer supreme magic damage output and transport/evac abilities.<BR>Necromancers offer supreme DOTs and their darnkess snare line.</B><P>I can hear members of some of the classes you mention above bursting to disagree with your evaluation, especially if you are talking about raids.  For an experience group, I'll accept your summary.<P><B>Now then, that leaves Magicians.<BR>What do Magicians offer?<BR>#1. Melee Damage through their pets. Pets are intended to be and are our main form of damage output. But, this benefit is often taken away because of pathing issues. And while pathing is not a massive problem in every single zone in Everquest..its such an annoyance in so many that i simply refuse to bother with it most times. I just use Summon Companion. I summon a pet, /pet guard here. When a pull comes, i stand near mob, Summon Compantion, /pet attack. If the group moves I either resummon or Summon Companion. Now then, yes, this does avert pathing, but it is a trully cumbersome process, and I doubt was the whole intention of the spell.</B><P>I'm not going to try to tell you that the pathing in EverQuest is perfect.  We are well aware that it's not.  You, however, do seem to have a workable solution to some of the problems.  The number of zones where pathing would exclude the use of pets, though, isn't some laundry list that never ends.<P><B>A few places I know pathing to be bad, at least as far in pets are concerned:<BR>Plane of Hate: Most all of the 2nd floor, and a good portion of the first floor. 2nd floor pathing in particular is bad. It is very very common to see mobs or pets heading in very strange circle patterns that eventually reach the raid party, but not before picking up a few friends on the way.</B><P>Hate, the most commonly mentioned bad pathing zone.  We've fiddled and fiddled with it, and it still sucks.<P><B>Ruins of Akheva: The hallway off to the right from the main entrance hallway has some places where if a mob is directly in front of me, the pet will go behind the mob and come back around to the front of it to attack.</B><P>Fair enough.  But you're talking about some spots in one location of that zone.  That certainly doesn't condemn the whole zone.  Most of the problem zones are like that, bad spots where pets are a bad idea.  Again, not a great thing.<P><B>I have no idea how the pathing in everquest works, or if it can really be 'fixed'. If it can't be, then a better workaround for pet owners should be found. Possibly having pets follow the owners like players follow each other, possibly giving a spell that allows the owner direct control over the movement of the pet for a short period of time.</B><P>In cases where you know the problem spots, Summon Companion works just fine to solve this.  As for other solutions, I'll certainly bring it up to the team.<P><B>#2. Magic damage through nukes. Personally, Im rather happy with how my nukes stack up. Not as good as a wizards. Druids have similar damage spells, but that has to be taken in context of the fact that the druid usually has other uses for his mana besides just nuking. He might need to watch health bars for heals, have mana to refresh sow or other buffs, have an emergency supply for an evac, etc. So while if a mage and druid both only nuked, the druid would be equal or better, this situation is not going to happen a lot. The only thing I would like to see in mage nukes are some cold based spells, nothing spectacular. Possibly summoning gusts of intensly cold planar wind with a small stun in addition to damage.</B><P>The idea of giving Mages a broader range of damage types keeps coming up.  Regardless of any claims to being the "masters of elements", broad damage range is the purview of the Wizard.  I don't know if you should expect to see other damage types.<P><B>#3. Utility Summons. I think this are has improved with Luclin. The Elemental Blanket and Defender are both great items. The Shard of the Core is useful now with the NO DROP tag removed. And summoning arrows and daggers will be useful as long as monks want to throw sharp things at giants. The improvement I'd like to see in this area would be utility summons for the mage besides food/water/bandages/beer (BTW thank Brell for Bristlebane's Bundle). My idea is a line of summons similar to the Beastlord line of Spirit of XXX spells, which imbue thier pets with various procs or abilities. Id like to see the mage be able to summon special weapons for each of his pets that enhance his natural abilities. These spells would be rare drops or quested, as they would be powerful and rare scrolls. Possibly a dagger of air with a small haste percentage for air pets, earthen blades (too bad that name is already taken) which had STR HPS and AC. Liquid spears with a very small slow (1-2% maybe-The idea being the mob cannot move as fast when experiencing such intense cold). Fire hammers with an atk bonus or possibly debuff. These spells could take the natutal strenghs of the various pets and amplify them, thus making them more useful overall, and making it easier to both solo and be effective in groups.</B><P>All interesting ideas.  One of the most common suggestions for improving mage pets, along with the idea of just buffing them up straight out.<P><B>#4. CoTH. I don't have this spell yet, so I can't really comment on it much. I can see how this spell has been turned around from its original intention. Mages defend it so fiercily because many see it as thier saving grace, the spell that gives their needed role in a group. If Mages could be given a broader and more definate role, then many would be so angry when it is tweaked back to its original intention.</B><P>Well, broader might not be a good idea.  Mages really do three things, summon stuff, pets and damage (ok, and debuff).  I'm not sure that I like the idea of broadening the abilities of any class, as that almost always leads to infringing on the stuff that others do.  Unless that broadening was into a completely new direction, and new directions are hard to find.  I'd like to see suggestions for improvement more like your #3, ideas that build on existing areas for the Mage.<P><B>So, my overall point is this: Mages need a role in groups, and to do this we need to have reliable damage output from our pets. This can be aquired by somehow dealing with the various pathing problems so people no longer have a fear of pets causing trains and death. Improved summons for our pets can make them even more effective, and thus more desiarable for groups.</B><P>All in all that seems like the way to go if improvements are to be made.  I would disagree with the idea that there would be no fear of pets causing trains and death, but it sure would be nice if such things were only cause by intentional game mechanics rather than weird game code.<P><B>Thank you very much for listening to your players and dealing with the bad seeds among those players. <P>Sincerly,<BR>Citen Clanbreaker<BR>52 Mage of Brell<BR>Karana Server<BR>Illuminatus Guild, VFA Alliance<BR>"Cause a Home just isn't a home..without a Gnome"</B><P>Thanks for the nice letter.<P>Keep sending in ideas and comments folks.<P>Alan<BR>
