<h2>Patch Message, January 9, 2002</h2>
<P>January 9, 2003&nbsp; 3:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P>** Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface **</P>
<P>Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others).&nbsp; However, with the release of some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces.&nbsp; They have been disabled as of today.</P>
<P>They served us well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>** EQ in a Window **</P>
<P>EverQuest can now be run in a window.&nbsp; To place EverQuest in a window, simply press Alt-Enter.&nbsp; You can also switch out of EverQuest to another program by using the familiar Alt-Tab.&nbsp; It is important that you do not do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process.</P>
<P>It is important to note a few things.&nbsp; Running the game in a window may reduce game performance a bit.&nbsp; And, as always, the more programs you have running at the same time the more resources they use.</P>
<P>At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest.&nbsp; We will be working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>** Songs Window **</P>
<P>We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality.&nbsp; The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs.&nbsp; This increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones).&nbsp; The new window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs).&nbsp; Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those.&nbsp; Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.</P>
<P>Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first.&nbsp; Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window.&nbsp; Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.</P>
<P>Note for User Interface skin creators:&nbsp; The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs window song names.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered.&nbsp; In most cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them.&nbsp; <BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too long to respawn.<BR>- Wu's Attack should now work correctly.<BR>- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-type spells in their proper order.<BR>- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player characters.<BR>- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies.<BR>- Sending special characters (such as &lt; and ") via EQIM will no longer freeze the game.<BR>- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no longer cause the game to crash.<BR>- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default properly.<BR>- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.<BR>- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem.&nbsp; He should no longer be hated in Fear, just feared...<BR>-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50 and over.</P>
