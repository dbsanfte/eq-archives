	When you start, you've got
  enough food and drink to last for a while. But eventually you will need more,
  and you might want to purchase better armor and equipment from a merchant. To
  do this, you'll need money. <BR><BR>By far the best way to gain that money is by defeating enemies. In the areas
  just outside of the city that you start in you will be able to find small
  creatures, often in plague proportions. You can aid your fellow citizens and
  earn cash in the process by defeating these pests and looting their corpses.
  Merchants will buy most of these items for a few copper pieces. It's not
  much, but it's a start. And at the same time you will be earning some
  experience, practice for much greater deeds to come. Just don't wander too
  far from your friendly guards until you've gained a few levels, or if you're
  feeling very brave. <BR><BR>FYI: 1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 silver = 1000 copper
