		<h2>
			6.1
			Sitting and Camping
		</h2>
	
	The sit and camp buttons are located on the Main Tab of the Actions Window.<BR><BR>Whenever you're resting, you should sit down. This allows your character to recover more quickly than standing or walking. <BR><BR><I>To sit:</I> <BR><BR>* Click the <B>Sit</B> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <B><I>Enter</I></B> and type <I>/sit</I> into the chat bar, then hit <B><I>Enter</I></B> again to have your character sit <BR><BR>Camp when you're ready to exit the game. This process takes about 30 seconds. Your character must first sit before he can camp. When you return to the game later your character will be where you left him and in the same condition (if he was wounded, he'll still be wounded). Keep that in mind when choosing your campsite (choose a safe place). <BR><BR>To Camp: <BR><BR>* Click the <B>Camp</B> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <B><I>Enter</I></B> and type <I>/camp</I> into the chat bar, then hit <B><I>Enter</I></B> again to have your character camp <BR><BR><I>Jargon Note: If you hear other players talking about "camping", they may not be referring to leaving the game. Some players linger ("camp") around an NPC's regeneration point (where they return after dying) in order to attack the newly returned monster.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			6.2
			Safe vs. Dangerous Locations
		</h2>
	
	As a new character stay near to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters. Once you venture into the wilderness, you're fair game for any non-player predators out there. Gnoll pups are notorious for ganging up on solo travelers, as are Kobolds. Generally speaking, the farther you are from a friendly city the more dangerous the area will be.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			6.3
			Modes of Transportaion
		</h2>
	
	In EverQuest, you can travel via several methods. You've already learned how to walk, run and swim (short distances). A few cities have docks from which you can catch a boat. Some powerful spell-casters can also cast teleportation spells. <BR><BR><I>To take a boat:</I> <BR><BR>* Find a pier and stand or sit nearby. Make sure you can see the end of the dock<BR>* When a boat arrives, walk onto it <BR><BR>To be teleported, you must either know a teleporting spell, or find a character to cast one on you. Some teleport spells affect only the user or target, while others can teleport entire groups of characters.<BR><BR>
