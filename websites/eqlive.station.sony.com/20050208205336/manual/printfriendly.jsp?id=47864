	p.34: The &quot;Jargon
  Note&quot; makes reference to player-killers lingering around another
  player-killers regeneration point (bind point, where they return after death)
  in order to attack them again. It should be noted that this tactic (called
  &quot;Bind Point Camping&quot;) is considered un-sportsmanlike conduct in
  Player-versus-Player combat, and is against the rules.
