			Dragon Circles (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Players in Velious will notice "Dragon Circles" in the Iceclad Ocean, the Great Divide, the Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar. These dragon circles are teleport locations for the wizard and druid teleports into Velious. <BR><BR>Dragon teeth were needed in order to teleport to these locations. That is no longer the case. As long as a druid or wizard has a spell to group gate a party to any of these dragon circles, all party members will be teleported as well, provided they have the Velious expansion. <BR><BR>
