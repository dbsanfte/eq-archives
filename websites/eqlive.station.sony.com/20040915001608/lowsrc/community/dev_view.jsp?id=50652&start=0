<h1>Sneaking, Hiding and You</h1>
	<B>In my time since I started playing EQ, I have played several characters with the sneak and hide ability combination (including a rogue).<P>The part I have yet to understand is why only the rogue has a success/failure messsage. Seemings that most classes receive sneak or hide at different levels, it would seem a bit more logical to have a success/fail message, starting at the level you can begin advancement (pay Practice Points into the skill).<P>In my opinion, this would not be taking anything away from the rogue class nor making an unbalanced game addition.<P>The sneak and hide combination is a very fun and useful part of the EverQuest world and I would like to be able to see more character types be able to take advantage of this ability in a more believable (it is a little hard to believe only a rogue knows whether they have hidden or is truly sneaking) format. Thank you for your time.</B><P>The success message is an advantage for the Rogue.  The message is not given to other classes with those skills specifically so that it can be an advantage to the rogue.  And, actually, it is fairly reasonable.  When you're trying to hide behind something it isn't all that easy to tell if you are properly hidden.  You may very well have a toe sticking out that you don't know about, or the top of your head may be sticking up (bad hair day, perhaps).<P>So, yes, that message is an advantage for the Rogue, and we don't plan to allow other classes to get it.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Along the same lines, how come classes that get sneak and hide cannot sneak while hidden?<P>I am a 55 ranger and I have had Hide since level 1 (wood elf) and Sneak since level 10.  Why is it that when I hide successfully (I usually con something to test it) and sneak successfully (easy way to tell, you move slower when it is successful), moving breaks hide.  I've always thought that others besides rogues should be able to do this, if not with the same skill.<P>Hell, even if rangers only got it in the outdoors (as befits their skill set), that would be cool, without taking away from the rogue class abilities.<P>Llerian Moonbow<BR>55 Outrider of Iratus Lepus<BR>Zeb</B><P>For the same reason.  It is the advantage for being a Rogue that you can sneak and hide at the same time.  For gameplay, it's an advantage that we chose to give to Rogues.  For explanation in the game world, Rogues are better trained at the specific combination of those two skills than others (as noted by their lower skill cap).  Those two things, the Rogue ability to use both hide and sneak at the same time and the success messages, were given to them specifically to make those skills more useful to them than to others.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Well I can understand it being a benefit of the rogue class, but to make a parallel that kind of shows our side of it look to other class abilities.  Rangers are traditional known as what?  Masters of the outdoors and are master trackers.  Our tracking skill is shared with druids and bards.  Personally I dont think anyone but rangers should have it, as with rogues and sneak/hide, but you chose to give out one class ability to others at a lower skill level.  Why not do the same for rangers with sneak/hide?  It would fit the class as rangers are a pretty swift, silent and deadly woodland warrior.<P>I guess I hear your explanation, but it doesnt hold up when compared to other abilities, and thus I dont agree with your conclusions.<P>Im not saying your explanation isnt valid.  I'm just using your logic used on another class defining abililty(tracking) to validate our side of things(rangers getting the ability to sneak/hide).<P>Personally, and I want to make this clear, I DONT think rangers should get the ability to sneak and hide at the same time.  But since verant has diluted our class defining ability by giving it to others (come on, if you were to look at a list of all the classes and asked someone who's never played EQ who are the trackers, rangers would be selected 9 times out of 10 with rogues probably getting the other 1), why not give us at least the ability to know if we were successful.  We get camo which does the same thing essentially so getting the ability to sneak/hide would only add the security of knowing its not gonna run out at the worst time, which camo does at every possible inconvenience.  I guess my point is I just dont see why such a rigid line is being drawn on the sneak hide thing, when so many other abilities are shared across many other classes, tracking used as an example since that one personally chaps my butt  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Chimaera<BR>56 ranger</B><P>Actually, it matches perfectly with your example of tracking and rangers.<P>Rangers get tracking, it is a defining skill for them.<P>Rogues get hide and sneak, also defining skills for them.<P>Rangers get all the (admittedly new) enhancements to tracking, along with a higher skill cap that helps them when it comes to range and other issues.  Other classes that don't feature tracking as their skill don't get those enhancements.<P>Rogues get the special abilities tied with hide and sneak, such as the success messages and the ability to use them together.  Other classes that don't feature tracking as their skill don't get those enhancements.<P>The parallel is pretty solid, I think.<P><BR><B>OK, adding to this...<P>1.) How come it takes a rogue 50+ levels to learn how to sneak while running? <BR>2.) How come on PvP casters can cast 'see invis' and see hidden rogues. Doesn't it make sense that the spell 'Invisibility' is an illusion spell. And the spell 'see invis' is a spell to allow you to see those illusions? If a rogue hides behind a tree or a bush (physical means) how can they be detected by a 'see illusion' spell? Are those trees and bushes illusionary? (stating that the current EQ engine does not allow this is acceptable)<P>Regards, <P>Roamer<BR>TZ</B><P>Because the ability to run when sneaking can't be easy to do.  Not unlike an archer learning to shoot from horseback.  Sure, he can shoot very well standing still...<P>And it's a reward for earning levels, much like specialization is for casters.<P>As for the See Invisibility thing, nobody gets to be completely invisible.  That's why.  It would be very unbalancing, especially in PvP, if someone could be completely hidden with no way of being discovered.<P>As for the spell, who says that the spell doesn't simply enhance the persons vision in such a way that their perceptions allow them to pierce shadow and foliage and any other sort of cover that the rogue is hiding behind?  There's no reason to interpret See Invisible as a 'see illusion' spell.  In fact, that's obviously not what it does, since it allows the caster to see hidden rogues...<P><BR>Trenzor wrote:<P><B>Absor,<P>While playing with my new Rogue I found the message for a success or failure of the Hide skill.  Nice I thought.  While in Third person view however,<P>-- when I get the successful hide message, I do in fact disappear.<P>-- when I get the fail to hide message, I still disappear yet my friends can see me.<P>I tested this with my Druid and the same thing.  Though the only message the Druid gets is "starting to hide..." if my third person view shows me disappearing, my friends often can still see me (also the mobs I discovered).  This indicates that the Hide failed but my own view of myself shows I disappeared.<P>Can you explain this?</B><P>Sure can.  Because if you could tell from the third person view whether or not you were hidden that would be exactly the same as getting a success message, and therefore nobody gets it.  Rogues, instead, get the message.<P>Alan<BR>

Unlike an invisibility spell you should still be able to see your body with your own eyes unless you shut them tight. We can tell that isn't happening, because the screen would be black  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sepulture of the Tribunal</B><P><BR>Well, yes, it would be better...<P>*shrug*<P>It's the way it is...  most likely due to one of those things that just happens...<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Inizen wrote:<P><B>If you want to talk about hiding behind a tree for someone not to see you, what's stopping you from literally doing just that? =)</B><P>Smartypants.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>I can agree with Absor on most points in this discussion.  However there is one point that I cannot reconcile with the explainations.  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  He is the master tracker and can tell how big and bad a creature is by smelling it on the air.  He above all others should have the sneak/hide combination "In A Wilderness Setting".  So you don't allow in in cities, dungeons, etc. that's fine and reasonable.  But, when it comes to the great outdoors, no one should be able to move undetected about better than a ranger. Even if you don't give them the message they should still be able to do both at the same time.  <P>Being trained for a lifetime on how to get close to animals without spooking them Rangers would have to be able to sneak/hide in the wilderness.  Rogues are trained on how to sneak/hide from "people" if anything their ability should be deminished when in the rangers world of the outdoors trying to hide from animals/monsters.  I am not suggesting that the Rogues be nerfed in the wilderness, only that the ability combination be give to rangers on their home turf.<P>JackMagist</B><P>I'm not trying to convince you that a ranger wouldn't be good at hiding in a wilderness setting.  I don't disagree with the idea at all.<P>I'm telling you that the reason that rogues get the ability to sneak and hide at the same time and nobody else does is simply because that's one of their special perks.<P>It's pretty easy to justify a lot of things in a roleplaying game.  I can justify any class/race combination you can think of with some simple roleplaying setup.  For example, Ogre bards:  Ogres have an innate sense of rhythm.  Their music is not complicated, but it is powerful.  And because the have no written language, the bards of their culture are the focus of all of their lore, keepers of their tales and their myths...<P>I can just as easily claim that rogues should be very good trackers, at least as good as rangers, and certainly better in an urban setting.  But they don't get that skill in the game because of game balance, because giving tracking to too many classes dilutes the skill.<P>Anyway, my point isn't that rangers would suck at hiding and sneaking.  My point is that they don't get it because rogues are the only ones that do.<P><BR>Raean7 wrote:<P><B>Incoming!  Monty Python reference!<P>"How Not to be seen."<P>*tree explodes, rogue bits fly everywhere*</B><P>Quit that.<P>Alan<BR>
