<h1>AMD and Shadowhaven Crash solved and More info</h1>
	Hello All,<P>We apologize for the problems some of you have experienced getting into EverQuest after the launch of Luclin. As of just a bit ago, we patched a new graphics DLL that fixes the problems some of our users (AMD users in particular) were experinceing crashing to desktop. This does not mean that all crashes to desktop have been fixed, but this code had the potential for a lot of side effects, and fixing it is a big step forward.<P>In the coming week you will see us concentrating on fixing many of the problems that remain. We are also hard at work on optimizations for both framerate and loading time. Load time is a particularly big target for us to work on, and we have some promising results in development. Our goal is to have that code out to you as soon as possible, but it needs to really be tested properly before we will feel comfortable doing that.<P>In addition, we're also working on server side stability in a few zones, most notably Hollowshade Moor. These should be taken care of very rapidly as well.<P>Thanks very much for your patience. <P>The EverQuest Team
