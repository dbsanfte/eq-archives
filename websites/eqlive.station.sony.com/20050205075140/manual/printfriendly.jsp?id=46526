			&quot;Feeling Out&quot; Strangers
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest inhabitants can
  detect hostility from a stranger. This ability, called consideration, lets
  you know (through a text message) how a targeted NPC/player/monster feels
  about you. In general, this helps you assess your target's perception of you.
  It also comes in handy when you're considering whether or not to attack a
  monster or other player. <BR><BR>There are two ways to Consider someone. <BR><BR>* Click on the character or monster. Their name should appear in your
  Targeting Window.<BR>* Type /con and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>Or <BR><BR>* Right-Click the target.<BR><BR>You can Consider any NPC, player or monster in the game. When Considering
  merchants, however, you have to do so from a distance (or type in /consider
  with the merchant targeted) - right-clicking on one while standing too close
  displays his shop goods. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Player characters (on most servers) will always appear to be
  Indifferent. Also, if an NPC does not know you are there (through
  invisibility or other means) it will appear to be indifferent. That does not
  mean that he is actually indifferent, it just means that he can't see you. He
  might like you or hate you, however, once he knows you are there.</EM>
