<P>Details:<BR><BR>-By 9pm, participants will find one of TB's representatives in EC to pay the entry feeand inform us of your Dark Elf's intended name. <BR>-Participants will create a level 1 Dark Elf and equip it with nothing more than what thecharacter is given at creation. If participants wish to turn in their guild note to theirguild leader for their tunic/robe, you may do so. the first 5 skill points may be trained if you wish. Nothing else may be purchased by participants though. <BR>-Participants shall not be twinked at all and shall not be given buffs by anyone not fromTunare's Benevolence prior to the start of the race. <BR>-The race will begin at the PoK book in Nektulous Forest and end in The Arena. The route will be as follows: Nek, EC, N. Ro, Oasis, S. Ro, Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, Lake Rathe, Arena. The finishline will be at the soulbinder at The Arena. The first Dark Elf to hail me at the Arena will be the winner. <BR>-Participants are required to hail certain checkpoints along the way. Use of Druid or Wizard ports, PoK books, and gating ahead will not be allowed. <BR>-Finishers who do not hail the checkpoints will not be eligable for any prizes. <BR>-Participants will be given the opportunity to bind (given by a member of Tunare's Benevolence) in Oggok if they wish. <BR>-Semi-hidden members of Tunare's Benevolence will be available in certain portions of the course to give beneficial buffs to those who wish to find them (clues will be given to their whereabouts). </P>
<P>Upon completion of the race by a majority of the participants, we will ask everyone to bind in the Arena and have a Level 1 Dark Elf fight. The last person (or few people dependin on number of participants) will also receive a prize. The same requirements concerning buffs and outside assistance that apply to the race will apply to the fight. </P>
