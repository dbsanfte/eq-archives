<h1>Mana Cap</h1>
	<BR>Hi all. I just wanted to bring to you a comment from Rich about the way items affect mana and the 'mana cap'. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=1>quote:</FONT> 
<HR>
<FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2>
<P>Hi, 
<P>The mana cap has been a big topic lately, so I'd like to take a minute to address it. Mana caps have been in EverQuest since the game was released. They haven't been changed, made more restrictive, or added at a later date in order to keep casters down. The mana cap as it is now has been there since you created your character, and only recently become a topic of concern for players. 
<P>Most things in EverQuest have a point of diminishing returns - a point where adding more of a resource yields little or no improvement. This is most obvious in your basic stats, where you can easily see that after your strength score hits 255 it does you no good to put on more strength enhancing gear. These kinds of caps aren't intended to cause you distress, and in many ways they can help support a well balanced game system. 
<P>While we have an appreciation for the benefits that stat caps can bring to a system, we're also willing to look at things like this with an objective eye. The mana cap on worn items has been in since release, and hasn't come up before as an issue that players felt overly limited by. With all the attention focused on the cap in recent days, the dev team looked it over and we agree - there's no reason to place an artificial cap on mana enhancing items. 
<P>On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live with the next patch. 
<P>Thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention, 
<P>____________________________<BR>Rich Waters<BR>Lead Designer, EverQuest<BR>Sony Online Entertainment

<P>Thanks Rich.

One additional clarification: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=1>quote:</FONT> 
<HR>
<FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2>
<P>This change just affects + Mana items. We didn't change the way a players mana is calculated from intelligence or wisdom, and we're happy with how that part of the system works.
