		<h2>
			7.3
			Chat Modes
		</h2>
	
	You can send messages using these
  chat modes by prefacing your message with the appropriate / command. For
  example, if you wish to Shout &quot;Hello World!&quot; to everyone in your
  current zone, you simply: <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to open the Chat Bar.<BR>* Type: /shout Hello World!<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. <BR><BR>Here some of the available chat modes. <BR><BR><EM>Say</EM> (Default): Use /say [text]. Sends your message to all nearby
  characters. This is the default chat mode, which means that if you do not specify
  a chat mode the game will assume that you want to use /say. <BR><BR><EM>Shout</EM>: Use /shout [text]. Sends you message to all characters in your
  current zone. Use this if you need to tell everyone trouble is coming, or
  need to locate your party quickly. Don't overuse shout, however - it can be
  annoying to other players. <BR><BR><EM>Tell</EM>: Use /tell [charactername] [text]. Sends your message to a single
  character. No matter how far away you are, that character receives your
  messages. <BR><BR><EM>Group</EM>: Use /gsay [text]. Sends your message to your group. This helps
  keep your group organized and informed, and no one outside of your group
  receives your message. All group members hear you, no matter where they are. <BR><BR><EM>Out of Character</EM>: Use /ooc [text]. For speaking out of the context of
  the game and your character. Use this if you're having a problem or have a
  question that doesn't pertain directly to Norrath. These messages can be seen
  by anyone within your current zone. <BR><BR><EM>Auction</EM>: Use /auc [text]. Sends a buy/sell message out to all players
  in the current zone. Use this if you've got something you want to sell to
  other player characters rather than a merchant, or to try to locate an item
  that you would like to purchase. Remember that auction messages are used for
  selling goods and materials, not for chatting. <BR><BR><EM>Yell</EM>: Use /yell. This sends a plea for help to players within very
  short range. You can't specify any text to send with the yell for help.
  Because this is used in emergencies, you might consider using the shortcut,
  /y. <BR><BR><EM>Guild Chat</EM>: Use /gu [text]. Sends your message to you guild. Only
  members of your guild will be able to see the message. Obviously you must be
  a member of a guild for this chat channel to be available.
