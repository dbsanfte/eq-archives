<h1>Name Change List</h1>
	<B>I thought I'd just add my voice to the others expressing their concern about the recent revealation that the character name changes will not be available to the rest of us. I worry that some of the nasty little people that I've met online will be using this feature to their advantage, sometimes to the extreme disadvantage of the rest of us.<P>Sure, I'm positive that some name changes will be for the better, some people just have bad names that they are better off without, or perhaps their characters have outgrown the frivolous names they put in when they were first starting the game.<P>It's always seemed that your policy was players had to live with the reputations they made in game. Doesn't this seem to create an easy way out of them?<P>Tsumite<BR>Monk of the Void</B><P><BR>There was a bit of miscommunication recently about this.  We do still plan to put up the name change list in the near future.  Its certainly taking longer to implement than wed hoped, and for that I apologize.<P>The integrity of the game is always one of our premiere concerns, and the list of names changed by this service is part of that.<P>Again, Im sorry if we caused a bit of a stir.  And thanks for keeping us on our toes.<P>Alan<BR>
