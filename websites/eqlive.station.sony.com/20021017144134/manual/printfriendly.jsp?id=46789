			Dueling
		</h2>
	
	Even if you're not on a player vs. player server you can still challenge someone to a duel. Once you start a duel, it continues until one player defeats the other, or one player leaves the zone. Only player characters can duel. <BR><BR><I>To start a duel:</I> <BR><BR>* Target the player you want to duel.<BR>* Type /d and press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>. <BR><BR>To accept a duel, your target must follow these same steps. <BR><BR>Dying during a duel is similar to dying in any other manner - see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>. <BR><BR><I>Note: For non-player-killers, participating in a duel doesn't give the winner the right to loot the loser's corpse.</I><BR><BR>
