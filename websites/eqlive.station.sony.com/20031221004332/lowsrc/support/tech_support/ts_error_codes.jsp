	<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Common EverQuest Error Codes</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=center><B>Error Codes at Login<A name=1></A></B></P>
<P><B>Error 1001: </B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"Could not connect to the EverQuest Server! Please try again shortly." </P>
<P>This error will only occur when you are unable to connect to the login server. You may receive this error when the EverQuest servers are brought down for their routine maintenance, and you try to log into EverQuest while they are down. Please remember that any type of firewall may prevent you from logging into EverQuest if you are blocking certain ports. Please visit our Firewall and Proxy Information page for more information regarding the port number for the login server. If you are having continual troubles, and are repeatedly receiving this error even when the EverQuest server are up then you may want to visit our Network/Connection support page for additional connection troubleshooting.</P>
<P><B><BR>Error 0023:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"Our Login Server and registration processes are temporarily congested. Please try again in a few minutes"</P>
<P>This error is the most common on patch or server maintenance days. You will receive this error if you try to log in to EverQuest while the EverQuest servers are down. You may receive this error during the few moments after the servers are brought back up due to the large amount of people trying to log in simultaneously. Please allow a few minutes for the congestion to clear and you should be able to log in to the game as long as the servers are up and fully operational, and you are not suffering from any other connection problems.</P>
<P><B><BR>Error 1014:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"You are not currently subscribed! Either you have not chosen a subscription plan or we could not bill to the account providedDo you want to subscribe NOW or LATER?"</P>
<P>You will receive this error upon logging into EverQuest if:</P>
<P>1. You have cancelled your account and the subscription period has run out. In this case you would want to resubscribe by clicking on the NOW button when the error box pops up. Once you have resubscribed you will be able to log into the game without receiving the same error message again.<BR>2. Your subscription period has ended, and we were unable to bill your credit card for the next subscription period due to some sort of decline of your credit card. At this point you will want to resubscribe as stated. If it will not allow you to resubscribe then you may want to contact your bank or credit card company to ensure there is nothing wrong with the card. If you continue to have difficulties after that point then you will want to contact our Technical Support Department for further assistance. You can reach one of our representatives by phone Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 6:00pm PST, at either (858) 537-0898 or 1-858-537-0898. </P>
<P><B><BR>Error 0016:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"The Station Name or Password were invalid. Please check and try again. Note the password is case-sensitive."</P>
<P>In most cases this error is most often due to the password either being wrong or entered incorrectly. If you have forgotten either your station name or password then you can follow the directions below to recover them.</P>
<P>Station Name:</P>
<P>If you have forgotten your Station name, please visit our Station Name Recovery Page at <A href="https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/retrieve/stationName.jsp">https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/retrieve/stationName.jsp</A>. You will be asked to fill out a form and your Station Name will be displayed. You will need the following information when you fill out the form:</P>
<P>Your E-mail Address (The one you provided during registration)<BR>Your ZIP/Postal Code<BR>Your Birthdate (mm/dd/yy)</P>
<P>Password:</P>
<P>If you have forgotten your password, please visit our Password Reset Page at <A href="https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/retrieve/password.jsp">https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/retrieve/password.jsp</A>. You will be asked to fill out a form and a new randomly generated password will be e-mailed to you, using the e-mail address you provided during registration. You will need the following information when you fill out the form:</P>
<P>Your Station Name<BR>Your ZIP/Postal Code<BR>Your Birthdate (mm/dd/yy)</P>
<P>After you receive your new password, we strongly suggest that you visit <A href="https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/registration/edit.jsp">https://www.station.sony.com/secure/en/registration/edit.jsp</A> (you will have to sign in) and change it to a unique password that only you will know. We also suggest that after you have changed your password, you write down your Station Name and Password for future reference.</P>
<P>If you believe that your account has been compromised then please contact us immediately, so that we can help you in that situation. You can reach one of our representatives by phone Monday through Friday from 8:30am to 5:30pm PST, at either (858) 537-0898 or 1-858-537-0898.</P>

<P align=center><B>Error Codes After Server Select Screen<A name=2></A></B></P>
<P><B>Error 1017:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"Cannot login to the EverQuest server. You may need to re-run the Update Patch. Repeatedly seeing this message indicates a loss of connectivity to the Patch Server. This is usually temporary."</P>
<P>This error can be confusing because it has to do more with connectivity to the world servers rather then the patch server. Included below are ways to troubleshoot this problem based on your connection type, whether you dial up to connect or you use some type of broadband connection (Cable, DSL). Of course, if the tips below do not help then you will want to also refer to our Network/Connection Support page for additional information on connectivity problems.</P>
<P>If you connect to the Internet using a dial-up modem then you will first want to check to see if you have a network card installed on your computer along with the modem. If you do have a network card installed as well as the modem then you will want to disable it. Most often network cards will have a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, which would cause your computer to search itself internally for the EverQuest servers. Since the EverQuest servers are not located on your computer it will never find them, and you will get the 1017 error listed above. If you do not have a network card installed along with the modem then you will want to make sure you have the proper subnet mask. To check this you will want to click on the Start button at your desktop. In the start menu, click on run, and type in 'winipcfg' in the "Open" line. The IP configuration window should pop up and you will be able to check your subnet mask there. If it is set to 255.0.0.0, then you will want to release and renew your IP address until you get a subnet mask that is something other then 255.0.0.0. Ideally you will want to have 255.255.255.0. If you are unable to get a different subnet mask after releasing and renewing then you will need to contact your Internet Service Provider for further assistance.</P>
<P>The same mainly applies to broadband connections as well. Most troubles with the 1017 error come from improper subnet masks. You will want to be careful of multiple network cards in a single machine. Even though one may be set up properly to connect to EverQuest, the other could be defaulting the subnet mask to 255.0.0.0. You will be able to check your subnet mask the same as listed above. </P>
<P>If you are running a firewall or proxy server and are receiving the 1017 error, then please visit our Network/Connection support page to find all the settings to configure your Firewall to be able to connect to EverQuest.</P>
<P><B><BR>Error 1018:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"You currently have an active character on that EverQuest Server, please allow a minute for synchronization and try again."</P>
<P>This error occurs when your character remains active on the server although you may not be connected to the server physically. This can happen if you disconnect in the middle of playing, or you do not camp out of the game properly. Most of the time this error is only temporary, so you will only have to wait a few minutes before you are able to reconnect to the game. If you are receiving this error for an extended period of time then you will need to be in contact with a GM, or Game Master, to have your active character removed from the server. You will usually find a GM in the EverQuest chatroom who can assist you, or can notify someone else who can assist you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><B>Error Codes During Registration<A name=3></A></B></P>
<P><B>Error 0020:</B></P>
<P>This error states:</P>
<P>"You cannot be registered at this time! Please try again later."</P>
<P>This error will occur if you are trying to create a new account with a Scars of Velious expansion account key. Since you can only use a Scars of Velious account key to upgrade an existing account it would be impossible to create a new account with the key. This error may also occur if the registration server is down, but most often happens with Velious account keys.</P>
<P>If you are still having problems after visiting this support section, you can contact our Technical Support Department through <A href="mailto:eqtech@soe.sony.com">email</A>.</P>
