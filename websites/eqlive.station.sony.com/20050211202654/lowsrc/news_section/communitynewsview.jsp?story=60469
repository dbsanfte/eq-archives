	2/07/2005 2:20 pm<br>
	<P>Blood Cult of Xev, like many other raiding guilds have
  lost members and are now recruiting. We have an excellent core membership,
  and have been around for 4 years. We have in the past cleared time to qaurm
  (and would love to drop him (hence this advert), we have also completed the
  Ikk trials. We are looking for dedicated, addicted players who want to have
  fun and still enjoy Eq1.<BR><BR>Our raid times are</P>  <P>05.30 pm GMT - 11 pm GMT</P>  <P>06.30 pm CET - 12 pm CET</P>  <P>09.30 am PST - 03 pm PST</P>  <P>12.30 pm EST - 06 pm EST<BR><BR>We are about to move to a prescheduled 3 day a week mandatory raid scheme
  with head counts on the other days (if insufficient force these days will be
  FFAs) Level 65 is required with ideally a 100 aas (though the aas will be
  looked at on a case by case basis)<BR><BR>We would also welcome a guild merger so if your euro guild is suffering / has
  disbanded, you are capable raiders and you want to join a friendly team
  please get your guild leader to contact Genadorm of Xev. <BR><BR>If you would like to check our reputation or our history please visit <A HREF="www.bloodcult.net">www.bloodcult.net</A> (nice video to view also)<BR><BR>BC's main goal is to keep a family atmosphere whilst raiding high end content
  (currently we aim for time again and uqua), we are proud of our reputation
  and hope you can help us continue to have fun.<BR><BR>Please contact Aitkindrum, Zeksie or Genadorm of Xev with any queries (our
  website has email forwarding if you would prefer).</P><br>
