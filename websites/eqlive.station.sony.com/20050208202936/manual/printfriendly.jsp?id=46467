			Character Creation Screen
		</h2>
	
	This screen lets you build
  your character through a series of steps: <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 1 - Pick a Race</STRONG> <BR><BR>Norrath has 13 known races, each of which was established in a specific
  region of Norrath. All have unique talents and professions - for example,
  Humans are relatively smart and can pursue nearly all professions, while
  Ogres have fewer options, but excel in physical strength. <BR><BR>* Click a race to select it. (Notice that the starting statistics and the
  list of available Classes change for each race.) <BR><BR><STRONG>Races of Norrath</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Barbarian</EM></STRONG>: Warriors at heart, most of the Barbarians' history
  revolves around one war or another. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Halas <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (Shadows of Luclin only), Rogue, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dark Elf</EM></STRONG>: Dark Elves share the heritage and features of other
  elves in Norrath, but they are more evilly aligned. Home is almost always
  underground, so darkness poses no obstacle for Dark Elves. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Neriak <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow
  Knight, Warrior, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans,
  Iksar, Wood Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dwarf</EM></STRONG>: Short but strong, Dwarves outperform Humans in nearly
  all physical tasks. Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded
  by their dexterity. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kaladim <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erudite</EM></STRONG>: Self-pride and intellect persuade most Erudites to
  forego physical activity in favor of mental challenges. Social grace is their
  forti, and they believe themselves to be the pinnacle of evolution. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Erudin or Paineel (determined by class) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard,
  Shadow Knight <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Froglok</EM></STRONG>:
  Frogloks are a short race of sentient amphibians. Although they can swim
  underwater for long distances, they're clumsy on land and can only hop from
  place to place.<BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Gukta/Grobb,
  Antonica<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Cleric, Shaman,
  Paladin, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksars, Ogres, Trolls,
  Dark Elves<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Gnome</EM></STRONG>: Distant cousins to Dwarves, Gnomes tend to burrow in the
  hillsides in underground communities. A lack of surface light lends a pale
  hue to their skin tone, and they rarely emerge to mingle with other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Ak'Anon <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Rogue,
  Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Half Elf</EM></STRONG>: As Human-Elf hybrids, Half Elves share the prominent
  physical features of both races. Their intellect is a notch above most other
  races, though they suffer a lack of strength as compared to the other
  Norrathian races. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport,
  Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Halfling</EM></STRONG>: Short and Human-like, Halflings are by far the most
  nimble and mobile race in the world. Outstanding dexterity and agility come
  naturally, and they're natural travelers. Because of this, Halflings have
  developed peaceful relations with most other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Rivervale <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>High Elf</EM></STRONG>: Though they have physical traits in common with Wood
  Elves, High Elves are far more developed in the ways of the mind. Pale and
  thin, they prefer to spend their time exercising the confines of the mind,
  and not the body. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Felwithe <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Human</EM></STRONG>: Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport  <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: All but Shaman and Beastlord <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Iksar</EM></STRONG>: A tribal race, these lizard-like warriors carry on a
  rich heritage of conquest, enslavement and destruction. Iksar are quite
  intelligent (despite their large size and warrior-like ways) and prefer to
  socialize within their own circles. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: New Sebilis (also known as Cabilis) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight,
  Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial Tensions</EM>: All other races. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ogre</EM></STRONG>: Ogres spend as much time on the battlefield as Erudites
  and High Elves do exploring their intellect. With their gargantuan size and
  strength, they pass most of their days munching on available game and rarely
  give any thought to pursuing other interests. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Oggok <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Troll</EM></STRONG>: Despite a two-foot height difference, Trolls get along
  famously with Ogres, sharing similar likes, dislikes and pastimes. Outdoorsy
  and not quite bright, they're easily recognizable due to their skin's natural
  green tinge. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Grobb <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Vah
  Shir</EM></STRONG>: Vah Shir are a feline race that walks upright. They're as tall
  as Barbarians, and are selfless and focus only on the good of others. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Shar Vahl<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Rogue, Shaman,
  Beastlord, Bard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Indifferent to all
  other races<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wood Elf</EM></STRONG>: Yet another variation on the Elven-Human theme, Wood
  Elves are slightly weaker than Humans, but highly dexterous and agile.
  Despite their tendencies to be wild and secretive, they are very dedicated to
  the good of society. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 2 - Pick a Class</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your class (your characters occupation) describes your career goal in the
  game. You can pursue any life you choose in EverQuest, so long as your race
  permits it. <BR><BR>* Click an occupation to select it. (Note that each occupation gives you
  specific attributes that are marked with green numbers. When allocating
  ability points, concentrate on these characteristics.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bard</EM></STRONG>: The Bard has the unusual ability to play magical songs
  whose supernatural effects last as long as the Bard continues to sing. He has
  some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (self-defense), but his main focus
  is always his art. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Dexterity, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Beastlord (only available with Shadows of Luclin)</EM></STRONG>: Beastlords
  are the spiritual warriors of the primitive cultures of Norrath and Luclin.
  Like the Shaman, the Beastlords have a close relationship with the spirit
  world. The Beastlord's fighting style is derived from tactics used by wild
  beasts thus they prefer to fight unarmed or with only small piercing weapons.
  But the Beastlord is best known for his life-long animal companion. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +5 Agility, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Berserker</EM></STRONG>:
  Berserkers are fearsome fighters, wielding two-handed axes and hurling throwing
  weapons. They have the best throwing arms of all Norrath classes. Their
  innate rage causes them to reach a frenzied battle state known as
  &quot;berserk&quot;.<BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cleric</EM></STRONG>: A Cleric is a holy woman born with the power to heal,
  and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of her deity to smite her foes.
  Prayer is how the Cleric gains her ability. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Druid</EM></STRONG>: A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all
  flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He
  is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to
  call upon Nature for aid and defense. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Enchanter</EM></STRONG>: The primary focus of this art can be summed up by
  the name of the arcane order to which it belongs - enchantment. Spells are
  crafted to enchant people, places and things. An Enchanter can charm beings
  and make them fight for a new master, or magically enhance the capabilities
  of a sword-welding warrior. She even has some proficiency in offensive
  spells. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Intelligence, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Magician</EM></STRONG>: The Magician is the summoner of the arcane arts, and
  can conjure up everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to
  fight on his behalf. While not as offensively adept as a Wizard, a Magician
  still possesses considerable spell power. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Monk</EM></STRONG>: The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure
  weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor. She's very religious as
  well, and the gods are known to bless Monks by magically enhancing their
  attacks. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Necromancer</EM></STRONG>: The Necromancer belongs to the dark brotherhood of
  the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spells, he can animate dead
  bodies and skeletons to do his bidding, as well as cast spells to leach life
  from his victims. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Paladin</EM></STRONG>: A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of
  good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights
  nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to heal
  simply by Laying on Hands. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +5 Wisdom, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ranger</EM></STRONG>: The Ranger is a hybrid mix between a Warrior and a
  Druid, sharing the skills of both. He's most at home in the great outdoors. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rogue</EM></STRONG>: Falling somewhere between an assassin and a thief, the
  Rogue belongs to the secretive class of Norrath. She's quite skilled in
  weaponry, but prefers to make sudden attacks from behind. Shadier skills
  include Pick Lock and Pick Pockets. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shadow Knight</EM></STRONG>: The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight derives
  power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part Necromancer and
  has the innate ability to damage flesh with his Harm Touch. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Intelligence, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shaman</EM></STRONG>: Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch
  doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary
  focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells
  as well. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Warrior</EM></STRONG>: A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its
  forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much
  punishment as he doles out. By nature, Warriors have more health points than
  any other class. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +10 Stamina, +5 Agility <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wizard</EM></STRONG>: The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is
  spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar
  and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her
  a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of
  destruction. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 3 - Allocate Ability Points</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your character has primary and secondary statistics. Primary ones are bright
  green, and represent abilities most beneficial to your chosen occupation. The
  others are secondary, which means they still affect you, but aren't quite as
  important. <BR><BR>The box in the top right corner of the screen shows your bonus ability
  points. The amount differs by race and/or occupation. You can add these
  points to any ability - but you should probably add most of them to your
  green &quot;primary&quot; abilities. <BR><BR>* Click &quot;+&quot; to add a bonus point to an ability.<BR>* Click &quot;-&quot; to remove a bonus point from an ability. (You can't
  decrease any ability below its starting value, however.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Agility</EM></STRONG>: Physical agility; affects your probability of being
  hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Charisma</EM></STRONG>: How various factions react to you; affects prices for
  some merchants. Also affects spell effects for Enchanters and Bards, and
  helps Bards successfully play more notes. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dexterity</EM></STRONG>: Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver
  with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain
  skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects
  some skills and Bard songs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wisdom</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn specific skills. For a
  Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at
  each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Intelligence</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn many skills. For a
  Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard, it also
  affects maximum mana at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Stamina</EM></STRONG>: Health and constitution; affects your maximum number
  of hit points at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Strength</EM></STRONG>: Physical strength; affects how much you can carry,
  how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 4 - Pick a Facial Appearance</STRONG> <BR><BR>To change your character's face, click <STRONG>Set Face</STRONG> just above the picture
  of your character. Click the arrows to cycle through different facial
  appearances. To return to the full view of your character, click <STRONG>Accept</STRONG>.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 5 - Pick a Name</STRONG> <BR><BR>Either type in a name, or click <STRONG>Get Name</STRONG> to let the computer pick a
  name for you. You can't use spaces, dashes or special characters (#, ?,
  etc.). <BR><BR>* Click in the name field and type<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> to proceed <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 6 - Pick a Deity</STRONG> <BR><BR>The Deity Selection screen displays once you click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> from the
  Character Creation screen. Depending on your occupation and race, you can
  either choose from several of 18 specific deities, or remain agnostic (not a
  follower of any one god, perhaps unwilling to acknowledge their power). <BR><BR>* Click a deity to select it. The name of the god appears in the text to the
  right. <BR><BR><STRONG>Here are some generalizations about the followers of each of the available
  gods.</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bertoxxulous</EM></STRONG>: Lovers of decay and disease; dedicated to
  spreading both. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Brell Serilis</EM></STRONG>: Choose to inhabit the underground; generally a
  bit solitary. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe</EM></STRONG>: True believers of fun and mischief;
  doctrine disregards trust and honesty. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cazic-Thule</EM></STRONG>: Followers are ruled by fear; hate, cruelty and
  torture abound. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erolissi Marr</EM></STRONG>: Defend justice and innocence; love always
  overcomes hate. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Innoruuk</EM></STRONG>: Fervid proponents of hate; no loyalty exists between
  followers, and all that is Good is weak. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Karana</EM></STRONG>: Disciples of rain; respectful of the power of weather
  in the woodlands. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Mithaniel Marr</EM></STRONG>: Seek courage, honor and good; leave
  frivolousness to others. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Prexus</EM></STRONG>: Watchguards of the water; doctrine upholds that this
  deity will one day wash away all of Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Quellious</EM></STRONG>: Masters of inner peace and enlightenment; knowing
  one's true self will help bring peace to Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rallos Zek</EM></STRONG>: Warriors to the end; emphasizes survival of the
  strong and the true value of conflict. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rodcet Nife</EM></STRONG>: Selfless servants to the weak and diseased;
  preaches healing and cleansing as one's life work. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Solusek Ro</EM></STRONG>: Devoted followers of all things aflame; aggressive
  and purposeful in all that they do. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Tribunal</EM></STRONG>: Bringers of justice; the world is
  black-and-white, and all wrongs deserve an even revenge. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Tunare</EM></STRONG>: Trustees of Nature; the land Norrath is to be protected
  at all costs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Veeshan</EM></STRONG>: Worshippers and servants of all Dragonkind; doctrine
  calls for sacrifice and dedication. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 7 - Pick a Starting   City</STRONG> <BR><BR>The world of Norrath is populated with many cities, but not all are friendly
  to all races, occupations and beliefs. Race is the primary factor that
  determines your starting city - you'll always be able to start in at least
  one of the cities listed in Race. However, choosing a certain deity or
  occupation may affect your starting city. <BR><BR>You can start from any city with a yellow or white name. (You may be able to
  choose between two or more cities, or you might only have a single option.)
  The currently selected city's name is yellow; cities you cannot start from
  are faded out.<BR><BR>* Click a city to select it (you may or may not have more than one choice)<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> twice to return to the Character Selection screen <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're planning on playing with your friends in a new city, make sure
  everyone has a compatible race, class and deity.</EM>
