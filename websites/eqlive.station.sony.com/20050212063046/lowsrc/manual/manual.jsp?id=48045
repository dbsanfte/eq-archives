			Appendix D - Necromancer Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<EM>Call to Corpse</EM>: (1 skill
  level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability gives the Necromancer the power
  to summon a corpse without the use of components or memorization of a spell.
  The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Dead Mesmerization</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This
  ability gives the Necromancer the power to confuse undead in an area without
  the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. The effect is a low
  resist mesmerization spell that only works against undead. The Refresh Timer
  for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Dire Charm</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
  allows the Necromancer to charm an NPC without fear that the NPC will break
  the charm (charm will end only when the Necromancer leaves the zone or logs
  out) without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. All of
  the usual restriction for charm spells apply to this ability as well, except
  in regards to duration. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one
  day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Fearstorm</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives
  the Necromancer the power to cause fear to all within an area. This ability
  acts like a low resistance area of affect fear spell. The Refresh Timer for
  this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Flesh to Bone</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Necromancer the power to burn the flesh from chunks of meat in
  order to obtain bones from which to summon his undead allies. This ability
  will allow the Necromancer to turn meat items (chunk of meat, gator meat,
  etc) into bone chips without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure
  of mana. The meat item must be held on the cursor when this ability is used.
  The Refresh Timer for this ability is 7 seconds (less than one second of game
  time). <BR><BR><EM>Innate Invisibility to Undead</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) -
  This ability gives the Cleric the power become invisible to undead without
  the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. The Refresh Timer on
  this ability is 7 seconds (less than one second of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Lifeburn</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives
  the Necromancer the power to convert his own life force into power and direct
  that power at his. The ability expends all of the Necromancer's hit points in
  order to cause the target to take the same amount of damage with no chance to
  resist. It also places a life bond effect on the Necromancer that does 250
  points of damage for six 'ticks'. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 144
  minutes (two days of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Mass Group Buff</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Necromancer the power to make his next group buff spell into an
  area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just
  the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as
  twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and
  will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much
  available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game
  time). <BR><BR><EM>Mend Companion</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Necromancer the power to completely heal his own pet. The Refresh
  Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Pet Discipline</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability
  allows the Necromancer to better control his pet. The command &quot;/pet
  hold&quot; will prevent the pet from attacking any foe, even if that foe
  attacks the pet or its master. The pet will remain passive until given
  another command.
