<h2>Game Update, April 23, 2003</h2>
<P>April 23, 2003&nbsp; 3:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P><BR>** Tip of the Day **</P>
<P>When you first log in you will be presented with a Tip of the Day window.&nbsp; We've added this window to provide helpful insight to new players, and perhaps a few tips for experienced players as well.</P>
<P><BR>** Gameplay **</P>
<P>- Any character 10th level and under that attempts to attack a 'red' /con NPC will receive a warning about the danger of such an action.<BR>- Low level characters now memorize and scribe spells much faster.<BR>- Guards in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport should be less likely to run through the newbie zone destroying the wildlife<BR>- Improved the respawn rate for monsters in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport.&nbsp; In these zones they were respawning less frequently than in all other newbie zones.<BR>- Added food and bag merchants to the newbie yards of Steamfont, East Freeport, West Freeport, Butcherblock and Nektulos.</P>
<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
<P>- Fixed a bug that was causing damage shields to assign the credit for their damage to the wrong person.<BR>- Fixed a bug that caused a short delay in the hit point updates from healing spells.<BR>- Removed Beastlords from the list of classes that can use Strength of Stone.&nbsp; They were never intended to get it, as they have a better spell of the same type at the same level (Furious strength).<BR>- Pets will no longer disappear when the pet owner casts a cancel magic type spell on the PC that the pet is attacking.<BR>- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC controlled pets (in non-PvP situations).<BR>- Talisman of Alacrity now works on the group and not just the caster.&nbsp; It also has the proper icons now.<BR>- Modified the text messages on many stun spells to prevent some confusion with their effect on stun immune mobs.&nbsp; The message has been changed from "You have been stunned" to "You are struck by a sudden force."&nbsp; <BR>- Torment of Argli no longer overwrites Torment of Scio.<BR>- The Lich series no longer conflicts with other DoT effects.&nbsp; This affects Dark Pact, Allure of Death, Call of Bones, Lich, Demi Lich, Arch Lich, Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, Ancient: Master of Death and Seduction of Saryrn.<BR>- The Flame Lick line of spells no longer overwrites hit point buffs such as Valor and Skin like diamond.&nbsp; This affects Flame Lick, Immolation, Breath of Ro and Immolation of Ro.<BR>- Changed the name of the druid spell Fury of Ro to Immolation of Ro to avoid confusion with the focus effect Fury of Ro.<BR>- Changed the icon for Kragg's Mending to a heart icon to match other Heal spells.<BR>- Froglok illusion now changes the character's perspective to the proper height.<BR>- Night's Dark Terror has regained its Scarecrow illusion.<BR>- Added sounds to several spells that were lacking them.<BR>- The cost of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half.</P>
<P><BR>** Zones **</P>
<P>- Acrylia Caverns, Hollowshade Moor and Grimling Forest have been revamped.&nbsp; We have updated the content in these zones to more accurately represent their design intentions and to address concerns voiced by players.<BR>- If you have had an issue with your Plane of Earth B keys, please speak with Muzzrap again and he should be able to straighten things out.&nbsp; Please make sure that you have the raid group that you want to get keyed set up and by your side when you do this.<BR>- The Trial of Fire event will be much less likely to damage people not actually in the trial.<BR>- We've made a pretty extensive pathing update to the Lake of Ill Omen and Beholder, along with several fixes to specific cases in several zones.<BR>- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in Plane of Air.<BR>- The spires in the Dreadlands are once again sending folks to Luclin.<BR>- Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again.&nbsp; Beware.</P>
<P><BR>** The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk **</P>
<P>Do not destroy the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk!&nbsp; Due to the revamp of the Acrylia Caverns, this key will no longer serve its original purpose.&nbsp; We do understand the difficulty of obtaining this key, and we don't want to see that effort lost.&nbsp; We will be looking into a way to allow this key to retain its value, so don't destroy it.</P>
<P><BR>** Items **</P>
<P>- Items with recommended levels now display any reduced AC component value in red.<BR>- Changed the usable race to Froglok on several of the Shin initiates armor quest intermediate pieces.<BR>- Giant Field Rat whiskers are about twice as common as they were.<BR>- The Ivory Hilted Cleaver can now be used in the secondary slot (for those that can dual-wield).<BR>- The Ornate Broadsword is no longer listed as usable in the secondary slot, since it is Paladin only and can't actually be used there.<BR>- These items can no longer be worn by Frogloks (they were never intended for use by Frogloks):&nbsp; Fright Forged Helm, Mundane Helm, Mundane Shield, Mundane Mask, Dread Forged Shield and Terror Forged Mask<BR>- Murph's Minin' Pick no longer lists Clerics as a class that can use it, since they could not.<BR>- Bone Bladed Scimitar no longer lists Beastlords as a class that can use it.<BR>- Cracked Bone Shinguards now have a visible graphic when worn.<BR>- Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now "worn" rather than "combat".<BR>- Stone Etched Mace now displays +135 mana instead of 1135 mana<BR>- Extended Affliction III now works on spells with a 30 second duration (lowered from 36 seconds), so it now functions with Sermon of Penitence.<BR>- Fireworks have casting sounds and Gnomish fireworks will no longer cause zones to crash.<BR>- Compasses once again display the direction you are facing when you right-click and hold.<BR>- The Hammer of Exoneration can now be used by Erudites and Dark Elves.</P>
<P><BR>** NPCs **</P>
<P>- Half-Elf bandits are no longer treated as merchants (so they will now leave corpses).<BR>- A Feral Amalgam is now a plant.<BR>- Now only one Natasha Whitewaters can exist at a time.<BR>- Bloodmaw is a little more attentive to his surroundings.<BR>- Pets no longer attack Tylis Newleaf when he teleports your group.<BR>- Corrected a bug with AE rampage that caused it to not attack everyone it should.</P>
<P><BR>** Quests **</P>
<P>- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest.<BR>- The Planar Projections for Bertoxxulous and Terris should no longer be able spawn in a location where they can't be reached.<BR>- Fixed several issues with the 8th cudgel quest.<BR>- Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury.</P>
<P><BR>** Alternate Advancement Abilities **</P>
<P>- Made the Servant of Ro AA pet much more potent.</P>
<P><BR>** Miscellaneous **</P>
<P>- Hit points gained from items are now display with the right value, and should help to prevent a few deaths from Cannibalization<BR>- Bind Wounds no longer uses up a bandage for attempting to use the skill when it is not available.<BR>- Fixed a bug that was not allowing players to link to containers unless they linked to something else first.<BR>- /book with no arguments again closes the spellbook as it should.</P>
<P><BR>Note:&nbsp; We have also made several spelling and grammar corrections and fixed a door here and there.</P>
<P><BR>** UI File Changes **</P>
<P>EQUI.xml<BR>EQUI_TipWnd.xml<BR>EQUI_HelpWnd.xml<BR>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml</P>
