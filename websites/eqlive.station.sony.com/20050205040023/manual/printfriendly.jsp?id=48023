			Appendix D - Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	The Class abilities are only
  available to characters level 59 and above that have spent twelve skill points
  to purchase Archetype Abilities. Obviously a character can only choose Class
  Abilities belonging to their class. <BR><BR>There are two types of Class ability. The first type is similar to the
  Archetype abilities, with three skill levels. The cost for those types of
  skills are always the same. The first skill level of these Class abilities
  cost three skill points. The second skill level costs six skill points. The
  third skill level costs nine skill points. <BR><BR>The second type of Class ability only has one skill level. However, that one
  skill level costs a different number of skill points for each ability. The
  skill point cost for each of these abilities is shown in the ability
  description. <BR><BR>All Class Abilities are passive unless a refresh time is shown.
