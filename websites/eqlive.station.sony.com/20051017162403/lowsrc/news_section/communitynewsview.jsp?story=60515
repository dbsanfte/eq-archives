	<h2>Cold Fury on Quellious Recruiting!</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> &nbsp;<br>
	3/21/2005 6:46 am<br>
	Cold Fury is an &quot;Off-Peak&quot; guild, dedicated to
  raiding in the Australian/Asian timezones.<BR><BR>This guild is about killing big things. It is about skilled and dedicated
  players and killing maximum content with minimum people.&nbsp; <BR><BR>The standard raiding hours of this guild are 7pm AEST till 12am AEST (Or AEDT
  during the appropriate months), however they can extend beyond this at times.
  We raid 7 nights a week. Attendance if you are online is mandatory.<BR><BR>Membership in Cold Fury is viewed as an agreement between the members and the
  leadership of the guild. Cold Fury agrees to provide its members with new
  content and a small roster with high loot distribution. In return for this
  our members agree to be online a minimum of 5 nights a week for an absolute
  minimum of 4 hours per night. Our members agree to abide by the rules of this
  guild. If a member does not meet their side of the bargain, they will be
  removed. We do operate across several time zones, and we try to be
  understanding of time zone differences regarding attendance.<BR><BR>We play hard, we play smart. We dominate the &quot;off peak&quot; times on
  this server. <BR><BR>For more info visit <A HREF="www.coldfuryguild.com">www.coldfuryguild.com</A>  or talk to Biliy ingame.<br>
