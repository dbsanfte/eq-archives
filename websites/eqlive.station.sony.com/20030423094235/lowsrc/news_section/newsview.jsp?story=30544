	<h2>A Reminder About Sullon Zek: Watch Your Language</h2>
	
	With the popularity of our new server, we are encountering a few problems as well.  These problems revolve around the rules for the server.<br>
<br>
For those of you that are unaware of the rules for Sullon Zek, please read them here: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/sullonzek.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/sullonzek.jsp</a><br>
<br>
One portion of those rules that people seem to be misunderstanding is this:<br>
<br>
<i>1.3 Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. <b>HOWEVER:</b> All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any server.</i><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, we have been forced to warn, suspend and banish a relatively high number of players (over 60 suspensions since the server opened) that have chosen to ignore the part of the rule after the bolded word <b>HOWEVER</b>.<br>
<br>
Remember, we will continue to enforce rules about common decency.  We will not allow any sort of swearing or out of character racial slurs.  We will not allow names that violate our <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp">naming policy</a>.<br>
<br>
Yes, we expect players on this server to duke it out for their team.  But we still insist that you treat your fellow players with respect.<br>
<br>
