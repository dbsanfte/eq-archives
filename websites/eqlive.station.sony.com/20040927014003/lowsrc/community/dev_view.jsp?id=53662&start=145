<h1>Update on recast times.</h1>
	Hi everyone, <BR><BR>We've made some changes to spell recasting delay with the patch on January 15th. This change may seem worse than it actually is, so we wanted to be sure it's well explained to avoid unnecessary concern. <BR><BR>When a player casts a spell in EverQuest, their spell gems grey out and become unusable for a period of just over two seconds. After these two seconds have passed, the spell gems ungrey and can be used again. Some specific spells have longer than the minimum 2.25 seconds recasting delay, and they take longer before they are ready to be cast again. However, no spell was legitimately recastable in less than 2.25 seconds. <BR><BR>With the old EverQuest interface, the minimum recast delay was enforced on the game client and it worked well. With the introduction of the new interface though, we've run into issues where your spell gems would ungrey and appear ready sooner than the minimum recast delay. When this happened, players would sometimes get the message "Recast time not met" when they tried to cast a spell, and the spell would fail. This is very annoying for players, and can certainly be dangerous in many situations. <BR><BR>We've applied that 2.25 minimum recast delay directly to the spell data. Most spells already had more than the minimum recast delay, but those that did not have now been changed. In many cases, this makes it appear that a spell that used to have no recast delay now has 2.25 seconds recast delay. In actual use though, nothing has actually changed - in the past, casters always had to wait 2.25 seconds for the spell gems to become ready, and the wait will be the same now, it just appears differently in the spell data. <BR><BR>This change isn't intended to make spell casting slower or more difficult. Now that we've fully transitioned to the new interface it's simply the best way to continue enforcing the same delay that's always been there. <BR><BR>This is the first part of a two-part change that we're making to correct the "Recast time not met" issue. The next step needs to be made in code and should appear on the Test server soon. <BR><BR>
