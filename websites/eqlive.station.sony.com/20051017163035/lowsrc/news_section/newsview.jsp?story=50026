	<h2>Evil Frogloks!</h2>

	The last few weeks have seen a
  number of events unfold across the EverQuest servers, particularly relating
  to Grobb / Gukta, and who will retain ownership of it.<BR><BR>The events played out over a period of roughly five weeks, during which the
  Orcs mounted an attack against the Elves of Faydwer, the Barbarians launched
  an assault against the mobilizing forces of Ykesha, and the Dark Elves called
  on the power of Innoruuk to create an evil curse to deploy amongst the
  Froglok, all of which ultimately resulted in the Fall of Gukta (also referred
  to as the Retake of Grobb).<BR><BR>The deployment of Innoruuk's Curse is of special note, since it caused the
  once unified Armies of Gukta to turn on each other, corrupting their minds,
  and giving them access to types of magic previously unknown to the Guktans.
  Those corrupted by the curse began to turn to Necromancy and other similar
  dark arts. <BR><BR>The manifestation of this curse is portrayed in the ability for players to
  create Froglok Necromancers, Shadowknights, Rogues, and Clerics, all of which
  who follow Innoruuk due to the curse.
