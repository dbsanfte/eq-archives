<h1>Meet Craig Knapp</h1>
	<IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/team_Knapp.jpg" align=left vspace=5 border=0> 
<P><EM>I am sure many of you wonder what goes on behind the scenes here at the EverQuest laboratory, well this week you get to hear the inside story from one of the team, Craig Knapp</EM>.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P>I hate to disappoint my groupies, but a day in the life of the EQ Associate Producer isn't quite as exciting as my last job as a roadie for the Lynyrd Skynyrd band (<EM><STRONG>Brenlo Note</STRONG>: Craig was never a roadie with Skynyrd and only knows who they are thanks to an 8-track tape he once found with their name on it.&nbsp; Incidentally he thought it was a strange video game cartridge</EM>). Some of you may mock me for being out of work since the mid 70's, but everyone has their downtimes.&nbsp; Plus, after I wrote "Free Bird", I thought I'd take some time off and recover.</P>
<P></P>
<P>I find that the working with the EQ team is a lot like touring with a band.&nbsp; You've got the same hooligans, playing the same old pranks.&nbsp; Instead of guitars, drums, and sound systems, these guys work their magic with code, data tables, excel sheets, and 3D modeling programs.&nbsp; I am usually wrangling designers or artists (or more likely our project manager and Senior Producer) and getting them back in front of their monitors to get work done.&nbsp; Then the real fun begins. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The rest of my work day consists of working with many of our other departments (Quality Assurance, Customer Service, Marketing, Finance, Operations, Facilities, Platform, etc.) to help make sure that everyone here (and thus our customers) is being supported properly.&nbsp; The tasks I do can range widely, but the bottom line is, I help to make sure everything runs smoothly and any projects we're working on get launched on schedule with no hitches.&nbsp; I figure when it's time to retire the EQ cap, I'll try to get back with the boys and do one last tour.</P>
<P></P>
<P><EM>Thanks, Craig.&nbsp; Sounds like your days are busy.&nbsp; By the way, is Lynyrd Skynrd still touring?</EM></P>
<P></P>
<P>Brenlo the EQ Roadie</P>
