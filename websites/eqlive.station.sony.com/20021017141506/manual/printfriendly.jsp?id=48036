	<I>Dire Charm</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability allows the Druid to charm an NPC without fear that the NPC will break the charm (charm will end only when the Druid leaves the zone or logs out) without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. All of the usual restriction for charm spells along with a few others apply to this skill, except in regards to duration. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Enhanced Root</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Druid a 50% reduction to the chance that his direct damage spells will break the hold of root spells on his target. <BR><BR><I>Exodus</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability gives the Druid the power to cast the spell Succor instantly and without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure or mana. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Innate Camouflage</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Druid the power to hide when outdoors. This works much like the invisibility spell, but with an unlimited duration. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 1 second (1/20th of a second of game time). <BR><BR><I>Mass Group Buff</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Druid the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR>Quick Direct Damage</I>: (3 skill levels - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Priest Archetype ability <I>Spell Casting Fury) - Each skill level reduces the casting time of direct damage spells. The first skill level reduces the casting time of direct damage spells by 2%, the second skill level makes the reduction 5% and the third makes the reduction 10%. <BR><BR><I>Quick Evacuation</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time for evacuation spells. The first skill level reduces the casting time of evacuation spells by 10%, the second skill level makes the reduction 25% and the third makes the reduction 50%. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery</I>: (1 skill level - cost 8 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Priest Archetype ability Spell Casting Reinforcement) - This ability raises the increased duration granted by Spell Casting Reinforcement to 50%. <BR><BR></I>
