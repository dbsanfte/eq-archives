<TR vAlign=top>
<TD colSpan=2>The <A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/index.jsp">Lost Dungeons of Norrath</A> is our largest expansion to-date, featuring the most content ever delivered in an EverQuest expansion. The Lost Dungeons expansion features 48 new dungeons that span the old world of Norrath, focusing on several long lost locations, including the <A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/dungeons_rurjarkian.jsp">Rujarkian Hills</A> and <A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/dungeons_guk.jsp">Deepest Guk</A>. Encounter never before seen monsters that prowl the halls of these dungeons, waiting to challenge any explorer brave enough to venture in.</TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD>In this expansion, players are introduced to several exciting new concepts in adventuring through the world of EverQuest. After joining the Wayfarers Brotherhood, you and your group undertake perilous new adventures into the recently unearthed Lost Dungeons of Norrath. These new adventures offer many benefits, including a clearly defined goal, the ability to play and make progress in a couple hours per adventure, and the confidence that you can set a time to meet your friends and have a dungeon fully available for you right away - no competition and no waiting!</TD>
<TD rowSpan=3>

<DIV align=center><STRONG>Lost Dungeons at a Glance </STRONG></DIV>
<UL>
<LI>Personalized Adventures tailored to challenge your group.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>48 distinct zones. 19 more than any previous expansion!</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Raid adventures provide exciting new battles for up to 36 players!</LI></UL>

<LI>Customize your equipment with new Augmentations.</LI></UL>

<TR vAlign=top>
<TD>Additionally, one of the most important gameplay improvements we've made in Lost Dungeons of Norrath is the introduction of personalized dungeon adventures for single groups. When you and your group receive an adventure, you're provided with a full dungeon exclusively for your own use. There's no need to worry that you're competing against others to reach the same goal, or that someone might already be camping there. All the focus is on having fun, which allows you to get lost in the adventuring and fighting to accomplish your objective. The challenge is the dungeons themselves - if you can best the Lost Dungeons, you deserve the rewards.</TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD height=171>
<P>Lost Dungeons of Norrath breaks the mold of traditional zones by allowing every zone in the expansion to provide adventures for all groups between levels 20 and 65. Each time you embark on a new adventure, you're sent to one of 48 distinct dungeon zones, each customized with challenging monsters and traps tailored to the level of your group. This means, as long as you're over level 20, you'll have 48 challenging new dungeons to explore and conquer! </P>
<P>Beyond the hundreds of single-group adventures in the Lost Dungeons expansion, you can also join up to 36 of your friends for powerful raid encounters! Take part in several new raids that you can do on your own schedule, with no competition or racing against other guilds. Set up raiding times that are convenient for you and your friends, with the knowledge that the dungeon will be there waiting for you when you log in!</P></TD></TR>
<TR vAlign=top>
<TD colSpan=2>
<P>The Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will redefine EverQuest by providing an enormous amount of adventuring possibilities, with the addition of massive amounts of content to the game - far more than any previous expansion. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
