			Item Flags
		</h2>
	
	When you inspect an item (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags printed right below the name of the item: <BR><BR><B>Magic Item</B>: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures that can only be harmed by magic. <BR><BR><B>Lore</B>: This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <BR><BR><B>NoDrop</B>: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests. <BR><BR><B>No Rent</B>: A no rent item will disappear from your inventory 30 minutes after logging out. <BR><BR><B>Artifact</B>: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power. <BR><BR><B>Item Size</B>: The size of any item will be listed (and for containers it will show what sized items it will hold). This should make organizing your inventory a little easier. <BR><BR><B>A Deity's Name</B>: If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <BR><BR><B>Weight Reduction</B>: If a percentage for weight reduction is listed on a container, that container will reduce the weight of any item placed into it by that percentage while it is in the container.<BR><BR>
