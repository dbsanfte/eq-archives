		<h2>
			12.2
			Weapon Types
		</h2>
	
	You start out with a basic weapon, but as you progress in levels and earn more money, you'll want to upgrade. Even those who specialize in magic usually carry a weapon in case their mana supply becomes depleted. <BR><BR>There are five basic types of weapon, and a skill for using each type. All except for ranged attacks are melee (close combat) attacks. Some weapons are one-handed, meaning that you only need one hand to wield them. If you possess the Dual Wield skill, you can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and use them simultaneously during combat. Two-Handed weapons require both hands and a two-handed combat skill. <BR><BR><I>Blunt</I>: Bashing damage delivered by a dull weapon (bruises your opponent).<BR><I>Slash</I>: Slicing damage delivered by a sharp, edged weapon or a whip (cuts your opponent).<BR><I>Piercing</I>: Stabbing damage from a pointed weapon (pierces your opponent).<BR><I>Ranged</I>: Piercing damage delivered from a distance by a propelled weapon, such as a bow and arrow.<BR><I>Thrown</I>: Projectiles thrown by hand, such as darts and rocks. <BR><BR>With some skills you can deliver manual attacks during combat, such as a Kick or Bash. This adds to whatever weapon damage you dish out.<BR><BR>
