			22.1
			Custom Animation Text
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has default text for all existing animations. For instance, when typing /point, or /point with a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the "point" animation and "CharacterName points at [target]" will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. <BR><BR>You can use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need to specify the "target" after the command as "say" followed by your custom text. For instance, typing "/point say points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" will cause your character to execute the "point" animation and display "CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" to those nearby. <BR><BR>
