			Appendix B - Player Corpse Decay Times
		</h2>
	
	p.20: The bottom half of this
  page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status. The
  corpse timer has been changed since the manual was printed. The player-corpse
  decay times are as follows. Please note that all times are in real time, not
  game time: <BR><BR>If they are under level 10, all corpses decay in 3 minutes. <BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above and have no items on them, they decay in 3
  hours.<BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above with items, they decay in 7 days.<BR><BR><EM>*Note: It is best advised to get your corpse right away. Also note that
  the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</EM>
