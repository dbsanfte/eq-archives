	<h2>When Assassins Strike - Xegony</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Xegony<br>
	05/31/2002<br>
	<P>Notice: Let it be known that Lord Ralzq Q'Enli of the Neriak City Council has placed a bounty of no less than one thousand pieces of platinum on the heads of the following individuals for false accusations and slander: Tarhik, Soulaw, Autolicus, Falkoh,&nbsp; Kenuur, Klaven, and Valaria.&nbsp; Disclaimer - only official assassins of Lord Ralzq are eligible to collect.</P>
<P>Assassins have been dispatched from Neriak to deal with these individuals, and it seems they have lost no time in catching up to their targets.&nbsp; The first two were defeated by the hands of Soulaw and Autolicus with the aid of a small band of adventurers.&nbsp; However before their demise the assassins indicated that this was only the beginning and that they were only the first, that all those who aid them will suffer a similar fate.&nbsp; This seems but the first step in an escalating rivalry within the ranks of the Neriak City Council itself.</P><br>
