	<h2>June and July Game Enhancements</h2>
	
	This week more new game enhancements were introduced into EQ with benefits for players at all levels. Most of the content for this latest update came from ideas generated by you, our community, at June's <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/guildsummit.jsp">Guild Summit </A>as well as the great feedback we got from players at our last Fan Faire, along with the comments from fan sites, blogs and other community forums. 
<P>This is actually the second in a series of content enhancements stemming from the recent Guild Summit; the first patch on June 16, 2004 addressed many issues expressed by the Guild Leaders at that event. So, enjoy the new fixes and enhancements and let us know how we're doing  we're always out there listening. </P>
<P>In case you were not aware of the recent June patch, it contained several enhancements including: improvements to collision; fixes to the Gates of Discord; the addition of the Gunthak Portal; better access to the Plane of Time and the Plane of Hate; updates to Berserkers; many item updates; Guild Help; new features for Raid Management; enhancements for Tradeskills and a host of other features. If you want the details, you can get them all right here: <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/recent_updates.jsp">EQ Live Updates</A></P>
<P>Additionally, if you have any more comments and suggestions for the EQ team, please visit our message boards for EQ gameplay discussions, updates and community posts!</P>
<P><U>July 14, 2004 Update</U>:</P>
<P>The EQ team is continuing to implement game changes driven by the community feedback they recently received at the <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/guildsummit.jsp">Guild Summit</A> as well as at the Fan Faire and <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?no_redir=true">community forums</A>. It is this direct relationship between the development team and the community which distinguishes EverQuest from other games and keeps our game alive and thriving even after 5-years! </P>
<P>This latest update is quite extensive and includes several community-requested features, bug fixes and back-end game changes that will help us continuously improve and enhance the EverQuest experience for players at all levels. So, thanks for all your support and thanks for being a part of our team! Remember, all your comments are welcome, just visit our <A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?no_redir=true">message boards</A> or one of our fan forums.</P>
<P><U>Updates Include:</U></P>
<UL>
<LI>You can now remove augments from items and keep the augment. While you have always been able to remove augments, the augment was always lost as part of the removal process. You can now keep the augment for use in other items.</LI>
<LI>You will now be able to sell LDoN items back to LDoN merchants for a percentage of the adventure points you spent on the item. Previously, when an LDoN item that you bought was no longer useful you were kind of stuck with it. You either sold it to a merchant for a considerable loss or kept it in your bank. That's now a problem of the past!</LI>
<LI>Increased the number of NPC debuff slots. NPCs have a limited number of slots for spell effects to sit in. So, if you have many spellcasters all casting spells, only a limited number would actually take effect. This modification will increase the number of slots that hold effects, allowing more spells to land.</LI>
<LI>Show Mana Number  Allows you to see the actual numeric value of your mana pool.</LI>
<LI>All-new buff timers allow you to see a countdown timer for your buffs so you know exactly when they will expire.</LI>
<LI>Once again pet owners can shrink their pets.</LI>
<LI>Zone with your pet! Zoning would cause your pet classes to lose your pets and ultimately have to create a new one. You will now keep your pets until you die, log out or dismiss them.</LI>
<LI>Veeshan Peak Zone Revamp! New quests and new content equals MORE FUN and NEW THINGS TO DO. </LI></UL>
<P>We hope you enjoy our latest patch. As part of our ongoing plan to provide you with the best possible gameplay experience we wanted to make sure we not only addressed the feedback from the community but thoroughly tested our code updates.
