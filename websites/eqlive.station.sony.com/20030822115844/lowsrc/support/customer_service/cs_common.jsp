<h1>Customer Service</h1>


<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Common Gameplay Questions</STRONG> </DIV>
<P><B>What is the proper use of the /ooc, /auction, and /shout channels?</B><BR>These channels are provided as a courtesy for players to communicate with one another in specific methods. The /shout command is for players to use in-game character speech. This is used for role-playing, asking for help or directions etc. The /ooc channel is specifically for Out-Of-Character speech only. Tech questions, game issues, and other such non-roleplaying questions are commonly used in this channel. The /auction channel is for the buying and selling of goods and services, and can be in character or not. It is important to remember that these channels are a courtesy for players, extended conversation need to go into /tell. Players who continue conversations far and beyond this, are considered to be "spamming, or flooding" these channels and are reminded they are under the same rules and regulations in game as they are when in EverQuest's chat rooms. Players should not have to turn off their /ooc, /shout, or /auction channels because some players cannot follow or respect policy and other players. </P>
<P><B>What if I can't see my corpse?</B><BR>Corpses are sometimes "invisible" after a death. A player may ask a bard or necromancer to verify that indeed their corpse is invisible, (the bard or necromancer can see it, but the player cannot), as sometimes where a player "thinks" they died, is not where they actually are. This is especially common in larger zones like Greater Faydark. Once a player has verified their corpse is indeed invisible to them, usually a quick log out and log in corrects the problem, if it does not, give the Guides a /petition and they will come to assist.</P>
<P><B>How long will my corpse last?</B></P>
<P>Level 1 - 10: 30 minutes real time. This corpse is for convenience resurrection spells only - this corpse is always empty.<BR>Level 11+: 7 days.</P>
<P>*Note: Empty corpses that are level 30 or above characters will remain in game for 3 hours. It is best advised to get your corpse right away. If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game. Also, be advised that your corpse decay is still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account</P>
<P><B>What is "linkdeath" and what happens when a player goes "linkdead"?</B><BR>"Linkdeath" is defined as a player who loses their connection to EverQuest, usually from their ISP going down, or Internet congestion has caused that player to "lag out". When a player goes "linkdead", he or she in essence basically becomes an NPC for all intents and purposes, this gives control over to the server, and the PC will attempt to defend itself like an NPC should a monster attack it or choose to harm it. The "linkdead" character remains in game approximately 30 seconds to a minute and then is logged off automatically by the server or given over to the player should they log before then.</P>
