			2.1
			DirectX 9.0b or Higher Required
		</h2>
	
	<P>EverQuest now requires that clients have DirectX 9.0b or higher installed. </P>
<P>To determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your system: </P>
<P>1. Click on start; </P>
<P>2. Go up to the run box. </P>
<P>3. In the Run window, type DXDIAG then hit ok. This will launch the DirectX diagnostics tool. </P>
<P>Your version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of System Information. DirectX Version 9.0b is listed as "DirectX 9.0b (4.09.0000.0902)" </P>
<P>Please do the following prior to playing EverQuest. It is very important that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to avoid potential problems: </P>
<P>1. Go to <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=141d5f9e-07c1-462a-baef-5eab5c851cf5&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=141d5f9e-07c1-462a-baef-5eab5c851cf5&amp;displaylang=en</A> and install the latest DirectX drivers for your operating system. </P>
<P>2. Go to the website for your video card manufacturer. There are a number of different manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the website for the manufacturer of your card. You can, at your option, go to the chipset manufacturer site. Most will be able to use either <A href="http://www.matrox.com/">www.matrox.com</A> (for Matrox Parhellia cards,) <A href="http://www.nvidia.com/">www.nvidia.com</A> (for TNT/GeForce cards,) and <A href="http://www.ati.com/">www.ati.com</A> (for ATi Radeon cards.)</P>
<P>3. Go to the website for your sound card manufacturer and do the same. If you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can right-click on "My Computer", go to properties, click on "Device Manager", and open "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers". If you use a SBLive sound card, you can run "LiveUpdate" from the Windows Control Panel off of your start menu. View our Sound FAQ: (<A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_audio_trouble.jsp">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_audio_trouble.jsp</A>) for driver locations and more details. </P>
<P>If you experience any issues of this type, please do the following: </P>
<P>1. Run DXDIAG.EXE from your Start menu (click start, run, then type dxdiag.exe) </P>
<P>2. Click the "Save all Information" button at the bottom of the program window. </P>
<P>3. Save the file as dxdiag.txt </P>
<P>Email the dxdiag.txt file you just created along with a complete description of your problem, any text from any error messages that are presented, and a phone number that you can be reached at if you are willing to assist our testing department over the phone to <A href="mailto:eqtech@soe.sony.com">eqtech@soe.sony.com</A>. </P>
<P>Also, if you experience a crash to the desktop while running EverQuest, please email your dbg.txt file from your EverQuest directory to <A href="mailto:EQtech@soe.sony.com">EQtech@soe.sony.com</A>.</P>
