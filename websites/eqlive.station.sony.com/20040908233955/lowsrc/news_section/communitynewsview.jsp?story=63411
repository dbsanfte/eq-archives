	<h2>EQ Samur Forum</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>

	<P>Hello, </P>
<P>Please forward this message to anyone you know that plays EverQuest. </P>
<P>I am pleased to inform you that EQ Samur is now online, and any may join if they please. EQ Samur is a free forum for the discussion of Quests, Strategies, Tutorials, and much more. As EQ Samur is just starting out, we would encourage members to join and post, and have them encourage others to do the same. Being dedicated to the players of EverQuest is something that we are proud of. I believe that within a short time, and the circulation of this letter of notification concerning our opening of this forum, EQ Samur will grow. And with that growing, people will reveal long-kept secrets, well-known facts, and much more, as this forum will become a main-stay for the EQ player looking to gain more out of his/her gameplay, or just for a fast way to level up or make platinum. But always remember that to make this forum flourish, people need to join and post ideas, strategies, tutorials, and open discussions. Three Hundred members and only two posts do no one any good, so that with!<BR>&nbsp; your free use of this forum, we ask that you participate actively. </P>
<P>If you wish to become a moderator for a certain board, you can PM, email, or IM any of the current administrators for more information, and a brief description as to why you wish to become a moderator/administrator.</P>
<P>You may reach the forum at <A href="http://eqsamur.idohost.com">http://eqsamur.idohost.com</A>, or for a direct link, <A href="http://eqsamur.idohost.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi">http://eqsamur.idohost.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi</A> .</P>
<P>With great Thanks, </P>
<P>-Samur</P><br>
