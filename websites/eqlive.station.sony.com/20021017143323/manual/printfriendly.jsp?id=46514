			Talking to Merchants
		</h2>
	
	Merchants usually greet you when you first walk into their store or selling booth, but they don't often like to talk about anything outside of their immediate realm of existence (in other words, don't ask a merchant for directions or favors...). <BR><BR>Before talking to a merchant, you must target him or her. To do so, move the cursor over the merchant and click. To speak to the merchant, press <B><I>h</B></I>. To see what the merchant has for sale, right-click on the merchant. <BR><BR>For more about selling items to merchants, see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=buying">Buying/Selling</A> Items.<BR><BR>
