			Trade Window
		</h2>
	
	To open a Trade Window pick up
  an item and left-click on another player character. The trade window can only
  be opened between player characters, NPCs use the Give Window. <BR><BR>It is important to know that no transaction is final until both players agree
  to it by hitting the Trade button. <BR><BR>The Trade Window consists mostly of two sets of boxes. The left-hand set of
  boxes will be where you will see items that you are trading to gain, along
  with any coins offered. The name of the character you are trading with
  appears above the left-hand set of boxes. The right-hand side will be where
  you place items that you wish to trade out. <BR><BR>You may add or remove items from the Trade Window at any time up until both
  characters have clicked the Trade button. Any time either participant changes
  the contents of the Trade Window, the Trade button pops back up. Any change
  in the items in the Trade Window will require that both parties click Trade
  again before the trade can be completed. <BR><BR><EM>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window
  are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect
  them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal
  as it is.</EM> <BR><BR><EM>Also Note: Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the
  incoming items! If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold,
  extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them
  up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). NPCs and other characters
  might pick up items that fall to the ground, so it is important to make sure
  your items have a place in your inventory after any trade.</EM>
