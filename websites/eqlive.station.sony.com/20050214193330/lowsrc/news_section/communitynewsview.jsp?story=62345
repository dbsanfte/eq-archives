	<h2>Cult of Mischief Recruiting - Tunare</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <A HREF="http://www.mage.ca/"></A><br>
	06/01/2004 4:08 pm<br>
	<P>Cult of Mischief, a small performance oriented guild, is recruiting level
  55+ on Tunare.</P>  <P>We currently have a core group of level 65s and 75 people over level 55.
  We are currently set to begin expanding again, looking to grow to a point
  where we can field a well rounded raid force of 72 during our peak hours
  (after 9PM PST). We plan to expand to somewhere between 100 to 150 people at
  this time.</P>  <P>This not a raiding guild, but is a guild that can and does raid (scheduled
  and unscheduled) Although we generally play together, your time is always
  your own.</P>  <P>We pride ourselves on being able to achieve with tactics, what some guilds
  do with numbers. We feel that when challenges are met and conquered by an
  underdog but cohesive and determined force, the satisfaction is as great as
  any in the game.</P>  <P>This guild is not a democracy, but if you join, and you are patient, I
  promise you will get more out of it than you put in. We have a communal loot
  policy when grouped with guild members, but your time, independence and
  liberty is always respected.</P>  <P>What we can offer you are some lower level flags (we have begun working
  on&nbsp;Gates of Discord&nbsp;trials in addition to Planar Progression). We
  can offer some help with key epic mobs, people your level to group with,
  equipment upgrades and some help with obtaining the expensive spells. As many
  of us are techs, we have solid web site which members visit daily.</P>  <P>I think the most valuable thing we can offer you is a sense of community
  and time and energy devoted to advancing your character. We want to grow, but
  not at anyone?s expense. At the end of the month we want everyone to feel
  they are getting something out of their time in the cult.</P>  <P>All of the mentioned help is given at our discretion, in our own time.
  Only through faith and patience will you inherit the promise. We help those
  most who help themselves. We don?t tolerate any malice, immaturity or drama
  that upsets those within the guild, or reflects badly on the guild name.</P>  <P>If you spend some time with us and move on at some point to bigger goals,
  there will be no harm done. If nothing else, maybe you?ll have made some
  friends along the way. All help is freely given and with no strings attached.</P>  <P>We have members in all time zones but our peak hours are after 9PM PST.</P>  <P>If you have any questions, please contact Mannus or Jasarina in game, or
  visit <A HREF="http://www.mage.ca/">www.mage.ca</A></P>  <P>&nbsp;and introduce
  yourself.</P><br>
