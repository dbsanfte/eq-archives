			Guild Commands
		</h2>
	
	Guild leaders and members can send special ("/") chat commands to others in their guild. Replace items in [brackets] with the indicated information. Valid users are listed in parentheses after the definition. <BR><BR>In order for a guild leader to make an officer, the player must not be in the guild when using /guildinvite o [playername]. If a guild leader wants to promote someone to officer, simply have the player to be promoted target themselves and type /guildremove in order to be ready to be promoted to officer. This will remove them from the guild, which will allow the guild leader to then use the /guildinvite o to make them into an officer. Please be careful in choosing who will be the officers in your guild, as only the guild leader and officers can invite new members into the guild. Only the guild leader can make someone an officer. <BR><BR><B>/guildinvite [name] [rank]</B> - Invite a person to join the guild. If this person is to be an officer, include the argument [O] (as in Oscar) for the rank. Usable by the Guild Leader and Officers, but only the Guild Leader can make officers. You would also use this function to promote a member to an officer. <BR><BR><B>/guildremove [name]</B> - Remove a member from the guild. Only the Guild Leader may remove Officers. You may use this command on yourself to leave the guild. <BR><BR><B>/guilddelete</B> - Disband your entire guild. Only the Guild Leader may use this command. <BR><BR><B>/guildstatus [name]</B> - Will return information on whether the named person is a member, an Officer, or the Guild Leader. <BR><BR><B>/guildleader [name]</B> - Transfer guild leadership to [name].<BR><BR><B>/guildsay [text]</B> - Sends a message to all guild members.<BR><BR><B>/guildwar [name] [duration]</B> - Initiates a guild war against the guild of the Guild Leader which appears in the [name] field. [Duration] sets the duration in real days for the guild war. This defaults to one real day if left blank. The opposing Guild Leader must send the same command with the [name] of the enemy Guild Leader to fully initiate the conflict. <BR><BR><B>/guildpeace [name]</B> - Ends a guild war before the duration has expired. [name] is the name of the opposing Guild Leader. Both sides must send this command to end the war prematurely. <BR><BR>
