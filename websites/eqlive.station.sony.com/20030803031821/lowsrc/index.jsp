	<h3><a href="community/dev_view.jsp?id=57675" class="smalltitle">Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Raid Content</a></h3>
	In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding.  Click through to read more.
 
	<h3><a href="community/dev_view.jsp?id=57545" class="smalltitle">LDoN Pre-Orders are now Re-enabled</a></h3>
	We have corrected the problems with the pre-orders of the Lost Dungeons of Norrath and restored the pre-order functionality.  Those of you that cancelled your order due to the problems this morning can re-order with no further worries.

We apologize for the error and the time it took to fix it.



 
	<h3><a href="community/dev_view.jsp?id=57544" class="smalltitle">Login Server will be down until about 5:15pm on 7-17-03</a></h3>
	The login servers will be down for just a little longer.  This message:

Error 1002:  Incorrect version!!

Indicates that the login server is still down.  We'll have it up as soon as we can.

Thanks for your patience.

 
	<h3><a href="community/dev_view.jsp?id=57543" class="smalltitle">Login Server will be locked from 3:00pm to 4:00pm on 7-17-03</a></h3>
	In order to implement the fix for the LDoN pre-order issues, we'll need to lock the login servers for a while.  This will not kick people out of the game that are already in, but will prevent anyone from logging in during that time.

 
	<h3><a href="community/dev_view.jsp?id=57542" class="smalltitle">LDoN Pre-Orders (7-17-03)</a></h3>
	There is an issue with the pre-orders for LDoN.  Pre-ordering the new expansion is causing people to lose access to previous expansions.  Logging out and then logging back in will fix this problem.  We'll be turning off the pre-ordering temporarily until we get it fixed.  Please click through for more details.
