<h2>Scars of Velious Signing Party</h2>

<P align=left>Fans of the wildly popular online game EverQuest got the chance to meet various game designers, artists, and other EverQuest personalities during a signing event held at the Electronics Boutique at the UTC Westfield shopping center here in San Diego. This special event was held in conjunction with the release of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, the second expansion to the EverQuest game that already has over 300,000 active subscribers. "This is a great opportunity for the players to meet and talk with the various people who created EverQuest," said Cindy Archuleta, Community Relations Manager. "At this point in time, after almost two years, EverQuest is more than just a game. It's a community."</P>
<P align=left>EverQuest is a massively multiplayer online game released in March of 1999. Currently over 72,000 adventurers play simultaneously each night to battle orcs, goblins, and dragons. EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, the first expansion to the popular title, buoyed the game to new heights. With the recent release of the second expansion, EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, players will now be able to explore a new continent and encounter strange new beasts and discover new treasures.</P>
<P align=left>The signing party was scheduled to begin at noon and run until four in the afternoon. At 10:30 AM, when Cindy Archuleta and a other staff members arrived to begin setting up, there were already players waiting, anxious to get free posters, t-shirts, mouse-pads, and pewter action figures. Yet, what the players awaited the most was the chance to get autographs from those who created EverQuest, and those who help maintain it on a daily basis. Those in attendance were not let down. Although this was primarily a local event, players from the Los Angeles area drove down to meet the EverQuest team.</P>
<P align=left>J.D. Markland, who goes by the name of Bumelan on the Solusek Ro server, attended the signing event with the holidays in mind. Not only did he want to meet the EverQuest team, he wanted to share this EverQuest experience with a friend who could not make it to the event. That means J.D. had to get a double of everything--two posters fully autographed, two Velious expansion boxes also autographed, two key chains, and so forth. Of course, his friend had no idea that J.D. would be attending the event and J.D. is looking forward to seeing how excited his friend gets when it comes time to open the EverQuest Christmas presents. </P>
<P align=left>On hand to sign autographs, and to hand out posters, t-shirts, key chains and action figures were game designers, artists, coders, and game masters. Among them were Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Premium Games and one of the original minds behind the creation of EverQuest, and Jeff Butler, Producer of the EQ Live Team and the Velious expansion. Luckily, the rainclouds held off until the event was scheduled to end at 4:00 PM, at which time the very happy crowd of EQ fans dispersed and headed home to enjoy their collection of new EQ goodies.</P>
