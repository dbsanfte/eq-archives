<h1>State of the Game part 3</h1>
	It's called:  <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/eqlive/indev.jsp" TARGET=_blank>State of the Game: The Fabled New Interface</A>.  I thought those of you that don't visit our main site might want to know.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>What of the new Umbral Code and the ability to see cloaks on Luclin players?<P>Tekara Grimmhealer<BR>60th High Thulian Priestess<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</B><P>Well, Umbra is in and working.  It was never supposed to be anything that made a visible change, it just makes it so that the millions of polys in the game get rendered less frequently.<P>Cloaks were an idea we wanted to add, but were always on the list of items to be cut first if they proved too problematic.  We were pretty clear about cloaks not making the cut a while before Shadows of Luclin shipped.  I suspect most people saw the first Firiona Vie model and assumed that because she was wearing a cloak that they were in for sure.  But that model was just a test run, done early in production.  We improved the models significantly after that.  But cloaks were always a feature that we expected to drop.  Implementing them properly would have made the character files a lot bigger than they are now, and that just didn't seem like a good idea.<P>Alan<BR>

I am just curious as to what the "new interface" is, is it still just the non graphical boxes or is going to be like the newer games out or coming out with nice graphics and such? Any info like this would not be spoiling much.</B><P>It's still too early for screen shots.  We have every intention of running it on Test for a bit before it goes Live, so you'll have a chance to try it out.  But it's not yet ready for public consumption.<P>We'll let you decide how it stacks up to other games.  I think you'll be pleased.<P>Alan<BR>
