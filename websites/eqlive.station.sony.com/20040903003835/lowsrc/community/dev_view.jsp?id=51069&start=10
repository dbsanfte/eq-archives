<h1>Player comment about making tough choices</h1>
	Before you read this, I want to point out that I'm posting this because it's a nice positive comment, and it's nice to post those some times.  Yes, I'm trying to make us look good.  That's part of what I do.  But I also think that the analysis of these changes is well done, and shows some of the decisions that we've had to make over the last year or so.<P><B>Alan:<P>I appreciated the comments on the manastone.  Having played with parties that had one I realized how difficult it would be for the designers to accomodate both parties that had a manastone and parties that did not.<P>This led me to comment on a number of very positive changes that represent change in position for Verant.  Each of these changes in position have their own story, but taken together they show a company committed to providing the best possible product for its customers:<P>1.  Manastones--Clerics without manastones sometimes had trouble getting into raid groups.  The ability of a cleric to manastone down and then do a complete heal was clearly and visibly unbalancing.  It also diminished the class-defining Cannibalize and Dark Empathy lines.  Tough call to restrict usage to the Old World...but right call.<P>2.  Donal's Breastplate of Mourning--Mana free complete heals used strategically mean that the players always win all single fights with a main tank plus complete heal cycle...and the clerics are at full mana at the end.  Again notice that clerics without the breastplate were often left out of raid groups.  Tough call to remove the complete heal...right for the game.<P>3.  Soulbinders--This game is designed for interclass dependence.  You assemble the parts to make a stronger whole than you can make with just parts.  But late at night and particularly for overseas players, bind affinity wasn't always easy to come by.  Compromise?  Soulbinders are not always in the most convenient locations, but they give you a bind when you need one.  Excellent choice.<P>4.  Rangers and defense--Rangers by design are offensive melees with spells.  They are based off of a chain-armor class 'template' that they share with Rogues and Shaman. The chain disadvantage first becomes apparent around 39th level when the Ranger's Defense skill starts falling behind Warrior's.  Rangers were finding themselves unable to be 'light tanks' and actually take damage the way they were used to.  First Verant implemented Jolt to mimic Rogue evade and permit the Ranger with personal aggro control.  <P>Then after letting that change sink in they came back and added defense to the Rangers.  Result is a class that is VERY powerful in melee but can still take an appropriate licking (and continue ticking).  Kudoes for the principle to implement the vision of the design and for tweaking it where appropriate.<P>5.  Removing teleport restrictions for Emerald Jungle, Skyfire, Great Divide, Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar--When the Kunark and Velious expansions came out, the designers decided there would be three ways to get to Kunark (Firiona Vie, The Overthere, and the Combines/Dreadlands portals).  You had to port from inside a Kunark dungeon to use Emerald Jungle or Skyshrine evacs.  Similarly when Velious came out you could either take the boat to Iceclad or get a port to the Iceclad Portal--you had to get a tooth to go to the other portals.  These restrictions were sensible storytelling limitations that controlled how players progressively saw Kunark and then Velious.<P>When Shadows of Luclin came out, Verant properly felt that the world was 'big enough' and removed the Kunark Dungeon and Velious 'Tooth' limitations.  Tough choice, good for the game...allows the teleporting classes to get near fellow guild members and friends so they can be moved to a spire so they CAN spire up to Luclin.<P>Each of these decisions took time to make.  Some of them were accompanied by cries of "Nerf".  Others were generally well accepted by the playing community.  But each of them demonstrates the character of the company to do the right thing for the game and for the players.  Congratulations on making tough choices and sticking to your guns.<P>Please continue to give us the big picture perspective as you make these kind of tough decisions.  It helps us players see that what seems right or fun for an individual player may be very harmful when the whole game is considered.<P>Saeul</B><P><BR>Thanks Saeul.  If I didn't know better I'd think you worked here.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>We really are trying to look out for the game as a whole, and sometimes that means making decisions that don't always please the majority of our customers in the short term.  We can only do what we think is best and adapt where needed.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>On the whole I agree with the gentleman. But, I disagree about the Velious dragon ring portal teeth requirement. I feel that my effort to get to CS the hard was was wiped out. Getting to CS from EW was hard but could be done by level 30 with the help of friends (which is what the game is about). Now, the story line has been violated. Sorry, I don't like the change and do not agree that the change was good in any way.<P>-- <BR>Dale James Thompson<BR>Yyidth of the Rathe (level 52 wizard)</B><P>I understand how you feel.  Often this is one of the concerns that we have to take into consideration when we make a change like that.  This came up when we were working on removing the hybrid experience penalty.  We knew that there were plenty of folks that had labored their way up through the levels under that penalty.  Removing that barrier would certainly make the journey easier for those that followed them, and it might have made folks upset that we were changing the rules after they'd made their way up the ladder.<P>In the long run it is better for the game that these things were changed.  Running the risk of disappointing some customers to make the game better might be the hardest thing we have to do here.<P>Alan<BR>
