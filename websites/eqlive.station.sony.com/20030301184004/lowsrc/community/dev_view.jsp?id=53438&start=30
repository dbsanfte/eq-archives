<h1>Playing more than one account using the same IP.</h1>
	<B>While I am excited to hear about the New UI changes that are coming and the ability to run in a windowed mode, I am hearing rumors of preventing multiple accounts coming from the same IP address. You cannot allow this. There are many areas in the US where the only way to have several machines sharing an internet connection is via a NAT router (As I have). This would make it appear to the outside world that all requests are coming from one machine. <BR><BR>I Personally multi-box 3 accounts (Yes I do have 3 seperate computers), if the new UI changes make it impossible for me to do this I will be leaving this game as I am sure SEVERAL other people will. Please Reply to this message either directly or via a post on Everquestlive.com. <BR><BR>Thank you <BR>Mike Heck</B><BR><BR><BR>Hi Mike. <BR><BR>We didn't make any code changes to the game with the last patch. Right now I'm not aware of any changes that would have caused any problems with multiple accounts on the same IP (though we are aware that a few people are having this problem, and we're looking into it). We don't plan to actively prevent folks from logging on with two accounts on the same IP. This wouldn't be a good thing for those with multiple computers in their homes and others that share a single connection (not that anyone plays at work...). <BR><BR>I don't know what router you are using, or exactly what the problem might be. There have been issues in the past with routers that an upgrade of the firmware has been able to fix, though, and you may want to see if there is an update available. If that doesn't work, you might post your information to our Tech Help forums and see if someone there can help. <BR><BR>Alan
