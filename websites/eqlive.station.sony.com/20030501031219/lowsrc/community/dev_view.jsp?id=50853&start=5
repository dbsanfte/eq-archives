<h1>Server population numbers</h1>
	As many of you have noticed, soon we will be removing the population numbers from the server selection screen, as well as our web site and our fan sites.  We will also be disabling the ability to use /w all in the game (which has the side benefit of reducing the load on our servers a little bit).<P>Myricah wrote:<P><B>Please leave the server select screen the way it is, with player counts and everything. I don't see how showing the numbers of players on a given server is harmful, and the count can be very useful and/or interesting. For example, when I am looking for a server to mess around on, I go to a server with under 1500 people. And, I still enjoy seeing how many people play on Sullon.<P>This is a feature that has been in place since I started playing EQ at least, Christmas 99, and I hope it stays that way.</B><P>Let me respond with a quote from our COO.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>"Due to the increasing amount of competition in the online gaming space we feel that it's not in our best interests as a company to provide our existing and future competitors with valuable information on our userbase. We have always had a very open stance on the issue of what our numbers are specifically, but as we grow in other markets around the world this information is simply not something our competition needs to know."<P>- John Smedley<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We do plan to set it up so that this impacts our customers as little as possible.<P><BR>Araxas wrote:<P><B>I read the recent announcement that viewing the number of players online on the various servers may in the near-future be removed. It seems to be the case on the server status page of this website already, though I assume this will apply to the server selection screen soon as well.<P>While I understand this from the perspective as Sony Online and Verant as a business, it does create a few potential problems. New players to the game are usually recommended to find a less populated server to start on. Not only is this in the newbie's best interested, but its in your own interest since the server counts are the player-driven load-balancing mechanism.<P>The other problem I see is for those players who play outside the United States in different time zones. Being able to see which servers are populated at the times they are able to play allows them to find a home which is active during their timezone (not all servers are).<P>While the decision is inevitable with the games the competition is offering coming out, will there be any system for alleviating the problems I mentioned? Even something as simple as being able to rank the servers in the login screen by population despite the actual number not being visible?</B><P>You will still be able to sort servers by population, so you will still be able to determine which servers are the least (or most) populated.  This should keep the functionality on par with the old system, just without the exact numbers.<P>As you noted, we are still a business, and we need to take care of the business stuff with just as much energy as we take care of the game stuff.<P>Alan<BR>

If it does indeed mean that, that would be a huge inconvenience to your player base.</B><P>I'm sorry, I wasn't very clear about that.<P>The only /w all functions that we intend to remove are the ones that give population counts.  Specifically, /w count functions will be removed.  Others may be modified slightly, I'm not certain yet as to which ones or how.  For example you might see a change in /who all &lt;class&gt;.<P>But /who all GUILD will continue to work as it does now, as will most restricted versions of /who all (such as friend).<P>We haven't examined all of the functionality to determine exactly what needs to be changed, so I can't tell you specifically what will happen.<P>Alan<BR>
