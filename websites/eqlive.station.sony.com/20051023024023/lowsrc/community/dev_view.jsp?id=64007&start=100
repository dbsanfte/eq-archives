<h1>EverQuest Producer's Letter</h1>
	What a year EverQuest has had.&nbsp; 2004 brought many changes to
  EverQuest.&nbsp;&nbsp; New content, new
  features, 2 new expansions, hundreds of community requested features, the
  first Community Summit, a Fan Faire in New Orleans and Las Vegas as well as
  thousands and thousands of hours of enjoyment for hundreds of thousands of EQ
  fans.&nbsp; A new Graphics Engine was
  launched allowing our artists to use new tools when building zones and
  NPCs.&nbsp; Zones were revamped to add
  some new life to older areas, new Adventure zones were added to keep small
  group gameplay fresh. We are quite proud of all that we accomplished but we
  are not sitting back and resting.<BR><BR>EverQuest in 2005 will continue to expand with more of what you have come to
  expect and appreciate from the game we all enjoy.&nbsp; While EverQuest will soon be 6 years
  young, it is aging well and still setting standards in the industry.&nbsp; A new expansion, EverQuest&reg;:
  Dragons of Norrath&#8482;, has been announced which opens an area that has
  long been on the maps of Norrath but not yet available.&nbsp; We are adding new tradeskill recipes,
  new features that ease communication and gameplay.&nbsp; You will see the continued addition of
  new NPCs and Zones modeled to make use of our New Graphics Engine and will
  bring a new quality standard to EQ art.&nbsp;
  In the coming weeks you will see more of the improvements as
  screenshots and movies are released for the upcoming EverQuest: Dragons of
  Norrath launch.<BR><BR>We have announced that we are re-envisioning classes in EverQuest, which in
  itself is a huge undertaking.&nbsp; We
  are looking at each class and what roles they fill in groups, followed by
  raids.&nbsp; Our goal is to make
  certain that each class has a desirable role to play when grouped and while
  raiding.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have a
  series of developer chats to discuss our plans and our findings as we gather
  and collate all the additional data the servers are currently mining and we
  will share any conclusions we come to at the appropriate times.&nbsp; There will be ongoing discussion
  threads on the EQ forums (Eqforums.station.sony.com) and we encourage you to
  take part in them.<BR><BR>We are aware that with the recent release of new MMO's that some of our fans
  have moved on and we wish them the best of luck.&nbsp; We have noted that this has had an
  impact on some server populations, most noticeably our PVP servers.&nbsp; The PvP community has asked that we
  further explore the idea of server mergers and to that end, we&#8217;ve put a
  poll for PvP players asking if servers were to be merged, which rule set they
  would most like to play under.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  More details for you on that soon.&nbsp; Although we are satisfied with the
  current population of most other servers, we will take a look at each after
  the release of EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and identify whether any
  additional mergers will be needed.<BR><BR>We do have another Fan Faire planned for June in Las Vegas and again hope to
  meet many of you there.&nbsp; We enjoy
  meeting you in person and sharing our mutual passion for this world of
  Norrath.&nbsp; We also have begun
  planning for two community summits this year, one in conjunction with the
  June Fan Faire and one tentatively planned for the fall.&nbsp; We are quite proud of what was
  accomplished in our first summit and our goal is continue the feedback
  process with the community leaders.&nbsp;
  We plan to have representatives for raiding players, non-raiding
  players and each class in attendance.&nbsp;
  This will provide a solid cross section of the EQ community to share
  ideas and discuss concerns with.<BR><BR>Of course this is only what comes to mind now, we have other projects in the
  works and will continue to expand this little world we share.&nbsp; We want Norrath to be a living vibrant
  world for years to come and with the team we have here, partnered with your
  passion and feedback, we are sure we can accomplish that goal.<BR><BR>Thanks for playing! <BR><BR>Robert Pfister<BR>Executive Producer EverQuest
