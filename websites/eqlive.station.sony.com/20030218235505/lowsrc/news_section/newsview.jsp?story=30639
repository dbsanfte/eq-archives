	<h2>Customer Service Changes to Policies and Procedures</h2>
	
	As was announced recently, we at SOE have spent the last few weeks performing a thorough review of our Customer Service policies and procedures. The modifications we have made as a result of this review process are geared to educate our customers about our policies and procedures and to give our GMs more latitude in assisting our customers. We wish to provide more for our customers, and we are confident that the changes that have been made so far will perform this task.<br>
<br>
We have made changes to the following polices, posted at:<ul><li><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp">Character Naming Policy</a><li><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/reimbursement_policy.jsp">Reimbursement Policy</a></UL>For an overview of the changes made, please refer to the following:<ul><li><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming_changes.jsp">Overview of changes made to the Character Naming Policy</a><li><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/reimbursement_policy_changes.jsp">Overview of changes made to the Reimbursement Policy</a></UL>We would like to thank every customer that submitted feedback, as it was quite helpful to us in this review.
