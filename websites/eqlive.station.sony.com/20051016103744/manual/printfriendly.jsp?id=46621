		<h2>
			12.5
			Developing Weapon Skills
		</h2>
	
	Several things affect whether
  you get weapon-based combat skills, and whether you can accumulate more
  later. <BR><BR><EM>Class</EM>: Depending on what class you choose, you may already possess one
  or more weapon skills. Most classes with warrior abilities (Warrior, Paladin,
  Ranger and so forth) give you one or more from the very start. <BR><BR><EM>Experience</EM>: You usually gain additional fighting skills as you
  progress through experience levels. <BR><BR><EM>Practice</EM>: You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve
  your weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game
  with practice points available (and you gain five of these with each level).
  Later, you may have to pay cash along with practice points for tutoring
  sessions (right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill
  you want to practice). Some skills can only be practiced if you've reached a
  certain experience level.
