<h1>New Interface Suggestions</h1>
	<FONT size=2><FONT size=3>We recently added some functionality for the interface that folks might not be aware of.</FONT> </FONT>
<P>If the interface can't find a file it needs in your custom interface folders, it will look for them in your default folder. 
<P>This is a wonderfully useful feature. It means that we can change files that you haven't modified and your custom interface will still be able to use them. It also generally reduces the space your interface uses on your hard drive. But there's a step that some folks need to take in order to take full advantage of this feature. 
<P>Remember, the key here is that if the interface can't find a file in the custom folder, it will look for it in the default folder. But if it <I>can</I> find the file, even if it's an old version of the file, it will try to use it. We do this because the newest file might not be the file you want to use (the older file might be a customized one). This could cause trouble, however, if we update a file in the default folder that also exists in your custom folder. In a case like that, you'll continue to use the old file - and that might cause your game to crash. 
<P>So here's what we suggest. 
<P><B>If you are using a customized interface, make sure that only the files you have modified are in the folder for that skin. Delete all other files.</B> That way the game can use new versions of files that you have not modified out of the default folder. This should help you avoid many of the issues that come up when we update the UI files. 
<P>We also wanted to let you know that we understand how updates to the interface can frustrate those of you that have customized it. We will endeavor to make it clear what files we've changed for the interface in our patch messages in the future. 
<P>For example, this morning a few files changed in for the interface, making it so that some people (and in some cases a specific character) could not log in. The files we changed were: 
<P>- EQUI.xml<BR>- EQUI_Animations.xml <BR>- EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<BR>- EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml <BR>- EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <BR>- window_pieces04.tga 
<P>If you have those files in your custom UI folder and you haven't edited them yourself, deleting them from that folder should fix things. 
<P><BR>There is a file created whenever the interface encounters a problem. It's called UIErrors.txt. If you suspect that you are having problems related to the interface, it's a good idea to check this file to see what is going on. 
<P><BR>We wanted to make sure everyone knows how to revert back to the old interface or to the default new user interface rather easily in order to get into the game. You might need to do this if you are having issues with a custom interface. 
<P>Each character stores the information about where it should look for the new interface files. Some characters might be using the default interface, some might be using a customized interface. This could lead to a situation where you can log in with one character but not another. 
<P>In this situation you can easily have a specific character go back to using the default interface. 
<P>Look in your EverQuest directory for an .ini file with the name of the character in it. It will look something like this: 
<P>UI_Absor_99.ini 
<P>Just edit that file (right-click and choose Open should work) and find the [Main] section and change: 
<P>UISkin=customfoldername 
<P>To 
<P>UISkin=Default 
<P>Close and save the file. Then when you log in that character will use the default interface. 
<P><BR>Though there should rarely be a time when you need to do this, there is a line in your EQClient.ini file that will allow you to turn off the new interface for all of your characters. You can find the eqclient.ini file in your EverQuest directory. Just open it up and change this line in the [Defaults] section: 
<P>NewUI=TRUE 
<P>To read 
<P>NewUI=FALSE 
<P><BR>All of this is the price we pay for customization. We will still need to update the interface at times, and that will often make for more work for those with customized interfaces. We will do our best to make those changes as painless as we can. 
<P>Thanks for playing EverQuest. 
<P>Alan</P>
