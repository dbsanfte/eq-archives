<h2>Patch Message, Feb 4, 2002</h2>
<P>** ANNOUNCEMENT **</P>
<P>The response to The Legacy of Ykesha(tm) extension has been overwhelming; we want to thank all of you who have pre-ordered.</P>
<P>In order to better serve ALL of our customers, including those who do not have a credit card, we've decided to make a relatively small number of The Legacy of Ykesha CD-ROMs available at retail as well.&nbsp; Please note, though, that The Legacy of Ykesha CD will likely not be available at retail in the US until as much as a week or more after the "live" date; the delay may be longer for our international customers.</P>
<P>If you have already pre-ordered from us, but you would prefer to wait for the retail CD, you can cancel your pre-order by following these instructions:</P>
<P>1. Go to the Station Store (<A href="https://store.station.sony.com/">https://store.station.sony.com/</A>)<BR>2. Go to Billing Info and sign in.<BR>3. View Current pre-orders.<BR>4. Click Cancel button; you will receive a cancellation email.</P>
<P>You may still pre-order the digital download version of The Legacy of Ykesha from the Station.com Store (the download version only - we will not be selling CDs through pre-order) for the special pre-order price of $17.99.</P>
<P><BR>February 4, 2003&nbsp; 3:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P>Note:&nbsp; Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to work properly.&nbsp; In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file.&nbsp; You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game.</P>
<P>ALSO NOTE:&nbsp; We have changed a lot of UI Files.&nbsp; Here's the list:</P>
<P>** UI File Changes **</P>
<P>EQUI.xml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>EQUI_Animations.xml&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml<BR>EQUI_FacePick.xml<BR>EQUI_NoteWindow.xml<BR>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <BR>window_pieces04.tga&nbsp;<BR>EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE<BR>EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE<BR>EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE<BR>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml&nbsp;- NEW FILE </P>

<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
