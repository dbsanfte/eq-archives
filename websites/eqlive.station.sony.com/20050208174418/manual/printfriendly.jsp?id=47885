			Appendix D - Unlocking Archetype and Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Unlocking Archetypes and
  Class Abilities:</STRONG> <BR><BR>There are three types of Alternate Abilities: General, Archetype and Class
  Abilities. Each is a stepping stone for the next. Attaining a certain number
  of General abilities is required before you can learn any abilities from your
  Archetype. Similarly, you will have to attain a prerequisite number of
  abilities from your Archetype to start gaining abilities from your Class
  group. There are also level requirements for each of these levels. Keep in
  mind that you can't gain any of these abilities unless you own Shadows of
  Luclin. <BR><BR>These requirements are in addition to any prerequisites needed for some
  abilities. <BR><BR><EM>General abilities</EM>: A character must be level 51 or higher to open up
  the General abilities. <BR><BR><EM>Archetype abilities</EM>: A character must have spent six skill points on
  General abilities and be 55th level or higher to open up the Archetype abilities.
  <BR><BR><EM>Class abilities</EM>: A character must have spent twelve skill points on
  Archetype abilities and be 59th level or higher to open up the Class
  abilities.
