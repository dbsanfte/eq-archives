	The Background option allows
  you to easily customize the background of the window you are working with.
  There are two options that you can change in regarding the background. <BR><BR><EM>Texture</EM>: This option toggles on and off the background texture of the
  window.<BR><EM>Tinting</EM>: This option allows you to tint the background of the window.
  In a window with no texture, the tinting color becomes the background color
  for that window. You can either choose one of the preset color options or set
  the red, blue and green color values using the sliders or the text boxes. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Choosing white as a tint color is the same as having no tinting
  selected. So if you want to return the texture to its untinted color, choose
  to tint it white.</EM>
