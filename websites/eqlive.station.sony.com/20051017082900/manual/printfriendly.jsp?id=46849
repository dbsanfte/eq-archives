	<STRONG><EM>F1-F6</EM></STRONG> will
  target group members 1-6 respectively. <BR><BR><EM>Communication</EM>: Keeping in touch with group members is crucial. Before
  combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle. <BR><BR><EM>Group Leader</EM>: Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect
  someone to make decisions about important party matters. <BR><BR><EM>Group Health</EM>: The names of fellow group members appear in the group member
  window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health
  status. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Spells</EM>: Some spells affect all members of a group. If
  you've got a spell caster in your group, it might be a good idea to pitch in
  and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Experience</EM>: Experience points are split between group
  members according to experience level - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=experiencegroup">Group
  Experience</A>. <BR><BR><EM>Splitting Loot</EM>: To split coin treasure evenly, enable autosplit under <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iogeneral">Options / General</A>.
  Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis.
