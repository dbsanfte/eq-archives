<h1>What makes a zone interesting?</h1>
	Once again I asked my esteemed colleagues what questions they would like to ask of all of you.  Now most of us were all questioned out after the Fan Faire, but that didn't stop us.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>I'd like to know this:<P>	If loot was not a factor, what do the players find interesting about zones? What would they like to see?<P>Dave Nevala<BR>Artist<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Awesome question.<P>So what sort of things do you find interesting about the zones that you like.  We're not talking about the Phat Lewtz here, we're talking about other things.  For example, I love the neon and sort of smutty feel of Neriak.  It conveys a sense of the people that live there very well.  And I hear endless raves about the bar fights that them silly dwarves have.<P>It could be about the kinds of battles that take place in certain zones.  It could be about the geometry of the area... whatever strikes your fancy.<P>Just use the Submit Comments button and let us know what you think.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<P>

<hr>

<BR>We've received so many comments on this topic that I'm not going to even try to respond to all the ones that I'm going to post here.  I'll just start it off with a thank you for the responses and end with in a comment.  You're all tired of hearing me chatter by now anyway...    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><B>Well...my favorite zone in the game (so far) is the Crypt of Dalnir. I've only been so far into it, but the theme is coherent. The zone itself tells a story. I love the hyper-intelligent slimes who are controlling the other races in the zone. The mobs are, for the most part, pretty much stuff you can see in a zillion other zones, but they are tied together in a way that is easy to read as you travel and fight in the zone, even if you haven't heard the story from some elf halfway across the world. I really like that. I'm also fascinated by Najena, and would like to know more about her and the fallen temple she inhabits. I'd also like to see more about the Moltor family, whose crypt is Unrest. Paineel is my favorite city. It's beautiful. It has a look that very much matches its inhabitants. It has little things that make it interesting (like the skeletal musicians in the bar). <P>Ghuz Spineshank of the Mystic Alliance<BR>25 Warrior on Rodcet Nife<BR>Rob</B><P>***<P>RaanVenturis wrote:<P><B>Two of my favorite zones in the game are Lower Guk and Sebilis (even though I have not yet seen all of sebilis as I am not yet high enuf -only 53).  So, when thinking about what I like about zones, I have to consider what I like about those zones.<P>First, those zones REQUIRE a well organized and varied group in order to survive.  You have to have your healer, your buffer, your snarer, your tanks, corwd control, etc.  <P>Second, there are only two REQUIRED classes for those zones (cle and enc).  All other members of a successful can be varied.<P>Third, even with a well balanced and organized group, you are not guanteed success.  Both zones still requires playing well together and everyone doing their job to succeed.  That makes it a continuous challenge.<P>Fourth, both zones DON'T require more than a full group to be successful (except the lowest reaches of sebilis).  <P>Fifth, there are enough "room areas" that multiple people can play successfully in the zone.<P>Sixth nice and varied graphics with a common "theme".<P>To sum it all up, the thing that makes a zone great is a that it is a challenge for a full group, has decent loot, does not take so many people to be successful that there is more time spent organizing than fighting, and requires a balanced, varied, and organized group to be successful.</B><P>***<P>Nimbul wrote:<P><B>I think my favorite zone so far, Tower of Frozen Shadows.<P>Crowding: hardly any. Most of the time it's a group to a floor<P>Location: not hard to get to, right near a port. See crowding, zone in, if it's crowded, leave. It's great.<P>Keys: well done! Adds just enough risk to keep lazy players out, but they don't become a hassle. We worked to get a complete backup set, and carefully chose who in the group got keys. (though the spawn rate of the angry librarian needs to be looked at in my opinion, that key is WAY too hard to get compared to the others).<P>Phat L3wt: not so much as to draw farmers. Enough to make it exciting when you find something.<P>Loot: cash is decent as are weapon drops (for cash)<P>Difficulty: just right. If you're smart, risk is minimal. Few roamers for adds means you can do this without the "required" enchanter. You can also do it without a full group.<P>Trainless: (is that a word?) the keyed levels eliminate trains. You can only zone out, or to the next (harder) level (and supposedly mobs follow), so there's no place to train to and kill others, or worst, have others train onto you.<P>Variety: each new level has a new look/feel, yet still stays within the theme.<P>I'd love to see more zones like this.</B><P>***<P>OccamsRazor wrote:<P><B>I like the little mini-dungeons in the Kunark  zones, such as, the small spider cave in Field of Bone, the goblin tunnels in Lake of Ill Omen, the Burynai mines in Frontier Mountains, the Yeti caves in Dreadlands, etc. These aren't full dungeons, but they're more than just tents with a few monsters standing around  a campfire. I was impressed and delighted when I found them, and it made me feel rewarded for exploration for the first time in a long time in EQ.</B><P>***<P><B>For me what makes a zone is the ability to move around as you fight.  Most zones are overcrowded all the time so you can't do this but certain zones are empty enough that once in a while you can take a group of six and adventure through a zone, instead of killing the same respawning mobs over and over.   Sebilis is a great designed zone because it has several part of it that are like independent dungeons.  For example you can go to the grup, pick area and most of the time be by yourself with one full group.  That part of the zone is big enough so you can move around a bit rather then just pulling non stop.  The crypt, and bar/chef area is the same way.  For me sebilis marked the evolution of the games dungeons because of this.  <P>Nurok</B><P><BR>***<P><B>Hrm, the Subject thingie is broken again it seems.<P>Well, Hi there.<P>I wanna comment on this by an example. My favourite zone when it comes to design is Blackburrow (nope, not because I like trains, not really). I like it because it's completely asymmetric, no straight lines anywhere, the guy who created it really did some great work there. It's all messy, you run down first, then over some bridges, you have to dive somewhere, then you go a bit up again to move further inside, climb some ladders, etc. Just like one would expect a real gnoll-hole. When I went in there for the first time, I was really lost, and thats how it's supposed to be. If I would crawl in some newly discovered cave in real life, I would probably get lost the same way.<P>However, it's made in such a way that you can recognize some spots (like the brewing barrels, or the bridges) so you can learn your way around once you've been in there for awhile. Thats the one thing about Crystal Caverns I didn't like, there aren't enough of those memorizable spots in there, so it's hard to remember the way upwards through the orc section. Apart from that it's a beautiful zone too, with lovely textures and the singing velium in every corner. Yes, sound effects add alot to atmosphere in a zone too. Drip. Drip. Drip...<P>Also I enjoyed some of the funny creatures you did, e.g. snow bunnys in a 30+ Zone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> Or a snow dervish slowing down in its rotation and finally falling apart when slain, or the geonids et al.<P>And I laughed my ass off when I was in that school room in Thurgadin where one kid pinches the other and the teacher tells the one who was pinched to stand in the corner, because he yelled out loud  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> Or the sleepy Guard in Icewell.<P>(Bah, Absor never posts my comments anyways.)<P>/bonk Absor<P>Hmm, too many chars to put them all in a signature. You may refer to me as Menemtahe for the moment :-)</B><P>***<P><B>Wow...I could probably write a book about this topic.  Here are some short thoughts :<P>Speaking from the graphical design of a dungeon, I especially like dungeons that tell a story.  The Hole is a very good example.  If you are down there you can imagine how it mustve been when the elementals from the plane of underfoot conquered the city and destroyed everything, forcing the heretics to retreat to Paineel.  Its creepy to walkk down streets in a ghost town....you see shops and inns, destroyed and with broken furniture.<P>As for the gameplay side of design: I think its vey important to have a safe zone in in a dungeon. Not everyone can assemble a party before going to a dungeon.  And its hard to form pickup groups if you cant hang around an entrance of a dungeon because of mobs spawning there (Howling Stones).  From the entrance it should be possible to go in several directions..not just one way...that would allow for multiple groups to go down without stepping on other people toes. When you go down a path..make it possible to branch off to set up camps in certain areas..so that folloing groups dont have to go through your camp to reach another spot.  As for mobs: I know it is a an old topic.  But please make it possible to go down without having to have a chanter in the group.  Too many mobs in an area and too many roamers together with bad pathing makes a chanter a MUST in a group.  Perhaps make the mobs harder but not that many in one spot.  Make rooms with just one or two mobs in it.  Make a mob that is very hard (doable by one group of course) and that procs pets to make things interesting for example.<P>Well, as I said..I could probably write more about it..but I am sure you have a lot of other emails to read...thanks for listening.<P>Thoril Honorblade</B><P>***<P>Lantir_DelArmgo wrote:<P><B>I, personally, love the feel of Thurgadin. Almost all of the other cities in EverQuest feel barren. Walk into a tavern in Felwithe or Kaladim and what do you see? Not a whole lot. There aren't many npcs in the bar. The pubs in Thurgadin, however, are full of people, and the added sound effects of lots of people talking help bring this area to life. Crowded barrooms are just one of the little touches that make this zone more interesting than others.</B><P>***<P>Goladus wrote:<P><B>Scenery, atmosphere.  I love the remote and desolate feeling of Permafrost, the sinister atmosphere in qeynos catacombs, and the big lava pits in Sol B.  Dalnir is freakish and unnerving.  To me blackburrow feels like an infestation, though I'd not rate blackburrow as one of the more scenic zones in the game.<P>I like when a zone has a good story behind it.<P>I like a zone that I can explore solo(meaning the creatures are low level or not agro).<P>Or I like a dungeon that a significant portion of can be explored by a single group.  <P>I like when NPC's respond to hails!<BR>I like when NPC's respond to hails!</B><P>***<P>We received over 300 comments about what you all like about zones so far.  The majority seem to like a theme, a story, a sense of life and mood.  Personally, I think that's a key to making the world more enjoyable.  Loot is only exciting the first time you see it.  A well designed, well plotted, nicely populated zone will be nice every time you see it.<P>I just can't post all 300+ messages.  But the team has access to all of them.  And I'd like to see many more messages for them to read over and use when thinking about zone design.  Keep sending in your ideas.  I'll post more of your comments later.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>EQ team,<BR>Can you post more comments?<P>I have so much fun reading about the broken town in The Hole and crowded bar in Thugardin. I've never been to those places before and these stories makes me want to explore the place myself.<P>I believe that these are the STORIES and LORE of Everquest. Where you heard about the great city and history.<P>EverQuest comes alive for me after reading the comments.<P>-skyp</B><P><BR>Most certainly.  We've received a lot of responses to this post, and rather than trying to come up with clever responses to them all, I'll just post more of them for you to read.<P><BR>Sumyun-SR wrote:<P><B>just wanted to tell you about my first visit to the temple of veeshan last week. something that i really enjoyed about the zone was the way in the opening halls of the zone were portrayed all of the old world and kunark prominent dragons. such as nagafen depicted fighting a barbarian warrior in his lair or vox also doing battle it was really a trip down memory lane telling the player look what youve been through and how far youve come to get here. it was a really neat connection for an old school player whos been there and done that. any zone that has content that can trigger that kind of response from a player and kind of connect with them like that is excellent.</B><P>***<P>Leata-Evoluxa wrote:<P><B>Personally, my favorite zones are:<P>Nurga/Droga:<BR>FINALLY, a dungeon where you don't just choose a cubbyhole where mob_003 spawns and drops loot_00456 or loot_0064.  These are both dungeons you actually have to crawl through and explore, and they are very linear.  Almost everything wanders, almost everything drops random loot.  The only shame was I was just almost too high-level for Droga when Kunark came out. =(<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow:<BR>A dungeon that again, is linear and not just a random collection of rooms with specific mobs with specific loot you can squat and camp.  Having to fight special creatures to gain the key to the next floor is awesome, especially Tserrina's Key which is your "passport" to the whole Tower as a reward for killing Tserrina, which is no easy task.  My guild on Brell Serilis practically LIVES in the Tower, especially the 7th floor where Tserrina spawns.<P>The Hole:<BR>I like the whole design and the toughness factor of this place.  Even without the Experience Bonus it has, I would hunt here a lot.  Lots of tough mobs, and you really need to have a solid and experienced group to go through here.  Plus it's not crowded like Sebilis or Karnors because the "phat lewt" is not as prevalent here.<P>Oh, and I have to say as well that Paineel is my favorite city, hands down.=)</B><P>***<P><B>EverQuest needs a good pyramid.  The pyramids in Cazic Thule are lots of fun, but they're more Mayan style than Egyptian.  There are plenty of great towers, but no really good pyramids.  I'm talking a "Plateau of Giza" kinda pyramid complex here with some nice, elaborate dungeon complexes inside of them.  I'm reminded of what was quite probably the best AD&D module series I ever played (Pyramid, and, uh, the other two   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">), and the flavor there was just tremendous.  I'm thinking a grand, rolling desert zone, akin to the Karanas in size, with a few massive monumental pyramids off in the distance.  Come on, it's not like you need to mine the stone or anything, it's all digital   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>As for what makes a zone interesting, I'm a flavor magnet.  Chatting NPC's, eerie, creepy effects, difficult maps to get used to (Blackburrow, Splitpaw, and Guk are excellent examples...as well as Droga/Nurga).  To date, Mistmoore, Unrest, and (most especially) Befallen raise my "creepy factor" right through the roof every time I go in.  Befallen especially has a tremendously good "tomb" feel for me, even better than Dalnir.  Just the right combination of low ceilings, collapsed areas, and general decay to make my first adventures there real knuckle-biters.<P>Danger is another important aspect.  I personally like doing "dungeon crawls", where you start with just a few friends and go from one end of the dungeon to the other, fighting what you find along the way.  There's something really freaky-kinda-disturbing about huddling hidden in a corner at almost no life trying to get enough mana just to escape (or heal yourself, or whatever).  Nothing is better than a knuckle-biter combat where everyone gets out with less than a bubble of life and mana.  I also like places where it's readily apparent that once you go down, there is no easy way back up (if you're a caster, that is...Dalnir's is priceless for this).<P>That's my suggestion, ambiance is VERY nicely done most places in EQ.  Background sounds are pretty fantastic.<P>Oh, and one other thing.  You need drums.  You need a good orc/goblin cave with dangerous, bottomless wells and orcish drumming, and grunting echoing through the halls from the distance.  "Drums in the Deep" worked in Moria, it'll work in EQ   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>-Zekestrom of the Many Names</B><P>***<P><B>It's not easy to say I like one zone better than another. There are things I like about every zone, but I have to compliment you on the way you seem to have been thinking in Velious. Velketors Labyrinth, Crystal Caverns, Dragon Necropolis and to a certain extent Skyshrine, all of them seem to have been designed in a way where moving about in the zone is just as rewarding as sitting still.<P>I think that is a good way of thinking. When you are moving, the movement itself creates "story". I'll try to explain it: A story is a row of "events" happening in the course of a certain time period (like an evening). When you crawl in a dungeon, the "movement" creates changing "events" , and your playsession becomes much more of a story than most camps (as you experience more varied monsters, NPC's, areas, PC groups...) <P>Not to say camps can't give you a feeling of having been part of a story, but as with most theatre plays happening in a single room, a lot more depends on the dialogue. Less room for surprises in a single room as well...<P>A few of the areas and feels I like: <BR>- The fairy tale look of the entrance to Velketors castle (The patio and garden area, after the well)<BR>- The view from the cliffs down at the Howling stones entrance.<BR>- Resting at the dock inside Rivervale.<BR>- The run from the Paineel Newbie gardens down to The Hole entrance.<BR>- Sneaking around in the Graveyard and Crypt in Mistmoore.<BR>- Running around in Kelethin and knowing where everything is.<BR>- The size of Unrest<BR>- The concept of the Tower of Frozen Shadows, from outside drumbeats to scraps of history spread out, to variety, to fitting loot.<BR>- Fighting our way south in Howling Stones.<BR>- The way you never get the full view of KC.<BR>- Walking on the walkways at the sky floor in City of Mist.<BR>- The music in Nro.<BR>- The uniqueness of the Cobalt Scar tower.<P>Piip Ignatz<BR>Iceni  Innoruuk</B><P>***<P>Kalad_Divinewind wrote:<P><B>My favorite zone in the game is Kaesora, for several reasons.<P>1. Has a place to sit outside and gather a group. I think this is critical of many dungeons. The one's that are underused don't have any safe places to get everyone together. Example--Howling Stones, which would be my favorite zone if you didn't have to spend 2 hours trying to find enough people to go at it (no safe gathering spot either outside or inside). <P>2. General spacing of mobs. It always seems to be a challenge, but in general you don't get run-away, out-of-control mobs.<P>3. A "doable" dungeon. Meaning, the layout just lends itself to being "done" by moving through it, rather than camping one spot.<P>4. Level-appropriate loot. The loot is very good for the level of the dungeon, but no so good that high levels come in and farm it all the time alas the Chief in Droga for the Thorned Idol.<P>5. A sense of history to the place. You can just FEEL that the place has history. The same thing with City of Mist, Mistmoore and The Hole. I love dungeons like this. The church area is beautiful and you can just picture Xalgoz up there at his pulpit preaching to his horde of undead.<P>It's dungeon's like this that make Everquest such a dynamic world. Kudos! and Keep up the good work.</B><P>***<P><B>For most zones (towns in particular), I love seeing NPCs that interact with other NPCs.  The Holy Harbringer bar in Thurgadin is probably my most favorite spot in EQ due to its bad jokes and Horasug's attempts to save the dwarves of Velious.  It's touches like these that make the world seem alive.  Too many zones are treated as if getting through the zone as fast as safely possible is the goal.  Thurgadin is one zone where it's fun to walk slowly and see what events unfold.<P>I've seen this done somewhat outside of towns (such as the Broodmother quest and Garadain quests) and would love to see more such quests and NPC events happen.<P>But you're an artist, so you're probably focusing on the zones themselves.  I'd have to say my favorite zones are the purely 3D zones, such as the town of Kelethin and the mine shaft in Crystal Caverns.  They add a sense of danger that's not in most other places.  Triggered forms of travel (such as the elevators of Kelethin and Paineel) are also intriguing, but teleporters usually ruin the effect of delving deep into a dungeon for me.<P>I guess the other piece I like about the some zones are the small imperfections in the world.  In Qeynos, a sign disallowing fighting has "and no Dwarves" sprawled on it near the bottom.  The aqueducts have graffiti such as "Aradune sucks".  It's almost something that I'd want to do but an NPC has already beaten me to.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Well, those are my thoughts about why I like to explore the world of Norrath.<P>Corinus<BR>Cazic-Thule</B><P>***<P><B>I like to see a place that seems like a piece of a real world.  I love the comings and goings in Thurgadin.  It's great that the king's council packs up for the night and goes home.  I like the zoo in Ak'Anon and the sled dogs in Halas.<P>For hunting, I like the zone to force you to move around.  Unfortunately, if everyone is moving, the zone supports fewer adventurers at once, because each group occupies a larger area.  Once you have slash-and-burned your way through a part of the dungeon, it should be uninteresting for a long time while you explore other areas.<P>I like to find a number of different challenging fights: a mass of melees, a mass of casters, a mix of melees and casters, a lord with guards, a trio of lords, a caster lord and a melee lord, a group of unmezzable stuff.  Each kind of fight takes a different strategy and it is fun to have to switch strategies between fights.<P>I like interesting geometry, but only as much as the game engine supports.  Arching bridges and mazelike tunnels are really neat to see and navigate, but if the creatures can't path on them naturally or if unseen things kill you through the ceiling, much of the charm is lost.<P>Kael, for example, is a beautiful zone, with interesting geometry and good mob placement.  It is harmonious with the pathing algorithm; nothing ever runs directly away from you when it is trying to get to you.  It does lend itself to a moving hunting party, but the fights are fairly uniform in nature (1-3 unmezzable things).<P>--<BR>Xymarra Elen-gariel<BR>Enchanter of the Arbiters on E'Ci</B><P>***<P><B>What I love is beauty and tranquility in the zone design.<P>Surefall Glade and Thurgadin/Icewell Keep<P>I could sit and relax in SG all day.  If it were a real place I'd want to live there, it is that quite and beautiful.  Thurgadin is just simply my favorite town.  It's alive and bustling.  The people talk to you, get in fist fights with you, and move around and do things.<P>Things I dislike.  Repetitiveness and dingyness.  I do not like Freeport and Guk.  I understand they are zones that were probobly some of the first created, and therefore ugly.<P>I love Thurgadin and High Keep also for utility reasons.  You can bind, buy food, gems, arrows, bank, and FIGHT in the same zone.  How awsome is that.  I love pure utility zones.  places you don't need to leave to feel safe, yet can still give you awsome experiance.  There is no travel hassle, or LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  Hell in Thurgadin, being a Paladin, I can even visit my trainer!  Though it is understandable, these zones only support you during certain levels, it's still a good stretch of time.<P>I love that.<P>I like rich textures and beauty, but not extreem complexity.  Crystal Caverns my be the best looking, well intentioned, yet most horribly executed zone ever.  It is a wonderful and amazing place, but THE single most complicated dungeon.  Go upo to go down, go down to go up.  You can't map this place if you tried.  And honestly I find it hard to belive even the Ry`Gorr and coldain would survive down there, and not stumble around getting lost.  Over complexity is not fun or rewarding in any way.<P>Lower Guk suffers form the same problem, but not to the same extent.<P>Hope this helps.<P>Mirithal Darkbuster<BR>Knight of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Illuminatus<BR>Karana</B><P>***<P><B>Why does a zone appeal to me? I'll tell you that my 3 favourite zones, are Crystal Caverns, The Tower of Frozen Shadow and Thurgadain, all in Velious. Since this can get long I will only go into detail of one of em. <P>Crystal Caverns.<P>This zone feels ALIVE. From the twisting tunnels and shimmering velium crystals to grumbling of Ry`Gorr miners outraged at the "thieves" crawling around their velium veins, to the lost dwarven city of Froststone full of barely surviving left behinds from before the founding of Thurgadain, with stories just waiting to be uncovered, to the breathtakingly beautiful silent and eerie velium caves below the city, where Queen Drachnia awaits. And in the middle of this, an outcropping of Geonids just minding their own business...This zone has a LIFE.  it also feels the most like a true dungeon crawl of any zone yet in Everquest.<P>The loot here is nothing to sneeze about, but I could just spend hours listening to dwarves, or swimming in the crystalline rivers dodging Velium Crawlers and looking for new things. I love this place deeply, and it's a good way to get away from the XP grind sometimes.<P>The other two zones are interesting to me for the same reason. deep, DEEP atmosphere.<P>That's what makes a zone interesting to me.<P>Jurrasic Epoch</B><P><BR>Thanks for all your comments.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

<B>Sounds like Velious is the place to be for nice zones.<P>Are there any comments about the old world ... you know, for those of us who can't get to Velious, because we won't have a character over the level of 30 any time soon?<P>Jynx</B><P>Well, since this question has generated a lot of response, I'm sure I can find some...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Numtini wrote:<P><B>What makes a good zone is sometimes different from what makes it interesting. I think making it interesting involves a lot of different visual zones and keeping something on a theme.<P>I think the most interesting zone for me is Neriak because of the atmosphere (for an adventuring zone, I think Lavastorm has great atmosphere) while the best zone for playing I've been to is the Warrens.<P>I think music and sound add a huge amount to a zone. After I played in Blackburrow for the first time with a Soundblaster Live! I went out and purchased one for myself. The echos etc. were just incredible. I feel similarly about the little "descent" sound when you go down the tunnel towards "the bridge" area.<P>The warrens has great gameplay even tho it's not that exciting in atmosphere. The loot is level appropriate (and thanks to the special rules, not farmed by ubers). The trains can be huge, but they are not automatic death. There is a nice range of levels and if you get yourself into trouble, you feel like it was you doing something stupid, not something unfair in the design. And even tho the wall textures are similar, there are enough landmarks: different sized openings, altars, short ramps and stairs, doors, etc. that I found it easy to learn my way around.</B><P>***<P><B>Someone mentioned Freeport, and I just wanted to throw in my opinion on that.  I LOVE Freeport.  It's a city that you can really USE.  It's designed as if the people living there laid out the city as it grew.  People that don't like each other stay away from each other, supplies for making things are where you need them to be (for the most part), it's a big center of commerce and people, it's messy and it feels alive.  No other city approaches the realism that Freeport offers except Thurgadin.  And I'm really jealous that I'm not working with you on making cities.<P>- Bihlbo (working hard to teach himself 3D image tools and game design)</B><P>***<P><B>I love the mood of certain zones, especially when enhanced by sound, like the creepy sounds in Unrest. I especially like the little places in zones where the sound comes alive, like under the fallen pillar by the undead ruins in the Swamp of No Hope. It is a little mini-reward for exploring the nooks and crannies of a zone.<P>Sheesh</B><P>***<P>Daye_Tradye wrote:<P><B>My personal favorite is Castle Mistemoore. The design is great, all the secret passages and the castle itself! the zone is also challenging, it's easy to die yet not so hard as to be un-playable. The loot that drops is decent for the risk involved in getting it, and it' never over-crowded. My chars go from 16 - 35 in that zone hehe sometimes higher if i can find a good group to sneak in with. We all invis up and sneak back to the maid / butler or up to the tower thru some of the secret passages. I think all this factors, the visually appealing design, challenge w/o being too hard, and decent player load, make this zone interesting and incredibly fun to play in, IF you know what your doing.</B><P>***<P><B>The sunsets<P>Alexandrae and Sock</B><P>***<P><B>My favorite dungeons? Well for scenary I'd have to say Chardok tops the list. Take a nice look at the library and you'll see what I mean.<P>For mood? I'm not really sure. Yeah, storyline is important to an RPG but my SK was never to worried about that, just shredding creatures to bits. Najena, Befallen, Unrest all have a nice dark atmosphere. But I personally prefer fast paced dungeons with lots of action.<P>My two favorite dungeons in the game are Cazic Thule and Lower Guk. Cazic Thule is easy enough to learn with time. The central courtyard makes grouping extremely easy. There is a druid port just outside, a wizard port INSIDE the dungeon. There are a ton of places groups can set up and pull to. The challenge is definately present as well, but not so overpowering as to discourage players.<P>I've been in a ton of "non-perfect" groups here during my time and had extreme success and very fast paced nights. Try fighting your way through the maze from the courtyard to the ziggurat, then clearing the entire ground floor and fighting all the way up to the archon on top and tell me you don't have fun....all at 30th level with no cleric, and no enchanter, just a druid, bard, sk and rogue...<P>Lower Guk is layed out wonderfully. The seperation of live and dead mobs is superb here, I think. And the mob seperation and pathing is wonderful. There's nothing more exciting than holding the frenzy area (30+ mobs) with just 2 warriors, 1 sk and a bard...<P>The problem with higher level dungeons, as they stand now, is that unless you have a large group of friends that already hunt there you can't find a group unless you are a cleric or enchanter. Spending 2 hours LFG in a remote dungeon like Sebilis is not my idea of fun. Karnors is a bit better for that but the exp reward is not worth the time it takes to find a group, find a place to pull to, etc etc. Chardok, while a superbly designed dungeon, isn't hunted becouse it's seen mostly as a raid location due to the difficulty of the mobs as you move deeper in.<P>Some dungeons should be designed to be "crawled" while others should be designed for the "camping" mindset that we players have grown into. Dungeons with buy/sell/bind points close by, ports nearby, a setup area to build groups in, distinct rooms that once broken make good camps, not a lot of see invis mobs in the way, or see invis undead mobs depending which are present, and not a heavy mix of live and undead standing side by side. Pullers like to explore before they dig a group into trouble. At 50+ if you get groups killed a lot trying to learn a dungeon you won't see many more groups. LGuk I was able to explore and learn, risking only my neck, without destroying the whole night for 5 other people when my explorations went badly. And being a good puller I got into tons of groups.<P>So to sum up, a good dungeon has a balance between challenge and explorability/ability to learn. Good dungeons are located in such a way to make hunting in them feasible and desirable. And good dungeons have a good layout, design and mood.<P>Vendric Ravenkrest</B><P>Again, thanks for the comments.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>I am primarily an old continent player. My machine does not well support the newer areas of the game.<P>My favorite zones in the older areas: (will also include things I don't like in those areas)<P>Blackburrow: Just an incredible warren, complete with waterfalls and gaping holes. The echos from barking Gnolls are incredible. This is the reason I prefer to contribute to the genocide of gnolls over orcs or goblins.<P>Upper Guk: A real mish mash, with tight corridors and a good claustrophobic feel to it. Areas carved out of the living rock, and areas with dressed stone walls. Very nicely done.<P>Innothule Swamp: Amazingly enough, I think this zone has less 'mist' than most of the forest zones, making it easier to see where you are going.  I much prefer running through this area than the neighboring Feerrott jungle. Could use some more snakes though and gators though.<P>Everfrost Peaks: This zone makes me cold. Beautifully executed, and the ability to get near the tops of the mountains on the edge of the frozen wastes makes for some incredible views. I do wish for the 'crisp frozen morning' view though, the fog is not bad but you should be able to see  forever. (good cold air is much clearer than normal air because it holds less moisture)<P>Cities:<BR>Qeynos, has a lived in look and feel while not being as ugly as Freeport.  Ak'anon is a very well done Gnome city... I'd like to see another pop up somewhere at some time, though the incessant ticking will drive me mad! Mad I tell you!<BR>Kaladim, Neriak and Rivervale are well suited to their inhabitants. Neriak is a city prepared to stand a siege, and under expansion (deep in the third gate are areas of construction.) Kaladim also seems to be carved from the bones of the earth, and has that daunting front portal to assault. I would have thought the dwarves would have cleared the area in front (what's knocking down a few mountains) for a better sortie/killing zone, but otherwise very Dwarvish. Rivervale is just... halflingish.<P>Tyas<BR>Enchanter of the 24th chapter.<BR>Morrel-Thule</B><P>***<P>Electricz wrote:<P><B>What I find interesting in a zone is a certain ammount of intelectual challenge.

The minute walk...i mean swam in, ready with my rebreather on, I really got he sense that I was in a mermaid castle.

I love zones with constant action to them. Growing up in places like Blackburrow then moving on to High Pass and High Keep they REALLY taught you how to group well cause if you didn't play your part well you died, it was that simple. Pulling from the raider room in High Keep into the warrior room and then the room suddenly spawns and your working as best as you can. The warriors are nervous cause the hitpoint bar is dropping fast, the enchanter is gettin whacked, the rogue just can't seem to backstab and the cleric has just anounced LOM. But then as if some miracle happens then cleric lands his heal drawing the mob off the enchanter onto himself, the chanter messes a few while the warriors and rogue make short work of the remaining mobs and in the end you all breath a sigh of relief.

I've talked to many people and we all agree on a few things on this subject.<P>Anything to get away from the spawn camping atmosphere makes us want to go to a zone.  Dragon Necropolis is by far the best zone in the game.  The layout, the mobs, the traps, everything is top notch.  Velkators has a unique but similar feel.  Lots of ice, mobs that feel like they were meant to be in the zone, a stimulating layout.  Temple of Veeshan just has a feel to it.  It's graphically stunning but it's the feel that makes it great.  I wish every zone in EQ had that feeling when you were playing in them.  I'd go to Dragon Necro even if there wasn't any loot in there just because the zone is that good.  Plus you'll never have a list, a camp, or a bad time.</B><P>***<P><B>Personally, I like zones where there's something interesting to do besides hunting and killing.  For instance, with the recent overall Events going on in the Karanas and elsewhere in the world, several of the NPCs that used to say little or nothing (for instance, the farmers in WK and NK) are now aware of events going on around them enough to complain about the mist, the swarms, etc.<P>What I would love to see is more of this, where the NPCs at least can relay events that they saw in their zone.  Lanys was in the zone trying to recruit help?  The NPCs should be able to gossip about it.  Sir Jevik was seen fighting some nasty undead?  Again, that should be something the NPCs could gossip about.  <P>Of course, depending on how 'major' an event is, would help determine how long it's gossiped about.  For instance, Firiona Vie seen wandering around the outpost named after her would bring only a few days or a few weeks worth of gossip while a big drag out battle like Kithicor could be talked about many, many, many months later.<P>Something like this would allow people who weren't lucky enough to take part in one of the Big Events that tend to shape our world be able to stay informed enough so that when they do take part, they don't have to ask questions that tend to sidetrack what is being relayed to us.  Plus I'd imagine that it would help take some of the load off of the GMs who otherwise have to try to fill in the backstory for those who are present at the plots.<P>Just my two copper,<P>Grei</B><P>***<P>Edair wrote:<P><B>wow, good topic.<P>The more memorable peices for me,<P>The catwalks and castle view of Velketors labrynth, the maze is cool too, velketors escape route behind the throne.. also Wow! (actually. the more i think about it the more i like that zone , now that its been tuned to be not quite so painful)<P>The sound (if you have surround sound set up) in the Plane of Hate fully spawned. Nothing else i've ever heard compares to that creepy feeling, and the silence after a clearing. The echo's in velketors entry also amazing.(and that laugh! What IS THAT!)<P>The first time i saw the graveyard, the ball-room , the gargoyled alcoves in Mistmoore. I also must say seeing a mistmoore train as the roaming guards and entire contents of the castle pour out to defend it.  While very ugly and brutal to the player, gotta say it was impressive and seemed to make the place alive.<P>The entrance to Temple of Veeshan. The stark external veiw of the pillars had me a bit disapointed untill i stepped up on the dias and saw the guard and the statues. Nominee for best use of colored lighting too.  Took my breath away.<BR>Kudos. Also after zoning in.. the artwork on the entry hall was very cool for the oldest players who remember doing those things. (finally we see how that frozen barbarian in vox's lair got there!) These things that tie the world and zone together.. make Norrath whole, not just a collection of ideas, but a world aware of itself.<P>I'm not sure what the magic is with Frogloks, but they are by far my favorite opponents. The wet dripping texture of the walls in sebelis and guk , the heirarchies of frog society. excelent. might just be the way frogs flip when they cast. Or the mixes of their classes, some roamers, some healers, some warrior types, some wizards. adds variety to each fight.<P>An individual note on Sebelis, The sheer amount of content packed in there is incredible.  I've seen 100 people in just the frogs area / crypt, and everyone had things to kill (there were still frogs left alive, unlike pre-kunark guk) nobody down in the jail, mycons or jugs. which, at a guess, could handle another 40+ people easy. This zone was obviously built to handle a ton of people and it does so very well. Yay frogloks!<P>Which reminds me of another plus. Zones that 'make sense', not just having a story but places you feel were built a certain way for a reason. like the dead vs live ruins of old guk, or the 3 room council of kobold royalty in nagafens lair and the giant court as well. Zones where you get a sense these creatures actually live there and life goes on with or without you.. really adds to the realism (i still cant figure out why there isnt a winding secret passage from the commanders room (or maybe the library) in sebelis over to the kitchen.<P>Also have to add my appreciation for the mini-dungeons in a zone.  The sarnak fort in lake of ill omen was very cool to explore. The old minotaur mines in steamfont. The goblin camp in warsilk woods ruins (the ravine is lovely too), The underwater tower in Lake Ratheatear, (which very cool, is hinted at by qeynos residents)<P>Kedge keep, love it, a totaly unique zone with its own quirks to figure out and several paths through to various areas. Its a shame there aren't more stories of the old kedge race or why there are portraits of kedge painted in east karana.<P>Another point i think i just stumbled over.. when there are several ways to get places in a zone, not only does it add to the 'sense' of the place.. but when you come full circle and suddenly recognize where you are the natural reaction is wow, cool! =)<P>Being able to enter a room or see its inhabitants acting naturally guarding or standing around a table without them all charging you immediately adds volumes to the magic of a place. Seeing the wedding party in tower of frozen shadow (or in kurns tower), sneaking into a corner of mistmoore castle's entry and watching the guard walk through.<P>I could go on, the world is so huge =). I'll mention one last thing.  The temple surrounded by fire in the plane of fear was a very cool idea. but the halls of the temple, the building itself.. in fact the scattered buildings all over PoF make no sense at all.. they're just 'there' , kinda hurts the sense of reality.</B><P>***<P>Justynn wrote:<P><B>Areas I love:<P>-The froglok city in Swamp of no hope<BR>    All very green to me, so not useful in a hunting aspect, but low enough that I could wander around at 53 with camo on undisturbed.

Why the heck can't we swim through zone walls?</B><P>***<P><B>I'm sure you're swamped with comments, but I thought I'd go ahead and add mine since you asked. :-)  I'll lump my responses into 4 categories.<P>1.) What I like in a city.  I really like how each city in Norrath has a unique feel or flavor.  Erudin is bright and clean, yet stark.  Qeynos has a very tight, windy, old-world feeling.  I could go on and on.  But it's great that each city has a unique feel and flavor.  For utility I spend the most time in Freeport or Thurgadin.  They have the most supplies for trade skills and other things.<P>2.) What I like in an outdoor zone.  I like a zone with a great view.  I love to stand up on the cliffs of Lake Rathe and look across the water.  Firona Vie has some good spots to look at the city from a distance.  Sometimes, in East Karana, I stop on the ramp and look at the carvings in the stone walls.<P>3.) What I like in a dungeon.  I like a dungeon that's do-able by a six-person, pick-up group.  I don't like places like Karnor's Castle where an Enchanter is just a requirement because single pulls are just impossible.  I also like safe places where a group can rest without too much to bother them past the occasional roamer.  The 30+ person uber-raid is fun, and has it's place, but sometimes I like the D&D feel of just grabbing five fellow adventurers and crawling through a dungeon.<P>4.) What I like in general.  I'd like to see more mini-quests, or quests that can be done with a small group.  Ak'Anon is rich in these quests, but the Ogres seem blessed with far fewer mini-quests.  I definately like a zone to have a rich, full story, background, and theme.  I like a zone that I can remember for it's unique flavor and features.<P>I just got done with my first raid deep into Velketor's Labrynth.  We sure scored some "phat lewt" but what I remember most is advancing slowly through the dark, gray, cramped, underground tunnels.  And then swimming up the water to the castle area.  Suddenly I was swimming out of a beautiful fountain, in a gorgeous, out-door fairy-tale castle garden.  I'll remember the shock of going from sewers to gorgeous garden more than the loot.<P>Thanks!<P>TexasRanger</B><P>It's nice to see so many zones that have their own fan clubs.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for the nice comments and suggestions.<P>Alan<BR>

Sirap wrote:<P><B>For me, what makes a zone interesting is a combination of several things.<P>1.  Probably the most important factor is NPC interaction.  The scripted events in Velious are wonderful (perfect example is the dwarf in one of the Thurgadin bars who actually steps outside when you tell him he's ugly) including the various scripted quests.  Also high up on this list is people to talk to.  The stories that whats-his-name bladesinger tell in East Karana are nice examples of good NPC dialogue.  The Qeynos guards who say things like 'Yes, Sir' and 'Buuuurrrrpp, oops, was that me?' are another example of this.  I want to feel that I'm in a living, breathing world whose inhabitants interact with each other as well as interacting with me.<P>2.  Zone music.  A lot of people don't like zone music, I know, but I think music can make or break a game.  Excellent job to whoever composed the two pieces of zone music for Wakening Land.  I especially like the music that chimes in when you wander around the PoG lake.<P>3.  The mini-dungeons that are in the various outdoor zones.  It's neat and exciting to be able to go exploring without a big preparation/risk element.<P>That's all I can think of.</B><P>***<P><B>Old World...<P>Cities: Neriak, Oggok, and Paineel<BR>I love the dark feel of Neriak and Paineel.  These two feel like sister cities to me.  In Paineel, I love the dancing skeletons in the bar.  The libary has a ghoul libary assistant.  All the ghosts floating around and moaning.  If you arn't actauly from Paineel it can be spooky.  Neriak has ghouls too guarding the Necro city.  This dark city has neon light like in Vegas.  They already have a place to shoot darts!  Hehee... Oggok is truely an Ogre home.  All the caves and crudness of the furniture.  I often wonder what the dead end in Oggok near the Food Vendors will be for... ?!?  Perhaps leading to a new future zone once the Ogres finish tunneling through?!?<P>Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule.  This is my all time favorite zone in the game.  Bar None.  People cause a lot of trains here, but if you play it right you can stay off the main tracks.  This zone isn't linear.  It branches off which I like a lot.  From the courtyard you have "Five" differnt places to head off into... 6 if you count the zone exit/entrance.  1)Zone, 2)the Stone Golem area, 3)The Maze, 4)The Grid, 5)The Silverd Temple, and 6)The throne room and eventualy the Avatar of Fear.  In each of these areas there are 2 and 3 areas for some of them.  This place has a nice theame to it.  Its not as crowded as it used to be and thats fine with me as I always go back here with my other charectars.  Also this zone is close to a city.<P>Expansions - Kunark<P>My biggest beef with Kunark are the moving tree and the sheer number of them in some zones... way way too laggy.. and I have a GeoForce 2 Ultra and ADSL.  I lag so much here I just stay away from Kunark as much as possbile.  I hate it when I have to lower my clip plane all the way down or turn off other display features to play in an area.. and I'm not talking about a raid... just normal travel.  With that being said I'm sure there are some nice places here but I can't comment on them as I stay away from Kunark based on lag.<P>Expansions - Velious<P>I LOVE Velious.. Kudos to you... the fact that there aren't many trees helps with lag a great deal.  The only zone I lag is in Wakening Lands.. again because of all the darn moving trees... way too much lag here to fight in... Funny but I don't lag as much in PoG.  Not as many trees here either.<P>City - Hands down Thurgadin because of the "Aliveness" of the town.  There is so much that happens here.. I wish you could revamp the Old world towns and make them move alive.  The only Old world town that comes close is Paineel.<P>Zones - Plane of Growth, Crystal Caverns<P>PoG I like because its so big... I love the waterfalls, the changing of the seasons, the river.. the Huge Lake... theame here is nice... I like the totem men.. Oogga Booga!  CC is has a great theam too.. very cave like.  The mob I hate to love here is the Velium Crawlers.. They are very loud and mean.. but I love them for that... scary mob factor.<P>I can't wait for the next expanison... make story alive... make the new town alive... have great theams...  for the old world.. add more story... add more history... revamp old places not for lvl changes or for loot, but for making them more "Alive".<P>Tekara Grimmhealer<BR>54th Vicar<BR>Hand of Chaos<BR>CT Server</B><P>***<P><B>Tarrick's Zone Awards, Part I:<P>*Coolest Environmental Effect (Audio)* :<P>- The Dragon Bridge in Iceclad -<BR>  The way the sound of the howling, whistling wind picks up as one continues to run up to the apex of this obviously immense bridge actually gives me a chill sometimes.  Perfectly done.<P>*Best Music* :<P>- Qeynos Hills/North Qeynos -<BR>  My favorite music in this area is that which plays near the small shop in the center of Qeynos Hills.  I believe this music is also used in other zones, but Qeynos Hills is the first place I heard it.<P>  The stately, noble fanfares that play near the North Qeynos and Surefall Glade gates suit this human area perfectly.  I am also very partial to the music in the ranger guild in Surefall Glade.<P>Honorable Mention: - Lavastorm -<BR>  The eerie music in this zone, replete with hissing, booming sound effects set me on edge the first time I heard it.  It still does sometimes.<P>*Best Use of Color* :<P>- Dreadlands -<BR>  The area near the druid ring and wizard spires is still, to me, one of the most beautiful areas in the game.  The stunning reds, yellows and oranges used for the leaves on the trees contrasts beautifully with the green of the grass and bright blue sky.<P>*Unsung Hero Award* (for the zone which receives nothing near the praise it deserves) :<P>- Runnyeye -<BR>  Many people HATE this zone.  Ok, I hated it for a while too - until I learned more about it.  There are a few things that I feel make this zone something special.<P>  Most notable is the extent to which this dungeon represents a true "mob town".  The fact that it has a usable bar/common room and a *functional bank* (for those who are fortunate enough not to aggro the goblins), is simply great.<P>  There is some fairly decent loot in this dungeon (for the levels it supports) and especially since they upped the EXP modifier for the zone, the EXP in here is quite good.<P>  One other advantage (which others may view as a disadvantage) is the challenging nature of the zone.  For a 20's group, this zone is tough!  It requires much care to not become overwhelmed and cause a train.  And heaven forbid you should get lost while trying to flee to the zone with 30 goblins behind you.  (Yes, it happened to me once).  This zone will keep you on your toes.<P>=====<P>I'll post Part II as more outstanding features come to mind.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Tarrick Greymoor<BR>56 Outrider<BR>Halcyon Conclave, E'ci</B><P><BR>Thanks for the comments.<P>Alan

IggyWuzz wrote:<P><B>Awesome question.  First off, I haven't ventured too far into Velious yet (only level 31 - this is my first character) and a lot of my younger years were spent powering up in Unrest rather than spending time exploring.<P>I think my favorite zone of all time has got to be Unrest.  The diferent levels of the house all present diferent challenges.  I love watching returning trains.  Everyone seems to work together well there.  I play on Vallon Zek, and there's a minimal amount of PKing.<P>I loved how people would run when the Ghost was trained.  I love how now, at 31, my group stands steady and derails for kicks.  Its just a fun fun zone with plenty to do for anyone from their early teens to their early thirties and beyond.  Even if it isn't the most visually impressive place its still fun.<P>Next - Timorus Deep: Elven outpost.  One day we wanted to really get away from it all and get some leveling out of the way, so a friend of a friend suggested the Iceberg.  So we jumped ship and swam to what's now dubbed "The Elven Resort"  I shifted into treeform atop one of the mountains and just stayed there for like an hour.  While the visuals aren't complex, they're evocitave - you have a good idea in your mind how this place would look, with the blue water lapping up on sandy shores.  The ancient monolith on the island is a curiosity, and its just a really nice picture watching the sun move overhead while you're waiting for the rest of the group to arrive.  Also, since you can't teleport or bind there - it really feels like a destination.  Everyone's gotta put some effort in to get there.<P>Lastly the Waterfall in the Great Divide blew me away.  I'm a sucker for eye candy like that.</B><P>***<P><B>One thing I've always wondered is who put all the torches up in most of the dungeons of the world that make them light all the time?  I mean you go into Feerott and it doesn't matter if you have Ultravision or what, at night IT'S DARK!  Now you go into the Crypt of Dalnir... It's a Crypt yet someone has lit it up rather nicely pretty much everywhere... You can leave your lantern/torch/etc outside because day or night it will be plenty light inside.<P>I'd like to see a couple dungeons with TRULY oppressive darkness.  Like Feerott but worse even...  Ultravision wouldn't work in this oppressive darkness since it's a complete darkness deep in the bowels of the earth.  Torchs, Lanterns, Magic lights and such would be the only light that would work.  <P>Imagine going into a dark dungeon with a group of friends all having to huddle close together for fear of being split up in the pitch black darkness.  Think of the fun of not being able to pull mobs 100yds away with an arrow, but having to almost run into them before you know they are there!  Seems a lot more realistic for a Crypt/Tomb to be utterly dark.  I think this also might encourage crawling the dungeon rather than camping/pulling since who would want to go off into the dark alone when they could run into 1 or 5 mobs at once!<P>Sciek Spellbottler<BR>Iksar Shaman  Tribunal</B><P>***<P><B>Hail Absor<P>Well without trying to repeat what a lot of other people have said, I'll try to concentrate on what I think makes a bad zone.<P>Okay, You have atmosphere. Befallen and Najena have buckets of atmosphere. Ever tried roaming those zones without light. CREEPY!<P>But you know what ruins the Najena for me? The design. Befallen is a ruin. Classic dungeon AD&D style. It's great.<P>Najena on the other hand they lost the plot. The designers appear to have made the zone to funnel players to the enterance. If the zone was more utilised the trains would make Mistmoore look lame! Take a look at the map sometime and you will see what I mean. <P>There is a castle in there. It looks great. Ruined etc. But why put jail cells and torture chambers outside the castle? It doesnt make any sense. Now if the design had put a "secret" door in that led down into the bowels of the castle to a torture chamber. That would be far more realistic, and add to the feel of the zone. As it stands you get a bizarre mix of caves with some kind of ruins, and fully functioning torture chambers. It doesnt gel.<P>To me the zone was designed by a Quake player. Running battles against live opponents. Get from one side of the zone to the other, and kill all the monsters. This was not a zone designed by say an AD&D player.<P>A lot of zones are like this. The original races that created them were presumably inteligent species. The PC's cities are all laid out intelligently. So why cant the city of Guk have been designed in a more rational manner? Why dont the ruined sections look more like ruins?<P>Unrest is brilliant. Mistmoore has some good parts, but looses it in others, SolA has to be one of the better designed zones, as you can see the mine shafts vs the inhabited quarters. But Lower Guk? HELLO? why is there a bedroom adjacent to the vampire bat cave? And it's sized for a troll no less.<P>I think you can see where I'm going here. A lot of zones in both Old World, and Kunark have the most irrational designs I have ever seen in an RPG. I dont know much about Velious as I havent explored a lot of it. For me zones full of endless drops (in the middle of a city), pitfalls, 100s of mobs closely packed, and bad pathing dont make a zone interesting for me. If it becomes too much of a challenge for me or my guild, we just dont go there unless it's required for a quest. <P>A fun outing is one where we go in, we have a few close calls, but we get all the loot and we get out without anyone dieing. A dungeon like Droga, CoM or Kaesora where you need to pay for the good items by sacrificing xp (ie. dieing multiple times to get it) are not interesting. I'de rather go to a dungeon where I dont earn any xp like SolA.<P>Regards<BR>Daareon Ravenstar<BR>Ayonae-Ro</B><P>Thanks again for all the commentary.<P>Alan<BR>
