			Participating in Groups

	Adventuring outside the city
  can be dangerous. Joining a group can help you defeat monsters that you normally
  can't kill, carry items that won't fit into your inventory, and progress
  through levels faster than you would alone. <BR><BR>Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience
  received while adventuring is based on the levels of the party members. As a
  general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the
  ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point
  that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>When starting a party, consider the skills of each member that you invite.
  You want a good mixture of combat, spell-casting and healing abilities. At
  the very least, make sure you have a couple of strong fighters, a wizard,
  magician, necromancer or enchanter to cast spells, and someone else with
  healing powers (like a cleric). Use variations of the &quot;/who&quot;
  command to see players of a certain level, race or class. <BR><BR>Groups are temporary groupings, as opposed to Guilds, which allow an ongoing
  affiliation between players.
