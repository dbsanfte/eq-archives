<h1>Update to the Patch Message for 2-4-03</h1>
	With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. <BR><BR>We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <BR><BR>The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. <BR><BR>We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. <BR><BR>We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix. <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
