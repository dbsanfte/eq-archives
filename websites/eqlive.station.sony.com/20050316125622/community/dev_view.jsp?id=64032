<h1>Class Re-envisioning</h1>
<P>Over the course of the last few months, since we announced
  this project, we have had numerous discussions on the classes.&nbsp; During these discussions we identified
  some key changes, that are relatively easy for us to implement, that could
  result in better gameplay for all of you.&nbsp; While this is far from complete (the
  process and this list) it is the start of this class re-envisionment,
  reflections, redefinition, whatever we all decide to call it besides
  balance.&nbsp; Some of these changes
  you see on this list will make it live for our April 6<SUP>th</SUP>  update.&nbsp; Others we would like to
  hear your thoughts and ideas on before continuing.&nbsp; We think that there are some very
  positive changes here, some of which kind of go against the grain of EQ
  gameplay.&nbsp; So let the discussion
  begin;&nbsp; </P>  <P>We'll start with some general gameplay changes that either
  affect all classes or multiple classes.&nbsp;
  </P>  <P><STRONG>General</STRONG></P>  <P>We are removing the level 55 fear cap and adding advanced
  spells to the fear lines to make them current.&nbsp; Now, this doesn't mean that all NPCs
  can be feared, we will be making use of a no-fear flag to stop potential
  game-play problems.&nbsp; </P>  <P>We will remove the hard coded aggro generated by poison
  based debuffs which will result in some DoTs and Tash generating less aggro
  than they currently do as well as more consistent aggro generation.</P>  <P>We are going to spread spell progression out for levels 1
  to 50 to reduce the levels gaps between gaining new spells.&nbsp; We would like casters to gain new
  spells every level and enjoy more even progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P>We are planning to add new abilities and disciplines to
  non-casters and spread those out between levels 1 to 50, along with their
  current abilities to make sure non-casters also have progression, in the form
  of a new ability, every level.</P>  <P>Pet owners will be able to click off any buffs they do not
  want their pet to have.</P>  <P>We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so
  they mitigate the effect instead.&nbsp;
  We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but where we feel the
  ability might be problematic the ability will have a lesser effect.</P>  <P>You will see the healing messages for Heal Over Time
  spells.&nbsp; There will also be a
  filter for this new message.</P>  <P>We will change the potion &quot;Essence of
  Concealment&quot; from invisibility to improved invisibility and make the
  components easier for alchemists to find.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P>All spells will check for immunity before they are
  cast.&nbsp; So if the target is immune,
  the spell will not generate aggro for the caster. </P>  <P>We would like ammunition to auto-feed from your inventory
  directly to the ranged slot.</P>  <P>We are eliminating the +mana cap.&nbsp; </P>  <P>We are removing the inherent resist rate from rain spells.</P>  <P><STRONG>Solo Play</STRONG></P>  <P>EverQuest is a group-based game we all know that but we
  also know that there are times that many of us like to hunt alone.&nbsp; Some of our classes can solo
  effectively, while others can't.&nbsp;
  We plan to make changes to classes that struggle with soloing to allow
  them some solo play.&nbsp; These
  changes will be made to only affect their abilities while solo and not affect
  how they perform in groups.</P>  <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We are still discussing the best way to go
  about this but some of the options we have discussed are listed here;</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Add healing potions to the game.&nbsp; To prevent this from unbalancing the
  group game, we need to be careful how these potions work.&nbsp; They may need to be a healing potion
  that does heal-over-time and does not stack with any other healing spells.&nbsp; Another option is simply having a long
  reuse on the potion so its effectiveness in a group situation, where the
  player is generally taking on much more difficult NPCs, is not affected much.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We are exploring class abilities that add the
  pieces needed to solo while also taking away the abilities that make them
  useful in a group situation.&nbsp; An
  example of this is a warrior ability that increases their defensive abilities
  and gives them a damage boost, but causes them to be able to generate nearly
  no aggro while the ability is in effect, so the warrior would not be able to
  tank for most groups</P>  <P><STRONG>Class Specific
  Changes</STRONG></P>  <P>Now onto the class changes.&nbsp; We know that this is what most of you
  are looking for and we think we have a pretty solid plan.&nbsp; Again, as I mentioned above, this is
  just the beginning folks.&nbsp; Our team
  is still crunching numbers and other changes are dependent upon that
  data.&nbsp; We will not be making any
  changes to melee DPS, tanking and other combat balance issues until that data
  is completed and we see what effects these changes have on gameplay.&nbsp; We ask that you please discuss these
  changes on your class board.&nbsp; And
  please folks, be constructive.&nbsp; If
  you think the ideas have no merit, say why.&nbsp; We can't work on it with you with bad
  feedback.&nbsp; OMG This SUXXORS is not
  going to help.</P>  <P><STRONG>Bards</STRONG></P>  <P>We will be increasing your instrument mod cap and using
  itemization to limit the inherent power gains.&nbsp; This also means that certain songs
  will have built in maximums to prevent them from scaling indefinitely.</P>  <P><STRONG>Beastlords</STRONG></P>  <P>We will add at least one new slow spell for you which has
  an innate resistance mod built in so that it lands more often.&nbsp; This will help you perform the role of
  slower in your groups, since you don't have access to the powerful resistance
  lowering spells of other slowing classes.<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P>We will be boosting your healing so it stays on par with
  ranger healing when we improve ranger heals.</P>  <P>We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should
  be able to use their pets in most gameplay situations, including raids.&nbsp; We believe that pet classes do not
  have many problems with pets on raids at the moment, but want you to
  understand that we intend for you to use pets on raids and if you find that
  there is a problem, we will find ways to correct it.</P>  <P>We will be increasing the availability of pet focus items,
  particularly for the more casual players.</P>  <P>We will be looking into the casting time of some of your
  pet healing spells and reducing the casting time where appropriate.</P>  <P><STRONG>Berserkers</STRONG></P>  <P>Many Berserker complaints are about their damage output
  and this isn&#8217;t something we can really address without the results of
  the number crunching.&nbsp; Our
  thoughts are that you are fine at lower levels and pretty decent at high
  levels with your AAs, but you may need some help at the mid levels.&nbsp; Should our numbers support our
  thoughts, we will be adjusting things so your damage progression is smoother
  across the levels.</P>  <P>We are looking into the endurance cost of many of your
  abilities and lowering them as necessary. </P>  <P>We are looking into adding throwing quivers that grant
  innate haste similar to normal quivers.</P>  <P><STRONG>Clerics</STRONG></P>  <P>With Dragons of Norrath you gained two new spells that you
  seem to enjoy; Mark of Vengeance and Mark of Retribution.&nbsp; We will be changing these spells into
  full spell lines that you get early on and that scale up as you level.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>We want to make your Turn Undead spells effective at all
  levels.&nbsp; Some of the suggested
  changes include:</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Changing the fear part of the spell so the
  rest of the spell still works even if the fear fails or removing the fear
  portion of the spell entirely.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Adding a strong snare effect.</P>  <P><STRONG>Druids</STRONG></P>  <P>Druids are a unique challenge in that the class is divided
  evenly between you offensive druids who enjoy doing damage, and you defensive
  druids who prefer to play the role of healer.&nbsp; We want to support both play styles,
  but if we were to increase both halves of the druid equally the class would
  quickly become overpowered.&nbsp; Our
  plan is to introduce a new option where a druid can enter into a particular
  &#8220;mode&#8221; or &#8220;stance&#8221; where they become better at one
  part at the expense of the other.&nbsp;
  Our preferred solution for this is to add an innate ability for
  druids. The ability would get its own button similar to abilities such as
  backstab or track.&nbsp; You will be
  able to be in one of three states and can switch between them once every 5 minutes.</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Normal &#8211; Their healing and offensive
  abilities are in balance.&nbsp; This is
  the state they exist in today.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Offensive &#8211; Their offensive power is
  boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their healing
  spells.</P>  <P>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Defensive &#8211; Their healing power is
  boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their
  offensive spells.</P>  <P>Another of our goals is to broaden the core grouping roles
  to allow all classes to more easily put together groups.&nbsp; Similar to how any of the 3 main tanks
  should be able to perform that role in a group, we want any of the 3 healers
  to be able to perform the role of a main healer in a group.&nbsp; The changes mentioned above for druids
  will allow you to fill a healing role and perform at about 80% of the
  effectiveness of a cleric.</P>  <P><STRONG>Enchanters</STRONG></P>  <P>We will add higher level upgrades to the Word of Morell
  spell line.<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P>We plan to change the way mana drain works.&nbsp; In the past the spell had diminishing
  effects on NPCs above level 53.&nbsp;
  We will be removing that limitation so you can use Theft of Thought on
  higher level caster NPCs and we can introduce more powerful spells in that
  line, in the future.&nbsp; However, we
  will also be changing drains so that they only return the mana the NPC has
  instead of always returning the full amount.&nbsp; If an NPC only has 100 mana and your
  spell does a 400 drain, you will only get 100 mana.&nbsp; This is a necessary change as most NPCs,
  including non-casters, are given small amounts of mana in order to power some
  innates.</P>  <P>We all know that the power of NPCs has climbed and the
  difficulty in charming NPCs has retreated.&nbsp; This has led to an imbalance where you
  were able to charm NPCs that do far more damage than ever intended and with
  minimal risk.&nbsp; This lead us to the
  unfortunate decision to make many NPC's uncharmable.&nbsp; With OOW, we introduced a change to
  charm that allowed us to make most NPCs charmable again, but reduce their
  effectiveness and remove the gameplay imbalance.&nbsp; We did this by reducing their stats
  while charmed.&nbsp; This presented
  some new problems though, the largest of which is you like to haste and buff
  your pets to get the most out of them and when the charm breaks, you face a
  much more powerful NPC.&nbsp; We have a
  plan to ensure charm&#8217;s usefulness and want to gather your opinion
  before putting it into motion.</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We want charm to be an integral part of your
  gameplay.&nbsp; You should be able to
  grab a charmed pet in most circumstances and use that to benefit your group.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We will be looking at the stats NPCs use when
  charmed to ensure they are within the intended range.</P>  <P>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We would like to add innate buff effects to
  enchanter charm spells.&nbsp; While an
  NPC is under the effects of the charm, they will also be under the effect of
  spells similar to what you would use to buff your pet.&nbsp; When charm breaks those effects will
  go away so you are only dealing with the NPC in its base state.</P>  <P>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The change mentioned above would cause further
  imbalance in zones where NPCs don&#8217;t currently lower their stats when
  charmed, the changes that were made in Omens will need to be made across the
  rest of the game and this will be the way new charm works in all of Norrath.</P>  <P>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  After charm changes for all zones, we can go
  back and open up the use of charm in areas where it was previously excluded
  due to balance problems making charm much more usable throughout the game
  world.</P>  <P><STRONG>Mages</STRONG></P>  <P>We will be converting most, if not all, of your summons to
  place the items directly into the hands of the target.&nbsp; Of course, we will also need a new
  toggle that lets players turn off this ability from anyone not in their
  group, anyone not in their raid, or anyone at all.</P>  <P>We will be adding new pet pack spells that contain the
  more used summoned pet item to help relieve the tedium of summoning many
  different items.</P>  <P>We will be fixing Turn Summoned in a way similar to how we
  fix Turn Undead for clerics.&nbsp; See
  the cleric section for more details.</P>  <P>We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should
  be able to use their pets in most gameplay situations, including raids.&nbsp; We believe that pet classes do not
  have many problems with pets on raids at the moment, but want you to
  understand that we intend for you to use pets on raids and if you find that
  there is a problem, we will find ways to correct it.</P>  <P>We will be increasing the availability of pet focus items,
  particularly for the more casual players.</P>  <P>We will be looking into the casting time of some of your
  pet heals and reducing the casting time where appropriate.</P>  <P><STRONG>Monks</STRONG></P>  <P>We will be reversing the AC mitigation reduction that you received
  during the Planes of Power era.</P>  <P><STRONG>Necromancers</STRONG></P>  <P>We will add new spells in the Screaming Terror line to
  give you some more combat utility.</P>  <P>We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should

  pet heal spells and reducing the casting times where appropriate.</P>  <P><STRONG>Paladins</STRONG></P>  <P>We want<STRONG> </STRONG>you to
  be a main tank in group situations.&nbsp;
  We believe that you are currently able to fill this role, but want to
  assure you that our intent is for a group to be able to grab a warrior,
  paladin, or shadowknight as their main tank and be effective with any of
  them.<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P>With DoN, you gained a limited form of defensive.&nbsp; We are monitoring your feedback and if
  you like this direction; we plan to make it a full spell line that begins at
  the level warriors get the defensive discipline.</P>  <P><STRONG>Rangers</STRONG></P>  <P>Rangers are good at many things and when all the parts add
  up properly, they&#8217;re a class that is in heavy demand.&nbsp; Our feeling is that the parts are not
  adding up properly in the current game.&nbsp;
  We are still digesting all of the DPS numbers and stats but in the
  meantime we identified a couple of things we can increase in the short term.</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We will be improving the damage you do through
  spells.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We will be boosting your healing ability,
  particularly at the top end of the game.</P>  <P><STRONG>Rogues</STRONG></P>  <P>We will fix the problems with Assassin&#8217;s Feint so it
  works correctly and then gauge your reaction to the working ability.&nbsp; If it turns out to be something that
  you like, we will look into adding more combat utility through a similar
  means.</P>  <P>We are looking into adding throwing quivers that grant
  innate haste similar to how normal quivers work<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>Shadowknights</STRONG></P>  <P>We also want Shadowknights to be a main tank in group
  situations. We believe that you are currently able to fill this role, but
  want to assure you that our intent is for a group to be able to grab a
  warrior, paladin, or shadowknight as their main tank and be effective with
  any of them.</P>  <P>With DoN, you also gained a limited form of
  defensive.&nbsp; We are monitoring your
  feedback and if you like this direction; we plan to make it a full spell line
  that begins at the level warriors get the defensive discipline.</P>  <P><STRONG>Shaman</STRONG></P>  <P>In DoN you received the spells Spirit of the Leopard and
  Spirit of the Panther.&nbsp; You seem
  to like these new spells and they have added more desirability for you in
  groups.&nbsp; We will be extending
  these into full spell lines so that Shaman of other level ranges can see the
  benefits from these spells.</P>  <P>As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing
  ability so you can function better as main healer in groups.&nbsp; You folks are a little problematic
  though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals,
  but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows.&nbsp; In a situation where an NPC is fully
  slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed,
  your healing falls behind.&nbsp; If we
  were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer
  when facing NPCs that can be slowed.&nbsp;
  So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in
  circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC
  (for your own strange reasons).&nbsp;
  These changes will be rolled out at the same time as any druid healing
  changes to ensure that one class does not eclipse the other. </P>  <P><STRONG>Warriors</STRONG></P>  <P>Many of the ideas for changes to the warrior class are
  dependant upon the results of the data we are still compiling.&nbsp; However, we are looking into improving
  your ability to solo in the mid and high level game as well as;</P>  <P>We are looking into the endurance cost of many of your
  disciplines and lowering them as necessary. </P>  <P>We will increase the knockback on Press the Attack
  slightly.</P>  <P><STRONG>Wizards</STRONG></P>  <P>With DoN, you received more mana efficient nukes that are
  aimed at improving your sustained DPS.&nbsp;
  We will be extending this into a line of spells to help out with
  sustained DPS at different level ranges.</P>  <P>We will fix Manaburn.&nbsp;
  Our preferred method is to uncap the ability and implement a cap based
  on the maximum percentage of health you can do in a single hit.&nbsp; So one of you, facing a million hit
  point boss mob (fairly common in today&#8217;s game) can expect a full
  manaburn to land for 10s of thousands of points of damage in one hit.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Once again I would like to remind you that this is the
  beginning of the changes and there is still more to come.&nbsp; We encourage you to openly discuss these
  changes and let us know what you think.&nbsp;
  We want this to be a cooperative exchange and we will chime in on your
  discussions when appropriate.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Thanks all.</P>
