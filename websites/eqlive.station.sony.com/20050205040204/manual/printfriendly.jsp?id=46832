			Hot Buttons
		</h2>
	
	To make any interface button
  accessible at all times, there's a Hot Button bank to the left of the screen with
  ten different sets of ten blank buttons (the arrows cycle you through each
  set). This means that you can program up to 100 Hot Buttons (though you can
  only view 10 at once). <BR><BR>Hot Button shortcuts are a good idea - you can copy any interface button function
  (any interface button, skill, spell, or Ability/Combat/Social/Main button)
  onto a blank Hot Button. <BR><BR><EM>To create a Hot Button:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click-and-hold on the button you want to copy.<BR>* Wait for a floating button to appear on your cursor (about 2 seconds).<BR>* Click on a blank Hot Button slot.<BR><BR><EM>To remove a Hot button:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click-and-hold on the Hot Button you want to delete.<BR>* Wait for that Hot Button to float on your cursor.<BR>* Click anywhere in your front view to &quot;drop&quot; the button.<BR><BR>You can cycle through the Hot Button sets by clicking the arrows, or by
  pressing <STRONG><EM>Shift + 1</EM></STRONG> through <STRONG><EM>0</EM></STRONG>. The number of the
  currently selected bank appears between the arrows. <BR><BR>You may want to consider placing the following actions on Hot buttons: <BR><BR>* Sit/Stand<BR>* Run/Walk<BR>* Combat skills you often use (Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, etc.)<BR>* Spells you often use (any spell you've memorized)<BR>* Skills you often use (Fishing, Lay Hands, etc.)<BR>* Social actions you often use (such as &quot;/shout&quot;)
