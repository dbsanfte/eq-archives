			Before You Cast a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Prior to casting, make sure
  you're ready (especially in a combat situation): <BR><BR>* Make sure that you have the spells you plan to use memorized (remember the <STRONG><EM>Alt</EM></STRONG>  key pops up the names of the spells).<BR>* Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost
  it.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key (you never know when you'll need to hit
  something).<BR>* Make sure that you have already cast any pre-battle spells (armor or
  strength-boosting spells) that you might need.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <STRONG><EM>F8</EM></STRONG>  to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><EM>Green text</EM>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><EM>Light Blue text</EM>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><EM>Blue text</EM>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it
  won't be easy.<BR><EM>White text</EM>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you
  could win.<BR><EM>Yellow text</EM>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><EM>Red text</EM>: You'll most likely die.<BR><BR><EM>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more
  help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a
  greater challenge.</EM>
