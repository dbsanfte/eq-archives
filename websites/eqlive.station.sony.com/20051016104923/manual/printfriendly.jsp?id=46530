			8.1
			Viewing Your Inventory
		</h2>
	
	Inventory management is an
  indispensable skill. If you're a pack rat you'll constantly need to reassess what
  you're carrying and figure out what to do with the items you've accumulated. <BR><BR>You can view your inventory by clicking on the Inventory Icon. <BR><BR><EM>You can also access your inventory by hitting <STRONG>i</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>The detailed view of your inventory is divided into several sections. You can
  place specific items on different parts of your body - hands, fingers, feet,
  etc. <BR><BR>Eight general inventory slots show all items in your possession that aren't
  coins, armor or weapons you're holding (stored weapons do show up, however).
  Use these slots to store items that you aren't wearing, as well as coins and
  weapons that aren't in use. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Backpacks don't fit into your characters &quot;back&quot; inventory
  slot. They only fit into general inventory slots.</EM> <BR><BR>For certain items, you can stack more than one of that item in a single slot.
  The small number in the corner of the slot indicates how many items of that
  type are stacked. A stack can never contain more than 20 items. <BR><BR>The coin window shows how many platinum, gold, silver and copper coins you
  have (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=moneymatters">Money
  Matters</A> for details). Coins can be stacked, and there's no limit to how
  many you can carry. If you're trading with another player or
  depositing/withdrawing funds at a bank, click on a coin slot to display a
  slider. Use the slider to control how many coins you're fishing out of your
  coin purse. You can also type the number of coins you wish to pick up into
  the box provided.
