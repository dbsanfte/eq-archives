<h1>EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements!</h1>
	<B>*The chat log is posted below. Please read both the description below and the chat log for the most complete information about the new system*</B><BR><BR>
<P>You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com <BR><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting 
<LI>Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes 
<LI>Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat 
<LI>Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay</LI></UL><BR>Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! <BR><BR>Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These "Openings" will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <BR><BR><BR><I>Here's a combat example:</I><BR><BR>A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the "opening icon" and the word "Parry" next to it (this information also appears in the chat window). <BR><BR>Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills. <BR><BR>In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <BR><BR>In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round. <BR><BR><B>Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills</B> <BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool 
<LI>Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills 
<LI>Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose 
<LI>Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters 
<LI>Disciplines will be transferred to this new system 
<LI>Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer 
<LI>Disciplines will require an Endurance cost 
<LI>Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines</LI></UL>There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <BR><BR>This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <BR><BR>Talk to you in the Live Chat! <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR><BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Welcome to the chat. <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Thank you for coming. We'll be taking questions about the upcoming enhancement to melee classes. If you haven't read the outline for those changes, please visit EverQuestlive.com site (specifically - http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510) to read up on the proposed changes. Ask us anything you'd like about the new system or melee in general. If we don't have time to answer them all here, we'll be recording the chat and we'll try to answer some of the questions we don't have time for today with an update to the web site. <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Please send your questions to AVanCouvering. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: Evening everyone. I am Paul Carrico, Assistant Lead Game Designer on EverQuest. Or as others have known me, Frizznik the Gnome. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Todd Schmidt</FONT> Hello, I am Todd Schmidt, Assistant Lead Programmer on EverQuest. I am known as Hobart on Test Server. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: Hey, I'm John Troy, Game Designer on EverQuest <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Oliver Smith</FONT>: Hello everyone. I'm Oliver J. Smith, the Lead Designer of EverQuest Live &amp; Expansions. Others may remember me as Valtron. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Jamey Ryan</FONT> Hey, I am Jamey Ryan, Lead Programmer on EverQuest. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: Hi, I'm Ryan Barker game Designer for EQ, sometimes known as Rytan. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: 1300 people typing &gt; Absor reading &gt;:) <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: hang tight guys we've got one coming up <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Wilhelm_Lany</FONT>: hi. I have a three-fold of questions. 1) Can we expect any changes in terms of agro on demand; instant agro generation, without waiting for an opening.? 2) how will increasing the endurance bar work, in terms of getting higher endurance, and endurance regen? 3) how will accessing these new skills once the opening is available work? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: 1) Yes, the system we're getting allows us to create abilities that aren't tied to openings. We will be giving warriors more options for aggro generation <BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: 2) The endurance bar is based on your melee stats and level. Regen is currently based on your level <BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: 3) There will be an extra UI window to put hotkeys for the new skills, which will be accessible with keyboard shortcuts <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: we're still tuning specific values so we don't have actual numbers set in stone yet for endurance costs and regen. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT> : We are only answering questions about the melee changes and melee concerns. Please don't deluge me with other types of questions. :) <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Galidin</FONT>: How do you intend to maintain the desireability of knights in your new melee system when they allready produce far less damage then pure melee, while you fix core issues such as taunt which have been the strong suit of knights? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: There's several aspects of the melee revamp, one aspect of which is the new opening system. There's plans on addressing other specific problems with melee in addition to the new system. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: The goal is to create a balance where knights and warriors both have equal desirablity in different situations. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: We're really excited about all the new changes we're making and we're anquious to get them out on test where we can tune them and see them in action. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Coronis</FONT>: When are you anticipating these changes going live on regular servers? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Oliver Smith</FONT>: Our changes are expected to go live during the December 16th update that'll be happening next month. We also plan on introducing them to the Test Server very soon. Feel free to log on the Test Server and use /feedback to tell us what you think about our changes. We'd be happy to hear everyone's thoughts on the systems that are being created. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>CeNo65-FOH</FONT>: how will acumen zing and others spells with similar effects, pertain to the new changes? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: We're removing the old invigor type effects that restored stamina entirely for now. It's possible we'll be adding endurance regen abilties later on but for now we don't want melee to be an more dependant on getting buffs to make use of the new system. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: We decided to do that because it's really an entirely new system, and has very little to do with how the old stamina bar worked. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Hamen</FONT>: Will these Melee changes effect everyone from level the first level on? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: You will be able to take advantage of the new melee opening system when you begin recieving new combat abilities at level 20. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Illydth</FONT>: As far as openings go, will any class be able to create an opening for themselves or are openings only created by certain classes? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: You will be able to take advantage of openings that you create. Some openings will work for everyone, but there's no link between your opening and someone elses. There are no combinations or dependencies on other players. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>ScootD</FONT>: how can you acquire the new melee abilities? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: The new abilities will be acquired by taking a "skill tome" to your guild master and he'll teach you the skill. Most of the basic skill swill be available on vendors, while a few high level ones will be drops. Right now we're planning on giving almost all of the sub 60 skills on merchants and having the 60+ skills using a system similar to the parchments quests in Planes of Power. From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same methods that you already use to acquire any other type of item. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Lendaor</FONT>: are many openings going to be based on mob placement? Such as from behind the mob as aposed to being infront? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: None of the abilities currently take advantage of your position relative to the mob, so no you won't have to be behind or in front of the mob in order to take advantage of the new abilities. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Badu</FONT>: will pure melee have their current dps lowered to take into account the extra dps from this system? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: No, there will be no decrease in melee's DPS to account for the increase from the new system. We're creating the system in such a way that they'll fit in right on top of the old one. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: Good thing Absor got lasik to read all the questions flying across his screen. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Subayai</FONT>: Will disciplines be overhauled are are you simply transfering them over to this endurance system? Most melees only use 1 or 2 disciplines, because the others serve no useful purpose in their current state. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: We'll be making changes to some of the disciplines that aren't very useful, as well as giving them different timers. You will still only be able to have one discipline going at a time <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Flaash</FONT>: how long will the play have to take advantage of an opening, and how will excessive server side Lag (elemental planes) handle this ? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: We're still tuning it, but our goal is to make the strategy be in what skill you decide is best to use at the time, not in fast-reaction or twitch gameplay <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Sabrosia</FONT>: HOW will these openings be presented? for instance, will a new window open - and we click a button - will we have to issue a command? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Todd Schmidt</FONT> There will be a UI indicator that pops up when you can activate an opening. And yes, you will be clicking a button as opposed to typing in a command. Once you activate the opening, that same window will show the opening effect. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Dranix</FONT>: will jumping to negotiate obstacles or people remove from my endurance pool for combat and disciplines? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Oliver Smith</FONT>: There have been a few questions with regards to upcoming expansions and features. At this time we cannot go into detail about what's in development. However, please make sure to watch the EverQuestlive.com site for more information over the next few weeks. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: Jumping will drain a portion of your endurance yes, but it's a relatively minor amount. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Tenludar</FONT>: How will skill points be handled for warriors that have already pogressed in the game? Will a level 65 be expected to spen hours doing nothing but training to get their skills up? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: You won't need to use skill points in order to learn the new skills, they're either on or off, there's no period of bringing them up to full power so to speak. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: The only thing you need to do is give the tome to the guild master and you'll have the full skill. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Drewon-FoH</FONT>: Will there be any new AA skills that are tied to, or create, these new melee abilities? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: There will AA abilities that will effect the new system yes. We don't have a hard and fast list for it yet though. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Barney</FONT>: it was mentioned some openings are available after certain skills go off, like parry. What about classes who do not have certain ablities. Like monks for example who lack parry. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: For monks, it's based on dodge, block, and riposte. We're tuning the rate that they happen based on the skills each class has. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Todd Schmidt</FONT> In addition to these melee changes, we have made a few others separate from this. All warriors regardless of level will now mitigate a percentage of all incoming melee damage. Monk will also now be able to dodge when being hit from behind, this should aide thier pulling abilities. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Voldeth-BB</FONT>: How will the new system affect a melee's role? Clearly it will support the tanking of a warrior, but what of the monk? What will their role be? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: The melee skills aren't limited to the dps or defense of the player that uses it. There are debuffs and group affects as well. The goal with the skill sets is to provide more of a role for the pure melee during combat <BR><BR><FONT color=red>VALBARR</FONT>: it has been stated by rbarker that position wont affect the skills, but in the chat overview, it states that position can change the effectiveness of certain skills ? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: The reference to the positional aspect in the doc on the website was an error. We're not going to have skills dependant on position. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Dakkon</FONT>: how many moves are you planning to introduce? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: We're planning on over 20 skills for each class to begin with and we'll be adding even more in the future. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>KyrosKrane</FONT>: I apologize if this was asked before; I missed the first half of the chat. Assuming an extended fight (e.g., Luclin bosses), how many openings per unit time could each player of an appropriate class expect? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: We're still tuning it. We're looking at a few per fight, though. We're aiming for making each opening more important, not something that is making you hit an extra 20 keys a minute <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Avelariel</FONT>: Can we make absolutely clear, these openings are solely for warriors, rogues and monks? Unless that's not the case :) <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: Yes we're only adding the new opening system for warriors, rogues, and monks. The discipline system revamp will be for all classes that currently make use of disciplines though. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Woody_GU</FONT>: How exactly does this re-establish balance? Why does this constitute a "fix"? And not a bandaid on top of a semi-broken existing system? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: The new system is only one aspect of the melee revamp, there's several other changes in the works for them as well. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: One of the major advantages of the new system is allowing us to more easily add new abilities to the pure melee classes. <BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: There's several aspects of the existing system that are going to be adjusted, I'd keep an eye on test server if you're interested in more specifics. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: You can quote Barker in the comics Woody. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Arlos-LOS</FONT>: If openings are tuned to block/dodge/riposte, what happens if we're not tanking? This would seem to be most applicable to monks &amp; rogues. How do we activate the new abilities if we're, say, fighting a raid mob and doing DPS? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: And yes you can quote me on that, as long as you don't draw me with a bandana &gt;:) <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: There are other events that trigger openings based on your regular attacks. If you're in a situation where you aren't tanking, you'll get more of those kinds of openings. <BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: You have a chance to trigger an opening on any attack or special attack <BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: NPC's also have a chance to "fumble," creating an opening that anyone fighting it can take advantage of <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Layn</FONT>: How will the new skills affect aggro if successfully used? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: There's several new abilities planned that will effect aggro generation. Some might increase your aggro while others might lower it. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Adorae</FONT>: just fix taunt? LOL <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: Saying that taunt is the one and only issue is fairly shortsighted, I think. Pure melee have very few strategic decisions to make, don't get new abilities with an expansion the way casters do, and don't get as much from an item with both hp and mana. These are all issues that people have raised, and this system gives us a way to address them. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Razorback</FONT>: Will debuff disciplines stack, or will having more than one person using that make it a wasted use <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Ryan Barker</FONT>: It really depends on the debuff. Generally there will be enough differnt abilities you can take advantage of that you'll have several skills that will be useful even if you have several of the same class present. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>faithcrusher</FONT>: When an opening exxists, you will be offered more than one option? Like one that would be agressive in nature and one that would be defensive? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Todd Schmidt</FONT> When you are presented with an opening, you will have to make a decision on what type of ability you want to use. There will be many per opening type. And there are a few opening types. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Depen_Hoss</FONT>: Will class specific items be adjusted to add endurance, or will we need to look for new items? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Oliver Smith</FONT>: We do plan on adding endurance stats onto existing items. We plan to have this done at the same time the new system is introduced next month (Dec. 16th). <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Kilbane_luc</FONT>: Will we have to buy a new expansion to use these skills too? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: This is a free feature. It will become available to everyone! <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Illydth</FONT>: VERY important question: Since we have a chance to trigger a special attack with every attack, does it then mean that haste and dual wielding and double attacking means more "openings"? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: More attacks will help a little, but in general they scale around delay <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Thanks for all of your great questions! We only have time for a few more, but remember, we'll be looking over the logs and we'll try to answer at least some of the questions that we don't have time for today on the web site later. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Aeria</FONT>: Question, this sounds great and all and maybe I missed this point..but if the openings are part of our text..thats ok for groups but major raids where the text OFTEN becomes sluggish means we will miss the opertunity to strike...is there going to be a visual clue? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: The opening is going to display on the UI - you won't have to watch your textbox for them <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: Another thing for warriors that some of you may have noticed on test is that you will now get a return message when taunt is used, so you will know if it was effective. <BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: The taunt return message will be for everyone, not just Warriors. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Aalek</FONT>: Will the abilities have "cast" times? Can they be interrupted by the NPC? Can pure melee NPCs use the abilities against players? <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: No, skills, like bash, kick, and taunt, are instant. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: One more question and we have to go. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Bumpper-Test</FONT>: Will Taunt be increased for warriors?...Its a simple question that I know alot of warriors want to know <BR><BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: Yes, we're giving warriors skills to better gain and keep hate. <BR><FONT color=green>John Troy</FONT>: We're not changing the way Taunt itself works. We're adding a new skill that doesn't require an opening, as well as others that do, to address the issue. <BR><BR><FONT color=red>Xath</FONT>: Ohh and thanks for taking the time to chat with us guys (and gals if you have any there). The changes looks promising, and I for one at least appreciate the attention and info. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: We're hoping to do this on a more regular basis. It's a lot of fun for us, and hopefully provides some useful information. <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: That's all the time we have. We should have a transcript posted on the site tomorrow. Thank you all for stopping in! <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: We've got a lot of new stuff coming up as well. We'll keep you informed on those things as they come up. <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Check on the Live site for information. <BR><FONT color=green>Alan VanCouvering</FONT>: Thanks for stopping in. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Paul Carrico</FONT>: Thanks for stopping by everyone. Keep an eye on test for more changes, if you feel inclined you can hop onto test and use /testbuff to level your current character to level 25. <BR><BR><FONT color=green>Oliver Smith</FONT>: Thanks everyone. Have a good night!! <BR><BR>
