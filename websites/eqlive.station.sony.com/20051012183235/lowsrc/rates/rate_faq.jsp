<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG><BR><STRONG>EverQuest's Price Increase FAQ</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>What are the EverQuest subscription rates?</STRONG></P>  <P>The following are the current subscription rates for the EverQuest game
  service . Please take note that the prices are discounted for multi-month
  plans.</P>  <P>New EverQuest rates as of&nbsp; June
  12<SUP>th</SUP>, 2005.</P>  <UL>   <LI>$14.99 per Month</LI>   <LI>$41.97 for 3 Months</LI>   <LI>$77.94 for 6 Months</LI>   <LI>$143.88 for 12
       Months&nbsp; </LI>   <LI>$199.95 for 24
       Months&nbsp; </LI>   <LI>EverQuest is part of
       the <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/stationaccess/">Station Access</A></STRONG> - $21.99
       per month</LI>  </UL>  <P>All pricing plans are recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at
  the appropriate interval, until you cancel your subscription. Note that
  purchasers of the full game will receive their free month of game play after
  supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during
  the free month, no charges will be made to your credit card.</P>  <P>New York State  and Texas  residents will be charged sales tax.</P>  <P>Additionally, residents of EU countries will be charged VAT equal to 17.5%
  of the subscription fees listed above.</P>  <P>All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the
  heading &quot;SOE*EverQuest&quot;. If the card is MasterCard, Visa, Discover,
  or JBC, <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/stationaccess/">Station Access</A></STRONG> charges will
  appear on your credit card will show as &quot;SOE*Station Access&quot;. If
  the card is Amex, it will show as &quot;SOE Station Access&quot;.</P>  <P>Please note:</P>  <P>The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will
  need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the <A HREF="http://store.station.sony.com/">Station Store</A>. The price of the
  game will vary depending upon the store.<STRONG>Can you explain what
  &quot;recurring&quot; charges are?</STRONG></P>  <P>All pricing plans&nbsp;are now&nbsp;recurring, meaning you have been and
  will continue to be billed at the appropriate subscription rate interval,
  until you cancel your subscription.</P>  <P><STRONG>What are the new EverQuest subscription rates?<BR></STRONG>The new monthly subscription rate will be US$14.99. The new 3-month
  subscription rate will be $41.97, the new 6-month subscription rate will now
  be $77.94 and the new 12-month subscription rate will now be $143.88.&nbsp; The 24-month subscription will
  continue to be $199.95.&nbsp; We
  continue to offer discounts in the new rate plan for multi-month
  subscriptions and encourage you to take advantage of this money saving
  option.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>When will the
  subscription rate change?</STRONG> <BR>The new subscription rate will take effect June 12, 2005.</P>  <P><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>Why was the
  subscription rate increased?<BR></STRONG>Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will
  be increasing our subscription rates in June. While this announcement may be
  unpleasant, the cost of operating a top tier MMO has increased significantly
  over the past three years and this change will help us achieve our goal of
  seeing that every player has a consistently enjoyable experience in the world
  of EverQuest. <BR><BR>EverQuest continues to be a great entertainment value &#8211; even at
  $14.99.&nbsp; No other game offers the
  kind of detailed gameplay and tight-knit community that EverQuest
  offers.&nbsp; The monthly subscription fee allows us to provide the best possible
  gaming experience while also expanding the world of Norrath.&nbsp; The EverQuest team is dedicated to providing
  fresh and dynamic content to the players with in-game events, quests, zone
  re-vamps, game enhancements and great new expansion packs.<BR><BR><STRONG>Are there any discounts for current
  EverQuest subscribers?&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></STRONG>In order to thank the EverQuest community, players can take advantage of
  a 6 or 12 month limited time promotional offer.&nbsp; Between May 12, 2005 and June 11, 2005, you can take advantage of a 6
  or 12 month limited time promotional subscription and reap great savings.&nbsp; </P>  <UL>   <LI>For a limited time, a 6-month subscription costs
       only US$69.99 -- that works out to $11.67 a month, a 10% discount off of
       the new monthly plan.</LI>   <LI>Even better, for a limited time a 12-month
       subscription costs only US$99.99 &#8211; that works out to $8.33 a month,
       a 31% savings off of the new monthly plan.</LI>  </UL>  <P>If you take advantage of this
  offer, you will be billed immediately, and your current subscription will
  automatically convert to the number of months of the subscription plan you
  elect. All prepaid but unused amounts for any EverQuest account that is
  converted to the 6 or 12 month limited time promotional subscription plan
  will be, at the time SOE converts the account, converted to days at the 6 or
  12-month subscription plan rate (as applicable), and the first subscription
  period for that account will be extended by the applicable number of days.
  Any account converted to the special 6 or 12 month promotional subscription
  plan during any no-charge subscription period will be immediately converted,
  and the remainder of such no-charge period(s) will be waived.<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>What do I have to
  do now that the subscription rates have changed?<BR></STRONG>You don&#8217;t have to do a thing.&nbsp;
  When your current subscription plan expires, you will automatically be
  migrated to the new subscription structure based on your current subscription
  plan. The only thing that will change is the rate.<BR><BR><STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>What if my renewal date does not fall between May 12th and June 11th?
  Can I still take advantage of the limited time promotional 6 and 12 month
  options?<BR></STRONG>Yes, you may. &nbsp;To take
  advantage, follow these simple steps between the dates of May 12th and June 11<SUP>th</SUP>, 2005:</P>  <UL>   <LI>Launch the EverQuest Game and go to the Login
       screen. Click the&#8221; Account&#8221; button and then click
       &#8220;Change Account.&#8221;</LI>   <LI>Enter your Station Name and password, and then
       click &#8220;Edit Billing.&#8221;</LI>   <LI>Next you will see the EverQuest Subscription page
       on the left and the EverQuest Legends access page on the right. Choose
       the EverQuest Subscription page and then checkmark either the 6 month or
       12 month option that you wish to take advantage of.</LI>  </UL>  <P>If you take advantage of this
  offer, you will be billed immediately, and your subscription will
  automatically convert to the number of months of the subscription plan you
  elect.&nbsp;&nbsp; All prepaid but
  unused amounts for any EverQuest account that is converted to the 6 or 12
  month limited time promotional subscription plan will be, at the time SOE
  converts the account, converted to days at the 6 or 12-month subscription
  plan rate (as applicable), and the first subscription period for that account
  will be extended by the applicable number of days. Any account converted to
  the special 6 or 12 month promotional subscription plan during any no-charge
  subscription period will be immediately converted, and the remainder of such
  no-charge period(s) will be waived. </P>  <P><STRONG>Can you explain
  what &#8220;recurring&#8221; charges are?<BR></STRONG>EverQuest subscriptions are and have always been recurring, meaning you
  have been and will continue to be billed at the appropriate subscription rate
  interval, until you affirmatively cancel your subscription.</P>  <P><STRONG>Ok, how does all this really work?<BR></STRONG>The current subscription rates are in effect for all signups and/or
  renewals that occur on or prior to June 11, 2005; the new subscription rates
  are in effect for all signups and/or renewals that occur on and after June
  12, 2005.&nbsp; Some examples:<STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  My current 3 month recurring subscription
  happens to expire/renew on May 20<SUP>th</SUP>.</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If you do nothing, it will renew at the
  current rate and your rate will not be increased until the subscription
  renews again (on August 20).</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If on May 20th you elect the special 6 month
  promotional offer, you will be immediately billed on that date and your
  subscription will then become a &#8220;6 month recurring subscription&#8221;
  as of that date.</P>  <P>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  My current 3 month recurring subscription
  happens to expire/renew on June 12<SUP>th</SUP>.</P>  <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If you do nothing, it will renew on June 12<SUP>th</SUP>  at the new rates.</P>  <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If on May 20th you elect the special 6 month
  promotional offer, you will be immediately billed on that date, your
  subscription will then become a &#8220;6 month recurring subscription&#8221;
  as of that date and all prepaid but unused amounts for your current 3 month
  recurring subscription will be, at the time SOE converts the account,
  converted to days at the 6 month subscription plan rate, and the first
  subscription period for your account will be extended by the applicable
  number of days.</P>  <P>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I have a monthly recurring subscription.</P>  <P>If you do nothing, the first renewal that occurs on
  and after June 12<SUP>th</SUP>, 2005 will be at the new monthly rate.</P>  <P><STRONG>Does this affect the Legends service or SOE Station
  Access&#8482; subscriptions?<BR></STRONG>No.<BR><BR></P>  <P><STRONG>Will I still
  receive my 30 days of game-play included with purchase of some of the retail
  package versions of EverQuest at no additional charge if I purchase and
  register a New Game?</STRONG> <BR>Purchasers of the full version of EverQuest will receive 30 days of game-play
  at no additional charge (subject to certain restrictions) after supplying
  valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the free
  month, no charges will be made to your credit card. </P>  <P><BR><STRONG>Will I be charged sales tax or
  Value-Added Tax on your subscription rates?<BR></STRONG>You will be charged sales tax or value-added tax, as applicable, if you
  live in states that require sales tax or if you live in European Union
  countries or territories. <BR><BR><STRONG>How will my
  charge appear on my credit card statement?<BR></STRONG>All subscription fees will appear on
  your credit card statement under the heading &quot;SOE*EverQuest&quot;. <BR><BR><STRONG>Is there a website with more
  information about the EverQuest pricing changes?<BR></STRONG>For more information, please visit <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/rates">www.everquest.com/rates</A></P>
