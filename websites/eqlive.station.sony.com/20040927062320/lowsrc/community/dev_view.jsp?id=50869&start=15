The difference is our version includes 1) a new user guide, 2) larger figures, and 3) US "code" (i.e. our installer, additional games - Cosmic Rift, etc, movie trailers (Knights tale, Final Fantasy, etc.).<P>Alan<BR>

Lead miniatures while kind of cool and reminscent of playing D&D, are not action figures.<P>2.  I already have two accounts....<BR>      Account  A  --- Complete Ruins and Velious installed.<BR>      Account B  ---  Original Everquest<P>     Question   :   I want to upgrade my Account B to use Ruins and Velious.....  And set up a Account C just the original edition for my daughter.    What is the easiest way to do this?  Note my main character is on Account B and my wife's is on Account A.<P>Thundyrkrush on Vazaelle</B><P>Actually, the copy says EverQuest figurines.  I didn't see the word 'action' in there anyplace.  But, despite not being action figures, they are very cool.<P><I>Edited:  It seems that it did indeed say "action" figures, but some smart editor caught it and fixed it before I noticed.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></I><P>The CD code for the product can only be used once.  So if you use it to upgrade your Account B then you've used it up.  You can pick up a copy of the original game from our web site for only $9.99, and that comes with a free month, so the game only costs a penny (plus shipping    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> ) if you take into account the cost of a month's play.<P>Alan<P><BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]
