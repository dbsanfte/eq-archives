			6.1
			Sitting and Camping
		</h2>
	
	The sit and camp buttons are
  located on the Main Tab of the Actions Window.<BR><BR>Whenever you're resting, you should sit down. This allows your character to
  recover more quickly than standing or walking. <BR><BR><EM>To sit:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click the <STRONG>Sit</STRONG> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> and type <EM>/sit</EM> into the chat bar, then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>  again to have your character sit <BR><BR>Camp when you're ready to exit the game. This process takes about 30 seconds.
  Your character must first sit before he can camp. When you return to the game
  later your character will be where you left him and in the same condition (if
  he was wounded, he'll still be wounded). Keep that in mind when choosing your
  campsite (choose a safe place). <BR><BR>To Camp: <BR><BR>* Click the <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> button on interface, or<BR>* Hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> and type <EM>/camp</EM> into the chat bar, then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>  again to have your character camp <BR><BR><EM>Jargon Note: If you hear other players talking about &quot;camping&quot;,
  they may not be referring to leaving the game. Some players linger
  (&quot;camp&quot;) around an NPC's regeneration point (where they return
  after dying) in order to attack the newly returned monster.</EM>
