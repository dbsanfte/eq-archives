			What If Your Character Dies?
		</h2>
	
	If you've worked long and
  hard, don't worry. Dying won't strip you of your possessions or coins - as
  long as your body is recoverable (for example, don't drown at the bottom of
  an aqueduct - it may be a difficult task to find that exact spot and
  resurface without dying again). <BR><BR>If your character dies he will 'respawn' at his 'bind point', which for new
  characters is just outside their starting city. Characters under level 10
  will respawn with all of their items and can continue their adventures right
  away. But once a character reaches 10th level he will begin to leave a corpse
  on the ground at the location of his demise. In order to recover the
  character's items, you will need to find that corpse. <BR><BR>To reclaim what's rightfully yours, locate your body, right-click on it, and
  put the items into your inventory (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=pickingup">Picking
  Up/Dropping/Destroying Items</A>).
