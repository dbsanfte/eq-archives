	 <p><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64050">Read</a> the letter to the EverQuest community from SOE President John Smedley.</p> <p>Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will be increasing our subscription rates in June. Effective June 12, 2005, the new monthly subscription rate will be $14.99/month. While this announcement may be unpleasant, the cost of operating a top tier MMO has increased significantly over the past three years and this change will help us achieve our goal of seeing that every player has a consistently enjoyable experience in the world of EverQuest. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $41.97, a 6-month subscription will now be $77.94 and a 12-month subscription will now be $143.88. The 24-month subscription will continue to be $199.95. You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires. Subscription rates are subject to tax and value-added taxes, as applicable. These price increases will not affect the SOE Station Access&#153; subscription rate. </p><p> New EverQuest rates as of June 12, 2005: </p><ul> <li>$14.99 per Month <li> $41.97 for 3 Months <li> $77.94 for 6 Months <li> $143.88 for 12 Months <li> $199.95 for 24 Months</li></ul><br> Additionally we'd like to thank our current EverQuest players by offering a 6 and 12-month limited time promotional offer. For a limited time only, you can take advantage of 6 or 12-month promotional subscriptions and reap great savings. Between May 12th and June 11th, 2005, we're offering a special discount on the new monthly subscription price: <ul> <li><b>A 6-month subscription costs only US$69.99 - that's a 10% discount off of the new monthly plan.</b><br> <li>Even better, a 12-month subscription costs US$99.99 - a 31% discount off of the new monthly rates.</li></ul> And for those customers subscribing to other great SOE games this is also an excellent time to become Station Access Members. The Station Access subscription provides an easy gateway for SOE fans to a variety of SOE titles for $21.99 a month. The Station Access subscription is good for <i>EverQuest</i>, <i>PlanetSide</i>, <i>EverQuest Online Adventures</i>, <i>EverQuest II</i>, <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i> and the Station Pass games. </p><p> EverQuest subscriptions are recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at the appropriate interval, until you affirmatively cancel your subscription. Note that purchasers of the full game will receive 30 days of game-play included with the purchase at no additional charge (subject to certain restrictions) after supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the period of 30 days of game-play included with purchase, no charges will be made to your credit card. </p><p> Subscriptions are subject to tax and value-added tax, as applicable. </p><p> All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the heading "SOE*EverQuest". </p><p> Please note: </p><p> The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the Station Store (http://store.station.sony.com). The price of the game will vary depending upon the store.</p>
