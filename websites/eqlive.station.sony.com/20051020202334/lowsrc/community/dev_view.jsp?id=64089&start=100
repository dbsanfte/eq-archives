<h1>Halfling Hodgepodge RiffRaff &#8211; Part 4</h1>
	<P>Welcome to the first edition of Halfling Hodgepodge
  RiffRaff, THE place to get to know your fellow EQ Community members
  better!&nbsp; If you would like to participate
  watch the <A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq">EQLive Forums</A> for
  information about this feature every month.</P>  <P><STRONG>Obsqura</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> October, 2000.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> 2 Desktop
  Computers.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Wood Elf,
  Female Ranger, even though I am a male in real life. I made only males after
  that, since my brother told me to make a female, only because when they beg,
  they get more money.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes, although I still play a first-person
  shooter game, named Counter Strike.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> I play two characters at once on two
  computers. 70 druid with 750 AA's and a 70 magician with 150 AA's.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Group, but I sometimes solo Wall of
  Slaughter named. </P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I chose a druid. I like the druid, since they can cast decent direct
  damage spells or heal in a group. Even if they can't find a group, I can
  manage to solo in places such as the Wall of Slaughter, the Ruined City of
  Dranik, or the Plane of Fire. </P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes, Raging Fury, on Antonius Bayle.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 3. My 70
  druid, my 70 magician, and a 39 Beastlord.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Karana, but I prefer Cazic-Thule for my
  druid. =p</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Bard, Berserker, Shadow Knight.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 238,000 platinum, on a Gold Ticket from
  the casinos.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Velious, since I started raiding there,
  first.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Cabilis, since my druid is liked in about
  half the zone, but raid zone is probably the Temple of Veeshan.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Vishimtar the Fallen, since it is one of
  the hardest encounters. </P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Lost Dungeons of Norrath. It did introduce
  augments, but there was no worthwhile raiding content.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> The Nexus. It is too small, and it was the
  beginning of the teleportation things that all players could use. So
  basically druids and wizards started to be less useful.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Zun`Muram Mordl Delt, but only because it
  is an annoying encounter.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> I have so-called &quot;toys&quot; such as
  the Tri-Plated Golden Hackle Hammer, but my most prized possession(s) is my
  iksar illusion potions. I try to be an iksar in every aspect. I only have
  about 88 charges left of my potions. Also, I keep old gear from previous
  expansions, until I run out of bank space, then unfortunatley, I have to
  delete some. Every piece of equipment I have has a story behind it, and there
  are great memories. </P>  <P><STRONG>Parks_Hyperlight</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> 3/15/02</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Dial-up</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Halfling
  Ranger</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 55</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Equal preference (depends; group if with
  fiends or guildies, solo if only pick-up groups available)</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> The ability to track.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 8</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Berserker, Druid, Beastlord</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever

  keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> No</P>  <P><STRONG>Pizzicato</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> Well I started playing towards the end of
  2001 but didn't create Pizzicato until March 2002</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop
  computer...not uber but does the job</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> I play on a 512KB cable connection</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Barbarion
  Warrior</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes and it will probably be the last
  because I get far too addicted sometimes :P</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> Level 70 with 217 aa's currently</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Group, it&#8217;s very rarely I solo</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I love everything about being a Bard :) I like the fact I can mez,
  charm (limited now I know but it was superb in the 50's LDoN's), slow, haste
  a multitude of other things and pulling is great fun when you make people go
  'WOW!'</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes I am a member of &lt;Old Continent&gt;
  which has many people I have known over the years and is a wonderful bunch of
  nutters :)</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> I have my
  Bard, a 58 beserker who was an experiment when they went live and a bunch of
  sub 30 chars who I never play and probably never will lol</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Yes he worships Tunare, and no he has
  never killed Tunare either. He even paid homage to her graceful beauty as he
  waved goodbye to her on Xev only to meet her re-incarnation on Druzzil Ro</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I have never played a Ranger, Rogue, Monk,
  Paladin or Shadowknight</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> That would probably be the ingredients for
  the improved dodge 3 aug I have, think it cost me about 100k in total</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> That&#8217;s a very difficult question to
  answer as I love most of the expansions but for different reasons. I have a
  lot of nostalgia for the 'old world' expansions, quests and lore while LDoN
  was great for grouping and PoP brought about many changes in raiding. I
  didn't have much experience with GoD until more recently when I joined all my
  friends in my current guild but I am having a blast and loving it. OoW
  brought us the second half of the GoD expansion which I am enjoying
  immensely.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> That&#8217;s an easy one :) Blackburrow
  all the way!</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> I would have to say the corpse summoners
  in the guild</P>  <P>lobby lol</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> The only expansions I haven&#8217;t been
  so keen on were LoY which apart from the ability to use in-game maps and the
  one song I bothered to get there has had absolutely no use for me whatsoever
  and DoN which is in all truthfulness a great expansion but for some reason
  that escapes me I don't like it... I know it&#8217;s a perfectly great
  expansion with many features and so on but I just can't get into it for some
  reason.../shrug</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Temple of Ssraezsha easily. I fought there
  and raided there for probably 2 years. It took me over 100 hours to get my
  emp key alone (my luck sucks in that zone) and have killed so many rhags and
  arch liches my housemate might have got worried for his pet snakes safety...</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> A Jester of Bristlebane</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> Unfortunately no...</P>  <P><STRONG>RaolinX</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> Late summer of 2001 Right after I was
  finally able to get DSL</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> 2001 Era PC no
  hardware upgrades.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> As mentioned Dial Up</P>  <P>What was the race
  and class of your very first character? Barbarian Warior (is now in mule
  status)</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 55</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Group then solo (been leading Ldon's
  basically for group Leadership. And I can ALWAYS find a group to do these.
  Usually less than 15 minutes.)</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> As a bard I injoy the flexibility and the speed. Running slow sucks</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 1 main 3
  mules (casual player FYI.)</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Bristlebane</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> All but bard really. The mules
  aren&#8217;t even level 10</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 65k for the lute of the howler besides
  that Im cheap nothing over 5k</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Velious (only have the first 7 though.
  Should grab DoN one of these days. Seems cool.)</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Great Divide</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Hmmm Gotta be The Jester. He doesn&#8217;t
  just sit there. More npc's need to talk. I like the Fisherman in Abysmal as
  well.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> This one is hard, as each expansion does
  improve the game. </P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Any underground where I can&#8217;t use
  Selos</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> hehe Right now Its Maligar's Enraged
  Doppleganger. But will always go back to Fippy.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> Probably The Mask Of deception, hHaven't used it in
  ages.&nbsp; I keep it Because my toon
  is a Bard and I like Illusion items.</P>  <P><STRONG>Raxtull</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> December 12, 2000</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My very
  first character that I made was a Human Warrior that I used for the sole
  purpose of learning the controls.&nbsp;
  My first actual play character was my Halfling Druid.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> Gwaelin, my 61 Dark Elf Magician</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Grouping with my friends.&nbsp; Pick-up groups are like playing
  Russian Roulette with 5 of the chambers loaded and soloing is boring (not to
  mention being impossible for any class that's not a pure caster, at least for
  experience).</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> My Magician can do some good damage and my Shadow Knight can
  actually take a few hits without eating dirt (at least in pre-PoP content).</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> No.&nbsp;
  I was always guilded with friends, but since all of them have quit I
  haven't bothered with looking for another guild.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server</EM>? I have one of
  each class, but I generally play my Mage and Shadow Knight.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Yes, whenever I have the choice.</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I've played them all to some extent, so
  I'll just list how far I've gotten each:&nbsp;
  Magician (61), Necromancer (60), Rogue (59), Shadow Knight (57),
  Warrior (57), Enchanter (54), Druid (53), Shaman (53), Monk (51), Wizard
  (51), Bard (31), Beastlord (24), Cleric (24), Paladin (13), Ranger (13),
  Berserker (5).</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 50k for a Crown of Elemental Mastery for
  my Mage.&nbsp; Usually, they're being
  sold for 100k+ and I have no means of camping (or even getting to) 7th isle
  of Sky, so I had to buy it when I found it cheap enough that I could afford.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> LDoN could have been, if the devs had
  given it more attention than just dumping it on us and forgetting about
  it.&nbsp; So, Kunark would be my
  favorite expansion, since it had content made for ALL levels of the game, by
  far the best dungeons in the game, and most importantly: Iksar.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Crypt of Dalnir.&nbsp; So many people were scared to death of
  that zone for some reason, but I've had some of my most fun times in
  there.&nbsp; I still level my
  characters through it.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Grandmaster Glox.&nbsp; Most powerful of all Iksar, and the
  first Iksar I saw in Cabilis.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Planes of Power.&nbsp; Itemization began its meteoric rise
  into ridiculousness, adventure was completely removed from the game in order
  to make everything more convenient, mobs became way too overpowered, and raid
  content became the only thing the devs worked on.&nbsp; The adventure is no more, bring on the
  ph4t l3wts.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Powerlevel... err... I mean Paludal
  Caverns.&nbsp; I've seen the worst
  attitudes being displayed there, so I avoid it entirely now.&nbsp; But then, the quality of the community
  has gone down the toilet over the years, so it doesn't really surprise me.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Raster and Quillmane.&nbsp; I spent 50 hours camping Raster before
  I gave up.&nbsp; Quillmane has spawned
  for me only 4 times in the 80+ hours I've spent camping it, and still has not
  dropped the damn Cloak.&nbsp; If it
  wasn't the last piece for my Mage's epic, I would have given up on it long
  ago.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> I would say an epic, if I could ever manage to get one for
  one of my characters.&nbsp; I can never
  seem to get the last item or two.&nbsp;
  But I do have a full set of Crescent armor and a pair of Fighting
  Batons in my Monk's bank, because that was THE Monk equipment back in the
  day.</P>
