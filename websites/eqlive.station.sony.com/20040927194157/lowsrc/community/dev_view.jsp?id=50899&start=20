<h1>Melee Changes clarifications</h1>
	Obviously there have been plenty of questions regarding the changes to melee and magic post 50 that we introduced with the last patch.  The man with his hands on the pulse of the melee changes is Rich Waters.  He was instrumental in figuring out what needed to be done and implementing the needed changes, so it's probably best that he be the one to answer questions about those changes.<P><B>Hi there !<P>Just a quick question:<P>When i saw the changes, i was very happy to see that my Shadow Knight could more damage at last........But now after playing and reading your reply's to some questions, i notice a flaw in it.....You stated that 2H weapons dmg is increased AFTER 51...But in your comment, that SK and Paladins will move to the same dmg table as the Warrior, you didn't make your self clear if this is from level 1 or level 51.....Fighting a blue con Mob yesterday after the patch made no difference for me....At 43 i still miss most of the time and thats the reason i quit playing my SK.....NOW i read that these table changes are in effect after level 51 ????<P>I think a lott of SK and Paladins will be disappointed in this...</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Before level 51, paladins, shadowknights, and bards are all on the same damage table as warriors, and always have been.  This patch, we changed it so that they remain on the same table all the way up to level 60.  Just to make sure this is clear, here is a list of classes-<P>Pre-level 51 there are two damage tables, the "standard table" and the "high damage table"<BR><B>1-50 Standard Table</B> - Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, Bard<BR><B>1-50 High Damage Table</B> - Monk<P>Before this patch when characters hit level 51, some of them would move to a higher table.  This is how things were prior to this latest melee patch.<BR><B>51+ Standard Table</B> - Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<BR><B>51+ High Damage Table</B> - Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Ranger<P>With this patch, we added two new totally new damage tables, and moved classes around a bit.  Here is how things are on live servers right now-<BR><B>51+ Standard Table</B> - No one.<BR><B>51+ High Damage Table</B> - Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard<BR><B>55+ Monk Table</B> - Monk<BR><B>60+ Monk Table</B> - Monk<P>Also, please note that damage tables are not always a big damage increase.  Moving from the standard table to the high damage table is a fairly large increase, but moving from the high damage table to the 55+ monk table is only a small increase.<P>Another important thing to know about damage tables is this - they only affect the amount of damage you do.  Damage tables do not affect the chance to hit or miss a monster, your weapon skills, or anything except the amount of damage you do.  Damage tables specifically affect your average damage per hit and how high your hardest hits can be.<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Ummm, So basicly what it said is that SK and Paladins move to the warrion table from level 1 on. It doesn't say anything about from level 51 ? And isn't it a bit strange that before level 51 i do only 50% of a warrior's damage ? Why don't give us BEFORE level 51 the same damage table ? That would balance the SK and Paladins for real.....even at 43 a warrior is always picked before a SK and a paladin (beter yet a Paladin is picked BEFORE a SK always since the can heal !)<P>There would be nothing unbalacing to this if SK and Paladins would be at 75% damage from level 1 upward to level 60 ? Can you at least think about this ?<P>Gravel Blacksoul,<BR>Human Knight of Bertoxxulous.</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>The reason that these changes all took place from level 51 and up, is because we feel that the game and classes are well balanced from levels 1-50 and have been for a long time now.  From level 1-50, knight classes do the right amount of damage and have an appropriate amount of other skills and abilities to balance them out against other classes.  Even in the low 50s, the classes stay relatively balanced.  It's only as they pass 55th level that things were getting unbalanced, so that is where we targeted our changes.  <P>Also, saying a shadowknight only does half as much damage as a warrior pre-50 is not very accurate.  If you compare a shadowknight and a warrior with similar quality gear in those levels, you will find it's much closer than that - even before you include your pet and the spell damage you can do.  Shadowknights have always been a very viable class, and now don't suffer from a lack of melee damage at the highest levels.<P>One of our main goals with this patch was to bring melee classes at 60th level back to the relative balance they had at level 50.  I think we've done this, and that you will find the results quite balanced once you have some time to get used to things again.<P>- Rich Waters<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>Thanks Rich.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

I have a little more information for you:<P><B>I believe you guys did a great job with the upgrading, however I do feel you fell short in one spot. Paladin and Shadow Knight epics seem to have been effectivly killed in this patch.<P>I play a shadow knight I have my epic and personally I felt sick to my stomach. <P>Innoruuk's curse is possibly one of the most long involved epics you can do, based on rare drops of rare spawns and visits to all three planes. <P>I can understand not changing the epic prowess of Rogue/Ranger etc epics due to the damage they dealt with dual wield. However, because of the old combat system the shadow knight and paladin epics fell far behind the others in "epic" status. Now with the new upgraded 2handers and 1handers most of the sentiment I am feeling from my community is. "Why bother?" "Why did I even bother my EPIC weapon is now a decoration." <P>Truely I feel an epic weapon should take back seat to drops in zones such as Temple of Veeshan or Sleeper's tomb, but I feel a small upgrade to the epics themselves would make them desirable again, they are epic aren't they?</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Far from killing the effectiveness of knight epics, we actually improved the damage they do by a large amount. This seems to be a common misconception with the new melee patch, and one that's important to clear up.  This question is really more about the quality of two-handed weapons than it is about paladins and shadowknights, but it's important since they have two-handed epics.  <P>When we decided to upgrade two-handed weapons, we looked at both the formula we were using to calculate damage, and also the two-handed weapons available to players.  When we looked at epics in particular, we took the amount of damage a warrior would do if he was dual wielding his epic sword pair.  Our research showed that this was a good, balanced amount of damage for an epic weapon, so we used it as a basis for comparing the other epics. <P>We applied this information to tune our two-handed damage formula, until we were happy with the amount of damage a shadowknight or a paladin was doing with his epic, when compared to the dual epic wielding warrior.  The result was an increase in damage done with the knight epics, without needing to change the damage/delay stats on them.  You should see that you are doing significantly more damage now with your two-handed epic than you were before the patch, and this increases the closer you get to level 60.  Epics did not need their damage/delay stats changed, because they are doing appropriate damage with just the new two-handed damage formula we implemented.<P>You've probably read by now that a few very powerful two-handed weapons had their damage/delay stats improved this patch.  The reason for this is pretty simple: post-epic quality one-handed weapons were available that had much better damage/delay stats than epic weapons, but the two-handed weapons available after epics did not improve much.  For example, if we made a one-handed sword that did 20% more damage than a warrior epic, we should include two-handed swords that do 20% more damage than a SK epic to keep things balanced.  So, some of the very rare and powerful two-handed weapons in the game got a boost in stats, to put them on par with the one-handed weapons available in the same areas. <P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Also I'm curious as to how this Damage Bonus system works.<BR>Paladin epic has 40 delay w/ 23 damage bonus <BR>Innoruuk's Cuse has 45 delay w/ 24 damage bonus <BR>Nature's Defender is 46 delay w/ 29 damage bonus <BR>what am I missing here?<P>Anyways thanks for the upgrades even if you don't boost epic prowess I feel you did a good job.<P>Zerous</B><P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>I'll go over damage bonuses more fully in another post, but here's the answer to this question.  Damage bonuses are based on the delay of the weapon and the level of the person using it.  The damage bonuses you listed were not all from the same level character.  At level 60, those weapons actually have these damage bonuses listed on them-<P>Fiery Defender (40 delay) 23 point damage bonus<BR>Innoruuk's Curse (45 delay) 27 point damage bonus<BR>Nature's Defender (46 delay) 29 point damage bonus<P>You can see that weapons with larger delays also gain larger damage bonuses.<P>- Rich Waters<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks for your questions Zerous, and thanks for the answers Rich.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

Once again I have some information to pass on that we hope will clarify the melee changes.<P><BR><B>The new guy answering questions did not actually answer Samin Soulsaver's question. Please, we want to know..HOW does the damage bonus work? Does it change the actual damage/delay of the weapon, say from 20/30 a bonus of 7 would change the weapon to 27/30, or does it just add 7 dmg to each successful hit?<P>Obsession Toujours</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>I've seen this question several times now and don't want to leave people wondering how to use this new piece of information, so here is how the damage bonus works in the game:<P><B><I>What are Damage Bonuses?</B></I><P>Damage bonuses are an amount of extra damage points that are applied when a character hits something with his weapon.  A damage bonus does not change the damage/delay stats of your weapon, or make you hit more often.<P>- <B>Main Hand Bonus</B> - All melee characters get a main hand damage bonus.  This bonus starts at level 29 and slowly scales up until level 60.  The main hand bonus applies to hits with the main hand weapon only.  This bonus doesn't vary by weapon, only by class and level. <P>- <B>High Damage Bonus</B> - If you are using a weapon with a high damage stat, you gain bonus damage.<P>- <B>Two-Handed Bonus</B> - If you use a two-handed weapon, you get an additional amount of bonus damage.  <I>This bonus is the one you see listed on two-handed weapons</I>.  This bonus varies depending on your class, level, and the delay of the weapon being used.  Slower weapons get larger damage bonuses, than fast weapons do.  All two-handed weapons of a given delay receive the same damage bonus, for example a level 60 warrior with a 40 delay two-handed sword gets a damage bonus of 23, as listed on the weapon.<P><B><I>How are Damage Bonuses applied?</B></I><P>Every time you get a successful hit with a weapon, the game engine determines the amount of damage you do.  This damage is in a range, based on your stats, skills, the damage value of your weapon, and the opponent you are fighting.  This is your <I>hit damage</I>.<P>- If you are using a one-handed weapon, you get the main hand damage bonus described above, plus the high damage bonus.  This is added to your hit damage every time you hit with the main hand. <BR>(<I>main hand bonus + high damage bonus + hit damage = amount of damage done</I>)<P>- If you are using a two-handed weapon, you get the main hand damage bonus, plus the high damage bonus, plus the two-handed damage bonus listed on the weapon.  This is added to your hit damage every time you hit with the main hand. <BR>(<I>main hand bonus + high damage bonus + two-handed damage bonus + hit damage = amount of damage done</I>)<P>I hope this clears things up a bit.<P>- Rich Waters<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Makes it clearer for me, and I'm pretty slow on the uptake.  Thanks.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>The two handed weapons improvements introduced yesterday actually REDUCE the damage done with 2H weapons for lower level characters. Please hear me out.<P>Way back when, 1H and 2H weapons had the same damage-modifier applied on every swing. The amount of this modifier went up from level 20 on. Later, this number was doubled for 2H weapons since they are much slower. Also, longer-delay weapons were given an additional damage bonus at some point in the future.<P>The easiest way to see what the added damage is for a swing is to look at critical hits on a warrior (or paladin using holyforge). "Soandso scores a critical hit (100)." Would be followed by Soandso slashes MOB for 111. The difference was the added bonus. The 1H bonus at 60 was(is)11. This number had previously been doubled for 2H weapons + whatever delay bonus the weapon had if it were slower than delay 40.<P>It now appears that 2H weapons no longer get double the 1H bonus + the listed delay. The new formula appears to be the 1H bonus + the weapon's new dmg modifier. That's fine if the modifier is larger than the 1H bonus.<P>However, for lower-level characters, that is not necessarily the case (especially for faster weapons). For them, 2 times the 1H bonus would have been larger than the 1H bonus plus the new (low-level) damage modifier.<P>My primary character is a paladin and I appreciate the changes made to 2-hand weapon damage. However, I do not think you intended to have a negative impact on 2H weapons at lower levels.<P>Harlan<BR>Zebuxoruk</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>This is definitely not the case.  I brought this to the attention of Hobart, who checked back over the two-handed damage code and examined all changes to it in the last three months.  There were no negative changes at all to the two-handed damage of players, regardless of level.  The two-handed damage enhancement this patch is all in addition to the previous two-handed damage bonuses.  The damage bonus displayed on all two-handers now is the combination of the old 2h bonus PLUS the new 2h bonus.  We were very careful when we implemented this enhancement, and equally careful when we checked out this issue today.  In every case we checked, two-handed damage was either the same as it was pre-patch, or increased at the higher levels.<P>- Rich Waters<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks again Rich!<P>Alan<BR>
