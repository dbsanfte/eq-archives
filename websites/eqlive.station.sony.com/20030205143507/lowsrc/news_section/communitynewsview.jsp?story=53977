	<h2>Bristlebane holds Danielas' Royal Rumble</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Bristlebane<br>
	02/03/2003 11:30 am<br>
	<P>Senior Guide Elindill of the Bristlebane server sent in the folowing recap of Danielas' Royal Rumble recently held on that server.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A Royal Rumble was held on Bristlebane in honor of Senior Guide Danielas' 3 year anniversary in the Guide Program.&nbsp; A great time was had by all and several of the contestants were seen to be a bit happy consuming Valtron's Finest.&nbsp; It is reported that Oryane downed at least 50 Valtron's.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Rumble was a high spirited event that came down to three contestants.&nbsp; Zaypp, Silvahnus, and Soulgrass.&nbsp; These three did do battle for a good 10 mins before Zaypp finally fell.&nbsp; Soulgrass attempted to kite Silvahnus but stepped off the tiles for just a moment and was disqualified.&nbsp; His protest was duly noted. :)&nbsp; Silvahnus left the event 2538 plat richer than when he arrived.&nbsp; </P>
