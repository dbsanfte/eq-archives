			29.3
			Appendix D - Titles
		</h2>
	
	Upon attaining enough skill
  ranks with the Abilities of each type (General, Archetype and Class),
  characters will be granted a title to show their efforts. The title for
  anyone meeting the requirements for General Abilities will be given the title
  Baron or Baroness. Other titles will be given as the character progresses
  through their alternate advancement, but we don't want to spoil the fun by
  giving them all away here.
