	With the launch of
  EverQuest in 1999, Sony Online Entertainment (back then we were Verant) was
  on the leading edge of what became a revolution in the video game
  business&#8230; Online Gaming. We certainly didn't invent it&#8230; in fact,
  we stood on the shoulders of some pretty amazing games, including Ultima
  Online&#8230; Meridian  59 and many, many other games including some great text MUDs.<BR><BR>EverQuest had that magic that propelled it to selling over 3 Million units
  over it's six year (well almost) lifespan. We've released 9 expansion packs
  during that time that have added an absolutely massive amount of content that
  we're pretty proud of. Certainly some of those expansions were better than
  others, but I think our goal has always been the same&#8230; to entertain our
  players.<BR><BR>With the launch of EverQuest II, our goal was to refine EverQuest&#8230; to
  distill the things that made EverQuest great, but also to add its own flavor
  and gameplay style. I think it's fair to say we also needed to aim for a more
  casual gamer&#8230; and make the game appeal to people that may not have the
  same amount of time they had when EverQuest first came out. As a company we
  needed to also appeal to a wider base of people. I think you can see from the
  universal appeal of the Lord of the Rings books (and oh yeah, the movies
  too&#8230;) fantasy worlds are what we can all call &quot;mass market&quot;.
  I'm really proud of EverQuest II and I honestly believe we delivered on our
  goals of making an incredibly fun and immersive world that our players want
  to be a part of and make their own.<BR><BR>Over the years, we've learned a lot. The biggest thing we've learned is that
  our players care very much about everything we do and the changes we make to
  their world. I cannot tell you how many thousands of emails I've gotten over
  the years complaining about class balance, nerfs, and overall changes we've
  made to the game. While I can absolutely understand and respect where each
  and every one of the people that took the time to write these passionate
  emails came from (and I read every single one of them and do my best to
  respond to them as well), I can also assure you that our game teams really do
  care about the changes they make. Remember... YOU, our players, write our
  paychecks.<BR><BR>But it's more than that.<BR><BR>It's also about truly caring about what we do. The vast majority of our
  development teams come from our playerbase. That's a fact that I'm incredibly
  proud of. In fact, it may surprise you to know that EverQuest actually was
  the catalyst for one of our Executive Team members to meet his wife (he just
  got married within the last 6 months)&#8230; she was in his guild&#8230; one
  thing led to another and&#8230; well the rest is as they say history.<BR><BR>We've certainly made our share of mistakes over the years&#8230; but overall,
  we've tried to stay true to our primary goal of entertaining you.<BR><BR>That's our job description.<BR><BR>Now what's been interesting from our perspective is what really serious
  competition is doing to the online gaming space. World of Warcraft has come
  on the scene and is doing awesome. Kudos to Blizzard on what I think is a
  spectacular game. I've played the heck out of it, and I love it (as have many
  people here at SOE). To a game developer, having another game developer play
  your game is the ultimate compliment&#8230; so to the folks at Blizzard we
  say &quot;Nicely done&quot;.<BR><BR>But don't think for a second that we don't see WoW as both a great game AND
  Blizzard as serious competition.<BR><BR>Personally&#8230; I'm glad they are out there. They keep us honest. They keep
  us focused and they force us to play with our 'A' game. They've certainly
  opened some eyes in our company to styles of gameplay that are different than
  we would have come up with inside SOE. I hope they're also opening up the
  eyes of other MMO developers that the 'old school' probably won't cut it any
  more. I'm glad that we went in the direction we did with EQ II because had we
  stuck with making an even &quot;harder core&quot; game, I think bad things
  would have happened. We need to be about larger scale
  mass-entertainment&#8230; because that's what online gaming is slowly
  becoming. Our games just need to be fun&#8230; and easy to get into.<BR><BR>In the United States  there are around 2 Million paying online gamers (this is after WoW btw).
  That's up from 250,000 back before EverQuest was released... and I'm only
  counting the MMO's.. if you start to add in the Pogo's of the world we're
  probably talking about 3-4 Million online gamers... and I have no idea what
  scary numbers some of these online poker places are bringing in.<BR><BR>What this means is that making future online games is a big business that is
  going to be increasingly competitive. I think that's good for you, and good
  for us. It's going to insure great games get made&#8230; and I can tell you
  we're in this for the long haul.<BR><BR>Where are we going? What are we going to be doing to revolutionize this
  business? Well let me throw out just a few of the things we're thinking about
  here at SOE.<BR><BR>What if you could have families in MMO's? Virtual Children&#8230; What if
  your characters could have children and pass on the family name&#8230;<BR><BR>What if players could build fantastic dungeons that become part of the worlds
  we create with tools we give them? How would that work exactly?<BR><BR>Can MMORPGs have skill based combat?<BR><BR>What if?<BR><BR>I mention these things to be provocative. I want to make sure we're going to
  take what we do to the next level&#8230; and that's going to mean putting
  some next generation ideas out there and seeing the kinds of things you
  actually want&#8230; but I at least want to start this dialogue and stir the
  pot a little. We're very interested in <A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=154262">your
  ideas</A> about where things go from here.<BR><BR>John Smedley<BR>President, Sony Online Entertainment
