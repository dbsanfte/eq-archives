	<h2>Searching for active guild with dedicated members?</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	01/16/2004 8:54 am<br>
	<P>Hail Adventurers! </P>
<P>Exemplars Union is a newly formed guild on The Rathe server created by dedicated players for dedicated players. Our mission was to create an ideal combination of challenging activities while still keeping a focus on the guild-family and levels. We have many activities scheduled monthly as well as little things to keep you interested in your off time. As far as members go, we look for quality over quantity. We have a great group of active and friendly members who all share a common vision. We are looking for more of the same so that we can move on to bigger and better things!</P>
<P>Exemplars Union is not for everyone. Although not strict by any means, we are not a mass-recruiting guild and are a little picky about our members. If you are level 46+, stay active in EQ and want to join in on the fun, we invite you to take a look at our requirements and decide for yourself if we are the place for you! <A href="http://www.therathe.com/">www.therathe.com</A></P><br>
