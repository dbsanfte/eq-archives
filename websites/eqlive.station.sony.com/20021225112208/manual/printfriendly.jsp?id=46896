			Need Help?
		</h2>
	
	There may be times during play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention. During these times, your best bet is to turn to EverQuest's battalion of Game Masters. <BR><BR>GMs are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Game Masters is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience without the hindrance of unforeseen problems. <BR><BR>
