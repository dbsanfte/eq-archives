<h1>Magic update</h1>
	Lawrence sent me this update to pass on to all of you.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes. <P>The "problem" with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better solution will be implemented.<P>Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. <P>Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self version work indoors. <P>Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form.<P>Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the next patch. <P>New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. <P>	Now on to the "Burning issue". I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing.  It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser  cause I'm sneaky like that.   Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <P>	As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <P>	The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to "Anchor" an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch. <P>	Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.<P>Take care all!<BR>/Lakers secret handshake<BR> <BR>- Lawrence Poe<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

<B>I just have one concern.  Will the NPC's be getting the anti-gate spells?<P>Thuldorn</B><P>No, NPCs will not be getting this spell (and not so much because we don't want them to, but more for technical reasons).  And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP either, for the same technical reasons.<P>Because of the fact that the spell would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to discuss whether or not we want it to work on player characters...  I think it would be fun, but that's just me.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Any comments on the fact that the majority of players would rather see an anti-summoning spell a lot more than they want to see an anti-gating spell?<P>(one side thought on an anti-summoning spell:  It should be a buff cast on players as opposed to a de-buff cast on mobs.. this would give casting mobs the chance to cancel it)<P>-Run</B><P>Sure.<P>First, well, it is nearly impossible to tell what 'the majority of players would rather see'.  We guess, we all guess, about what exactly it is that most players want, but nobody actually knows.<P>As for that sort of spell... no, I don't think such a spell will be created.  For the same reason that we don't plan to add a summoning suppression type spell.  There are, sadly, cases where summoning is an important way to prevent certain exploits.  We don't plan to create spells that prevent summoning.<P>Alan<BR>
