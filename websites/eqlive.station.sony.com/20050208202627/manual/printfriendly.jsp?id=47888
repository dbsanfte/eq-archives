			Appendix D - Ability Types
		</h2>
	
	There are two types of
  abilities, passive and active. <BR><BR>Passive abilities are always on and always have effect. Most abilities are
  passive. In fact, all General and all Archetype Abilities are passive. <BR><BR>Active abilities need to be triggered by the player. Every active ability has
  a Refresh Timer associated with it. This indicates how long it will be after
  using the ability before it can be used again. Refresh Timers are given with
  two times, in game time and real life time. For every minute that passes in
  the real world, 20 minutes passes in the game world.
