<h2>Patch, June 6, 2002</h2>
<P>** Gameplay **</P>
<P>- In hopes of providing more things for more people to do, certain raid level encounters in the world now return to existence a small amount faster than they used to.&nbsp; This was actually included in lastnight's patch but was not mentioned.</P>
<P>- To address the competition between epic-seeking bards and other classes, the infamous White Dragon Scale is no longer used in the quest given by Karam Dragonforge in Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; The quest now requires a White Dragon Hide.&nbsp; We did not reduce the rate at which White Dragon Scales enter the world, but rather added new potential for the new White Dragon Hide to be found.</P>
<P><BR>** Focus Items **</P>
<P>- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time properly.</P>
<P>- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably.</P>
<P>- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random.&nbsp; They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum.&nbsp; (We never wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)</P>
<P>- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.</P>
<P>- Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually affecting them.</P>
<P>- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their originally intended effect.&nbsp; </P>
<P>All of the same items have focus effects.&nbsp; However, as many people noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error.&nbsp; (Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level effects, and vice versa.)&nbsp; </P>
<P>This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that we originally planned for them.</P>
<P><BR>** Firiona Vie **</P>
<P>- Your server should once again have Trivial Loot Code enabled.&nbsp; Sorry for changing the rules on you.</P>
<P><BR>** Chat Channels **</P>
<P>- Should once again work reliably for people who are using NAT or IP Masquerading via certain networking devices.</P>
<P><BR>- The EverQuest Team</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><BR>June 5th, 2002&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00 pm<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P>** Emergency Patch **</P>
<P>- Fixed the zone between Iceclad and Eastern Wastes.<BR>- Fixed the firepot room in Timorous Deep.<BR>- Updated a handful of zones to fix a problem with NPCs spawning in the wrong place.<BR>- Fixed the graphics cache issue that was causing characters' inventories to appear with the wrong item icons. <BR>- The petition queue is now working as it should be.&nbsp; (The delays some of you might have experienced with your petitions this morning should be reduced dramatically.)</P>
<P><BR>We are aware of the following items, but are not able to fix them at this time:</P>
<P>- The skiff is broken in Erudin<BR>- Corpse resurrection timers aren't decrementing while people are offline</P>
<P><BR>** Previous Patch Update **</P>
<P>We fixed these items in the original patch, but forgot to mention them.</P>
<P>- Familiar Link Death issues<BR>- Moving traps</P>
<P><BR>We're sorry for the downtime.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience.</P>
<P>- The EverQuest Team</P>
