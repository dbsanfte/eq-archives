			Trade Skills
		</h2>
	
	With a trade skill, you can
  make certain items by assembling the necessary pieces. Some trade skills
  require you to seek out a merchant and buy a book or kit specific to that
  skill. Others (like Fishing) only require you to purchase the proper
  equipment.<BR><BR>Before you can learn most skills, you might want to visit a merchant that
  specializes in that trade. He or she will sell you a book that outlines the
  basics for a certain skill. Once you've read it and acquired the necessary
  kit, components or ingredients, you can make pottery, bows and arrows, bread
  products and more. <BR><BR><EM>To make an item, you need all of the ingredients and the right kind of
  container:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the container (a small window opens).<BR>* Click on the needed items in your inventory (item should &quot;float&quot;
  on your cursor).<BR>* Click on an empty slot in the container to place the item in the container.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Combine</STRONG>.<BR><BR>If you're skilled enough, and lucky enough, you'll succeed in your creation.
  A new item will show up in your inventory. Keep in mind that you'll
  occasionally fail, losing all items in the container. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Never stack items when combining them. All items in the combination
