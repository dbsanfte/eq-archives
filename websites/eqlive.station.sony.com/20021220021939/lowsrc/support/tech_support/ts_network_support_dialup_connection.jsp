	<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Dial-Up Connection Troubleshooting</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left>The following is information that may help you with your dial-up connect. Though EverQuest supports a minimum dial-up connection of 28.8, the recommended dial-up connection is 56k or better.</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>Some v90 modems have difficulty receiving the type of data packets that we send. Try using a non-v90 connection to your ISP, if it is available. Otherwise, try lowering the speed of your modem connection for more stability. Do this by right clicking on your "My Computer" icon and select "Properties" from the menu. Click on the Device Manager tab and open the Modem section. Select the Modem tab, and set the Maximum speed to 57600 (or 38400 if it was already set to 57600), then click OK.</P>
<P>If your modem is an external modem, in addition to the above change, open the Ports (COM&amp;LPT) section of the Device Manager and double click on the port listed for your modem. Switch to the Port Settings tab and set the "Bits per Second" to at least 57600 (default is 9600) and the Flow Control to Hardware (default is xon/xoff). Click OK and reboot your computer.</P>
<P>If you have a "software" or "win" modem, this may also be the source of the problem. Software-based modems can cause numerous connectivity problems, not just in our game but also in general. The reason is because the CPU is being used to "pump" the data in a software modem, as well as its other calculations. When playing a game, the CPU may not be able to make the necessary game calculations AND transmit data. We strongly recommend against using them and if you have one, we suggest that you purchase or acquire a hardware-based modem.</P>
<P>Also, you can have your local phone company check your phone lines for signal noise by asking for a "56k Quality Test". Your local phone company should provide this test at no charge. Excessive signal noise can cause a disruption in the data flow, which in turn would affect your connection to our servers.</P>
<P>Finally, search for and open the "datarate.txt" file from the EverQuest folder (the default location is "C:\\\\\\\\program files\\\\\\\\everquest"). The original value is "5.0". Change it to "3.0" and save the file. This will reduce the size of the packets being transmitted and received by EverQuest. This has helped many other phone modem users.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=subHeader align=center><STRONG>Specific Problems for AOL Users</STRONG></P>
<P>Some AOL users will experience problems logging into EverQuest. Make sure you are using the Master AOL Login and that you are minimizing AOL after connecting.</P>
<P>AOL uses a timing system that will disconnect users after about 40 minutes of browser inactivity. An easy way to get around this is by typing the phrase "smile4u" in the KEYWORDS section of the AOL program.</P>
