			5.20
			Inventory Window
		</h2>
	
	The Inventory Window is not open by default. You can click on the second icon from the left (the human figure icon) to open your inventory, or you can press "i" on your keyboard. We'll describe this window in four parts. The left side, where your character's statistics are displayed, the center where your character's worn inventory is shown, the right side where your character's general inventory is displayed, and the bottom where coins and action buttons are displayed. <BR><BR>a) The left side of the window shows your character's statistic: name, level, class, deity, hit points, armor class (ac), attack, experience bar, attributes, resistance, weight carried/allowance and Alternate Advancement experience. <BR><BR>b) The middle of the window displays your characters inventory worn. The larger box in the middle shows how your character looks. The smaller boxes surrounding it are the individual body locations. Each body location is represented by a picture a body part. For example, the top-most center box has a picture of a helmet in it, and that is where items worn on the head would be placed. Pointing at the locations will display a tool tip telling you what they represent. <BR><BR>c) The right side of the inventory window displays an animated logo that represents your character's chosen class. Below that are your character's general inventory slots. These are inventory locations not tied to a specific body part. Just about any item can be placed into a general inventory slot. <BR><BR>d) Across the bottom of the inventory window are the coins your character is carrying (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Copper, in that order). <BR><BR>e) At the very bottom of are four buttons: <BR><BR><I>Skills Button</I> - this button will open a window that shows you all of your characters skills. It lists the skill name as well as your character's rank and numeric value with that skill. <BR><BR><I>Alt. Advance Button</I> - this button will open a window that displays the Alternate Advancement window. This window gives you access to descriptions of and the ability to purchase Alternate Advancement abilities (restricted to Luclin owners with characters over 50th level). It also give the character the option to send some of their experience points to their Alternate Experience pool. See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=appendixd">Appendix D</A> for more details on Alternate Experience. <BR><BR><I>Destroy Button</I> - use this button to destroy items. If you are holding an item on your cursor and you click this button, the item will be destroyed. <BR><BR><I>Done Button</I> - Closes the Inventory Window. <BR><BR>To inspect any item in your inventory, just right-click on the item and hold the mouse button down. When you release the mouse button the inspection window will close. If you wish the inspection window to remain open, right-click the item and hold the mouse button down. Then move the mouse pointer off the item and release the mouse button. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: Pointing your mouse at items in your inventory will tell you the name of the item.</I> <BR><BR>
