			Keyboard Options (Options Window)
		</h2>
	
	<I>Select Category</I> (Movement/Commands/Spell Casting/Target/Camera/Chat/UI/Macros/All): This allows you to find keyboard commands by specific category, or you can just choose All to see all the commands at once. <BR><BR><I>Changing an Option</I>: To change the keystroke(s) that activate a command, just click on the item in the Keypress column that you wish to change. Text will appear asking you to press a key. The keystroke (or combination) that you press will appear in the column. <BR><BR><I>Reload Defaults</I>: This resets all keyboard options to their default. <BR><BR>Example: One of the most common Keyboard changes is to 'remap' the attack key. The attack key is assigned to the 'a' key by default, making it easy to remember. But 'a' is a commonly typed letter, and putting your character into attack mode at the wrong time can be a bad thing. So to make it so that a different key makes your character attack: <BR><BR>* Open the Options Window (Alt-O)<BR>* Select the Keyboard tab<BR>* Select the Commands category<BR>* Find the Autoattack listing<BR>* Click on the 'A' under the Keypress column (you should see the 'press a key' text)<BR>* Press the key that you want to assign the autoattack function to (perhaps Caps Lock, since that key has no function in game)<BR>* Close the Options Window <BR><BR>Then just remember that you've changed that key. <BR><BR>
