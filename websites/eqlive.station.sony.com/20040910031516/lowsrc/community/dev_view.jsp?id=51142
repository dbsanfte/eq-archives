<h1>Upcoming pet enhancements</h1>
	<BR>I have some news from Rich about changes we plan to make for pets.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Hi,<P>I wanted to take a minute to let you know about some pet upgrades that we've just completed. The changes are fairly significant, and we think they address a lot of concerns that have been brought up by players.<P>Here are the changes we've made -<P><B>Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures</B><BR>All pets now think of mesmerized creatures as being dead. Pets will not break mez, will not attack mesmerized creatures, and will forget any hate they had towards a mesmerized creature.<P>In short, if a monster gets mesmerized, your pet will forget about it and stop attacking it. This is good for all pet classes, and especially handy for Enchanters, who can now trust their pets to not break every mez as soon as it lands.<P><B>Pets are neutral to monsters</B><BR>Monsters will not attack your pet first. All monsters see your pet as a neutral creature, and will leave it alone unless your pet attacks something. This means if your pet wanders off, it won't bring a train of monsters back with it. <P>Keep in mind, if your pet chases a fleeing monster, other monsters may still attack it. Your pet is only treated as neutral while it is not acting in a hostile manner.<P><B>Pets no longer take experience in most situations</B><BR>In the past, pets would take a full share of experience if they did the most damage to a creature. We've changed this rule as follows -<P><I>* Pets take ZERO experience from a creature, unless no player does damage to that creature.<P>* Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature - if no player does damage to that creature.</I><P>This means that your pet takes no experience from you or your group <I>unless your pet kills a monster with no help from players.</I> <B>As long as you or your groupmates do damage to a monster, your pet will take ZERO experience.</B><P>Due to the high potential power of dire charmed pets, they will continue to take a share of the experience. In the worst case, dire charmed pets will take a full share of experience  <I>this is the same as it's always been.</I><P>The amount of experience taken by a dire charmed pet scales based on how much damage the pet does. If the dire charmed pet is doing the majority of the damage, it's experience share gets larger. If you or your group are doing reasonable damage to a monster, a dire charmed pet will not take much experience. The more damage you do, the less experience a dire charmed pet will take. In most situations, dire charmed pets will take less experience than they did previously.<P>As with all pets, if a dire charmed pet does the majority of damage, <I>and no player does any damage</I>, the dire charmed pet will take 75% of the experience from the kill. <P>Overall, these changes are a significant boost to pet classes. The dev team has been hard at work on finding and implementing the right solutions, and we hope you'll enjoy these changes. Thanks for your patience as caster balancing continues, and thanks for playing.<P>Rich Waters<BR>Lead Designer, EverQuest<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks Rich.<P>Alan<BR>

There are times (especially if you're a soloing enchanter using charm) that this comes in handy.</B><P>Pets will still attack who you tell them to.  They just wont run out and do it on their own.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Moctemoc-Veeshan wrote:<P><B>Very nice indeed.<P>As a mage, I can see these as some quite positive change. The "messed up" part being the most interesting really.<P>One minor question/fact though, that I would think, might be a minor issue in this:<P>If a pet is casting a spell on the mob being messed, the casting will not be interupted, I assume that. So in effect, the mess will still break on few occasions. I.e. I assume it will work semilar to the feign death while a caster mob is engaging you.<P>The NO XP taken by the pet is nice, but after my oppinion, not the most interesting part of this.<P>I am looking forward to this change.</B><P>Thats true, the pet wont stop casting a spell in mid-cast due to a mez.  So there will be at least that one case where a pet can break mez.  Should be rare enough, though.<P><BR><B>I have a Troll Beastlord that now wants to give Rich Waters a big sloppy kiss.<P>If you development guys get a chance can you summon Rich to da swamps for a well deserved reward? <P>Thanks,<P>-DaxD</B><P>Actually, we keep a Troll under the stairs.  We usually only call her out on special occasions, and those occasions usually involve Mennix (the poor lil fellow needs a smooch sometimes).  But I think we can break her out and let her loose on Rich.  He certainly deserves it...<P>The only trouble is that its probably going to be my job to put her back under the stairs.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

Splendora-ROV wrote:<P><B>Regarding pet changes, I notice you are differentiating between 'normal' pets and Dire Charm as far as the experience changes go. But what about 'normal' charm ? Will the regular pet rules apply in that case or will it be the same as Dire ?</B><P>Actually, the differentiation is between Dire Charmed pets and all other pets.<P>Once something is charmed it is a pet.<P>So the regular rules will apply to charmed pets, with the exception of Dire Charmed pets, as noted above.<P>Alan<BR>

CORRECTION!<P>I made a mistake when I said:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Pets will still attack who you tell them to.  They just wont run out and do it on their own.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>With the new changes, pets will <B>not</B> attack a mezzed NPC, no matter how much you beg, plead or cajole.  Youll have to break the mez by some other means first.<P>Im sorry about the mistake.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Since this wasz essentialy one of the pet classes AA abilities - what will be done about that AA ability slot now?  Or for those who may have spent the points on it?<P>Havneq - Arch Mage  Tribunal</B><P>Pet Discipline is still a very useful ability.  The new pet changes do not prevent a pet from switching between live targets according to its own desires.  Pet Discipline is still the only way to gain that level of control over your pet.<P>Alan<BR>
