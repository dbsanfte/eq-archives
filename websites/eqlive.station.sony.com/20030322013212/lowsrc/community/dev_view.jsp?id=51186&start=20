<h1>Instrument Mastery</h1>
	Ok, heres what happened with Instrument Mastery.<P>Though this seems obvious to me, I want to make it clear how this was supposed to work.<P>Singing Mastery is designed to improve the bards ability to sing songs.<P>Instrument Mastery is designed to improve the bards ability to play instruments.<P>Now there is a bit of possible confusion when we start talking about songs that are instrument based when the bard is not using an instrument.  At that point the bard is singing and instrument song, and it really becomes a matter of taste as to whether Singing Mastery or Instrument Mastery should apply.  Weve decided to base it on the skill used, not whether an instrument is in hand.  So Singing Mastery applies to all Singing skill based songs and Instrument Mastery applies to all instrument based songs, whether or not the bard is using an instrument at the time.<P>No, these two abilities were never meant to overlap.  It was a bug when Instrument Mastery gave a bonus to songs that use the Singing skill.<P>That bug was fixed this patch.  Instrument Mastery no longer affects songs that use the Singing skill.<P>What weve decided to do is increase the amount that Singing Mastery affects Singing skill songs by 50%.  That should go in the next time we patch.<P>Im sorry for not catching this in the patch message.  Basically because this was the way it was always intended to be, we were not aware that wed fixed a bug.<P>Alan<P>
