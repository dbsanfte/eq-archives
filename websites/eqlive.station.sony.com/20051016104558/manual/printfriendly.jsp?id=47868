		<h2>
			27.6
			Appendix B - Skills and Combat: Skills
		</h2>
	
	p.49: The next-to-last
  paragraph on this page reads, &quot;You can have anywhere from 0 to 100
  points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher
  skill ranking&quot;. This section is incorrect. This section should read: <BR><BR>Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill
  is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon
  your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill,
  you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain
  skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the
  skill page is &quot;Master&quot;. <BR><BR>If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your
  skill. <BR><BR>p.52: The &quot;Tiger Claw&quot; skill is listed under &quot;Other
  Skills&quot;. It should be listed under &quot;Combat Skills&quot; on p.51.
