<h1>DirectX8 Files to hit Test Server next week</h1>
	Some time about the middle of next week we plan to put the files for DX8 onto the Test server for you all to download if you'd like to help us test it out.<P>What we really need here is for people with all sorts of configurations and hardware and such to try this out and let us know if there are any problems.<P>Please try to make sure that you have updated drivers for both your sound and video cards, and that you are indeed running DirectX 8 before you test out the new files.  See <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000348.html" TARGET=_blank>this post</A> for some suggestions about how to upgrade to DX8.<P>If you encounter a problem (assuming you've done all the stuff above), here's what you can do to help us fix the problem:<P>1)  go into your EverQuest directory and delete your existing dbg.txt (this file can get really big, and having a fresh one helps us a lot).<BR>2)  go back into the game and see if you can recreate the problem.  If you can't, then we need to consider it a fluke.<BR>3)  if the problem repeats, then get the following information:<BR>  3a)  your dbg.txt file (in your EverQuest directory)<BR>  3b)  your dxdiag information (just go to Start, Run and type dxdiag.exe and tell it to Save all information  send us the resulting file)<BR>  3c) a detailed explanation of what happened that caused the problem<BR>4) send all that information to us at <a href="mailto:Luclinbugs@station.sony.com?Subject=DX8 Problem">Luclinbugs@station.sony.com</a>.  Please use the subject: DX8 Problem.<P>We appreciate any help you can give us with this upgrade.  We really don't expect there to be too many issues, but we'd like to catch any of them that we can sooner rather than later.  We just can't test on enough systems internally to prevent them all.<P>Thanks in advance for your help.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

<B>Greetings from your volunteer editor...<P>Unless they're planning on changing it before next week, as of 11/7/01 the file was still called dbg.txt.  Even on Test Server (where you never know what they're going to change next... look out for that level 10 fire beetle!)<P>- Xelene</B><P>Correct as always... sorry.  I'll edit the post to reduce confusion.<P>Thanks.<P><BR><B>Wouldn't it make sense to have people delete/rename the dbug.txt file before attempting the test?  While bugs may be inconsistent (not readily repeatable), you can't call a bug a fluke.  It's still a bug you need info on regardless of how hard it may be to recreate.<P>Jzonn<BR>Ayonae Ro</B><P>Well, yes and no.<P>Sure, a bug could only happen once and be very hard to reproduce.  We know all about that.<P>But if the bug can't be reproduced by some methodology, then we'll have a very, very hard time finding it ourselves.<P>And if something only happens once and you can't get it to happen again, then it usually was caused by something on the computer being out of whack (that's the techie term, I'm sure).  Perhaps some software that looked like it closed didn't and was hogging memory, or maybe there was some sort of hicup on the PC itself.<P>Unfortunately, if you can't repeat the problem then we probably won't be able to do so either, and that means that it will be very hard to fix.  And, well, if it doesn't come back...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Yes, I am encouraging people to try to reproduce a problem before sending it in to us.  It's infinitely more efficient for us if we have some confirmation that the problem can be reproduced.  Otherwise we have to spend a lot of time building a computer to match the one that the customer is using and then spend a few hours trying to reproduce the problem so we can find it and fix it.<P>We certainly want all reports of problems, I'm not trying to discourage folks from sending their bug reports in.  But we will tackle the ones that are repeatable much more quickly just by their very nature.<P>Alan<BR>
