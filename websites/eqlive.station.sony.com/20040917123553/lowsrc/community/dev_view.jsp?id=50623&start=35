<h1>Asking about new servers</h1>
	<B>Hello Absor!<P>     Is there any plans in the near future to bring a new Non-Split Server up? Vazelle was a Smashing Sucsess and i think with the new EQ Classic being released that a New Server would probably be helpful.<P><BR>Thanks.<P>Faelyte Faebryte &lt;Celestae&gt;<BR>Vazelle</B><P>Hi!<P>I'm not trying to single you out by responding to you this way.  But I wanted to point out that we announce new servers as soon as we know that we're putting them up.  I've been getting a lot of questions like yours, and I just wanted to let everyone know that we're not sneaking new servers in the back door.  And prodding me with sharp objects, while fun, won't divulge any secret information about new servers.<P>When we've got one in the planning, we'll certainly let you know.  I'll post it here.<P>And, well, I certainly hope that EverQuest Classic causes us to need more servers.  That's what the marketing folks tell me is the idea of the whole thing.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Alan,<P>I think you get people asking about new servers more to help you gauge the level of interest than to prod you with sharp objects.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sheesh</B><P>Well, sure.  But then who's going to prod me with sharp objects?<P><BR><B>I would like an answer to this one either on board, or in private email.<P>This is a Player character question, real world based and definately not in game.<P>As an IT professional, I can only imagine the type of infrastructure set up in your data center (or whatever you call it).  However, knowing you are based and held (as far as I know) in California I have a few concerns, and I think they are valid.  I'm sure your company has answers for them, and I am just curious, as a professional in the field, to know what they are.<P>Okay, so, you're in California.  Out here in Texas, we get a lot of news reports that y'all are a little short on electricity, which if I'm not mistaken still runs all these servers.  I've also heard about these rolling black outs.  What measures are in place to ensure that my game playing fun is not interrupted by one of these rolling black outs?  Side question on that; the news also tells us that electricity costs are going to be going up sharply in the near future.  I can only imagine how this is going to affect the bottom line there at EQ central, as I'm certain you will be hit fairly hard by the increase.  I figure to some point, there are budgetary guards against increases; but not usually to this magniatude.  Thus, my question; what is being done to curb this increase and keep costs down?  Have you ever considered relocating to cheaper real estate?  (hint, hint:  Texas)<P>My last question is basically about your internet setup.  I am assuming you are connected to at least 5 different ISPs through some OCRs of some type.  If its not considered a company secret or security risk (I don't think it is, but your mileage may vary) can you let me know who you have connections through and what type?  This is more curiosity on my part.  <P>Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider a response.  I would appreciate hearing back from you on these questions.<P>Jynx</B><P>We have a huge generator right outside the office, right under my cubicle.  A few weeks ago we were hit by one of those rolling blackouts.  I got to go home an hour early (can't really do my job without power), but the servers stayed up.  No worries there.<P>Yes, power rates are slated to go up.  I won't express my opinion of the way that situation has been managed...  As for the budgetary concerns, I dunno.  But relocation wouldn't work for me.  With the exception of the whole power thing, California is an awesome place to live, and San Diego is one of the nicest places in California.  So I'm going to quietly squelch your suggestion about relocation...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for our Internet connection setup, I can't tell you.  I don't know that much about it.  I do know that we have a stunning amount of bandwidth.<P>Alan<BR>
