<h1>The new Cazic-Thule</h1>
	Korgarl wrote:<P><B>Well now that Cazic Thule has all of a sudden become a 50+ dungeon I have a couple questions.  Where do I go now for the mid 30's level quest armor for shadowknights.  I would love to someday start my epic and would love to know where I at least go to get information on the new location of the decayed armor drops.  Sorta miffed this was not announce earlier but it is nice to have the revamp done to a worthless zone (except for the SK armor).  Any information you can provide will be helpful.</B><P>All of the stuff that you used to get out of Cazic is still available.  I'm not going to give out details, that's for you to discover.  But we didn't just drop the content into a dark hole, it's still out there.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Question, what happens to the wizard portal that's in Cazic thule?<P>I'm guessing you didn't clear the area around the portal site out.<P>-Eban Stormbringer</B><P>The portal isn't really any more dangerous than it was before.  The same precautions work as they did before.  Sure, if you were going to get wiped out in the old CT, you'll get wiped out a little faster now.  But the portal is pretty much just as usable as it was before.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Chess-CoN<P><BR><B>I was excited to hear about the changes to the zone, but quite dismayed to discover that despite its location on Antonica my manastone no longer works here.<P>I don't think I'm alone among the players in my belief that while manastones would not be functioning in any alternate planes or expansion zones, they would continue to work in zones in the "old world". <P>Was this simply an oversight, or is the reduction in the number of zones where this item can be used intentional?</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Since the time the manastone was introduced, the world of EQ has changed enormously.  Players now have hit point totals that were impossible back in the day.  Spells like Complete Heal, Torpor, and Nature's recovery make the mana/hit point heal ratio totally insane these days.  Beyond that, the improved efficiency and availability of regeneration is also incredibly higher than it was pre-Kunark.<P>Manastones are crazy broken today.  The speed, convenience, and efficiency they bring would unbalance today's high end player beyond repair.  As an example, with the use of a manastone, a high end cleric can go from no mana to full mana in under a minute.<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While we all understand that there was an implication that we'd let manastones continue to work in the old world, the new Temple of Cazic-Thule is basically a new world zone.  It's a zone designed for the same high end people and content that we think manastones break.   And, well, it seems to me to be a better idea to make a good zone than to worry about one "crazy broken" item.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Are the new tradeskill combines working as intended? Or are many broken? I have heard many reports from other players not being able to find recipies using the clues in the journals, and many friends of mine have come up with some VERY innovative ways of combining the items suggested in the journals, however to no avail, they result in Does Not Combine messages.<P>Thanks,<P>Kamotracker Shadowarrow<BR>Fier'Dal Ranger of Tunare<BR>Officer of Destiny's Flame, Torvonnilous</B><P>Well, creative isn't the same as correct...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Those recipes have been checked and double-checked.  They work.  It's just a matter of getting the right items in the right place at the same time.  Everything that is an actual recipe does work, you'll just have to keep working on interpreting those journals.<P>Alan<BR>
