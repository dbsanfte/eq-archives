<h1>Re-envisioning Classes in EverQuest</h1>
	<P>The
  EverQuest development team continues the process of evaluating class roles,
  class definitions, and class desirability to ensure that each class provides
  value in group and raid situations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, we have found that
  the term &quot;class balance&quot; is a term that means many different things
  to different people and we believe that it's more accurate to define our goal
  in another way.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P>We
  believe at its core, each class should be fun and have a desirable role in
  raid and group situations and it is to this standard that we will hold our
  evaluations as EQ continues to grow and evolve.</P>  <P>We
  have begun the process by looking into group roles.&nbsp; We plan to take a
  look at raid roles after we have finished with groups.&nbsp; We are looking
  at what each class has to offer in a group setting, how useful and viable
  that role is and finally, how well they perform these duties.&nbsp; The team
  is currently reviewing extensive data from live servers to make sure that the
  conclusions we make are as accurate as possible.&nbsp; Once we have data that
  we can share, we will ask for your input and insight on our
  conclusions.&nbsp; </P>  <P>Our
  goal is to identify the underlying reasons behind any problems we uncover and
  we may find it necessary to make fundamental changes to the game to address
  them.&nbsp; As we move forward with this process, we will keep the community
  apprised of our findings and gather their input on the changes we feel need
  to be made to make players of all classes in EverQuest feel useful as they
  fulfill roles that are interesting and fun to play.&nbsp; We would like you
  to be part of these discussions and help us to determine the shape of classes
  in EverQuest's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>  <P>Thank
  you for you time and for being a part of this wonderful world that is
  Norrath.&nbsp; As an initial&nbsp;step in this process,&nbsp;while we are
  gathering data, we're going to host a live chat between players and the
  developers to begin this discussion.&nbsp; We will announce the time and date
  for the chat in the next few days.</P>  <P>The
  EverQuest Team<BR><BR><A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=52376&amp;no_redir=true">Join
