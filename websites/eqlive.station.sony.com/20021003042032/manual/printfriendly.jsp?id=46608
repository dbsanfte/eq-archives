			Trade Skills
		</h2>
	
	With a trade skill, you can make certain items by assembling the necessary pieces. Some trade skills require you to seek out a merchant and buy a book or kit specific to that skill. Others (like Fishing) only require you to purchase the proper equipment.<BR><BR>Before you can learn most skills, you might want to visit a merchant that specializes in that trade. He or she will sell you a book that outlines the basics for a certain skill. Once you've read it and acquired the necessary kit, components or ingredients, you can make pottery, bows and arrows, bread products and more. <BR><BR><I>To make an item, you need all of the ingredients and the right kind of container:</I> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the container (a small window opens).<BR>* Click on the needed items in your inventory (item should "float" on your cursor).<BR>* Click on an empty slot in the container to place the item in the container.<BR>* Click <B>Combine</B>.<BR><BR>If you're skilled enough, and lucky enough, you'll succeed in your creation. A new item will show up in your inventory. Keep in mind that you'll occasionally fail, losing all items in the container. <BR><BR><I>Note: Never stack items when combining them.
