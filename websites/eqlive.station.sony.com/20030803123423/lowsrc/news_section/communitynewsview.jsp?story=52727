	<h2>Karana Council of Guilds Meeting</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Karana<br>
	11/14/2002 4:45 pm<br>
	<P>Qamgine Nighteagle of the Royal Knights of Light guild announced an upcoming Karana Council of Guilds (KCoG) meeting.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Karana Council of Guilds will be holding a Council Meeting on Tuesday, November 19th at 9pm EST. We will be discussing the possible addition of KCoG to the Venril Sather Rotation, and whether this is possible or not. </P>
<P>Guild Leaders affiliated with KCoG are asked to attend, and Secondary Leaders are also welcome. </P>
<P>To keep the meeting as on track as possible we ask that only Guild Leaders and their Seconds attend. If you know of a Guild that is affiliated with KCoG that does not normally check this board, please inform this of this meeting. </P>
<P>On Tuesday, check with me and I will give you the channel information with which to get into the channel. For those of you with PoP, I will be in PoK if you want to meet in a specific place. </P>
<P>If you have any questions post here, or ask me in game. Unguilded people are also welcome, as they do not have a guild to represent them. Feel free to join in as well.</P>
<P>We are looking for guilds/characters who are currently "not" on VS rotation.</P>
<P>Please visit <A href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showMessage?topicID=104.topic">http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showMessage?topicID=104.topic</A> for more information.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
