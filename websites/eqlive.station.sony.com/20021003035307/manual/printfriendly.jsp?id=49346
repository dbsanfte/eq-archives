	The Window Selector is located at the top of your screen in the middle. It is a simple tool that allows you to quickly open and close the most frequently used windows. Each window is represented by an icon. From left to right they are: Actions, Inventory, Options, Friends, Hot Buttons, Spells, Pet, Effects and Help. Clicking an icon/button will toggle the window open or closed. The Window Selector cannot be closed. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: Pointing your mouse at any of the icons will tell you the name of the window that the icon represents.</I> <BR><BR>
