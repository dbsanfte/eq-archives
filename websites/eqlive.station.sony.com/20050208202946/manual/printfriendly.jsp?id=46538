			8.9
			Auctioning Items
		</h2>
	
	As you advance in the game, you'll
  find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need
  an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have
  just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your
  jewelry-making kit. Or, you could need a spell ingredient yourself - the old
  adage &quot;one man's trash is another man's treasure&quot; holds true in
  EverQuest as well. <BR><BR>Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in
  your playing zone can hear. Unlike &quot;/shout&quot; (which is reserved for
  critical situations), &quot;/auction&quot; is only used for buying and
  selling items. The preferred usage is &quot;WTB&quot; (want to buy) or
  &quot;WTS&quot; (want to sell), followed by a description of the item. <BR><BR>To send a message to the auction chat channel, just type /auction [text].
