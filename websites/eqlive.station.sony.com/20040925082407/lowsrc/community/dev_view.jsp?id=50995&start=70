<h1>Sudden Changes?</h1>
	<B>Firstly, I would like to thank you for your continuing effort to keep EverQuest alive. I once wondered if EverQuest would become a one-off game, which fades out after a year or so. So far you guys have been great!<P>One little thing that I have noticed in the recent era - you have been changing 'little' things which we (players) had so passionately argued for in the past. For instance the stackability of pelts and trade skill items, and the recent addition of 'Soulbinders'.<P>This is good. The addition itself is wonderful, and rightfully so I believe. What I would like to ask, though, is Why all these changes now?<P>I can see this may sound a little "frictional" as it were, so I have to be careful about how I word things here. Either way, I really don't mean any offence - I sincerely want to know why these things are changing.<P>In the past, as you know, quite a lot of us requested for such 'little' changes that brainstormed the players. With these issues, the voices on the players' end were nearly always unanimous (unlike with class balancing issues where there were usually conflicts among players). A pattern then emerged gradually - you always refused to change them by saying that things were to remain as they were for the best. This pattern repeated itself over and over.<P>I have been seeing the changes being applied gradually, though. Is this a general change in attitude among the developpers? I don't believe that one side was wrong up until a certain point and suddenly become right - so I'm sure you would see what I mean when I say that it seems the general attitude you have towards the game seems to be different from that of, say, this time a year ago.<P>Either way, it's a good thing. I think it is. And I want you to know that I love EverQuest. I think you have done VERY well overall. We all know nothing/noone is perfect - and within the limits you have done an excellent work. At least, you are looking at (or reading a message from) a person who's enjoying the work you have done. I just really wanted to ask that question just because I'm somewhat a little surprised to find the changes occuring in the areas where you so PASSIONATELY refused to change in the past.<P>I'm not really expecting a reply on this, to be honest, but I would want to know (before the day I die) how things advanced for you guys within the team. I would never find that out unless you tell the story, and you are likely not to bother talking about these minor issues unless asked.<P>Once again, I would like to thank you for continuing to improve EverQuest. You guys are really wonderful!<P>Carline Clair</B><P><BR>Well, there really are two considerations involved here:  team dynamics and the health of the game itself.<P>Probably the most important thing is the team dynamic.  We are just like any other group of people.  One day we can all agree that the sky is blue.  But over time we can be convinced, as individuals or as a group, that the sky is in fact yellow.  As the team changes, as the game expands, and as the game itself changes, so do we.  Especially when you're talking about the soulbinder thing.  I think it's fair to say that we've been on the fence about it as a group for a long time.  There really are reasonable arguments for and against doing it.  We have debated this issue in several forms since I started here.<P>Very few changes that we make are sudden.  But for those that aren't here, in meetings and sitting around the lunch table, I can see how it might seem like a sudden switch.<P>I think it's also important to understand that once we add something like this, it's fair to say that we really can't take it back.  So when we're on the fence, when arguments on both sides are equal and the net result is hard to determine beforehand, it is probably always better to make the mistake that is reversible.<P>Focusing on the soulbinders as an example, we don't know how these NPCs will affect the interaction between players.  We don't know how it will affect the economy for lower level PCs, who can often make a good living being helpful to others by binding them.  On the other hand, adding these NPCs reduces the frustration level for some players that play at off-peak times when finding a bind can be a problem.<P>You also talked about how these changes are being applied gradually.  We never really want to introduce a ton of changes at one time.  Despite the seemingly popular desire for soulbinders, I'm already getting plenty of mail from people that don't like it (those are the people that made money selling binds).  And I, for one, am convinced that this is one change will affect the social dynamics of the game, perhaps in a negative way.  Before making any other changes that might affect the social nature of the game, it seems like a wise idea to examine the effects of any similar changes made previously.<BR> <BR>So we make changes one at a time when we can.  It makes it easier to judge the overall effect on the game world.<P>I read plenty of message boards.  I think I'm fairly well aware of the desires of those that post about EverQuest (though I am also aware that there are many people that just play the game and never come to message boards at all, either to post or read, and we have to try to be aware of those people too).  There have been a few times since I took this job that we've implemented a change based on what seemed like the desire of the majority of players, only to receive an overwhelming amount of email from people that didn't like the change.  It is very hard to claim that any suggestion has the near unanimous support of the player base.  So we try to be careful making changes.  EverQuest is a great game right now.  It's hard to say what changes might make it better and what changes might only <I>seem</I> to make it better.  We have to use our judgement on these things as best we can.<P>Anyway, those are my thoughts on the issue.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>ok, so let me get this straight...  you're saying that you're careful about changes because you might make people mad.  with the same paragraph you also imply that the only reason you commit to a change is when it will make the least players mad.  all the while saying that you're weighing what's best for the game.  so you're telling me that if a change needed to happen in the game it might actually be held up because of a player majority that didn't like it and was vocal about not liking it??  i understand you guys are in business to make money, but ****** that kind of thinking is dangerous.  i just hope that verant will have the courage to make a change in the face of player outcry.  i remember what happened with TLC.  i am against the version that was implemented then removed.  i would most likely have quit because of it.  i do, however, like the things i see coming from the umbral plains.  the step-up approach seems to me to be a great way to look at the problem.  just, please, don't bail on standards.  don't let the playerbase ruin the game by demanding and stomping their feet.  always do what's best for the game.  the playerbase may shift, but it will be there and when the game is better, it will be stronger.<P>Lenkyl Greatstorm<BR>51 Wanderer<BR>Morrell-Thule</B><P>Well, I think we've shown that we have the "courage to make a change in the face of player outcry".  I can still remember the Fan Faire that I had to go to right after we changed the effect on the Donal's Chestplate...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  Though I had expected to be beaten by clerics, instead I met a bunch of cleric players that said that even though they didn't like the change, they understood it.  Some of them even bought us drinks.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I suppose what I wrote might have sounded confusing because, well, the process is complicated.  Yes, we are in business to make money.  That means that we need to listen to what our customers say they want.  But we also have to make sure that giving some players what they want won't upset more people than it pleases.  And on top of all of that we also have to remember that in the long run it's the quality and integrity of the game that really makes people happy, and that doing something that lessens either of those is a very bad thing.<P><BR><B>I have always played a melee. For me these changes are fantastic. You have mentioned that some of the dev team fear a negative repercussion to player interaction. <P>First, the soulbinders are scattered enough and located in some non-optimal spots so player binds remain in demand. I still see players /shouting "looking for bind at orc lift" just as often as before. When I have mentioned the soulbinder option to them, the typical response is "too far from the orc camp/crushbone."<P>The Nexus is another huge change that you implemented perfectly. I use it some, but am still a good customer for ports and TLs. <P>Shiz, Xev</B><P>Thanks!<P>That's pretty much what we were shooting for.  A tool to help those that just couldn't find a bind from a player because they play at off hours without really losing the interaction that is generated from characters needing things from other characters.<P><BR>Cyndzia wrote:<P><B>About hearing alot of negative things regarding some of the changes (sticking with the example of soulbinders, but I feel this principle applies in most if not all situations)People are much more vocal when they are upset then when they are happy, so no matter what the change (imho) you are likely to get more negative than positive feedback even if most people like it.</B><P>That's certainly true.  It's very hard to judge the reactions of our entire customer base from the reactions of a few players.  And it is human nature to try to affect change when you are not happy and to be content (and quiet) when you are.  That's why I think it's important for us to keep our eyes on the overall good of the game as well as customer feedback and suggestions.<P><BR><B>Oh, Absor.  Just like Carline Clair, I too had a mixed response about some of the small changes.<P>Soulbinders - A good idea on the surface, but a bad idea in practice.<P>Alternative #1 - Shaman created Potions of Binding.  Cost to construct, roughly 4pp.  Typical selling price?  5-8pp each and can be combined into a stack of 10.  Will only work for the user in a location they can normally bind in (i.e. sorry warriors, cities only).<P>Alternative #2 - Encephalographic Magnetic Location Instigator.  A 10-pound box, size giant, with 1 charge of Bind Affinity.  Created using tinkering skill.  Construction cost, roughly 35-50pp.  Typical selling price? 65-75pp.  Allows non-caster types to bind in zones and locations that typically only casters can bind in (hey, there better be a benefit to carrying something that large, that expensive, and that also won't fit into most containers).<P>Pros: <BR>1.  Just like soulbinders, players do not need someone else around when they want to get a bind.<BR>2.  Increased use and demand for trade skills.<BR>3.  Increased participation in the "player-driven" economy.<P>Cons:<BR>1.  Still some times when off-peak hours will see issues with getting a bind, albeit, less so.<BR>2.  Monetary cost imposed.<P>The key point is to introduce the ability for players to solve their own problems.  Creating NPCs to solve issues is like asking our government to solve our problems for us.  In most cases, we don't want you/Verant to solve the problem, but at least give us the ability to solve it ourselves.<P>In total honesty, many problems like this can be solved by creating a tradeskill constructed item of some kind.  The web pages for tinkering are filled with astoundingly good ideas from some seriously creative people.  To be sure, some items would create balance problems, but I think you would be surprised at what restrictions people are willing to accept when you place that "burden of balance" on their shoulders.<P>Lanceor<BR>Paladin of 41 Truths<BR>Xegony</B><P>The idea of a trade skill item was one that we thought about.  In fact, I remember a discussion with a player about that very thing on the message boards a while ago.<P>And it's not a bad idea, really.  But, well, you'd probably still have exactly the same problem if you play off-peak hours.  Instead of finding a bind you have to find a tinker or alchemist with the skill to make the item you need.  While this might not be a problem, it still leaves a large potential that the same people that can't find a player to bind them before would still be stuck.<P>This idea will probably bubble around in my head, at least, for a while yet.  But in the end the soulbinders are a much more solid and controllable solution for us.  With the soulbinders we know we are fixing the issue in the places and situations we want to address.  Freedom is all well and great, but if you want to hang a picture it's probably better to just put the nail where you want it than just shooting at the wall with a nail gun until you hit the right spot. <P>I love my bad analogies.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

But for you the spell is far more versatile than the soulbinders, easily justifying the effort and cost.  While we certainly could have charged for the service from an NPC, we decided just to make it free.  So far it seems as though this was the right decision.<P>The Nexus portals have similar restrictions.  They take time and only take you to limited locations.  Spell casters that can port have a much broader selection and can do so without delay.<P>For now I wouldn't be looking for any other spell-casting NPCs.  Obviously nothing is out of consideration (never say never), but we're not planning any new changes along these lines right now.<P>I think we're pretty happy with the soulbinders as they are, so I don't think you'll see any changes to them.<P>I like these topics too.  It's always interesting to share our perspective with all of you and to hear yours.<P><BR><B>Short Version:<P>I agree with the player that said I'ts better to give the players the TOOLS to make solutions than to solve the problems for them.<P>-W</B><P>I only disagree with that idea when the issue that needs to be addressed is one where the availability of the players to solve the problem is part of the problem.<P><BR>Oualawouzou wrote:<P><B> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"> but if you want to hang a picture it's probably better to just put the nail where you want it than just shooting at the wall with a nail gun until you hit the right spot </font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Aren't you neglecting the fun factor here?</B><P>I might be.

Tinkerer's and Alchemists will be setting up shop to sell their wares.

Not at all actually.  It just requires some forward planning.  No different than buying food before heading deep into a dungeon.  If I'm a character that can't bind, then I best work on that solution while I can.  Which is when people are on.  Save up a couple auto-bind trinkets and BAM! bound when I need it.  Busy time or not.  When I've used up almost my supply... would I go looking for more when nobody is on, or take care of it, while there's people on. Tuck them away for when I need them and nobody is around...<P>I think that it's a perfect solution, and as the other player pointed out... requires us to work on the solution not have it handed to us.<P>Tabril</B><P>Actually, it would be very different than stocking up on food.  You can buy that food at any time from a vendor.  Some people have a hard time getting a chance to play at 'peak' times, and seeking a player made item for a bind would really be a problem.<P>But like I said, the trade skill idea isn't a bad one, it's just that the potential for an incomplete solution exists.  In fact, it seems likely since the source of the problem is player character availability at off hours.<P><BR><B>Hey!<P>I enjoy shooting nail guns at just about anything.<BR>I suppose a wall is as good a target as say...elves, just not as much fun.<P>-violing</B><P>Or dwarves.  Often they don't even notice it, and you can try drawing designs on their backs...<P><BR>Alan<BR>

Using the Nexus a character can 'port' himself from Antonica to Kunark without the help of a player character.  But they are restricted in this ability by time and location, where a character that can cast teleportation spells has a much greater range of places he can go to and he can go in the blink of an eye.<P>Alan<BR>
