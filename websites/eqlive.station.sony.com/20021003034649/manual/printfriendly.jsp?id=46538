			8.9
			Auctioning Items
		</h2>
	
	As you advance in the game, you'll find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your jewelry-making kit. Or, you could need a spell ingredient yourself - the old adage "one man's trash is another man's treasure" holds true in EverQuest as well. <BR><BR>Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in your playing zone can hear. Unlike "/shout" (which is reserved for critical situations), "/auction" is only used for buying and selling items. The preferred usage is "WTB" (want to buy) or "WTS" (want to sell), followed by a description of the item. <BR><BR>To send a message to the auction chat channel, just type /auction [text]. <BR><BR>
