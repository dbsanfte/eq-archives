<h1>Server Stability Issues</h1>
	<P>The EQ team apologizes for the server instability in the past week. This
  instability occurs at peak times, and is seen to our users as
  &quot;1017&quot; errors.&nbsp; Normally within a few minutes these users are
  able to log back in, but on some servers this problem has occurred more than
  once in a single evening.</P>  <P>We're working to address the problem, and expect that in the next couple
  of days we'll have everything resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance
  you'll run into this problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times
  - if you do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20
  minutes.</P>  <P>For those of you who want to know more, read on.</P>  <P>Gates of Discord has been immensely popular - many of our old customers
  have been coming back to try it out, and many new customers have arrived to
  give EQ a try.&nbsp; Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in
  addition the people who are online are also playing more and for longer than
  usual.&nbsp; Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, high level
  content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of content is particularly
  taxing on our servers, and coupled with the unusually high usage, we're
  seeing a resulting instability during our peak times.</P>  <P>Our first effort was to remove the casino, which improved our server
  stability.&nbsp; Since then, we've been working on two different fixes, the
  first of which will go live at the 3am  patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night).&nbsp; The second will be later this
  week.&nbsp; Both of them are meant to improve performance during peak times
  and address the 1017 errors that you may be experiencing.&nbsp; Each of them
  we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, and we expect our second fix
  to resolve the problems.</P>  <P>We apologize for our service instability in the past week; we're working
  hard on this problem - it's cutting into our play time too.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;</P>  <P>We'll give you another update in the next day or two as we make progress,
  and let you know how things are coming.</P>  <P>Brenlo the 1017 Slayer</P>
