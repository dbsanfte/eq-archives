	EverQuest's chat rooms are
  not accessible from within the game. Instead, click <STRONG>Chat</STRONG> from the
  Login screen (which appears when you activate the EverQuest desktop icon).
  You can use chat to speak to other players about the game and ask questions.
  Other players are often a great source of answers.
