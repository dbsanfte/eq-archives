	<P>We are a hybrid guild based in Europe. We set it up because many of us found that, as we moved up in levels, there was no guild that really catered for us on Stromm. We want to progress in the game, explore new places and raid, but we want to do it at our own pace, and have fun doing it. Although there are many good guilds, most play on North American time and this can make it difficult for people playing on European time to participate in them and to raid. While there is at least one high-end European guild, many of us do not have the time that that sort of guild requires. We aim to give the level 50+ people on Stromm who play on European time a guild of their own, which plays, groups and raids in a way that they enjoy, at a time that suits them.</P>
<P>Aims:</P>
<P>We aim to make it easier for our members to: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Organise regular groups, especially at off peak times, or in out of the way places. 
<LI>Do things and get stuff that needs a good team, such as epics. 
<LI>Raid - not necessarily big stuff, and not all the time. We have no pretensions of becoming an |ber guild but we want to have at least one raid a week to look forward to. </LI></UL>
<P>Principals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Our peak gaming hours are European: 8pm to 11pm GMT during the week, and 1pm to 6pm GMT at weekends. We raid at 1pm GMT on Sunday afternoons. 
<LI>Our level range is 50-65. However, we welcome applications from players above level 40 who are moving towards level 50, although they will not be eligible for raids until 50. 
<LI>We are a hybrid guild. We intend to have regular weekly raids, but our main aim is to have fun. We want a relaxed atmosphere and understand that everyone has a real life.</LI></UL><br>
