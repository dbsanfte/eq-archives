<P>The first annual Everquest Gladiator Championship, held this year at GenCon in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Aug 2-5 2001, was a huge success.</P>
<P><BR>Thousands of people crowded around the booth throughout the weekend to observe a contest of skill and valor in one-on-one Arena battles. The contestants were each given a duplicate pregenerated 24th level character and dueled opposite their opponent to the death. Prizes were given away to the Finalists, including EverQuest key chains, caps, t-shirts, printed game guidebooks, and official EverQuest action figures along with an in-game item. The Overall Winner was issued the Title of "The Duelist" and will have the chance to defend that title next year when this competition resumes. In addition, 3 prizes (Sony Sports Am/Fm Walkman, Sony SportsAm/Fm/CD Walkman, and a Sony Color TV watchman) were issued to the winners that won 8 matches apiece and seeded as a final contestant.</P>
<P>Gamespot had this to say about the event : <A target=_blank href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2801267,00.html">http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2801267,00.html</A></P>
<P>The first annual EverQuest&reg; Gladiator Championship was held at this year's GenCon on August 2-5, 2001. This competition of arena battle pitted contestants against each other in one-on-one gladiatorial combat within the EverQuest game. Each contestant was given a pre-generated 24th level EverQuest character and sent into the ring to duel his opponent to the death. Prizes were awarded to the finalists. The overall winner received the title of "The Duelist" and will have the chance to defend that title at next year's event.</P>
<P>Gary "Daegarmo" Grobson and Ed "Namdarie" Hocking, both from Sony Online Entertainment and two of the organizers of the Gladiator Championship, took a moment to tell of their highlights of the competition.</P>
<P>Ed Hocking revealed a special moment for him when a young man of seven, named Frank, sat down at one of the computers ready to take on challengers. "At first glance, I thought how cute it was that this seven year old is giving EverQuest a try," said Ed Hocking. "Well, after beating his mother in head-to-head combat and several others of our player base, my view quickly changed. He didn't just end up runner-up in the Warrior division, he was playing so well that others were afraid to sit down against him. Frank, you can tank for any group of mine!"</P>
<P>To many, Gary Grobson is also known as Lady Daegarmo in the world of EverQuest. Every night, about an hour before GenCon ended for the day, Gary would host a "Duel Lady Daegarmo Time." This drew some of the more hard core player-versus-players. "My boast was heavy. You choose your class, then you choose my class, and I will still make you see 'Loading, please wait'" </P>
<P>The "Duel Lady Daegarmo Time" was not Gary's highlight though. That came when Drizzlin showed up. "Drizzlin, the Silent, the champion rogue of the Vallon Zek server, challenged me to a duel, head up Rogue vs. Rogue. I have some experience in PvP with rogues, but no where near champion status," said Gary about his event highlight. "I literally saw him reposition himself in his seat after I got a good backstab off, and then all of a sudden I was in trouble. I wish I could come up with some decent excuse, but the fact is that he is an incredible rogue, and when it was all said and done, I was done and dead."<BR></P>
