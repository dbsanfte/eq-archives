			Creating an Account
		</h2>
	
	This section shows you how to
  create an account. Once you've done that, you can log into a game server. <BR><BR>Before you can log into EverQuest, you must have an active Internet
  connection through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a valid player
  account. You'll also need a valid credit card, an EverQuest registration code
  (printed on the jewel case) and your e-mail address. <BR><BR>To create an account: <BR><BR>1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on your desktop.<BR>* Each time you start the game, it automatically downloads the latest patches
  and game news. It is a good practice to read the patch news. Once this
  finishes, click Play Online. <BR><BR>2. Click <STRONG>Account</STRONG>, then <STRONG>New Account</STRONG> to display the account
  registration screen. <BR><BR>3. Enter your name, address, e-mail address, and date of birth.<BR>* Left-click in a field, then type in the information. You can use <STRONG><EM>Tab</EM></STRONG>  to move the cursor to the next field. <BR><BR>4. Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> to proceed. <BR><BR>5. (Optional) Enter your PC specifications and answer other general interest
  questions, then click Next to proceed. <BR><BR>6. Type in a login name and your EverQuest account key.<BR>* The login name displays whenever you connect to the EverQuest servers, and
  can also be seen whenever you are in the EverQuest chat rooms.<BR>* When entering your account key, carefully check to make sure you correctly
  enter zeroes and ones. Remember, a zero (0) is skinnier than the letter
  &quot;O.&quot; <BR><BR>7. Type in a Sony Station login name and password.<BR>* If you don't have a current Sony Station account, create one by entering a
  login name and password. <BR><BR>8. Click <STRONG>Finish</STRONG>. Your registration information will be sent to the
  server and processed. <BR><BR>9. Once you receive your confirmation e-mail, repeat Steps 1 and 2. <BR><BR>10. Click <STRONG>Change Account</STRONG>. <BR><BR>11. Type in your Sony Station name and password (from Step 7), then click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG>.
  <BR><BR>12. A subscription window appears. Click <STRONG>Now</STRONG> to start a
  subscription. <BR><BR>13. Select a payment method and fill in all required billing information,
  then click <STRONG>Finish</STRONG>.<BR>* Your billing information will be processed (this may take a few minutes).
  Once it's accepted, you can click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG> to return to the
  front-end screen.<BR>* If you encounter any problems with the billing process, please contact our
  Customer Service department immediately. <BR><BR>14. Click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG> to begin playing EverQuest.
