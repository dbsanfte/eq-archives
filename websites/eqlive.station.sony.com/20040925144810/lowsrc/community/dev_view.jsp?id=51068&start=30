<h1>Class-specific Items</h1>
	Some folks have been asking about the idea behind class-specific loot (or the lack thereof).  Questions like this one:<P>Sekira-Xev wrote:<P><B>Was marking Rowyls Armguards usable by Clerics and Shamans intentional or a mistake?  Please tell me it was a mistake.  This was one of the only high-end druid only items in the game, named after the same Druid that druid armor in Thurgadin was...<P>It was also the ONLY item that a druid had any hope of getting from *Omitted MOB for spoiler purposes but you know who*.  Now priority will be given on this item to Clerics and Shamans because, as we all know, they are vital and important classes and druids are sideliners.</B><P>Others asked why there were not more class-specific loot drops in general.<P>Rich Waters had this answer to such questions:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Class specific items are good in cases where they are not going to be No Drop.  When they can't be traded, it's often a very frustrating situation if you have no one present who can use the item in question.  Having an item that your group earned and no one can use is very annoying, as you put in the appropriate effort and the reward rots on the corpse.<P>The Rowyl's Armguards are a good example.  The item was changed because that's a case where 45 or more people participate in an event and on some servers the armguards were beginning to rot as the guild druids all acquired the item.  Making the armguards useful to more classes lengthens the amount that can drop before a given group becomes saturated with them.<P>- Rich Waters<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I suppose there will always be a fine line between the problem of classes wanting the same items and the frustration of having items drop that nobody in the group can use.<P>Lawrence Poe (not worthy of a full quote...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif">  ) mentioned the revamp of Hate Plane and how the class-specific loot their wasn't so well received.  Both make very good points.  Obviously no decision on such things is going to be able to please everyone.  But we'll continue to do our best to make the decisions that work out best for the game.<P>Alan<BR>
