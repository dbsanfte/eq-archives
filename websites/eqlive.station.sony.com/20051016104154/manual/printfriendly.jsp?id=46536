			Inspecting Another Player's Inventory
		</h2>
	
	To see if other players have
  something you might want to trade for, click on their characters. This
  targets them and, if you're standing close enough to them, opens their
  Inventory window. It is often considered polite to ask permission before
  doing such an inspection. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A> to learn how to trade.
