	<B><I>F1-F6</I></B> will target group members 1-6 respectively. <BR><BR><I>Communication</I>: Keeping in touch with group members is crucial. Before combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle. <BR><BR><I>Group Leader</I>: Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect someone to make decisions about important party matters. <BR><BR><I>Group Health</I>: The names of fellow group members appear in the group member window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health status. <BR><BR><I>Groups and Spells</I>: Some spells affect all members of a group. If you've got a spell caster in your group, it might be a good idea to pitch in and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell. <BR><BR><I>Groups and Experience</I>: Experience points are split between group members according to experience level - see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=experiencegroup">Group Experience</A>. <BR><BR><I>Splitting Loot</I>: To split coin treasure evenly, enable autosplit under <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=iogeneral">Options / General</A>. Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis. <BR><BR>
