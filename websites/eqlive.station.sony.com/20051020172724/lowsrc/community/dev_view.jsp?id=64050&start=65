<h1>Community Letter from John Smedley</h1>
	<p>Hello everyone, </p> <p>It's amazing that we're now six years since the launch of EverQuest, and even more amazing to see so many people enjoying the world of Norrath. I know that the development team has exciting stuff planned for the coming months (look for an announcement soon!) and they are dedicated to keeping EQ fresh and alive with all the best technology has to offer. </p> <p>EverQuest is in its 6th year of existence and while we have continued to bring new content for everyone to enjoy, the cost of operating a top tier MMO has increased significantly during the past three years. Today I am writing to tell you all that we will be increasing the subscription rate for EverQuest <i></i>effective June 12, 2005 . The new monthly subscription rate will be $14.99/month. </p> <p>We strive to ensure that EverQuest remains a great entertainment value. No other game offers the detailed gameplay, huge world and tight-knit community that EverQuest offers. The monthly subscription fee allows us to provide the best possible gaming experience for you while also expanding the world. The EverQuest team is dedicated to providing fresh and dynamic content to the players with in-game events, quests, zone re-vamps, game enhancements and great new expansion packs. </p> <p>To thank the EverQuest community, we're offering players a limited-time promotional offer. Between May 12, 2005 and June 11, 2005, you can take advantage of a 6 or 12 month limited time subscription and reap great savings. Just go <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/faqs/faq_rate.jsp">here</a> for more details. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions and these increases will not affect the <a href="http://www.stationaccess.com">Station Access</a> subscription rate, which will hold at $21.99. </p> <p>We sincerely appreciate all of you who inhabit our EverQuest universe and we look forward to continue having you be a part of our world for years to come. </p> <p>Thanks, </p> <p>John Smedley </p>
