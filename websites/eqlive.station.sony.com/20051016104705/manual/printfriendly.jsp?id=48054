  line. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 69 seconds (about three seconds
  of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Mass Group Buff</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Shaman the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of
  affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the
  caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice
  as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use
  up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The
  Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Pet Discipline</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability
  allows the Shaman to better control his pet. The command &quot;/pet
  hold&quot; will prevent the pet from attacking any foe, even if that foe
  attacks the pet or its master. The pet will remain passive until given
  another command. <BR><BR><EM>Quick Buff</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting
  time for beneficial buff spells with a duration. Some spells may be
  specifically excluded from benefiting by this ability. The first skill level
  reduces casting times on buff spells by 10%, the second skill level makes the
  reduction 25% and the third makes the reduction 50%. <BR><BR><EM>Rabid Bear</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives
  the Shaman the power to transform into a bear. The Rabid Bear form boosts all
  of the Shaman's combat abilities. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 120
  minutes (forty hours of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 8 skill
  points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Priest Archetype ability Spell
  Casting Reinforcement) - This ability raises the increased duration granted
  by Spell Casting Reinforcement to 50%.
