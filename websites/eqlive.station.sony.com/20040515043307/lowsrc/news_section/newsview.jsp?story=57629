	<h2>EQ Zones Revamp Report</h2>
	
	We're bringing even more excitement to <EM>EverQuest</EM> game play! So, in case you've missed the past couple months' Recent Updates announcements, here's a recap of the latest zone enhancements: 
<P><STRONG>CHARDOK</STRONG></P>
<P>Unusual rumors abound on Chardok. Are the sources reliable? Is there really strife within the Council of the (Overking)? And what about the "Halls of Betrayal", Chardok's "pocket zone"?&nbsp;EverQuest pocket zones are created to help tell a story, and are only around for a little while.&nbsp;So, check it out before it's gone! </P>
<P><STRONG>RALLOS ZEK</STRONG></P>
<P>The Warlord is ticked off, so&nbsp;be sure to stay in a raiding party of no less than 20&nbsp;when&nbsp;dealing with&nbsp;Rallos Zek! Why? If you're on Rallos Zek's hate list, he can kick you and any other single player or griefer out of the zone! And even if you're in a big raiding party,&nbsp;be careful.&nbsp;Only one raid is allowed at any time. </P>
<P><STRONG>DROGA AND NURGA</STRONG></P>
<P>These zones were revamped and exclusive to Legends, but now&nbsp;they have moved&nbsp;to the Live servers! So feel free to revisit them and&nbsp;watch out for Goblins and Burynai in the mines of Nurga!</P>
<P><STRONG>GRIEG'S END</STRONG></P>
<P>Legends players,&nbsp;be the first to experience new encounters, items, traps, and events in Grieg's newly redesigned zone.</P>
<P><STRONG>VEKSAR</STRONG></P>
<P>Explore one of&nbsp;Norrath's most persistent legends. Is there an ancient city called Veksar buried under the Lake of Ill Omen? It's up to you to discover the tale of its fate.</P>
<P><STRONG>PLANES OF POWER ZONES</STRONG></P>
<P>Great news! There's easier access to the Planes of Power for guild members who have fallen behind. You'll able to enter PoP zones by meeting these simple level requirements: If you're Level 55 and over, you can enter the Plane of Storms, the Plane of Torment, the Plane of Valor, and Crypt of Decay. If you're Level 62 and over, you can enter the Bastion of Thunder and Halls of Honor. And, even you don't meet these level requirements, you can enter these zones with existing flags or as a member of a raid. </P>
<P><STRONG>PLANE OF EARTH B</STRONG></P>
<P>Good news! There are no longer Call of the Hero restrictions in this zone!</P>
