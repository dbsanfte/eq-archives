<h1>Manual</h1>




	
		<h1>
			12
			Using Weapons
		</h1>
	
	In EverQuest, you can fight
  using short-range melee weapons (swords, clubs and so forth), ranged weapons
  (bow and arrow), or your bare hands. If you've got magical spells, you can
  use those in combat as well - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=magicusing">Using Magic</A>.
  Combat might be dangerous inside a city, as guards are there to protect the
  citizens.

	
		<h2>
			12.1
			Acquiring Weapons
		</h2>
	
	Nearly all classes get a
  basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you
  do, you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure
  you hang onto your original weapon for a while - even a basic sword isn't
  cheap, and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along
  the way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons.
  <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait,
  you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as
  good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			12.2
			Weapon Types
		</h2>
	
	You start out with a basic
  weapon, but as you progress in levels and earn more money, you'll want to
  upgrade. Even those who specialize in magic usually carry a weapon in case
  their mana supply becomes depleted. <BR><BR>There are five basic types of weapon, and a skill for using each type. All
  except for ranged attacks are melee (close combat) attacks. Some weapons are
  one-handed, meaning that you only need one hand to wield them. If you possess
  the Dual Wield skill, you can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and use
  them simultaneously during combat. Two-Handed weapons require both hands and
  a two-handed combat skill. <BR><BR><EM>Blunt</EM>: Bashing damage delivered by a dull weapon (bruises your
  opponent).<BR><EM>Slash</EM>: Slicing damage delivered by a sharp, edged weapon or a whip (cuts
  your opponent).<BR><EM>Piercing</EM>: Stabbing damage from a pointed weapon (pierces your
  opponent).<BR><EM>Ranged</EM>: Piercing damage delivered from a distance by a propelled
  weapon, such as a bow and arrow.<BR><EM>Thrown</EM>: Projectiles thrown by hand, such as darts and rocks. <BR><BR>With some skills you can deliver manual attacks during combat, such as a Kick
  or Bash. This adds to whatever weapon damage you dish out.

	
		<h2>
			12.3
			Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	Prior to fighting, run
  through a quick, mental checklist: <BR><BR>* Scribe and memorize any offensive spells you possess.<BR>* Program your Combat skills and spells (if any) to Hot Buttons.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key.<BR>* Makes sure you have a weapon in hand.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <STRONG><EM>F8</EM></STRONG>  to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><EM>Green text</EM>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><EM>Light Blue text</EM>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><EM>Blue text</EM>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it
  won't be easy.<BR><EM>White text</EM>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you
  could win.<BR><EM>Yellow text</EM>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><EM>Red text</EM>: You'll most likely die. <BR><BR><EM>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more
  help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a
  greater challenge.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			12.4
			Attacking With Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in
  EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally
  easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target,
  you can simply press <STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> (or whichever key you've remapped this
  function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your
  only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> Initiate auto-attack (on current target).<BR><STRONG><EM>Esc</EM></STRONG><EM>ape</EM> Remove current target from Target
  Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long
  as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another
  swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot).</EM> <BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If
  you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says
  &quot;Your target is too far away.&quot; Be sure to remain facing your
  target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow.
  Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and
  whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage,
  you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent
  is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and
  weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on
  your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A>, for information on how damage affects you.

	
		<h2>
			12.5
			Developing Weapon Skills
		</h2>
	
	Several things affect whether
  you get weapon-based combat skills, and whether you can accumulate more
  later. <BR><BR><EM>Class</EM>: Depending on what class you choose, you may already possess one
  or more weapon skills. Most classes with warrior abilities (Warrior, Paladin,
  Ranger and so forth) give you one or more from the very start. <BR><BR><EM>Experience</EM>: You usually gain additional fighting skills as you
  progress through experience levels. <BR><BR><EM>Practice</EM>: You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve
  your weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game
  with practice points available (and you gain five of these with each level).
  Later, you may have to pay cash along with practice points for tutoring
  sessions (right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill
  you want to practice). Some skills can only be practiced if you've reached a
  certain experience level.
