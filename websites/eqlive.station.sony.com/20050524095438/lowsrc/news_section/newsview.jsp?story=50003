	 <p align="center"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/VetRewardsHeader.jpg"> <br> <strong>Good News for Veteran EQ players</strong>! </p> <p>As part of EverQuest's 6th-Year Anniversary celebration, the game team is giving current EQ players** one special Veteran Reward for every year that you've been an active, paying EverQuest subscriber in good standing! This is very good news for six year vets! It means that you'll be getting six Veteran Rewards for up to six of your characters! </p> <p>If you are a former EQ player, any active subscription time previously accrued on a paying account in good standing will be credited toward your veteran reward when you re-activate your paid subscription. </p> <p>Note: you'll find the Veteran Rewards tab in the game's AA user interface. </p> <p>Even better news: From April 11, 2005 to May 11, 2005, any current EQ player can purchase a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/veteran_rewards_rules.jsp">12-month EQ subscription for a special price</a> ($99.99 plus applicable taxes) resulting in a potential savings of more than $50 off of the standard, monthly subscription fee. Game software is sold separately. The EverQuest Sixth-Year Anniversary 12-month Subscription fee is a <b><u>recurring</u></b> charge; that means that, unless and until you cancel your account, you authorize SOE to charge your credit card the subscription amount ($99.99 plus applicable taxes) <u>immediately</u> upon signing up for the Sixth-Year Anniversary 12-month subscription plan and again at the beginning of each subsequent 12-month subscription period. For this special offer, that means that you will be billed <u>immediately</u> in full on the day you initially sign-up for this special offer and then you will also be billed on the date that is 12 months from that date and so on.</p> <p>In addition, players who purchase the special 12-month subscription will be entitled to receive their next year&rsquo;s reward without having to wait* until their next year as a subscriber (subject to the launch date or account age calculation date of the veteran rewards program). For example, a three year veteran will be entitled to receive awards one through three for up to three characters. If he or she decides to purchase the special Sixth-year anniversary 12-month subscription plan, he or she will also be entitled to receive the fourth year award as a bonus without having to wait* until their fourth year as a qualifying subscriber. </p> <p>Additionally, six year veterans who purchase the Sixth-year anniversary 12-month subscription plan will receive the following unique seventh year reward without having to wait* until the seventh year of their qualifying subscription even though EverQuest is only now celebrating its 6 th-year anniversary. </p> <p>A special note: An EverQuest player can claim their applicable reward(s) for one additional character (up to a total of six characters) for every full year they have been actively subscribed with a fully-paid account in good standing and qualifies for the veteran reward. In addition, Veteran Rewards remain with each character for as long as that character exists. For every year that a player has been subscribed, they will be able to claim the Rewards on one character. </p> <p>SOE may, in its sole discretion, add, modify or delete veteran reward program terms or conditions with or without notice, and may terminate the program at any time. </p> <p>Veteran Rewards are as follows:<br></p> <table width="100%" border="0" align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2"> <tr> <td valign="top" align=left><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/VetRewardsBullet01.gif"></td> <td><strong>Lesson of the Devoted:</strong> The player is surrounded by a beautiful blue/white glow as they gain double experience for half an hour every 24 hours.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="145" valign="top" align=left><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/VetRewardsBullet02.gif"></td> <td width="100%"><strong>Infusion of the Faithful:</strong> Usable once every 24 hours, the player enjoys maximum resistances and statistics and a faster run speed for 15 minutes while he glows brightly with power. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" align=left><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/VetRewardsBullet03.gif"></td> <td><strong>Chaotic Jester:</strong> Summons a Bristlebane puppet that persists for 15 minutes.
