<h2>Bard</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/bard_ani1.gif" alt="Bard" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Bards are jack-of-all-trades adventurers who use music to create a wide variety of magical effects. Though they often use melee weapons, bards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield many different types of weapons and instruments.<BR><BR>Bards can do a little bit of everything. Their songs can regenerate health and mana, increase attack speed and accuracy, momentarily charm angry enemies, help friends resist many types of damage and even directly damage enemies. Bards are perhaps best known, however, for their ability to greatly increase the foot speed of their group.<BR><BR>Bards have the unique ability to create multiple effects at once. By weaving different songs together, a bard can customize effects to any situation. This makes nimble fingers and quick thinking a must for those who want to play a bard.<BR><BR>Bards do well both alone and in groups. With the right combination of songs, they can adapt to many different challenges. The bard is a great class for players who enjoy a wide variety of play options but are quick to adapt to a changing situation.</SPAN>

<h2>Beastlord</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/beastlord_ani.gif" alt="Beastlord" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons, or use their bare hands to attack.<BR><BR>Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells. Beastlords share every battle with their warders, fighting along side these fierce companions or falling back to heal and aid. <BR><BR>Beastlords also gain spells to slow or damage their opponents. Beastlords can heal and add to an ally's health and mana regeneration as well, making them a well-rounded ally in battle.<BR><BR>Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places. They depend upon coordination with their warders and well planned spells to finish every fight, but they can also aid a group through their spells and melee abilities. The beastlord is a great class for players who like the option of solo melee fights, but want to be able to help in a group.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Berserker</h2>


<img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/classicons/beserker.gif" alt="Beserker" border="0">
<br>

Berserkers are fearsome fighters that possess inordinate amounts of strength and bravery. They lunge into battle swinging large two-handed axes or hurtling throwing weapons at their prey. They carry huge axes because of the damage they deal and for the fear the weapons instill in the enemy. As great as a berserker's skill with a two-handed axe is, his skill with throwing weapons cannot be overlooked. As he becomes more powerful, he can infuse his rage into various thrown weapons, causing dire effects when they strike a foe. 
<P>With the mastery of his innate rage, the berserker also gains the ability to become "berserk,"&nbsp;a deadly state which causes a great amount of damage as a berserker's blade swings with frenzy. As dangerous as berserkers are at these moments, they become more vulnerable to enemy attacks.</P>
<P>Berserkers do not fear death and they value speed and agility over personal defense. The berserker is at his best with a group of friends and adventurers that allow him to unleash his full anger on an enemy without interruption. When standing within arm's reach of his enemy, the berserker is one of the masters of offense, crippling and maiming with impressive speed and skill. And, in situations where an enemy must be fought at a distance, the berserker has the best throwing arm of any Norrathian. </P>
<hr>

<h2>Cleric</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/cleric_ani.gif" alt="Cleric" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Clerics dedicate their lives to the gods of Norrath, gaining magical powers in exchange for their faith and service. Clerics are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield blunt weapons. <BR><BR>Clerics gain powerful healing and enhancement spells, greatly increasing the health and defenses of their group, while keeping them healed in the most dangerous battles. While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<BR><BR>Clerics are potent enemies of the undead, able to channel their holy fervor into highly destructive banishment spells. Resurrection is also the domain of the cleric, allowing them to bring their fallen companions back from the dead without the normal penalties for death.<BR><BR>With a few exceptions, clerics are dependent on being part of a group. But they are highly desirable group members. An experienced cleric is a great benefit to any group and is an excellent choice for the social player.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Druid</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/druid_ani.gif" alt="DRUID" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Druids are disciples of the wilds, following the teachings of the Norrathian gods of nature. Druids are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons and scimitars.<BR><BR>Druidic magic takes many forms, allowing the druid to fill a wide variety of roles when in a group or adventuring alone. Druids possess excellent healing abilities, powerful mana and health regenerative spells, and valuable enhancements that improve the health and armor of their group.<BR><BR>Offensively, druids are both powerful and versatile. They have access to fire and cold-based damage spells, a selection of disease and swarm spells that damage their enemies over time, and devastating banishment spells focused upon unnaturally summoned creatures. Druids also gain some of the best travel spells, including the ability to speed up their group's movement and teleport their group to distant regions.<BR><BR>Druids are a well-rounded class, prospering in both solo and grouped situations. An experienced druid is able to adventure alone, but is equally at home in a group. The druid is an excellent class for players who enjoy a variety of play styles and options.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Enchanter</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/enchanter_ani.gif" alt="Enchanter" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Enchanters are the most subtle of spell casters, with little focus on doing damage directly but tremendous impact on the world around them. Enchanters are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Enchanters specialize on improving the minds of their allies, with unmatched mana regeneration spells and mental enhancements. Haste spells are also the domain of the enchanter, providing incredible boosts in attack speed for members of their group. Enchanters have many powers of illusion as well, allowing them to take the form of many different creatures and races.<BR><BR>In battle, enchanters are able to bring order to chaotic situations, often saving their group in a fight that would otherwise be lost. Enchanters possess the ability to mesmerize their enemies, temporarily removing them from a battle. Attack slowing spells are also a specialty, dramatically lowering the speed of a monster's attacks for a period of time. In many situations, enchanters can call upon powerful charm spells to subjugate the mind of a monster and command it to do the enchanter's bidding. <BR><BR>Enchanters are a powerful class, but often rely upon a group to reach their full potential. Experienced enchanters thrive in chaotic situations where they can make the most of their offensive abilities. The enchanter is a good choice for players who enjoy playing in groups and like to take charge of challenging situations.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Magician</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/magician_ani.gif" alt="Magician" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Magicians are master summoners, able to call elemental pets to do their bidding and to conjure useful items from thin air. Magicians are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Elemental pets are at the heart of a magician's offensive strategy, and typically accompany a magician in all his adventures. This pet provides protection for its master, along with powerful attacks and special abilities. Magicians have a large selection of fire and magic-based damage spells, allowing them to mount a damaging magical assault in support of their elemental pet.<BR><BR>Magicians have a wide range of summoning spells, allowing them to conjure such diverse items as food, weapons, armor, and magical jewelry. In battle, the magician can encase his entire group in a shield of fire, damaging any opponent that strikes them. Magicians also have spells that lower a monster's resistance to magic, allowing spells to damage them more easily.<BR><BR>Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power in their area of expertise. Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation. The magician is a good choice for players who enjoy managing a powerful pet and using a tightly focused spell selection.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Monk</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/monk_ani.gif" alt="Monk" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines. Monks are a melee class with the ability to wear leather armor, wield blunt weapons, and use unarmed combat styles.<BR><BR>Monks forego heavy armor and almost all weapons in order to hone themselves into masters of combat, using their fists and a stout staff to make their mark upon Norrath. Monks learn many special attacks to enhance their damage dealing abilities, including the dragon punch and the legendary flying kick.<BR><BR>In their martial studies monks also learn other useful skills, including the ability to move silently and fall safely from great heights. Experienced monks also learn to feign death, slowing their body's functions enough to fool most observers into believing them dead - this trick often allows the monk to escape dangerous situations as monsters wander off, thinking the monk defeated.<BR><BR>Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone. The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Necromancer</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/necromancer_ani.gif" alt="Necromancer" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Necromancers are servants of the dark gods, studying ancient and mysterious tomes to gain power over the world of the dead. Necromancers are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Necromancers are able to raise the dead, commanding them to do their bidding and aid them in battle. A skeletal servant often accompanies the necromancer in her adventures throughout Norrath. Necromancers have mastered the powers of poison and disease, allowing them to assault their enemies with damaging afflictions that savage their vitality over time. <BR><BR>Necromancers learn to control and mimic the dead, allowing them to escape harm, convert their health to mana, and bend the minds of the undead to serve their cause. The power of shadow also is within the domain of the necromancer, with spells that bind and choke their enemies in darkness, hide the necromancer in a cloak of invisibility, and teleport through the shadows to escape danger.<BR><BR>Necromancers are a very self-sufficient class and often choose to adventure alone, though they can provide great value to a group as well. The necromancer is an excellent choice for the independent player who enjoys a wide variety of abilities.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Paladin</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/paladin_ani.gif" alt="Paladin" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath.

They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<BR><BR>Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<BR><BR>Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Ranger</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/ranger_ani.gif" alt="Ranger" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Rangers are warriors attuned to the ways of nature, able to call upon the power of the wild to aid them in their fights. Rangers are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Rangers are scouts and hunters, able to track enemies from a great distance and engage them with deadly ranged attacks, but rangers can also fight well in a melee, using two weapons to attack their foes. <BR><BR>Rangers have spells drawn from nature. They can increase run speed and add to an ally's armor, health or ability to attack.

A ranger's bow is a welcome addition to a group, adding a good deal of damage. The ranger is a great class for players who like to engage in melee battles between trips to explore the broad expanse of Norrath.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Rogue</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/rogue_ani.gif" alt="Rogue" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Rogues are the stealthy thieves and vicious assassins that stalk the shadows of Norrath.

The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Shaman</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/shaman_ani.gif" alt="Shaman" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<BR><BR>Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<BR><BR>The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<BR><BR>Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations.

Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<BR><BR>Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.

Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<BR><BR>Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.</SPAN>
<hr>

<h2>Wizard</h2>


<img src="/images/classicons/wizard_ani.gif" alt="Wizard" border="0">
<br>

<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Wizards dedicate their lives to learning the powers of fire, ice, and magic; channeling their knowledge into ever more destructive spells to unleash upon their enemies. Wizards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Wizards are the most single-minded of spell casters, with the majority of their spells dedicated to delivering massive amounts of damage as rapidly as possible.
