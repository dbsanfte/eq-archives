		<h2>
			10.2
			Improving Skills and Training
		</h2>
	
	The more you use a skill, the
  better you become at it. When you improve a skill ranking, a message appears in
  your Chat Window. In order for a skill to improve, your character must know
  the basics (for some skills this will require expending at least one practice
  point in that skill). Skill rankings are tied to your experience level - you
  can only improve a skill so much at Experience Level 1, improve it a bit more
  at Level 2, more at Level 3, and so on. <BR><BR>You can develop as many skills as you like - there's no limit. Some skills,
  however, are better suited for certain races, occupations or experience
  levels. <BR><BR>One good way to increase your proficiency in a certain skill is to visit a
  trainer. Trainers are usually masters of certain skills, and are willing to
  teach you. As a new character, you can visit your Guild hall and spend
  practice points, credits toward training. Later, you'll have to pay for
  lessons. <BR><BR>To approach a trainer: <BR><BR>* Visit your Guildhall (your starting note will usually tell you who to look
  for).<BR>* Right-click on the Guild Master or a trainer.<BR>* The skill page pops up - click on the skill you wish to improve.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Train</STRONG>.<BR><BR>Some skills can't be practiced until you reach a certain experience level
  (noted on the skill when you visit the trainer). For these, you'll need to
  practice at least once to learn the basics of that skill.
