			Communicating
		</h2>
	
	<P>EverQuest provides an ongoing source of social interaction. You can chat
  with fellow players on message boards, or talk to NPCs and other players
  within the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity
  &quot;hear&quot; you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text
  portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send
  private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and
  all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>To send messages to characters near&nbsp;you&nbsp;in the game:</EM> <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text
  cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message.<BR><EM>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode,
  which is the default setting.</EM></P>  <P><EM>To send messages only to a specific character:</EM></P>  <P>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to
  activate the text cursor.<BR>* Type /tell [charactername] [your message].<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. </P>  <P>Use the <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> key to reply to the last person that sent you a
  /tell. <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> puts /tell [charactername] into your chat bar for you.
  All you have to do then is type the message and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>.</P>  <P><EM>To talk to a non-player character (such as
  a shopkeeper NPC):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the
  Target Window), then press <EM><STRONG>h</STRONG></EM>.<BR><EM>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</EM><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate keywords
  - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using those
  words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><EM>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using
  inappropriate language.</EM> </P>
