	<h2>EverQuest Turns Two!</h2>
	
	March 16, 2001 marks the second anniversary of EverQuest. It's been a great two years and the game has come a long way since the early days! Not only have we seen the popularity of the game continue to soar, but we've also seen two expansions that added completely new continents continents that are filled with new creatures, new quests, and new challenges.<br>
<br>
To commemorate this special event, we're pleased to unveil a new Quicktime movie of EverQuest, featuring an original musical composition from Sam Powell (who also did the recent musical score for The Scars of Velious), shot by Travis Ball, and edited by Paul Tighe.  You can check it out in on our special <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp">2nd Anniversary site</A>!<br>
<br>
As a special surprise, we're also releasing one of the earliest forms of the EverQuest client. Less than 2 megs zipped up, it's well worth the download if you're interested in seeing how EverQuest started.  You can find this proof of concept client <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/eqclient.jsp">right here</A>.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks to all the many people who have shared in the grand adventure that is EverQuest.
