<h1>Favorite EverQuest: Gates of Discord feature</h1>
	<P><EM>Greetings Norrathians,</EM></P>
<P><EM>I thought it might be interesting to ask some of the designers what their favorite feature in EverQuest: Gates of Discord is and this is how two of them responded.</EM></P><IMG hspace=5 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/team_Carly.jpg" align=left border=0> 
<P><STRONG>Carly (Xenaida) Towle, Game Designer</STRONG></P>
<P>I think that there are a lot of interesting features and exciting new things in Gates of Discord. If I had to choose one, I would say that I am most interested in the leadership experience. </P>
<P>I am always looking for new ways to improve my own characters, and I think that leadership experience will be a fun addition. I am looking forward to the new tools that go along with it, both for exploring on my own and hunting in groups. I don't really want to say too much about the way it works, but definitely check it out when you pick up Gates of Discord.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><IMG hspace=5 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/team_Alan.jpg" align=left border=0> 
<P><STRONG>Alan (Absor) VanCouvering, Game Designer</STRONG></P>
<P>My favorite thing about the Gates of Discord expansion?&nbsp; That's a tough question, especially if you consider that this is the first expansion that I've actually worked on.&nbsp; Up until now I've just been a spectator, and I suspect that I have prejudice in favor of things I've helped out with.</P>
<P>But if forced to choose, I'd give two answers.&nbsp; First, I love the new golems.&nbsp; I think I said that about the new golems in Lost Dungeons as well, so maybe I have some sort of affinity for the big, lumbering oafs.&nbsp; If you ever see one swim (and golems certainly should not be doing a lot of swimming...) I think you'll agree with me.</P>
<P>I'm a simple fellow, and I like the simple things.&nbsp; So my other favorite thing in the expansion is the guy we've been calling "the angry box kicker".&nbsp; He's been given the unpleasant job of loading boxes into the storeroom on the Queen of Thorns.&nbsp; His boss is a grumpy ogre who has no tolerance for slackers.&nbsp; But our angry fellow is a mere human, and his poor back has been hurting him.&nbsp; So he kicks the boxes around the ship and down to the hold.</P>
<P>This sounds like a simple thing.&nbsp; But, as I'm sure you know, making the simple things happen is rarely easy.&nbsp; Jason Mash, the designer that made the box kicker tick, had to invent several complicated scripts to get the NPC to do what he was supposed to do.&nbsp; Every little move he makes has to be carefully planned, and until Jason got his teeth into it NPCs couldn't shove objects around like that.</P>
<P>There are all sorts of things like that on the Queen of Thorns in the Abysmal Sea.&nbsp; There are fishermen that have interesting tales to tell about the one that got away, a dedicated waitress, garden gnomes (though they don't like to be called that) and a bunch of quests for tradeskillers.&nbsp; So if you were to ask me which zone I like the best, I'd say Abysmal Sea.&nbsp; There are some extremely exciting events and some awesome things to see in the other zones (many have golems!), but I love a good story, and I think that a good game has to be founded in and surrounded by simple things that make it live.</P>
<P>Now leave me alone so I can go break bards or something :)</P>
<P><EM>Thanks to you both for shedding some light on your favorite features.&nbsp; Absor good luck with your life long dream of breaking bards.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM>Now, a question for you folks reading this, what feature are you most looking forward to in the Gates expansion?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Brenlo the Enquiring Mind</EM><BR></P>
