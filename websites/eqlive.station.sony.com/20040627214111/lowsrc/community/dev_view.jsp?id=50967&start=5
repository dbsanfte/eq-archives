<h1>Word on the new interface</h1>
	Resulka wrote:<P><B>I have to admit that I'm sort of disappointed that there has been no official word on what happened to the new user interface we were told was coming.  I mean, with as large as this release has been, I'm sure it had to be put on a back burner for later...but since you advertised it quite a bit, why didn't we hear something like, "We are working on getting this out to you as soon as possible."<P>Was it scrapped?<P>Below is the quote we received from these boards concerning the UI...<P>"Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued."<P>So, what happened?</B><P><BR>Well, we decided to hold off on the new interface.  It's going to be rolled out to all our customers, so it's not really a Luclin feature.  Because we decided to make the new interface available to everyone, we had to make sure that it would work with all of the old commands.  And since it wasn't a feature specifically for Luclin, we decided not to spend too much Luclin production time on its creation.<P>We also wanted to take the time to let folks try the interface and give us feedback before it is finalized.  We just couldn't do that under the time constraints of producing Shadows of Luclin.<P>When we have a better idea when we'll be able to release the new interface, I'll let you know.<P>Alan<BR>
