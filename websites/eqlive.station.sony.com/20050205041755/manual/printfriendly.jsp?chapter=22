			Social Scripting
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest supports a total of
  120 configurable &quot;socials&quot; in game. Along with these socials, you
  have the ability to develop custom emotes and sequences of commands.

	
		<h2>
			22.1
			Custom Animation Text
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has default text
  for all existing animations. For instance, when typing /point, or /point with
  a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the
  &quot;point&quot; animation and &quot;CharacterName points at [target]&quot;
  will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. <BR><BR>You can use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need
  to specify the &quot;target&quot; after the command as &quot;say&quot;
  followed by your custom text. For instance, typing &quot;/point say points at
  a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; will cause
  your character to execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and display
  &quot;CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is
  ready to kill it&quot; to those nearby.

	
		<h2>
			22.2
			Emote Codes
		</h2>
	
	When creating custom socials,
  you can use a series of &quot;%-codes&quot; that expand into various pieces
  of information when the social is executed. <BR><BR>The %-codes are: <BR><BR><STRONG>%M</STRONG> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet).<BR><STRONG>%T</STRONG> - Returns the current target.<BR><STRONG>%S</STRONG> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (He, She, It).<BR><STRONG>%O</STRONG> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (Him, Her, It).<BR><STRONG>%P</STRONG> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (His, Her, Its).<BR><STRONG>%R</STRONG> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).
  <BR><BR>For example, if you have a target of &quot;a gnoll&quot;, the following
  emote: <BR><BR>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <BR><BR>...Your character will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation with a text
  output of &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready
  to kill it.&quot;

	
		<h2>
			22.3
			Pauses in Socials
		</h2>
	
	You may enter pauses in
  social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to
  600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of
  seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <BR><BR>For example, a social consisting of: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/cast 1<BR>/pause 100<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds
  after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <BR><BR>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another
  social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command
  is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line. <BR><BR>For example: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/pause 100,/cast 1<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that
  the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and
  MUST be specified first on the line.
