			Minimize (Window Settings)

	Not all windows can be minimized. Minimizing a window shrinks it down to only display its title bar. The window can me restored to its normal size by right-clicking on the title bar and choosing 'minimize' again. <BR><BR><I>Note: Minimize is not the same as resize. If you drag the window borders to make the window smaller, minimize will not restore it to its normal size. You will need to drag the borders back out to return the window to its original size.</I> <BR><BR>
