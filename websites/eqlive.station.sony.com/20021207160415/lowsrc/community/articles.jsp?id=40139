<h2>Using the Report Feature</h2>
<CENTER>
<CENTER>
<CENTER>
<DIV align=center>
<P align=center><B><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color=#ff9900 size=4><SPAN class=header>Using the /report feature </SPAN><BR></FONT></B></P>
<P align=left>The /report feature is designed to give customers a way to send us the text that they see on their screen. The reasons to do so are as varied as there are players of EverQuest, but there are some common uses for this feature. You can use it to report foul language, harassment, scams or bugs. As long as there is some text that has appeared in your chat window that you would like us to see, you can report it. For example, if you think there is a bug with faction message that you received after killing a certain NPC, you can use /report to show us the faction message.</P>
<P align=left>The /report function captures the last ten lines that are visible in your chat window and stores them in a searchable database. So, if you have enlarged your chat window to accommodate 16 lines of text, and you want to /report 9 of them, just make sure that the last line you wish to report is at the bottom of your chat window.</P>
<P align=left>There are two things to note about the above paragraph. First, and bolded, is that the function only sends text that you can see. If the text that you want to report has scrolled up out of your chat window, then you will need to use the SHIFT-PAGE UP keys (or the scroll bar) to scroll up your chat window until you can see the text that you want to report. It might be a good idea to move to a location that doesn't have too much chat going on to make it easier to isolate the information you want to report.</P>
<P align=left>The second thing to note is that this information is stored in a database. It is not reported directly to a Guide or a GM. If you want to bring this information to the immediate attention of a GM (it should be noted that only GMs have access to this information, Guides do not), then you should follow your /report with at /petition. Include as many details as you can in the petition, and make sure to mention that you placed a report.</P>
<P align=left>Not all /reports need to be followed up with a /petition. If you just want some information on record in our database, then no petition would be needed. For example, if you find someone's language to be offensive, but you are about to log off or just don't think that a single instance of such language is worth a petition, then you can report the text and it will be available for future reference.</P>
<P align=left>It is also important to note that you can add a parameter to the /report function. The format for the feature is:</P>
<P align=left>/report &lt;subject&gt;</P>
<P align=left>You can use anything as the subject. Often the best subject is a character name. You should put a subject in the report almost every time you use the feature.</P>
<P align=left>If you are reporting the actions of another player, such as foul language, then include the name of that character after the /report. Make sure to spell the name correctly.</P>
<P align=left>In other cases you should include your own character's name in the report. This makes it easier for our GMs to find the report when you petition with your concern. So if you want to report a bug that has affected your character, scroll up to the text that shows the bug and type /report yourcharactername, then send a /petition with all the information about the problem and mention that you have placed a report as well.</P>
<P align=left>You could also use the type of problem for the subject. For example you might use "/report faction" if you want to report a faction problem. If you send a petition after the report, please include the subject so the GM can find it more easily. If you don't petition, the subject will help us when we look for reports about faction issues.</P>
<P align=left>In summary, the important details about using /report:</P>
<P align=left>1) Make sure that the text that you wish to report is visible on your screen<BR>2) Include a subject after the /report (i.e. /report faction)<BR>3) Send a /petition if you would like someone to look up your report. Include the fact that you've sent a report in your petition</P>
<P align=left>The /report function is a very useful tool for our customers if used correctly. Hopefully we have provided you with the information you need to get the most out of this tool.</P>
<P align=left>Additional Note: There is a spam-resistant feature on the /report function. Only one report can be sent at a time. This spam-resistant feature is reset each time you zone. So if you need to report a second instance or you need to send multiple reports to capture the complete information, you will need to zone between each report.<BR></P></DIV></CENTER></CENTER></CENTER><!-- #EndEditable -->
