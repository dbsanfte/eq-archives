		<h2>
			18.1
			Finding Quests
		</h2>
	
	Once you're fairly familiar with the game, you may be ready to take on a quest, or an adventure with a specific goal. Most quests offer some sort of reward. <BR><BR><I>Ready-Made Quests</I>. Many non-player characters have small quests. The best way to find out what they are is to hail various NPCs and ask. Non-player characters have certain keywords marked in square brackets - for example, "I need some help with my [problem]." If you respond with a question that includes that keyword, you'll receive more information. <BR><BR><I>Player-Created Quests</I>. Players can create their own quests and publicize them via chat or message boards. Keep your eyes and ears open for any interesting opportunities. <BR><BR><I>Miscellaneous Events</I>. Some of the more creative EverQuest players organize public events. These include advertised duels, weddings between characters, celebrations, and in some cases, even lotteries and contests. <BR><BR>

			Participating in Groups
		</h2>
	
	Adventuring outside the city can be dangerous. Joining a group can help you defeat monsters that you normally can't kill, carry items that won't fit into your inventory, and progress through levels faster than you would alone. <BR><BR>Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is based on the levels of the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>When starting a party, consider the skills of each member that you invite. You want a good mixture of combat, spell-casting and healing abilities. At the very least, make sure you have a couple of strong fighters, a wizard, magician, necromancer or enchanter to cast spells, and someone else with healing powers (like a cleric). Use variations of the "/who" command to see players of a certain level, race or class. <BR><BR>Groups are temporary groupings, as opposed to Guilds, which allow an ongoing affiliation between players. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			18.3
			Joining/Leaving/Disbanding a Group
		</h2>
	
	You can either invite someone to join your group, or accept an invitation from someone else who has started a group. <BR><BR><I>To invite a player to join your group:</I> <BR><BR>* Target the player.<BR>* Click the <B>Invite</B> button in the Group Window.<BR><BR>The player you're inviting receives the invitation in the Chat Window, and his or her "Invite" button changes to "Follow". <BR><BR><I>To accept a group invitation:</I> <BR><BR>* Ask to join a group or wait for someone to invite you to join.<BR>* Click the <B>Follow</B> button in your Group Window (the button then reverts back to "Invite").<BR><BR><I>To leave a group (or dissolve a group you started):</I> <BR><BR>* Click <B>Disband</B> button in your Group Window.<BR><BR>

			Group Notes and Tips
		</h2>
	
	<B><I>F1-F6</I></B> will target group members 1-6 respectively. <BR><BR><I>Communication</I>: Keeping in touch with group members is crucial. Before combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle. <BR><BR><I>Group Leader</I>: Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect someone to make decisions about important party matters. <BR><BR><I>Group Health</I>: The names of fellow group members appear in the group member window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health status. <BR><BR><I>Groups and Spells</I>: Some spells affect all members of a group. If you've got a spell caster in your group, it might be a good idea to pitch in and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell. <BR><BR><I>Groups and Experience</I>: Experience points are split between group members according to experience level - see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=experiencegroup">Group Experience</A>. <BR><BR><I>Splitting Loot</I>: To split coin treasure evenly, enable autosplit under <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=iogeneral">Options / General</A>. Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis. <BR><BR>
