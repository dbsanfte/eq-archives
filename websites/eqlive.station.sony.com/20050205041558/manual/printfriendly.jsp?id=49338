		<h2>
			5.8
			Alpha (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	The 'alpha' value determines
  the transparency of the window. An alpha value of 50 would make the window
  50% transparent. There are two alpha settings for windows: <BR><BR><EM>Normal Level</EM>: The Normal Level is used when the window has focus,
  meaning that your cursor is over the window or you are actively using the
  window.<BR><EM>Faded Level</EM>: The window uses the Faded Level when it is not the active
  window. The alpha level designated for the Faded window is a percentage of
  the Normal Level. This means that if the window is Normally at alpha 50 (50%
  transparent) and the Faded alpha is set to 50 as well, then when the window
  fades it will fade to 50% of the normal level (or alpha 25).
