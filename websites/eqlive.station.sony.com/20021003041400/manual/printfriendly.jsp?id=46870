		<h2>
			20.2
			Corpse Dragging (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence or risk. As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse is considered "assisting the enemy" by the inhabitants of the area. They will react accordingly.<BR><BR>
