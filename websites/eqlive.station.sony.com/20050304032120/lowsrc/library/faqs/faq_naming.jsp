<h1>Naming FAQ</h1>


<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>  <P ALIGN="center"><STRONG>Naming FAQ</STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG><BR><STRONG>Names are a very important part of your EverQuest identity. Your name
  is associated with your character even more than your race, class, or
  equipment. When choosing a name, keep in mind that it will identify you for
  many levels to come! Although SOE Customer Service staff does not like to
  interfere in your role-playing experience, there are some simple guidelines
  you should follow when creating a character name. If your name violates the
  rules outlined below, it may be changed when it is brought to the attention
  of a Guide or the GM of your server.</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG>What kinds of things should I keep in mind when creating a
  character name?</STRONG></P>  <P>You should keep in mind that the following types of names are
  unacceptable:</P>    <P>a. <U>Offensive names:</U> This includes rude, profane (swear), or vile
  words. It also includes racial slurs, sexually offensive terms, and
  references to the anatomy. A name that sounds like an offensive word
  (homonym) when sounded out will also be considered unacceptable. Commonly
  known abbreviations for offensive words will not be allowed, nor will
  intentional misspellings of offensive words. Combinations of names that
  result in an offensive phrase or word are also off-limits. Repeated attempts
  to create a character with a name in this category can result in a warning or
  banning, so please be mature and don't attempt to get these through the
  filter. If you do make a character with a name that violates this policy the
  character will be deleted, and your account may be subject to suspension or
  banning depending on the nature of the name.</P>  <P>b. <U>Religious names:</U> Don't try to name yourself Jesus or Allah or
  Beelzebub. This type of name can also offend many other players.</P>  <P>c. <U>Words that are offensive, religious, or known as part of popular
  media in another language besides English.</U></P>  <P>d. <U>Trademarked services, concepts or products:</U> Trademarked names
  are not part of Norrath. Names such as Kleenex, Tylenol, Marlboro, etc. will
  not be allowed.</P>  <P>e. <U>Non-fantasy names from television, movies, comic books, books, and
  other popular media:</U> Rambo, Cinderella, Darthvader, etc. are all
  unacceptable.</P>  <P>f. <U>Common words that would not be found in a Norrathian setting:</U>  Switchblade, Microwave, Phaser, Sloegin, Website, Cannabis, Computer, etc.
  are all examples of this type of name. Also included here is slang common to
  the gaming culture, such as leet, uber, or phear.</P>  <P>g. <U>Names of NPCs and places already found in Norrath:</U> Kedge,
  Innoruuk, Trumpy, Erudin, Odus, Cindreela, Rathe, etc. will not be allowed.</P>  <P>h. <U>Names with titles in them:</U> Mothermary, Sirtallon, Lordeagle,
  Masterbob, Therogue, Ladyelise, Kingsteve, Queentara, Fatherbill, etc. are
  all unacceptable. Titles in Norrath may be bestowed in an epic quest or other
  similar event, but giving yourself a title in your name won't be allowed.</P>  <P>i. <U>Names chosen to imitate, make fun of, or harm the reputation of
  another player, SOE employee, or Guide.</U> Fitzsucks, Gmsarebad,
  Ralfencheats, Brenlo, Absor, etc. are all examples of what would fall into
  this category.</P>  <P>j. <U>l) Names of the fantasy genre which are known in popular media:</U>  Gandalf, Merlin, Belgarath, Drizzt, etc. are not allowed.</P>    <P><STRONG>That tells me a lot about my first name, but what about my
  surname?</STRONG></P>  <P>All the same rules apply to your surname. Further, the combination of
  names cannot violate any of the guidelines set forth in the Naming Policy.
  For example, the name Absolute, when combined with the surname Vodka,
  violates Naming Policy. Similarly, names such as Merr Linn, Belg Erath,
  Sylvester Stallone, Klee Necks, etc. are all unacceptable.</P>  <P><STRONG>How about apostrophes and double capitals? Can I have those in my
  first name?</STRONG></P>  <P>No, we're sorry, but you may never have apostrophes or double capitals in
  your first name.</P>  <P><STRONG>What if my chosen first name is not offensive but the name filter
  doesn't accept it?</STRONG></P>  <P>It is likely that someone else already has reserved the name, whether or
  not they are actively playing at this time.</P>  <P><STRONG>What about my surname? It's not a phrase or sentence, and it's not
  offensive, but I can't get the filter to accept it.</STRONG></P>  <P>Someone else likely already holds that surname. You can still petition and
  be granted this surname knowing that it will not be unique to your character.</P>  <P><STRONG>Ok, how about apostrophes or double capitals in my surname?</STRONG></P>  <P>Apostrophes and double capitals are allowable in a surname, particularly
  if they lend themselves to role-playing. However, apostrophes and capitals
  cannot be used to create a title or sentence, or to break up what would
  otherwise be considered an unacceptable word</P>  <P><STRONG>What about the word &quot;The&quot; as part of my surname?</STRONG></P>  <P>We're sorry, but &quot;The&quot; would make your surname into a title,
  which is not allowed.</P>  <P><STRONG>Why do I see some people running around with a &quot;The&quot; in
  their name then?</STRONG></P>  <P>In special cases, such as Events and Historical Quests, sometimes a last
  name including &quot;The&quot; is rewarded for winning a tournament or
  participating as an integral part of a Quest. Additionally, Guides and GM's
  may be seen with a &quot;The&quot; in their names.</P>  <P><STRONG>Under what circumstances can I get a name change?</STRONG></P>  <P>Customer Service will change a player's last name at his or her request,
  provided that the player is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or
  the requested combination of the first name and surname does not violate the
  Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the player
  receiving a new surname or else with the removal of the surname altogether.
  If your current surname violates naming policy, it may also be changed. Your
  first name may never be changed unless it violates naming policy.</P>  <P><STRONG>Who has the ability to change my name?</STRONG></P>  <P>Senior Guides and GMs have the ability to change names. You will need to
  petition to seek a name change. Please be patient, there are some
  time-sensitive situations on every server that may take priority over name
  changes. It is also very helpful to report names you see which you feel are in
  violation of the naming guidelines.</P>  <P><STRONG>This policy seems pretty restrictive! What kinds of names are
  encouraged?</STRONG></P>  <P>We try to promote names that are descriptive and encourage role-playing.
  Treehugger, Giantslayer, Windwalker, Stormcaller etc. are all examples of
  surnames that are encouraged and allowed. The variety of names and
  combinations that don't violate naming policy is varied and broad. We urge
  you to use creativity when choosing a name for yourself. After all, you and
  your name will be inseparable as you travel the many roads of Norrath! If you
  are still having problems after visiting this support section, you can
  contact our Technical Support Department through an email via our <U><A HREF="http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp">online
  form</A></U>.</P>
