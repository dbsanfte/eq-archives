			Modifying the User Interface
		</h2>
	
	<P>The EverQuest interface is designed to be very customizable. Doing so will probably require some knowledge of XML, and unfortunately we can't teach XML to you through this manual. But we do have a few tips for you. <BR><BR>First, read the AboutSIDL.doc in your EverQuest directory. It has information that is very helpful when modifying the EverQuest UI. <BR><BR>Also, as new looks to the interface are created by players, you will certainly be tempted to use them yourself. By all means, use them! The whole point is to allow you to customize the interface. <B><I>BUT!</I></B> You need to make certain that any files you download do not contain a virus or any other unpleasant things. The security of your computer is your responsibility. We can't check every player created file for problems with the XML, viruses or things like that. So exercise every precaution when downloading anything off the Internet. <BR><BR>Modified versions of the UI need to be kept in their own folders in the UIFiles folder in your EverQuest directory. If you modify the files in the 'default' folder those files will be replaced by our patcher the next time you log in. <BR><BR>In order to use a modification, simply type /loadskin FOLDERNAME in the chat bar in game. Don't do this in a dangerous situation; loading a new skin can cause a long delay in the refresh of your screen. If you're fighting at the time your character could be the subject of a sound beating while you're refreshing your interface. <BR><BR><BR><I>Interface Related Commands</I> <BR><BR><B>/viewport [</B><B><I>distance from left, distance from top, width, height</I></B><B>]</B> - the viewport command allows you to change the size of the gameplay area on your screen. The 'gameplay area' is the area in which Norrath is displayed. <BR><BR><B>/clearchat</B> - clears the Chat Window's scrollback buffer. <BR><BR><B>/loadskin [</B><B><I>foldername</I></B><B>] [</B><B><I>1/0</I></B><B>]</B> - the 'foldername' is the name of the folder where the skin you want to load is (that folder MUST be in the UIFiles folder). The last argument should be 1 if you want to use your current INI settings for the new skin, or 0 if you want to load the positions/sizes from the XML (and then appropriately modify them for your resolution). <BR><BR><B>Labels:</B> <BR><BR>The interface also provides Labels for some of the information that is sent to the interface. This allows you to put that information wherever you need it. <BR><BR>Put simply, a <EQTYPE>#</EQTYPE> tag in any label will cause the text of that label to be ignored, and the # will determine what value is placed in that label when drawn. Note that certain labels determine their coloring dependent on the data (such as STR, which is either green, gray, or red depending on buffs/debuffs), while others will retain the label coloring from the XML. Hopefully the label names are self-explanatory. <BR><BR>Name = 1<BR>Level = 2<BR>Class = 3<BR>Deity = 4<BR>Strength = 5<BR>Stamina = 6<BR>Dexterity = 7<BR>Agility = 8<BR>Wisdom = 9<BR>Intelligence = 10<BR>Charisma = 11<BR>Save vs Poison = 12<BR>Save vs Disease = 13<BR>Save vs Fire = 14<BR>Save vs Cold = 15<BR>Save vs Magic = 16<BR>Current Hit Points = 17<BR>Maximum Hit Points = 18<BR>Hit Point Percentage =19<BR>Mana Percentage = 20<BR>Stamina Percentage = 21<BR>Armor Class = 22<BR>Attack = 23<BR>Weight = 24<BR>Maximum Weight = 25<BR>Experience Percentage = 26<BR>Alternate Experience Percentage = 27<BR>Target Name = 28<BR>Target Hit Point Percentage = 29<BR>Group Member 1 Name = 30<BR>Group Member 2 Name = 31<BR>Group Member 3 Name = 32<BR>Group Member 4 Name = 33<BR>Group Member 5 Name = 34<BR>Group Member 1 Health Percentage = 35<BR>Group Member 2 Health Percentage = 36<BR>Group Member 3 Health Percentage = 37<BR>Group Member 4 Health Percentage = 38<BR>Group Member 5 Health Percentage = 39<BR>Group Pet 1 Health Percentage = 40<BR>Group Pet 2 Health Percentage = 41<BR>Group Pet 3 Health Percentage = 42<BR>Group Pet 4 Health Percentage = 43<BR>Group Pet 5 Health Percentage = 44<BR>Buff 1 = 45<BR>Buff 2 = 46<BR>Buff 3 = 47<BR>Buff 4 = 48<BR>Buff 5 = 49<BR>Buff 6 = 50<BR>Buff 7 = 51<BR>Buff 8 = 52<BR>Buff 9 = 53<BR>Buff 10 = 54<BR>Buff 11 = 55<BR>Buff 12 = 56<BR>Buff 13 = 57<BR>Buff 14 = 58<BR>Buff 15 = 59<BR>Spell 1 = 60<BR>Spell 2 = 61<BR>Spell 3 = 62<BR>Spell 4 = 63<BR>Spell 5 = 64<BR>Spell 6 = 65<BR>Spell 7 = 66<BR>Spell 8 = 67<BR>Your Pet's Health Percentage = 68<BR>Your Pet's Name = 69 </P>
<P><BR><BR><I>UI_character_##.ini</I> <BR><BR>For each character there is a file named UI_charactername_##.ini, where the number corresponds to the server where character exist. These files are located in your EverQuest directory, and they contain information about the settings of your interface for that character on that server. For the most part you should not need to open this file. Most of the data here can be altered by choices made in game. But there are a few lines in these files that experienced players may wish to change. <BR><BR><B>Petbars = [</B><B><I>True/False</I></B><B>]</B> - Under the settings for the [PlayerWindow] and the [GroupWindow] is a line for Petbars. Setting this line to False will turn off the display of pet health bars in these windows. <BR><BR></P>
