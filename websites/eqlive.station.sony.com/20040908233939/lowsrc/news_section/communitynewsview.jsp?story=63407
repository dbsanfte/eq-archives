	<h2>Elemental Guild on Morden Rasp is Recruiting</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	09/07/2004 2:33 pm<br>
	<P>Phantasmic Dreams is currently looking for a few good players to Transfer to Morden Rasp. We are a high-end Elemental Planar guild that has the EPs almost completely to ourselves. PD is in the process of killing the EP gods for Plane of Time access. To say that we're a raiding guild would be an understatement. We raid 7 days a week, for a total of about 60 to 70 hours. A typical week for us on Morden Rasp is knocking over 30 to 40 EP names, at least one EP god, and several higher teir back flags like Rallos Zek or Solusek Ro.</P>
<P>We are currently looking for additional high playtime players (40+ hours a week) that can dedicate 100% of their EQ time to raiding. The perfect canidate will be fully EP flagged (we are only backflagging for direly needed classes (clerics, druids, chanters, rogues - PM us if you fit that catagory)), 65th level, and over 100 AA's. Some classes require specific AA's, see our application requirements page. PD raids 6 to 8 hours a night on weekdays and 12 to 14 hours a day on weekends, 7 days a week. We start at 7 pm (1 pm on weekends) est and usually finish around 3 to 5 am est.</P>
<P>If you're a cross server transfer thinking about moving to apply with PD, please PM zyakad on our forums before putting in your transfer. We may not need your class at the given time. Don't move unless you have a confirmed invite. Our guild website is <A href="http://www.realmsonline.com/mc">www.realmsonline.com/mc</A></P><br>
