			Safe vs. Dangerous Locations
		</h2>
	
	As a new character stay near to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters. Once you venture into the wilderness, you're fair game for any non-player predators out there. Gnoll pups are notorious for ganging up on solo travelers, as are Kobolds. Generally speaking, the farther you are from a friendly city the more dangerous the area will be.<BR><BR>
