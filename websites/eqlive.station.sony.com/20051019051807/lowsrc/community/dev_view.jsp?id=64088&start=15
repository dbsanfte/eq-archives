<h1>Halfling Hodgepodge RiffRaff &#8211; Part 3</h1>
	<P>Welcome to the first edition of Halfling Hodgepodge
  RiffRaff, THE place to get to know your fellow EQ Community members
  better!&nbsp; If you would like to
  participate watch the <A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq">EQLive
  Forums</A> for information about this feature every month.</P>  <P><STRONG>Loral</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> It was early 2000 but I don't remember the
  exact date.&nbsp; My current character,
  Loral Ciriclight, was born on 2 May 2000.&nbsp; He has over 370 played days logged in
  so far with 370 more to go =)</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> I play on a
  desktop.&nbsp; &lt;flex&gt;My machine
  is a P4 3.4ghz with 1gb ram and a Geforce 6800 GT with a 1920 x 1200
  resolution 24&quot; widescreen monitor that I love more than life
  itself.&lt;/flex&gt;</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cablemodem with the occasional backup line
  drop to dial up when things go south on the cable line.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My first
  PC was a long forgotten half-elf paladin.&nbsp; One time I lost all of my gear (this
  was back when you could loot PC corpses) in the bottom of Befallen and a huge
  and powerful level 32 high elf cleric came and got it for me.&nbsp; I won't forget watching him drop down
  the well, hear the chaos of battle, and see him come back up the stairs with
  my bags and a new bone bladed claymore on his back.&nbsp; Quite a site!</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> I played a little bit of Ultima
  Online.&nbsp; I was always a social
  player.&nbsp; This nice fellow met up
  with me in the starting city and asked if I would go hunt with him.&nbsp; I went out to hunt and his two PK
  friends killed me and took my tattered clothing and what little copper I
  had.&nbsp; I never went back to MMOGs
  until EQ came out.&nbsp; I was a big
  Doom and Quake player before that but that was a lifetime before EQ.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> Level 70 with 560 AAs</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group? </EM>I much prefer to group.&nbsp; To me the true benefit of games like
  EQ come from the people you meet and the adventures you share.&nbsp; I also believe heavily in the benefits
  of pick-up groups to give me a chance to meet new friends instead of just
  hunting with the people I already know.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I like helping people.&nbsp; I
  like being able to double or even triple the hitpoints of a new player before
  he has figured out whether I am a PC or NPC.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> I am an officer and recruitment
  coordinator for Healers United on the Quellious server.&nbsp; Our whole guild exists to help the
  hunters of Norrath with their adventures and travels.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> All eight.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> He does.&nbsp; The Mother, Tunare.</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I don't think I've tried a mage or a
  beastlord yet.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> I spent 65k on the most excellent Mantle
  of Rebirth. </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&nbsp; Lost Dungeons was the first expansion
  to focus EQ around single group hunting for progressive and measurable
  rewards.&nbsp; Dragons of Norrath is a
  very close second.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> The beach of North Ro was always one of my
  favorite places.&nbsp; Plane of Torment
  and Plane of Fire were two of my favorite looking zones - no zone felt more
  like the old D&amp;D evil planes than those two.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Tunare.&nbsp; I go to Growth often to ask her
  advice.&nbsp; Her wordless expression
  usually gives me the answer I seek.&nbsp;
  The tentacle heart-valve crab thing from Plane of Torment is one of my
  favorite beasts next to the big red winged demons from Fire.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Planes of Power.&nbsp; PoP was the first expansion that
  seemed to tell people that if they don't raid, they're not playing
  right.&nbsp; It took a game that was as
  wide as the world around us and stuck it into a single path; a set of
  rails.&nbsp; I still see guilds crash
  and burn around progression through PoP while they skip tons of excellent
  raids in GoD, Omens, and Dragons.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Plane of Fear.&nbsp; It is much nicer now that our power
  has grown and now that we have the corpse alter in Dragons of Norrath; the
  wipes in Plane of Fear were the only time I had to miss work and stay up all
  night just to get my gear back.&nbsp;
  No game should make you skip work just to get your gear back.&nbsp; Plane of Sky is a close second.&nbsp; Spending 90% of your raid time corpse
  summoning is a bad way to spend a weekend.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Any complete healing / gating cleric
  mob.&nbsp; I hate those guys.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> I have a few.&nbsp; I
  have an idol of Tunare made for me by my guild leader.&nbsp; I have a Robe of Living Fungus I wear
  for formal occasions.&nbsp; I have a
  Trakanon Tooth I won on my first Trakanon raid back when he was hard.&nbsp; I have my Staff of Endless Adventure
  from the 5th year anniversary.</P>  <P><STRONG>Lumpy125CA</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> Last August during the 30 day free trail.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Half elf
  Paladin</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 38</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> I'm not picky.&nbsp; I'll do either.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> There aren't that many berserkers around; it&#8217;s nice to be an
  individual..&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes.&nbsp;
  Officer of &quot;Experience Penalty&quot;, Xegony server.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server</EM>? 8</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> No</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Enchanter, Cleric, and Wizard.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 9500pp or so on a small red Drogmor for my
  gnecro.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Lost dungeons of Norrath</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Shadeweaver's Thicket</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Fippy Darkpaw.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> I like them all.&nbsp; There are still a few things I haven't
  tried in each in expansion though.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> The Warrens.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Sgt. Slate.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> My main character's Iron Gloomingdeep axe.&nbsp; I hacked up a lot of gnolls with that
  axe.&nbsp; It still holds good memories
  for me of running through blackburrow as a youngster.&nbsp; </P>  <P><STRONG>MelodionxXx</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> Sometime late 99, I will know when exactly
  when I get my new veteran AA.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> I currently play
  on a laptop, I travel a lot for work and don&#8217;t always get the chance to
  have a desktop.&nbsp; I am a Brit
  currently in New Zealand. </P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> DSL </P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Woodie
  Ranger.&nbsp; I wanted a class with
  some versatility and variety to it. </P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Yep. </P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 70 </P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Group always.&nbsp; Solo is teh dreary.&nbsp; Why play an MMOG then solo?&nbsp; I have been in groups where I
  couldn&#8217;t type for laughing.&nbsp;
  That&#8217;s why I play EQ </P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I play a lvl 70 bard, and the versatility of the class is
  matchless.&nbsp; There's so many things
  I can do, so many solutions to each problem that its just a constant
  challenge to see quite what I can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Pulling is something I do almost constantly in groups, and for me that
  is the core of EQ. </P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yeah, I play with a bunch of Aussies, we
  are working on Uqua access at the moment </P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 8 but I only
  play 3 or 4 </P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Karana.&nbsp; Yes I know bards should be Agnostic,
  didn&#8217;t read about that till after.&nbsp;
  But bugger it, Karana is cool </P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I've played all at least a few lvls.&nbsp; The ones I quickly gave up on are all
  pure casters, only the necro lasted till 40, all the rest never got beyond
  10.&nbsp; Sit and med&nbsp; = teh yawn </P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> Couple of months back, I bought AoN for
  350k.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm an illusion nut
  (current count is 17).&nbsp; I made it
  a quest to get that much money.... now for gnome mask.... 650k&nbsp; *cry* </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> If I HAD to choose I would have to say
  PoP.... or would it be Luclin.... or would it be DoN.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P>1) PoP for
  raids.&nbsp; The PoP flagging system
  was the longest most absorbing frustrating quest I ever undertook.&nbsp; Time access took me 2 years across 2
  guilds and 3 servers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
  know all the pain of backflagging, but that was addressed very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for the sheer amount
  of time and effort and for the final wonderful sense of achievement of zoning
  into Time, this was the best expansion </P>  <P>2) DoN for groups.
  What an awesome expansion.&nbsp; This
  is everything LDoN should have been but wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; The missions are fun; the rewards are
  good enough and easy enough to get for non-raiders to get decent gear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Superb stuff!</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Gosh that&#8217;s hard...&nbsp; I think Ssraeshza Temple (i had to go
  to Alla's to remember how to spell it) has to be a strong contender just for
  the number of encounters in it.&nbsp;
  The wonderful atmosphere of the place, that kind of
  pseudo-egyptian/stargate feel to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thurgadin is another great one;
  it&#8217;s the most alive of the city zones. </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> Illusionist Lobaen in PoK library.&nbsp; If you know the NPC you know what I
  mean /wink </P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> GoD, easy one.&nbsp; I hate it even more than I hate the
  dreary endless grind of LDoN (though i can see that LDoN was a necessary step
  on the path to DoN).&nbsp;&nbsp; I
  remember when GoD first came out.&nbsp;
  Trash mobs would take down the best geared toons faster than you could
  cast a quick heal.&nbsp; It was insane,
  it was the most unbalanced, buggy, poorly thought out expansion ever like the
  developers thought, &#8220;OOH how much damage can these mobs do.... ooooh
  make em quad... oooh make em hit for 900..... OOOOH that&#8217;s not enuff
  make em proc for hundreds more..... OOOOH&quot;.&nbsp; The mobs had to be nerfed twice before
  it even began to be reasonable, how could something that bad be released.....
  OMG I just ranted.... Sorry &gt;.&lt; but I &quot;really&quot; hate GoD now
  hehe. </P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Ferubi </P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Ukun, Noc, Kyv, Moodhoro Finharn... take
  your pick =) </P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> My bank is full of this kind of stuff hehe.&nbsp; I would never ever destroy my Coldain
  Shawl.&nbsp;&nbsp; That has to be the
  quest I most enjoyed of all I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; Made me realize what a wonderful
  zone Thurgadin is,&nbsp; all the little
  stories going on, all the little bits of lore you picked up on the way during
  the quest and the final encounter.&nbsp;
  I will never destroy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s a bunch
  of others e.g. my Toetwister will last forever, my first proper bard raid
  drop weapon but the shawl is really the one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a dream that one
  day there will be a follow on quest to enhance it further.... Dream on.. </P>  <P><STRONG>Nekozilla</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> About 4 or 5 years ago my little brother
  got it for me for Christmas</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> I play on my
  desk top</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> I originally played on dial up but then
  switched over to DSL when I got a chance</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My first
  toon was a Wood Elf Ranger</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> No, my first online game was Mech Warrior
  3, I ruled at that game ^_^</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ? </EM>Currently my highest is 53 (I like to chat
  a lot in place of actually killing and leveling)</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> It all depends on my mood, I usually go
  towards group or duoing with a friend</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character? </EM>I liked the mix of magic and combat</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes, it&#8217;s a small family guild but
  full of good folks</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server? </EM>Well I have
  all 6 of my toons on the same server</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Yes, she worships Tunare</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I have yet to play a Necro, Mage, or
  Wizard</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 20k on this 1hb I got for my Ranger, which
  *sighs* has a level 55 restriction on it......</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> I love the Planes of Power</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> When first started to play I loved The
  Estate of Unrest.&nbsp; All of my alts
  have gone there or will be going there to hunt at some point</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> That&#8217;s a hard one.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I have a favorite
  one though any dragon would get my vote</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> LDoN, only because when I wanted to get a
  group no one wanted a ranger, when I moved on and got involved in something
  else all of the sudden I was being asked to join up... to this day I have
  still never done a LDoN Dungeon crawl with ANYONE!</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Any jungley zones like emerald jungle too
  many low trees make me lag and its hard to see.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Dvinn, that dark elf has killed all of my
  toons multiple times.... Fabled Dvinn was even worse.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons? If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> The Bow I got from the 5th anniversary
  event when the skeletal commanders would come out at dusk.&nbsp; I had some very kind folks from a high
  end guild get on their alts and form up groups to take them out.&nbsp; I still keep it just because it was so
  much fun to get it.</P>
