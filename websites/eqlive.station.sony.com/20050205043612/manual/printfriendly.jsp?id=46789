			Dueling
		</h2>
	
	Even if you're not on a
  player vs. player server you can still challenge someone to a duel. Once you
  start a duel, it continues until one player defeats the other, or one player
  leaves the zone. Only player characters can duel. <BR><BR><EM>To start a duel:</EM> <BR><BR>* Target the player you want to duel.<BR>* Type /d and press <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>To accept a duel, your target must follow these same steps. <BR><BR>Dying during a duel is similar to dying in any other manner - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>.
  <BR><BR><EM>Note: For non-player-killers, participating in a duel doesn't give the
  winner the right to loot the loser's corpse.</EM>
