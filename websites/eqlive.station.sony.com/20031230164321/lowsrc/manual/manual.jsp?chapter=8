			8
			Manipulating Items
		</h1>
	
	The world of Norrath is an abundant world full of items you can pick up, buy, sell, use or transform. When your character is "born" he already has several items - a basic weapon, some food and water, and a scroll or two (items vary slightly, depending on your class and race). <BR><BR>Before long, you'll acquire some valuables. Eventually, you'll want to buy containers to store your items, or put items in a bank for safekeeping. <BR><BR>Some items on your person can't be dropped, sold or traded (such as your starting food and weapon). To remove these items from inventory, you must either store them in a bank or destroy them. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.1
			Viewing Your Inventory
		</h2>
	
	Inventory management is an indispensable skill. If you're a pack rat you'll constantly need to reassess what you're carrying and figure out what to do with the items you've accumulated. <BR><BR>You can view your inventory by clicking on the Inventory Icon. <BR><BR><I>You can also access your inventory by hitting <B>i</B></I>. <BR><BR>The detailed view of your inventory is divided into several sections. You can place specific items on different parts of your body - hands, fingers, feet, etc. <BR><BR>Eight general inventory slots show all items in your possession that aren't coins, armor or weapons you're holding (stored weapons do show up, however). Use these slots to store items that you aren't wearing, as well as coins and weapons that aren't in use. <BR><BR><I>Note: Backpacks don't fit into your characters "back" inventory slot. They only fit into general inventory slots.</I> <BR><BR>For certain items, you can stack more than one of that item in a single slot. The small number in the corner of the slot indicates how many items of that type are stacked. A stack can never contain more than 20 items. <BR><BR>The coin window shows how many platinum, gold, silver and copper coins you have (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=moneymatters">Money Matters</A> for details). Coins can be stacked, and there's no limit to how many you can carry. If you're trading with another player or depositing/withdrawing funds at a bank, click on a coin slot to display a slider. Use the slider to control how many coins you're fishing out of your coin purse. You can also type the number of coins you wish to pick up into the box provided. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.2
			Holding and Wearing Items
		</h2>
	
	Items stored in a general inventory slot are not in use. If you want to hold a weapon or wear a new item of armor or clothing, you've got to move it to the right location slot: <BR><BR>* Click on an item in a general inventory slot.<BR>* Once the item is floating on your cursor, click on an appropriate location slot.<BR><BR>Use this same click-and-drop method to take off a wearable item or store a weapon. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.3
			Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items
		</h2>
	
	You can pick up items you find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped, traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form of a small, brown bag. <BR><BR><B>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</B> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<B><I>i</B></I>).<BR>* Click on the item (it "floats" on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <I>To drop it</I>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <I>To give it to someone</I>, click on that person. This will open the Trade window. Just click <B>Trade</B> to give them the item (the person receiving your gift will also have to click Trade to complete the trade, so don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <I>To destroy it</I>, click <B>Destroy</B>.<BR><I>Note: Once you destroy an item, it is gone. Make sure you really want to destroy the item (and that you have the correct item) before clicking Destroy.</I> <BR><BR><B>To pick up an item from the ground:</B> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot .<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.4
			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player, see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=giving">Giving/Trading Items</A>. <BR><BR><I>To buy/sell an item:</I> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<I>Note: you will have to be relatively close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only receive the "consider" information for the merchant, not the merchant window</I>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <B>Purchase</B> or <B>Sell</B> to purchase or sell the quantity of items you've selected.<BR><BR><I>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</I> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the Control key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. To buy or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.5
			Giving/Trading Items
		</h2>
	
	You sometimes find that you need (or don't want) a particular item. You can sell or buy from other players. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves through the Trade Window. <BR><BR>No transaction is final until both players agree to it. <BR><BR><I>To give away/trade/sell an item to another player:</I> <BR><BR>* Open your Inventory screen (<B><I>i</I></B>) and select an item or amount of coins (this should 'float' the item on your cursor).<BR>* Click on the character you wish to trade with.<BR>* This will open the Trade Window.<BR><BR>The trade window has two sections, one for the items and/or coin that you are trading out and one for the items and/or coin that the other character wishes to trade. At this point you may add or remove items or coins from this window as you see fit. <BR><BR><I>Note: The Trade Window will close if you move too far from the other person.</I> <BR><BR>Both players must click <B>Trade</B> to complete the action. If either player puts another item into the trade window after one player clicks Trade, he/she will have to click the button again. <BR><BR><I>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal as it is.</I> <BR><BR><B>Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming items!</B> If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). <BR><BR><I>Note: Items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items, and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing quests that give items as rewards.</I><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.6
			Inspecting Another Player's Inventory
		</h2>
	
	To see if other players have something you might want to trade for, click on their characters. This targets them and, if you're standing close enough to them, opens their Inventory window. It is often considered polite to ask permission before doing such an inspection. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=giving">Giving/Trading Items</A> to learn how to trade. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.8
			Item Flags
		</h2>
	
	When you inspect an item (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags printed right below the name of the item: <BR><BR><B>Magic Item</B>: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures that can only be harmed by magic. <BR><BR><B>Lore</B>: This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <BR><BR><B>NoDrop</B>: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests. <BR><BR><B>No Rent</B>: A no rent item will disappear from your inventory 30 minutes after logging out. <BR><BR><B>Artifact</B>: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power. <BR><BR><B>Item Size</B>: The size of any item will be listed (and for containers it will show what sized items it will hold). This should make organizing your inventory a little easier. <BR><BR><B>A Deity's Name</B>: If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <BR><BR><B>Weight Reduction</B>: If a percentage for weight reduction is listed on a container, that container will reduce the weight of any item placed into it by that percentage while it is in the container.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.9
			Auctioning Items
		</h2>
	
	As you advance in the game, you'll find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your jewelry-making kit. Or, you could need a spell ingredient yourself - the old adage "one man's trash is another man's treasure" holds true in EverQuest as well. <BR><BR>Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in your playing zone can hear. Unlike "/shout" (which is reserved for critical situations), "/auction" is only used for buying and selling items. The preferred usage is "WTB" (want to buy) or "WTS" (want to sell), followed by a description of the item. <BR><BR>To send a message to the auction chat channel, just type /auction [text]. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.10
			Containers and Banks
		</h2>
	
	You've only got eight general inventory slots, several of which are nearly always occupied by food and drink. Some items can be stacked on top of one another in a single slot, such as fish, bread and arrows. Other items take up an entire slot. All add weight to your character. If you don't want to continually sacrifice one item for another, try purchasing a container or finding a bank. <BR><BR><B>Containers</B> <BR><BR>Purchase backpacks, bags and other containers to increase your carrying capacity. By placing items inside a container, you can fit multiple possessions into a single slot. To open a container, right-click on it. <BR><BR>Certain containers also serve as catalysts for creating items - for instance, you need a bowl to make bread, and a sewing kit to stitch things together. <BR><BR><B>Banks</B> <BR><BR>Banks will gladly store coins for you, and they're also a great way to store inventory items. Banks in Norrath are well connected - even if you travel abroad, any banker can instantly conjure up your items. You've got eight bank inventory slots at your disposal. If you go to another bank, you don't get additional slots. <BR><BR><I>To put an item in the bank:</I> <BR><BR>* Find a bank and right-click on the banker. Eight bank inventory slots appear for you to use.<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory (it "floats" on your cursor).<BR>* Click on a bank inventory slot. <BR><BR>To withdraw an item from a bank, reverse the steps above. <BR><BR><I>Note: Bank inventory slots work the same way as your character's general inventory slots. This means that you can use containers in the bank to increase your storage capacity.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.11
			Eating and Drinking
		</h2>
	
	Bread, milk and water are staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items, along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with 20 skins of milk and 20 loaves of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time). <BR><BR>When you're running low on either item, your text display shows "You are low on food" or "You are low on drink". If you don't find food or drink soon you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health and stamina suffer. <BR><BR>Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and other items (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=buying">Buying/Selling Items</A>). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement skills and agility. Such items must be manually consumed. <BR><BR><I>To eat/drink an item:</I> <BR><BR>* View your inventory (<B><I>i</I></B>).<BR>* Right-click on the item you wish to consume.<BR><BR>Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used as needed. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it. <BR><BR>
