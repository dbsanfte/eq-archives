<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>THE SHADOWS OF LUCLIN&#153; FAQ</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left><B><I>Section #1 - Overview</I></B></P>
<P align=left><B>1.0 What is EverQuest: the Shadows of Luclin?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>EverQuest: the Shadows of Luclin is an expansion to the world-renowned game EverQuest. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>1.1 What are the features?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here is a partial feature list. Please note that this feature set is subject to change prior to release. </P>
<UL>
<LI>A massively enhanced 3D graphics engine that makes use of newer technologies allowing us to support higher poly counts and more detailed textures 
<LI>Over 25 new zones including a new starting city 
<LI>All new, highly detailed player-character models 
<LI>An all-new player character race: The Vah Shir (Kerrans)

<LI>Additional non-level-based advancement options for those at level 51 or higher 
<LI>New quests, items, NPCs, and more!</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>1.2 Will the minimum system specification for Luclin be raised above that of Velious?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, Luclin is a very ambitious title. In addition to a rich in-character feature set, Luclin will sport some of the most stunning visuals yet to be seen in online games. In order to achieve this, the minimum system specification for Luclin will roughly coincide with that of games being released today.</P>
<P>The system specs will be released closer to the expansion's release date.</P>
<P><B><A name=121></A>1.2.1 What will the minimum system specification be?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Required Specs:</B></P>

<LI>Windows&reg; 98/2000/ME/XP 
<LI>Pentium&reg; II 400Mhz or greater 
<LI>256 MB RAM

<P align=left><B>1.3 What is the projected release date?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luclin will go live in December of this year.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>1.4 Will there be a beta? How do I get in?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes. Luclin will be tested via a closed beta system expected to begin around August. People will be invited individually based upon past demonstrated desire to test and assist in EverQuest's development. As such, people who actively play on the Test server will get priority.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>1.5 Will Luclin be sold? In what form?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, Luclin will be sold; however the precise format of sales is still to be determined.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>1.6 We have 4 accounts in our family. Will we need to buy a copy of Luclin for each one?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, you will need to buy a copy of Luclin for each account that you wish to access Luclin content.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><IMG height=30 src="/images/tribal_divider.gif" width=251></P>
<P align=left><I><B>Section #2 - General Gameplay</B></I></P>
<P align=left><B><BR>2.0 Where is Luclin set?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luclin is the name of the ringed moon that orbits Norrath which currently can only been seen via the Plane of Sky. We expect that Al`Kabor will soon pierce the veil of shadow that hides it from view elsewhere in Norrath. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>2.1 What level range will Luclin support?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Luclin will support players of all levels, much like Kunark.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>2.2 Will the maximum level be increased beyond 60?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No, but we are planning on including some non-level-based advancement options for those who wish to advance their characters further. The advancement will be measurable but subtle, so-as not to give anyone the feeling that they are required to advance as many felt upon the release of Kunark.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>2.3 If we did not buy Kunark or Velious, will buying Luclin allow our characters to exceed 50th level?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>2.4 How do we get our characters from Norrath to Luclin?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Giant steam-powered gnomish rocketships</P>
<P>Just kidding. Keep an eye on the Journal of Al`Kabor. Something tells me he may have some idea about how it's accomplished.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B><A name=251></A>2.5 I know you are still in the process of creating everything. I just want to know if I have messed up my faction with the cat-people race on Kerra ridge by killing that named tiger, am I going to be KOS when and if I go to the moon?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As the moon of Luclin has been unreachable for a great period of time, the inhabitants there will be greatly unaware of the activities you've engaged in on Norrath. Of course actions you take after the portals open might be a different story.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><IMG height=30 src="/images/tribal_divider.gif" width=251></P>
<P><I><B>Section #3 - The Vah Shir</B></I></P>
<P align=left><B><BR>3.0 Who are the Vah Shir?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Vah Shir are a race of noble cat people that were wiped off Odus and deposited on Luclin many years ago in the test of a great weapon by the Erudites. The weapon, aimed at the Vah Shir home city of the same name, flung the entire city and the inhabitants therein through space, leaving what is now known as The Hole. Without their nobility, the remaining cat people, dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites, were easily rounded up and segregated to Kerra Isle.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>3.1 Will we need to purchase Luclin to play a Vah Shir?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Though everyone's client will download the Vah Shir character model in order to allow viewing of those of the Vah Shir race, you will need Luclin in order to play one.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>3.2 What classes can the Vah Shir be?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>While still subject to modification, we plan to allow the Vah Shir to be warriors, rogues, shamans, beastlords, and bards.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><IMG height=30 src="/images/tribal_divider.gif" width=251></P>
<P><B><I>Section #4 - The Beastlord</I></B></P>
<P align=left><B><BR>4.0 What is a Beastlord?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Beastlords are essentially hybrid class with a heavy reliance upon pets. More information will be available as we finalize the details.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>4.1 What races can be a Beastlord?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At minimum, the Vah Shir will be able to be Beastlords. It is very likely, though not guaranteed, that we will open the class up to other shamanistic races.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>4.1 Will we need to purchase Luclin to play a Beastlord?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes. Even if we make the Beastlord available to existing races, you will need Luclin in order to play one.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><IMG height=30 src="/images/tribal_divider.gif" width=251></P>
<P align=left><I><B>Section #5 - New Character Models</B></I></P>
<P align=left><BR><B>5.0 Is it true that you are building new character models for each race?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes. The character models we are building are far more detailed, sporting a much higher polygon count and a greater texture depth. They seem more lifelike.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>5.1 What about faces?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The new models will have a greater number of face options available. For those who already have characters, we will be creating faces for the new models that closely resemble the ones you chose for your old models. We may also allow players with existing characters a one-time choice of a new face for each character, but that's not guaranteed at the moment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>5.2 What if we want to get Luclin, but prefer the old character models?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>While we sincerely doubt that will be the case, we will include an option to continue display of the old models.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>5.3 I spend nearly all of my time in wolf form. What do the new models mean to me?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We're also planning on making new models for anything that players can become. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>5.4 Please tell me there are more animations.</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, we're doing all new combat and social animations, including differentiating animations based upon what you happen to have in your hands at the given time. In other words, a kick carrying one weapon will look different than a kick while carrying two weapons.</P>
<P>In addition, we're working on another aspect of animation that will simply blow you away. Unfortunately we can't talk about it just yet.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><B><B><A name=55></A></B>5.5 Can you give us some details about the new armor and clothing textures? I've heard that they will be separate graphic items for Luclin. What does that mean? </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Right now all armor attached to characters (with the exception of helms and robes) is done by performing a texture swap on the model. The "skin" changes to take on the appearance of another form of armor without changing the geometry. Hence, characters in full plate look as sleek and slim as characters in newbie clothes.</P>
<P>With the character models that come with Luclin, armor will in whole or in part when it makes sense will be displayed as attachable geometry. For instance, a steel breastplate will actually be an additional item that is placed over the chest of the character. </P>
<P>There are still cases where textures may be used, but usually in conjunction with geometry. For instance, a boot might be a swapped foot texture with an attached piece of geometry for the cuff or neck.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
<P><B><B><A name=56></A></B>5.6 I was just curious, well more than curious, I feel compelled to ask, will elementals and other pets be getting cool new models too?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We do indeed plan on giving models which players can become a makeover as well. Right now this includes the elementals, bear, wolf, skeleton, and spectre.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><IMG height=30 src="/images/tribal_divider.gif" width=251></P>
<P><B><A name=sec6></A><I>Section #6 - Miscellaneous </I></B></P>
<P><B><BR>6.0 I've heard a lot about the new graphics for Luclin, like grass and bushes fading in as you get closer and greater detail textures for everything. That's great, but what if my computer can't handle all that? Will I be able to turn that stuff off, like the clipping plane works now?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We plan to allow users to configure many of the new graphics options that will be available. At minimum, we'll let users turn that grass on or off. It's also possible that we'll let you set the radius in which it is displayed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>6.1 Will Shadows include the improved UI that came with Velious?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, we are working on removing the last remnants of the obsolete 640x480 UI.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>6.2 I can't wait for Luclin to come out, except for one thing.... After 2 years I am out of character slots (on 2 servers, mind you) and don't want to destroy any of my memorable companions to invent a new Kerran. Any chance for a couple more character slots with this expansion?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No, we are not planning on expanding the number of characters allowed, with possible exception to Sullon Zek, where we might allow one additional character to give current people a chance to try out a Vah Shir on that server. This is however not written in stone.<BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
