<P>*** Announcing The Legacy of Ykesha ***</P>
<P>The Legacy of Ykesha will be the first download-only extension for EverQuest.&nbsp; This product will not be available in stores.&nbsp; This extension will include some great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for characters ranging from level 35 up to level 60.</P>
<P>Legacy of Ykesha Features include:</P>
<P>A new playable race: Frogloks<BR>Enhanced Looking For Group Tool<BR>New Cartography System<BR>New Magic Item slot: Charms<BR>Armor Dyes<BR>Dozens of new creatures<BR>Expanded bank capacity<BR>New zones<BR>New spells</P>
<P>For more information, please visit <A href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com/">www.legacyofykesha.com</A></P>
<P><BR>*** Patch Information ***</P>
<P>** Gameplay/Features **</P>
<P>- With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or extremely-crowded-zone situations.<BR>- Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is removed.<BR>- Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other players when you zone in after them.<BR>- Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour limit when player was not logged in. <BR>- Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.</P>
<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
<P>- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner similar to traditional healing spells.<BR>- Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs that had this ability.<BR>- Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from being removed.<BR>- Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds.&nbsp; This is a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed to correct the "Recast time not met" problem.&nbsp; More information is available at the Developer's Corner at <A href="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.com</A>.</P>
<P><BR>** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities **</P>
<P>- The range on the Bard Ability "Boastful Bellow" has been increased slightly.<BR>- Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the standard amount per level over level 60.</P>
<P><BR>** User Interface **</P>
<P>- Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window.&nbsp; They were not getting removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.<BR>- Introduced new Story window.&nbsp; The purpose of this window is to provide story updates in a readily available location.&nbsp; ALT-N toggles the window.&nbsp; You can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are added if you wish.<BR>- Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item Links.&nbsp; Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered items.&nbsp; Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to discover new items.&nbsp; These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts of those who create them.<BR>- Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points.&nbsp; To turn on this confirmation box, please check the Options window.</P>
<P><BR>** Miscellaneous **</P>
<P>- Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.<BR>- The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 6 hours after the event is failed.&nbsp; It will respawn normally if the event is won.</P>
<P><BR>** New/Changed Interface Files **</P>
<P>- EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)<BR>- EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml</P>
