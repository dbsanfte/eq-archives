<h1>Changes to The Grey</h1>
	Sylvini-Tholuxe wrote:<P><B>From Castersrealm:<P>"THE GREY GETS NERFED<P>The Grey zone in Luclin was patched live a short while ago.<BR>Many mobs in there have had their resists significantly increased. Players are also reporting an increase in hitpoints on many monsters, and the addition of a new mob which is immune to Magic based spells. This can only have been done in response to the large numbers of AE groups which had been set up in the zone for fast exp gain.<P>So casters beware next time you hit the zone. <P>Submitted by Baelish, 6:27 PM EST"<P>Why is it that you always punish EVERYONE for the actions of a few???  I went there myself to check it out and it's true, not one ensnare landed, the necro with me didn't have one darkness land, including our epics (especially on the named critters), DD's didn't once do full damage, and DoT's were a pain to land.<P>This is getting really tiresome.  Instead of just nerfing an entire zone like this, making snares impossible to land or nerfing magic damage, how about you take away the damn AoE spells causing such nerfs?  Let's face it, spells like Pillar of Frost/Fire/Lightning (on the wizard side) and Lighting Strike/Blast (on the druid side) only get used for one purpose: TO QUAD KITE.  They don't get used in groups, especially high end groups where keeping a mob mezzed on multiple pulls is most important.  And they don't get used against single mobs.<P>It seems to me that this is the main source of the problem.  A few people go out and quad like this to gain exp atleast 4 times faster than everyone else and the rest of us who don't get punished for it again and again.  I was happily soloing 1 spawn at a time (since I can't seem to get a group at level 55) and was doing as well as the full groups of 5 and 6 who were dominating the pillars of the pyramid.  Now, I can't solo a freakin skeleton or golem.<P>Now, as a Druid, I'd much rather see my quad kiting spells I never use go bye bye and be replaced by something more group friendly like more stuns, better healing, another DD line that's Magic or Cold based, anything that's alot more group friendly than these anti-social, spawn hog spells.  And I'd like to see zones like The Grey go back to the way it was before you patched it with snares landing on everything (including named mobs) more often than NEVER (or almost never, I didn't land one but didn't get the "can't alter this mob's movement" message).  <P>I'm basicly just sick and tired of getting nerfed on soloing single pulls because some schmuck decides to quad kite.  It's bad enough I have to solo most the time because I can't find a group, I don't wanna have to suffer even more because of someone else's quad kiting.</B><P>Well, we are not talking about quad kiting here.<P>No single group should be able to kill 40 or 60 experience-giving NPCs at one time.<P>I know this is a short answer for such a long comment, but really that's what it comes down to.  We would rather not make such changes, but the situation in The Grey was too extreme to allow to continue.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]


<hr>

A number of the responses coming into the Dev Corner are along the lines of "Why the knee-jerk reaction"?  <P>Frankly, when you have a situation that horribly breaks the game, trivializes advancement, and is public common knowledge, you have to act without delay.  For instance, were a dupe bug to find its way into game and get posted all over the web, we'd immediately shut the servers down while we correct the situation.  Some might consider that knee-jerk, but it's necessary for advancement in the game to mean something.  <P>The situation with the Grey is basically the same type of thing, though not as severe of course.  It had to be addressed first to ensure the integrity and longevity of the game.  Sure, after that we can sit down and determine what the best way would be.  You might want to see what changes go in (some tonight) before making final judgements.<P>-Gordon

<hr>

Obviously the changes we recently made in The Grey have stirred up some conversation.  This seems like a good opportunity to break down the design process a bit and to show you how and why we do these sorts of things.<P>First let me talk a bit about AoE groups.<P>There are indeed several places in the old world where such tactics are used, and used effectively.  AoE groups have been around since the early phases of beta.  There is nothing inherently wrong with such groups.<P>But as the designers of the game it is our job to avoid setting up situations where one tactic becomes far too useful.  That's what happened in The Grey.<P>Until the changes, it was possible to use an AoE group to pull and kill an extreme number of NPCs (upwards of 50+) in an almost continuous fashion with a lower level of risk than was appropriate.  There were, essentially, three factors that contributed to this, factors that don't exist all together in any other zone.  The addition of the light blue experience-giving NPCs made more low-hit point NPCs available to give experience.  The Grey had a rather fast spawn rate, increasing the pool of available experience giving NPCs over time.  Also the NPCs in that zone were given very low resistances in order to make casters more appealing to groups in the zone.<P>Looked at individually, these three factors all seem like good things.  During testing this zone worked as intended.  But when exposed to AoE groups, these factors created a situation that made such groups far too efficient in this zone.<P>So we changed the zone somewhat.  Reports of...  let me quote one comment sent in:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>"Good job! You broke the GREY for casters completely!"<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>...are exaggerations.  Rather large exaggerations at that.<P>Here are the changes that have been made.<P>Increased the hit points of all NPCs in the zone 8% (yes, that's 8 more hit points for every 100 it had before).<P>Reduced the spawn rates on the NPCs in the zone.  There are still plenty of NPCs in the zone, but it might not be possible to pull and kill 30 or 40 at a time at a fast rate anymore.<P>Increased the resistance of the NPCs to moderate levels.  Where they were practically unable to resist spells before, they now can resist spells some of the time.  Cold and Fire spells might get complete or partial resists half the time, doing full damage the rest of the time.  The initial changes to the zone had the average monsters being quite resistant to magic based spells, and after looking at the results the magic resistance has been lowered to a more appropriate level.  This change should allow people to snare and root mobs more easily in The Grey.<P>Additionally, a resistant monster was added to The Grey.  The new Shimmering Rockfiend is highly resistant to fire and cold based spells, and adds a bit more danger to pure AoE groups.  This is tempered by the fact that the Rockfiend is fairly rare, easy to see, and the soloing casters in the zone will learn to recognize his threat and avoid fighting him.  If you are pulling 40 monsters to your AoE group though, chances are you'll pick up a Shimmering Rockfiend or two and have to deal with them.<P>This in no way makes casters completely broken in The Grey.  It doesn't remove the ability to effectively run an AoE group in this zone either.  What it does is reduce the effectiveness of pulling massive numbers of NPCs and wiping them out with an AoE group.  And the zone is still very workable for the balanced experience group, as well as soloing casters.<P>I wanted to set that straight.  I wanted to clear it up primarily for those that have not experienced this zone before.  Some of the rumors about how 'broken' this zone is are exaggerated, and I suggest that if you want to know how playable the zone is that you try it out rather than listening to rumors.<P>If further testing and play in the zone brings problems to light, we'll evaluate it and make appropriate changes.  We want you to play in and enjoy our zones, and provide quality content for every class.  We'll continue working toward this goal, and appreciate the insightful feedback we've gotten on this issue.<P>Alan<P>
