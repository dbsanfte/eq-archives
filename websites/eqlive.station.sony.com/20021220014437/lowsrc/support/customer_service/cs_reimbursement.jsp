<h1>Customer Service</h1>


<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Reimbursement Policy</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left><B>In an effort to more efficiently assist our customer base, we have evaluated and revised our Reimbursement Policy. The primary goal of these modifications is to give our GMs more latitude in assisting our players. It is our goal to be able to keep our customers as satisfied as possible and to balance that with the overall integrity of the game. We are confident that the changes below will perform this task.</B></P>
<P align=center><I>This policy is not all-inclusive and there are situations outside the scope of the policy that may be determined at the specific time to not warrant an item reimbursement. Please remember that no requests for reimbursals are guaranteed to be fulfilled.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>1. Bind Death Loops</B></P>
<P><B>Bind Death Loops occur when a player is killed repeatedly upon return to his or her bind point with no available means of escape, typically due to the player's faction with the NPCs at their bind point.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. Any losses due to bind death loop situations may be reimbursed after an investigation and solely at the discretion of the Game Master.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.1<I> Note: Please remember to only be bound in safe places.</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. If a player is in a bind death loop, the GM may remove the player from the loop once contacted.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.1<I> Note: If you find yourself in a bind death loop, please do the following:</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><EM>Attempt to camp the affected character out of game. </EM>
<LI><EM>Upon returning to the character select screen, either log in another character, or make a new character to log in game on the same server. </EM>
<LI><EM>For assistance, petition in game on that same server with the name, location, and details of what is taking place.</EM></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>2. Coins</B></P>
<P><B>Coins are the cash that players use as currency with merchants and other players.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Coins (platinum, gold, silver, and copper) may be reimbursed under some circumstances. Such a reimbursement would take place after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.</P>
<P><B>3. Containers</B></P>
<P><B>Containers as referred to herein are both world containers, such as forges, ovens, or pottery wheels, and mobile containers, such as spits or sewing kits. These containers are those that allow the creation of new items using player trade skills.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. Items lost when combined in world containers, such as forges, ovens, etc. (intentionally or accidentally) may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>4. Deleted/Missing Player Characters</B></P>
<P><B>Characters are deleted from the character select screen, which is only accessible using your account station name and password.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1. Deleted/Missing characters may be restored after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.1 <I>Note: A restore of a deleted or missing character cannot be guaranteed, including any items of any kind that were on the character at the time of deletion. It is imperative that you contact a GM immediately if you wish to request a character restore.</I></P>
<P><B>5. Destroyed Items</B></P>
<P><B>Items are destroyed by using the Destroy option on your inventory screen in game. The option can be set to either Fast Destroy On or Off under your Options in game; this option allows you to confirm whether or not you wish to destroy an item.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1. Items that are destroyed, intentionally or accidentally, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1.1<I> Note: To avoid accidentally destroying an item, we suggest you turn off the fast item destroy option.</I></P>
<P><B>6. Dropped Items</B></P>
<P><B>Items are dropped by targeting the item away from any PC, NPC, or the inventory screen and clicking the left mouse button. The option is available to set Item Dropping to Fast Drop, Confirm, or Never.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1. Items dropped, intentionally or accidentally, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1.1<I>Note: To avoid accidentally dropping an item, we suggest you set the item dropping option to never.</I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2. Items that fall to the ground during trades due to a full inventory, or due to those items not fitting into a container may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3. Any items that are thrown as a projectile, such as items placed in your range slot, intentionally or accidentally, may not be reimbursed.</P>
<P><B>7. Experience</B></P>
<P><B>Varying amounts of experience are gained by killing NPCs and are lost upon death.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1. Experience will not be restored for any death caused by latency (a.k.a. "lag"), Link-Death, or other forms of disconnection.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2. If there is a known server-wide player drop, resurrections may be authorized.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3. Experience may not be restored for any death caused by duels, Player vs. Player combat, or NPC attacks.</P>
<P><B>8. Faction</B></P>
<P><B>A player's "Faction" is comprised of a combination of their race, class, deity, and deeds (what they've done in the world), and this combination defines how NPCs interact with you in the world. While race, class, and deity are fixed in nature, how other NPCs look at you can be influenced pro or con based on what you do in the world.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.1. Factions may be restored to a previous save after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1.1. Note: A restore of faction cannot be guaranteed. It is imperative that you contact a GM immediately if you wish to request a faction restore.</P>
<P><B>9. NO RENT Items and Containers</B></P>
<P><B>NO RENT Items are items that remain on the character only until a player logs out of game. These items would include summoned bags, weapons, or any looted items with the NO RENT description.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1. All items classified as NO RENT and all contents lost in NO RENT containers may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1.1. <I>Note: If a player is disconnected from the game while they have NO RENT Items on their character, they have 30 minutes after the time of disconnection before the No Rent item is destroyed. If they log back on within this 30 minute period, the items should still be in game.</I></P>
<P><B>10. NPC's/Corpses of NPC's</B></P>
<P><B>An NPC is a non player character that upon death may leave a corpse in game.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.1. Any disappearing NPCs, items or corpses of an NPC, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM. However NPCs may not be spawned and items not looted will most likely not be reimbursed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2. Mistakenly looted NO DROP items may be transferred after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2.1.<I> *Note: Intentional Ninja-Looting will be dealt with as a separate issue. This only applies to situations of non-malicious looting.</I></P>
<P><B>11. PC Corpse Decay</B></P>
<P><B>The PC Corpse Decay Rate is as follows: If your character is level 10 to 60 then you have 7 days of offline or online time to loot your corpse. Naked corpses for characters under level 35 decay in 3 minutes. Naked corpses for characters level 35 and above decay in 3 hours.</B></P>
<P><B><I>Note: We recommend that you loot your corpse as soon as you are able.</I></B></P>
<P><B>The Resurrection timer for any corpse is 3 hours of online time. Online time includes any time spent on any character on the account in question, any time spent on any character&nbsp;on the account in question, any time spent at the character select&nbsp;screen, or any time spent waiting in chat.</B><BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.1. Any corpse lost to normal decay rate, including any items on that corpse, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>12. Quests</B></P>
<P><B>Quests are available in game to gain items and/or experience for performing certain tasks for one or more NPCs.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.1. Items lost in any Quest may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.2. Items that are lost or a reward given to wrong person due to Multi-Questing will not be transferred or reimbursed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.3. NPCs in Quests that disappear or are killed may not be respawned, nor will items on the NPC's be reimbursed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.4. Items lost in any Quest performed incorrectly may not be reimbursed.</P>
<P><B>13. Trades</B></P>
<P><B>Trades are any items that are placed into the trade window and purposely given to another player, NPC or Pet (by mutual agreement between the two involved players), regardless of the intent behind the trade.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.1. Items traded to or sold to other players, pets or other NPCs, intentionally or accidentally, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.1.1. <I>Note: GM's may not assist with any trade disputes. All trades are considered final.</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2. Trade scams are not permitted in Norrath. Trade scammers may have disciplinary action taken against their account.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2.1. <I>Note: If you would like to provide evidence of a trade scam based on an agreement with another player, then we ask that you please use the /report command to record the appropriate text and send it directly to the GMs. In order to /report, please do the following:</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><EM>Scroll up until the pertinent text is available in your viewing window </EM>
<LI><EM>Type /report &lt;name of player you are trading with&gt;. For example, if you are trading with John, type "/report John." </EM>
<LI><EM>If you are in fact scammed and need assistance from the GM, then please request in-game assistance using the /petition at that time.</EM></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>14. Roll-backs</B></P>
<P><B>Roll-backs occur when players are disconnected from the server at a point between saves. Upon logging back in, players are then reset to their most recent save point, thus losing any items or experience gained beyond that point.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.1. Any lost items, experience, or faction due to a reset to a previous save may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.</P>
<P><B>15. Rallos Zek Specific</B></P>
<P><B>On the Rallos Zek server, Player versus Player (PvP) combat may be rewarded with the ability to loot one item from the corpse of the character that you have slain.</B></P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>15.1 Any items lost to PvP looting rules have been relinquished to another player as a reward for winning the Player versus Player combat. As such, any items lost in this manner may not be reimbursed by a CSR.</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Should any unforeseen technical issue occur resulting in the loss of items to our player base as a whole, Customer Service will address these issues separately across all servers.</I></P>
<P><I>If you lose an item or experience due to a verifiable bug or a server problem, the item or experience may be reimbursed.</I></P>
<P><I>If your situation is not addressed in this policy, please use the /petition command for additional assistance.</I></P>
<P><I>Reimbursements of any kind, regardless of the circumstance, are not guaranteed.</I></P>
<P><I>Reimbursement issues can only be addressed by GMs (SOE employees), as they have sole responsibility for enforcing this policy.</I></P>
