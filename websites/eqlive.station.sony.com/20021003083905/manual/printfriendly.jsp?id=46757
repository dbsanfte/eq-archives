			13.1
			Spell Book and Mana
		</h2>
	
	All spell casters carry a spell book. You can open the book at any time by clicking the book icon. Once you copy a spell from a scroll (scribe it), it is permanently recorded in your book. <BR><BR>You can "memorize" eight scribed spells at any one time by placing them in a spell gem slot. Casting the spell then becomes as easy as clicking on its gem. <BR><BR>Spell casting consumes mana, a mystical source of magical energy. Like hit points, mana regenerates over time. Your current level of mana is shown by the blue mana bar. The longer the blue line in the bar, the more mana you currently possess. As you gain experience levels, you gain additional mana. Resting or meditating restores your mana faster than standing.<BR><BR>
