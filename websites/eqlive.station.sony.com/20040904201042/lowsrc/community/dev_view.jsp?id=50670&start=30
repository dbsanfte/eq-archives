<h1>Shadows of Luclin site open</h1>
	We've opened our Shadows of Luclin site.  You can get to it at this address:<BR> <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/" TARGET=_blank>http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/</A> <P>Or from the links on <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com" TARGET=_blank>www.everquest.com</A> <P>Some interesting shots and tales are available on the site.  Go take a look.<P>Alan<BR>

In_Debt wrote<P><B>Maybe I took to much medication today BUT did the new character model on your Shadows of Luclin site wink at me?<P>Any chance for some info on other little add-ons we might see?</B><P>You took too much medication.<P>And that wasn't a wink, it was a blink.  Just like you to assume she was flirting with you.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>It might be a while before you hear much more about the cool stuff coming for Luclin.  Just keep your eyes on the site (see the many layered pun there?), that's the best place to learn new stuff.<P>Alan<BR>

Roybob wrote:<P><B>When I first saw reference to the upcoming expansion, I pronounced it with a soft "u" and "c" sounding as "k," in other words Luclin = "Luck*lin." The more I thought on it, the less sure I felt. A friend said she thought it was pronounced with a hard "u" and "c" sounding as "s", or Luclin = "Loose*lin." This sounded better to me, but several coworkers confused the issue by agreeing with the hard "u" but reverting to "k," Luclin = "Luke*lin."  As I rule out a soft *u* and *s* (Luss*lin?) combo, which of the other three is correct?<P>Thanks =)</B><P>This I <B>can</B> answer.  It's pronounced LuckLynn.  You were right the first time.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Ok, now you've gone too far!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Please tell me that you're not going to use an animated model, but that Denise, the original flesh-and-blood model will be brought back!<P>I can't imagine going to a Fan Fair and meeting a cartoon, instead of the real thing.<P>-Fandarian<BR>41st Druid, E'ci<BR>Attendee of Baltimore Fan Fair<BR>(And yes, I DID meet Denise!!)</B><P>Oh...  what if that cartoon was Jessica Rabbit?  Would you be singing the same toon then?<P><BR><B>Absor! It's been more than a week now! We need more character models and screenshots! Please!?<P>-Kellis</B><P>Sorry folks.  We're going to be slow to put up new information for a while.  We want to make sure that we can actually do what we want to do before we mention it.  And, well, we like to keep you all drooling...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Veliarx wrote:<P><B>i just read about some new info on the upcoming expansion. there the beastmaster was described as being "the first class that can tank and conjure a pet". as someone who has played a shadowknight past level 40 i feel you should've had that idea a little earlier in everquest's history.</B><P>Well, we didn't actually say that... that was someone else saying that.<P><BR><B>Dang, you sure about that Absor?<P>The longest time I've been pronouncing it, "Bob."<P>&lt;shrug&gt;<P>Dimento Graven<BR>44'th Season Druid<BR>'Gankos' Zek</B><P>No, no...  "Bob" is how your pronounce 'Jeff Butler'.<P>/em looks over his shoulder in a bit of a panic.<BR>/em writes note to NOT post this.<BR>/em promptly loses note.<P><BR><B>Ok, then how do YOU pronounce the newest split server, Zeboruxok.  Bet you can't! :-P<P>Binnen</B><P>I don't really have to know how to pronounce is, as long as I know how to spell it I can complete my daily tasks without worry...<P><BR>Kynyne wrote:<P><B>As was done with Velious, is there going to be a request for Questions to produce a FAQ sheet for Shadows ?</B><P>Actually, I've been getting plenty of questions.  I've been building a FAQ question list for Gordon to look over.  So send in your questions if you'd like.  But the list of existing questions is already pretty long.  And, yes, most of the questions you'd expect to be asked have already been asked... several times.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR><B>why is there only gnomes screenshot in new models page ??    and please please don't say gnomes r sexy !  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">    (i was one time in a group of 4 male gnomes...)<P>Sylviania Delaforet<BR>Wood-Elf Ranger<BR>49th season</B><P>Ok, that's not fair.  You can't ask me a question and then immediately tell me that I can't give you the answer...<P>Gnomes are sexy.  If you don't agree, you're in denial and should write to Mennix for help.<P><BR>Tamarac wrote:<P><B>Yup, she winked at me as well.  Flirtatious that one...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The site is just informative enough to keep me hanging, good work.  The idea of new advancement paths for 60th level characters sounds intriguing and the Beastlord is mentioned as being available to the Vah Shir and possibly the 'other shamanistic races' which sounds promising, since I was hoping the Kerrans would be Shamen and not some super-civilized space Kerrans.<P>Having it based on Al'Kabor might not be the best choice.  The man does not exactly have the best reputation in the Wizardly arts, given his dubious contributions in that area...  Many Wizards would rightly feel that he is something of a con artist or snake oil salesman for cheating them out of hard won platinum to purchase his namesake spells that end up less effective than the 'generic' versions perfected by long-forgotten Wizards of skill before him.<P>Then again, his off-handed note in the introduction of 'quietly' sneaking various tomes off to his library to study without informing his companions reinforces his disreputable nature...<P>An brief but vituperative GM event would ensue if he ever dared show his face around a gathering of potent PC Wizards, I am sure.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>Nobody ever claimed that the famous Al'Kabor was a sweetheart of a guy...<P>And, well, the Spiraliscious-one has been known to take the occasional risk and travel the lands of mere mortal wizards, when the need is great enough.<P>And, well, we call it a 'teaser' site, so I guess we did out job there.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Rosvineer wrote:<P><B>When will you be adding content to the Luclin site?  And when you do, will you post a message here?</B><P>Yes and yes.<P>Right now we're gearing up for E3.  After that we hope to have an update for the site, but exactly when I'm not sure.  But I'll definitely let you guys know when we do.<P>Alan<BR>
