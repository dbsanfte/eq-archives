<P align=center><STRONG>Customer Support Contact FAQ</STRONG></P>
<P align=center><STRONG><EM>Petitions</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Q.&nbsp;When is the best time to petition for Customer Support assistance?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Although GMs are available 24 hours a day, the best time to petition is between the hours of 12 p.m. and 12 a.m. PST/PDT, when the bulk of our GMs are available. </P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;How long does it take for a petition to get answered?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Members of the Customer Support Team (both GMs and volunteer Guides) work to answer petitions as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Some issues take longer to respond to than others, and the number of petitions may vary at any given time.&nbsp; This may affect the response time necessary to resolve the issue.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;Why can't I just send a /tell to a GM or volunteer Guide that's online?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;The current Customer Support Team system&nbsp; was arranged so that customer issues can be handled in the order that they are received.&nbsp; Sending a direct /tell to a GM or volunteer Guide will only cause delay in assisting you and other customers, so please only use the /petition command when requesting CS assistance in game.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I sent in a petition, but when I typed "/who all gm" there was no one online.&nbsp; Does this mean that my petition will not be answered?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Members of the Customer Support Team that are online will not always be visible to the public, as they may be dealing with issues that require their full attention.&nbsp; Even if you do not see one online, please be patient and send in a petition, as a GM or volunteer Guide may still be there to help you with your problem.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;Someone is harassing me in game.&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Please be aware that you always have use of the /ignore &lt;name&gt; command.&nbsp; If the harassment becomes extreme (intentionally causing experience loss, continual messages, abusive/offensive language, etc.) then please make sure that the text you wish to report is visible in your chat window, use the /report command, and petition.&nbsp; A GM will review the situation and take the appropriate action.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;Another player and I wish to hunt in the same area, but he doesn't want to share.&nbsp; Should I petition?</P>
<P>A. &nbsp;Before petitioning, you should be aware that no one group or player can "own" an area.&nbsp; In addition, the Play Nice Policy states that in such a situation, both parties must compromise with one another.&nbsp; If no resolution can be met, then you may petition for assistance as a last resort, and a member of the Customer Support Team will mandate a binding compromise to the disagreement.&nbsp; It is strongly suggested that the groups involved make every attempt to resolve the dispute without the involvement of a member of the Customer Support Team.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;This person's name is offensive.&nbsp; How can I report him?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For any name that violates the naming policy, whether offensive or just a minor violation, you may petition for assistance.&nbsp; A GM or volunteer Senior Guide will review the name and take the appropriate action.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I read the naming policy and I think that my name is a violation.&nbsp; Will I get in trouble if I petition to have it changed?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Do not worry.&nbsp; Most likely no action will be taken if you report your character's questionable name yourself.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;Someone stole an item from me!&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For these situations you may petition for assistance; however, no guarantee can be made that we will be able to assist you.&nbsp; To protect yourself from having items maliciously taken from you, make sure to take all necessary precautions during trades and after killing creatures.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I think someone is breaking the rules because he is attacking a creature that is not attacking him back.&nbsp; How do I report him?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;You should petition this issue as soon as you notice it so a member of the Customer Support Team can investigate.&nbsp; Please include the name of the player involved, the zone this is occurring in, and what the person was doing at the time.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I think someone on my server is exploiting a quest.&nbsp; He has pulled the two NPCs close together so he can get the quest item and turn it in very quickly. Is this ok for him to do or should I report him?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;This is indeed an exploit.&nbsp; Please report this with a petition as soon as you notice.&nbsp; Be sure to include the name of the player involved, the name of the NPCs, the zone that player was in, and what the person was doing at the time.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I died to what I think is a "bug."&nbsp; How can I get help?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Please petition in game and a member of the Customer Support Team will investigate your situation.&nbsp; If the GM or volunteer Guide is able to determine that an in game anomaly was involved in your death, he/she will assist you as necessary.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I am missing an item from my inventory and I didn't delete it or sell it!&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;You will need to petition in game, as a GM must investigate the issue to determine how the item was lost and if an in-game anomaly was involved..&nbsp; If there was something abnormal that caused the item to disappear, the GM will assist you as necessary.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;The merchant in this zone will not sell to me.&nbsp; He just says he is busy and is out of his normal place.&nbsp; Who should I contact to fix him?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Please send in a petition with the name of the NPC and the zone the NPC is in, and a member of the Customer Support Team will investigate and attempt to correct the issue.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I am unable to retrieve and/or resurrect my corpse.&nbsp; It is not where I died, and I believe that it is in a wall or under the world.&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;First, try logging out to desktop and restarting EverQuest.&nbsp; This sometimes fixes problems with not being able to see your corpse.&nbsp; If you are still having problems, then please petition and a member of the Customer Support Team will investigate and assist if&nbsp; he or she is able.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I can't find my corpse!&nbsp; It's not either not where I died or I don't remember where I was when I died.&nbsp; Should I petition for help?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;First you should try to find someone who has the ability to find your corpse for you, such as a Bard, Necromancer, or Shadow Knight.&nbsp; It may simply be that your corpse is somewhere that you haven't looked.&nbsp; The abilities that these classes have can make it very simple to find or even bring the corpse right to your feet!&nbsp; If after trying these abilities you still are unable to locate your corpse, please petition and a member of the Customer Support Team will investigate if there is an anomaly involved and assist you if possible.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I am stuck in the ground/wall and unable to move.&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
<P align=left>A.&nbsp;A member of the Customer Support Team will probably need to assist you with this situation. Please petition as quickly as possible and someone will be along to help as soon as he/she is able.&nbsp; If you are in a dangerous area, it may be a good idea to camp out and petition with another character instead.</P>
<P align=center><BR><STRONG><EM>Emails</EM></STRONG></P>
<P align=left>Q.&nbsp;I have a problem regarding the billing on my account.&nbsp; Who should I contact for assistance?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For issues regarding account or billing questions, please send an e-mail to <A href="mailto:accounts@soe.sony.com">accounts@soe.sony.com</A> or call 1-858-537-0898.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I have a suggestion that I feel would enhance the game play of EverQuest.&nbsp; Where can I submit this idea?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;To send feedback on in game issues, or to submit ideas that you would like to see implemented in the game, you can either use the /feedback command in game, or you may e-mail <A href="mailto:EQFeedback@soe.sony.com">EQFeedback@soe.sony.com</A>.&nbsp; Although you may not receive a response due to the amount of feedback that is received, all feedback is read and taken into consideration.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I think I may have found a bug in the game.&nbsp; Who do I report this to?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;You may report any type of in game bug, related to quests, NPCs, or other aspects of the game by submitting a report in game by use of the /bug command, or by e-mailing our Quality Assurance department at <A href="mailto:EQTesting@soe.sony.com">EQTesting@soe.sony.com</A> with a detailed description of the bug.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I have a problem with the game that I believe is related to my computer.&nbsp; Who can help me with this?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For Technical problems, please contact our Tech Support department by e-mailing <A href="mailto:EQTech@soe.sony.com">EQTech@soe.sony.com</A>, or by calling 1-858-537-0898.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;My account has been suspended/ banned and I want to know why.&nbsp; Who can I speak with to find out?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For questions regarding suspended or banned accounts, please e-mail <A href="mailto:EQAccountStatus@soe.sony.com">EQAccountStatus@soe.sony.com</A>.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I have an issue about the game that doesn't fall under any of the categories listed above (such as a praise for a GM or volunteer Guide, complaints about a policy, etc.).&nbsp; Is there anything that I can do to talk to someone?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;For any other general issues (compliments, complaints, general feedback, etc.), you may also e-mail <A href="mailto:EQMail@soe.sony.com">EQMail@soe.sony.com</A>.&nbsp; Your situation will be forwarded to the appropriate department. </P>
<P align=center><STRONG><EM>Tech Support</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>Q.&nbsp;How can I contact Technical Support?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Tech Support can be reached by either e-mailing them at <A href="mailto:EQTech@soe.sony.com">EQTech@soe.sony.com</A>, or by calling 1-858-537-0898.&nbsp; You may also reach someone in the Technical Support chat room of EverQuest Chat during the hours of 8am to 4pm PST, Monday-Friday.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;When can I call Technical Support?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Tech Support is available from 9:00AM to 1:30 and 3:30 to 6:00PM PST, Monday through Friday.&nbsp; If you are unable to contact Tech Support during these times, you may send an e-mail at any time, or you may visit the <A href="ttp://www.station.sony.com/en/instantchat.jsp">Live Chat</A> forums from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I cannot log on with one of my characters.&nbsp; Who should I contact?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Please contact Technical Support or petition a GM in game to have your character walked out of the area that it is stuck in.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;What do I do if my graphics and/or sound are not working properly?</P>
<P>A.&nbsp;Quite often, problems with Video and Sound are related to old drivers.&nbsp; Make sure to check with the manufacturer of your Graphics/Sound cards for updated drivers by visiting their web sites.&nbsp; If you have the latest drivers or upgrading your drivers does not seem to have any affect, please contact Technical Support.</P>
<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I am having problems installing the game.&nbsp; How can I get help with this?</P>

<P><BR>Q.&nbsp;I can't seem to get my Account Key to work.&nbsp; When I type it in, it says that the account key is incorrect.&nbsp; What should I do?</P>
