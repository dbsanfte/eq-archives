			Connection Status Bar
		</h2>
	
	In the upper left-hand corner
  of your display is a green bar with four numbers over it. This is your Connection
  Status Bar. It gives you information about your connection to our servers
  through the Internet. This isn't really a good place to try to explain the
  intricacies of the Internet, so we're just going to tell you what the numbers
  are. <BR><BR>Left number - shows the round-trip ping<BR>Second number - shows the packet loss incoming to your machine<BR>Third number - shows the packet loss going to the server<BR>Fourth number - shows the throughput <BR><BR>The main thing to know about the Connection Status Bar is that it changes
  colors. If the bar is green then your connection is generally good. If it
  turns yellow or red then your connection is generally not so good.
