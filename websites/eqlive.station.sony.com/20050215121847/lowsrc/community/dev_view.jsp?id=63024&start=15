<h1>Tacvi Changes</h1>
	<P>Hello all,</P>  <P>Later today, we'll be pushing out an update&nbsp;for Tacvi to all live
  servers. Although this&nbsp;update will only affect a small portion of the
  audience for EverQuest, those that are affected have been waiting eagerly for
  it, so I wanted to run through the changes that you'll notice and talk
  briefly about what is coming in the near future for that zone.</P>  <P>First, I believe that I've located and corrected the problem that was
  sometimes causing a crash in the first event in Tacvi. I've run through the
  event for many hours now, both by myself and with the aid of a testing guild
  and the zone has remained stable throughout.</P>  <P>Second, some tuning changes have been made to the bosses of Tacvi, so some
  things may work slightly differently than before. Although the encounters
  themselves haven't changed in any major fashion, don't assume that tactics
  you've ruled out in the past still won't work.</P>  <P>Finally, I've laid the groundwork for a change to how the zone works.
  Although this is the least noticeable of the changes, it's also the biggest.
  Tacvi currently works like other dynamic raid zones. Players gain lockout
  times based on their accomplishments in the zone. I'm in the process of
  changing Tacvi so that it will remember which bosses you have killed
  recently. Then, the next time you start up the dynamic zone, the zone will
  only spawn those NPCs that would have respawned since you last killed them.
  This will negate the need for lockout timers in Tacvi. The code to support
  this change is brand new and doesn't exist on live servers yet, so this
  change must wait until the next full patch to EverQuest before it can go in.
  In the meantime, the most noticeable difference you'll see is that all of the
  bosses in Tacvi are now up as soon as the zone spawns.</P>  <P>Although I'd normally rather wait until all the changes are all done
  before pushing the zone out, I'm pushing out these first&nbsp;few now,
  because I know how eager people are for the changes to the initial
  encounters.</P>  <P>Thanks all,</P>  <P>Rashere</P>
