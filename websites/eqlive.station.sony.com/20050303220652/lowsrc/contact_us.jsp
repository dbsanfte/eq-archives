<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG><BR><STRONG>Contact Us</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P>Customer Service Related
  Contacts:</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com">eqmail@soe.sony.com</A><BR>This is the big dog of the contact addresses. This is the place to send
  feedback, suggestions, complaints, compliments, and almost anything else.
  When email is received at this address, it is forwarded to the proper person
  or department. Also, when an email is sent to this address, an automated
  response is generated notifying the sender that the email has been received.
  It is the most common address, and one that game masters and guides often
  provide to the EverQuest player base when needed.</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqtech@soe.sony.com">eqtech@soe.sony.com</A><BR>This is the main tech support email address. If you are having technical
  issues, use this address. When using this address, it is best to supply as
  much information about your system as possible. The more information Tech
  Support has, the better they will be able to help you. Another thing you can
  do is to send the dbg.text file that is found in the EverQuest directory
  along with your email. The dbg.txt file is a debug file that contains
  information that Tech Support may be able to use to help solve your technical
  problems.</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:accounts@soe.sony.com">accounts@soe.sony.com</A><BR>This is the accounts/billing address. This is the place to send account and
  billing questions.</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqaccountstatus@soe.sony.com">eqaccountstatus@soe.sony.com</A><BR>At times, player's accounts are suspended or banned due to violation of game
  or service rules. This email address allows those account holders to check on
  their account status or to find out when a suspension will end. Of course,
  SOE/Verant personnel will only discuss account issues with the registered
  account holder.</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:appadmin@soe.sony.com">appadmin@soe.sony.com</A><BR>As the number of subscribers increases on a weekly basis, the need for
  volunteer guides increases also. If a player has submitted a guide
  application and has further questions, or had problems with the application,
  this address is the one to use. Please remember, like always, to provide as
  much information regarding the issue as possible in order to get the best
  help possible.</P>  <P>Design/Testing Contacts:</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqfeedback@soe.sony.com">eqfeedback@soe.sony.com</A><BR>Have suggestions for the game? Think something can be done better? Send an
  email to this address and provide your feedback about EverQuest. But be
  warned, chances are very slim that a response to an email will ever be made.
  This address was created mainly as a one-way street to learn what the players
  want in regards to EverQuest.</P>  <P>EQ Web Site Contacts:</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqwebmaster@soe.sony.com">eqwebmaster@soe.sony.com</A><BR>The EQ Webmaster is provided for those who wish to submit news items for
  publication on the EverQuest site, including the Harpy's Head Tavern pages.
  The news items accepted here are general news/announcements, in-game events,
  guild events, etc. The EverQuest.com Editor reserves the right to determine
  what news items will be posted and where. Another function of this address is
  to notify the EQ Webmaster of possible problems with the site so that they
  can be checked out.</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:eqmoderator@soe.sony.com">eqmoderator@soe.sony.com</A><BR>This address is used to alert the EverQuest message boards moderator of posts
  that need to be looked at regarding possible inappropriate content. There are
  two sets of official EQ related message boards. There are the main boards for
  general and game related discussions, and the Harpy's Head Tavern boards for
  in-character roleplaying. The <A HREF="mailto:eqmoderator@soe.sony.com">eqmoderator@soe.sony.com</A>  address only deals with the out of character general discussion boards.
  Concerns about the Harpy's Head Tavern boards can be addressed to the EQ
  Webmaster.</P>  <P><BR>Fan Faire Contacts</P>  <P><A HREF="mailto:fanfaire@soe.sony.com">fanfaire@soe.sony.com</A><BR>This is the address to use if you have any Fan Faire related questions.</P>  <P>More ways to contact us than you thought? One
  of the complaints we hear at times from some players who email us with a
  concern is how long it took us to respond. When this happens, and it is not
  really that often, it is usually because the email was originally sent to the
  wrong address and may have been buried in the recipients in-box until he or
  she found it and forwarded it to the right department or person. By using the
  list above, and sending emails to the correct addresses, the chances of a
  slow response are greatly reduced.</P>
