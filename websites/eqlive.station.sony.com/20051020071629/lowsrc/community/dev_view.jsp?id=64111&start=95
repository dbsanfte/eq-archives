  name?</EM> Douglas</P>  <P><EM>What is your
  occupation?</EM> Computer Technician</P>  <P><EM>Where will you
  retire?</EM> A quiet home in Northern Virginia.</P>  <P><EM>If you could eat
  lunch with one famous person, who would it be</EM>? Ron Moore, the creator of
  the new Battlestar Galactica. He has created such a terrific show I would

  traveled outside your country of birth? </EM>Yes</P>  <P><EM>What kind of
  clothing would you never wear?</EM> I don't like clothes that act as political
  or social statements. If I cared about your beliefs, I'd ask.</P>  <P><EM>If you won the
  lottery, how long would you wait to tell people?</EM> Outside of telling my
  wife, I don't know if I would tell anyone - ever. I can only imagine the
  unwanted attention that winning the lottery would bring.</P>  <P><EM>Who would you hate
  to be stuck in a room with?</EM> Either Paris Hilton or Camryn Manheim - they
  are both obnoxious and have absolutely no place on television (or in a room
  with me!)</P>  <P><EM>If price were not an
  object, what kind of car would you drive?</EM> Honestly I wouldn't appreciate
  any luxury cars, I'd be content with a Jeep Cherokee.</P>  <P><EM>What do you do most
  often when you are bored?</EM> Juggle (badly)</P>  <P><EM>If you could be any
  animal what would it be?</EM> Any kind of large bird, I think it would be
  wonderful to be able to fly.</P>  <P><EM>What was your single

  lunch with one famous person, who would it be?</EM> Mark Twain (aka Samuel
  Clemens). I would have loved to hear about his life and travels during that

  object, what kind of car would you drive?</EM> A 1991 Mustang GT, white, with
  a sun roof.</P>  <P><EM>What do you do most
