  water, and some even have fountains and underwater aqueduct systems. You can
  swim in water for a short period of time. The better you are at swimming, the
  longer you can hold your breath. <BR><BR>To swim: <BR><BR>* Walk into the water.<BR><EM>Notice that a new gauge appears. This is an important gauge; it indicates
  how much air you have left. When it runs out your character will begin to
  suffocate.</EM> <BR>* Pan your view down and move forward to swim down.<BR>* Watch your air gauge. When it gets low, emerge for air.<BR>* Pan your view up and move forward to swim up to take a breath.<BR><EM>Note: You can swim with your head above water by panning the view up
  slightly.</EM>
