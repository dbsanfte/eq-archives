			22.2
			Emote Codes
		</h2>
	
	When creating custom socials,
  you can use a series of &quot;%-codes&quot; that expand into various pieces
  of information when the social is executed. <BR><BR>The %-codes are: <BR><BR><STRONG>%M</STRONG> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet).<BR><STRONG>%T</STRONG> - Returns the current target.<BR><STRONG>%S</STRONG> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (He, She, It).<BR><STRONG>%O</STRONG> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (Him, Her, It).<BR><STRONG>%P</STRONG> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target
  (His, Her, Its).<BR><STRONG>%R</STRONG> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).
  <BR><BR>For example, if you have a target of &quot;a gnoll&quot;, the following
  emote: <BR><BR>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <BR><BR>...Your character will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation with a text
  output of &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready
  to kill it.&quot;
