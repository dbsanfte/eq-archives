		<h2>
			22.1
			Custom Animation Text
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has default text
  for all existing animations. For instance, when typing /point, or /point with
  a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the
  &quot;point&quot; animation and &quot;CharacterName points at [target]&quot;
  will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. <BR><BR>You can use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need
  to specify the &quot;target&quot; after the command as &quot;say&quot;
  followed by your custom text. For instance, typing &quot;/point say points at
  a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; will cause
  your character to execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and display
  &quot;CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is
  ready to kill it&quot; to those nearby.
