	<EM>Abjuration</EM>: Deals primarily
  with defensive magic; for example, a spell that enables the character to take
  less damage from extreme cold. <BR><BR><EM>Alteration</EM>: Deals with changing things, whether it is illusion or an
  actual physical change. Cause illusions or actual physical changes
  (teleportation, faster movement, etc.). <BR><BR><EM>Channeling</EM>: Give a change to continue casting without being
  interrupted if you are hit while casting the spell. <BR><BR><EM>Conjuration</EM>: Brings something from elsewhere into the world, whether
  they are elemental creatures or powerful clouds of energy. <BR><BR><EM>Divination</EM>: Allows the caster to both detect things previously
  concealed and conceal things previously visible. <BR><BR><EM>Evocation</EM>: Deals with things that go boom. Fireballs, force spells,
  etc., all fall under the auspices of this offensive skill. <BR><BR><EM>Meditate</EM>: allows casters to memorize spells and regain their mana more
  quickly. <BR><BR><EM>Specialization</EM>: Specializing in one of the types of magic (Abjuration,
  Alteration, Conjuration, Divination or Evocation) allows casters to cast
  spells using less mana and with a higher rate of success.
