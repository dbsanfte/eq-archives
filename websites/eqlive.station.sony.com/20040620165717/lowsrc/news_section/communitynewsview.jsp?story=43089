	<h2>Obituary: Lord Aniz Tan'il of the Neriak City Council</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Xegony<br>
	05/16/2002<br>
	<P>Services were held&nbsp;recently to commemorate the passing the Lord Aniz Tan'il of the Neriak City Council.&nbsp; Among his accomplishments were the defense of the Tier'Dal homeland during the Siege of Ak'anon during the War of the Kabob and supplying resources for the struggle against the evil Djinni and the subsequent destruction of the Lamp of Power when it was uncovered in the Desert of Ro.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The benediction was given by Tarhik Ka'Tariz another member of the city council who has been charged with overseeing Lord Tan'il's estate on behalf of the council.&nbsp; The funeral was held in the Western Commonlands where a cairn was erected in Lord Tan'ils honor.&nbsp; Other notables in attendance included Ralzq Q'Enli another council member, Sir Soulaw a shadowknight who gained some repute in the desert action against the Lamp of Power, Falkoh a Tier'Dal Wizard, Klaven, Kenuur, Valarion, and the Rogue Autolicus as well as members of the Neriak faithful.</P>
<P>Inside sources indicate that Lord Aniz Tan'ils death may not have been an accident but there has been nothing to substantiate these claims.</P><br>
