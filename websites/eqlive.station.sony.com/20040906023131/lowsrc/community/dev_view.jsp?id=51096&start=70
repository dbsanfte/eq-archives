<h1>Healing and spell damage messages bug</h1>
	There have been some questions about spell damage and spell healing not taking effect properly, things like a player seeing a) multiple death messages, b) "you died" when they should have died to an NPC or c) seeing healing messages and then dying from damage that would appear to be less than the amount just healed.<P>It's a bug in the spell filters -- The workaround for this is to turn spell filtering totally off.<P>We're sorry we didn't patch code with the last patch, but we're in the process of updating some of the server architecture, which includes character storage, so we're taking our time on it.  We need to make sure everything is working properly before we can patch this stuff, which includes the fix for this particular bug.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Ok, I cant help but wonder what this may mean.<P>"...we're in the process of updating some of the server architecture..."<P>Just curious if you can elaborate, at least let us know what these changes will allow on the player end =)<P>Anyways, maybe I'm just thinking too hard =P<BR>Thanks for yer time<BR>-Doug</B><P>Curiosity killed the Vah Shir...<P>Were not doing anything all that exciting.  Most of it has to do with our localization (or is that internationalization) project.  No, I think Ill stick with localization, its easier to type.  Any time you change the basic structure of things its good to make sure youve got it working right.  Unfortunately this required that we hold of updating any code on the Live servers with the last patch.<P>I dont think there are any major changes to the game involved in that whole ...updating some of the server architecture... mumbo-jumbo.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>As a cleric who has seen his tank die too often to this bug (AoW is relentless) I am very interested in this obviously.<P>So, could you elaborate please - does both the one casting the heal and the one the heal being cast on have to have serverfilters off? Also, just to be 100% certain - you mean "/serverfilter off", correct?<P>Thanks in advance <P>Exarch Mikar of the the Nexus<BR>The Companions<BR>The Tribunal</B><P>I guess I can see how this would be a bit confusing.<P>The one receiving the spell needs to have his or her filters turned off.<P>The tricky part is that when you look at the options for spell filters, the options are asking you if you want the <I>spell messages</I> on or off.  You want the filters off, which means that you want the spell messages on.<P>So when you get to the chat filters section of the options menu, <B>turn all of those spell messages ON.</B><P>As for /serverfilter, if all the messages are on (filters off) then the condition of the /serverfilter wont matter.<P><BR>Alan<BR>
