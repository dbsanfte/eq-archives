<h1>Mischief of the Heart</h1>
	<P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Harpy's Head Tavern was bustling with activity on a
  cold, dark and stormy night. A bard sang softly in the background while
  patrons conversed over foamy mugs of dwarven ale and delicate glasses of
  elven wine. Suddenly the door of the tavern blew open and slammed against the
  wall with a huge crash startling everyone within the welcoming warmth.
  Silhouetted in the doorway was a dark figure, his cape blowing wildly in the
  fierce wind. A chill ran down the spines of the tavern's patrons, and it
  wasn't entirely attributable to the cold. The dark figure stepped inside, but
  the light of the torches could not penetrate his raised hood. He raised a
  gloved hand to summon the Innkeeper. The Innkeeper turned to see who had come
  in. His face paled and his hands began to shake. &quot;Wha...how...?&quot;
  stammered the Innkeeper as he tried to regain his composure. At the end of
  the bar stood a dwarf, calmly sipping at his short ale as he watched the
  Innkeeper and the mysterious figure. T! he dark figure's silken voice hissed
  &quot;Innkeeper, do you know what I do to traitors?&quot; The figure's gloved
  hand began to glow with a dark, eldritch light. The tavern hushed, and several
  of the patrons close to the bar reached nervously for their weapons, fearing
  the violence that could erupt at any moment. The dwarf continued to sip his
  ale, still watching the unfolding drama without any apparent concern for his
  own safety. <BR><BR>&quot;T-t-traitor? Me?&quot; squeaked the Innkeeper. &quot;I swear, I've done
  nothing!&quot; Hastily, he backed away from the cloaked one, and took refuge
  behind his bar. &quot;Nothing?!&quot; roared the figure. &quot;You call this
  nothing?!&quot; the figure shouted, and swept the cloak off. The dead white
  skin of the figure's bald head shined in the lantern light. One eye, pure
  black as onyx, blazed. The other sat dead white in its sunken socket. The
  creature's features were sharp and angular but one feature stood out from all
  of the rest. A sigil of an ancient script sat deep in the being's forehead.
  &quot;You marked me, innkeeper.&quot; Chills of the darkest night flowed from
  the creature's smooth words as he spoke. &quot;And now I shall mark
  you.&quot; The being's long-fingered hand fell to demon-headed hilt of his sword.
  The Inn's murmuring clientele rapidly grew silent,
  save for a loud glugging gulp from the distant end of the bar. The weathered
  dwarf intoned, &quot;That'll be enough then, ye don't need to be pickin' on
  that ! fellow nae more. He's but a mere innkeeper and you're-- well, I'm not
  sure what in the Underfoot ye be, but I'm not takin' a liking to ye. Shall we
  step outside or would ye be planning to bleed to death here on the
  floorboards of me favorite Inn?&quot; <BR><BR>The dwarf's intonement gave the Innkeeper the moment he needed, as the he
  took one small step back, and with a quick swirling motion of his right had,
  a glob of brilliant white light shot out at the approaching menace. The light
  hit it squarely in his chest causing him to fly backwards off his feet. With
  in seconds, the innkeeper mumbled some words in an ancient tongue, where
  suddenly, many small vines cracked through the old worn floor boards of the
  inn. The vines quickly snaked and entangled around the legs of the menace as
  he tried to rise to his feet. &quot;Do you take me to be such a fool!&quot;
  the innkeeper shouted as a smirking question. Fool indeed! I shall flay the
  skin from your bones, and drain your soul to the dregs!&quot; Muttering dark
  incantations, a dark and sickly fog emanated from the shadowknight's fingers
  and slithered quickly like a snake, coiling itself about the Innkeeper's
  legs. He was still able to move, although slowly, but the fog continued to
  snake its way! up his body and plunged into his open mouth. The Innkeeper
  looked feverish and began to cough with such violence that he was unable to
  utter a counterspell. &quot;Do you feel your health slipping away from you? I
  assure you, that is only the beginning of your torments, a mere down-payment
  for the mutilation you have inflicted upon me!&quot; Then he turned to the
  dwarf, and snarled &quot;As for you, dwarf, do not meddle, or by Innoruuk you
  will regret it!&quot; <BR><BR>The heavy brow of the Dwarf crinkled and a slow smile began to inch across
  his ruddy bearded face as he slowly and gingerly brought his gnarled hand
  from within the folds of his cloak where it had crept upon the entrance of
  the dark-robed figure. Suddenly, without warning, a globe of incandescence
  flared and a beam of purest sunlight arced toward the shadowknight's
  onyx-black eye, piercing the blackness and turning it as white and dead is
  its companion. A guttural sound began to emanate from deep within the chest
  of the dark figure, rising in pitch to become an unbearable scream of anguish
  and pain....and then....silence...... The corpse shuddered and darkness
  flowed forth. Inky blackness seeped into the room, eating away at the light.
  Without a sound, the flickering light from the torches and the warm glow of
  the hearth were extinguished, leaving the common room shadowed in an
  oppressive murk. <BR><BR>The door opened once more, startling the frozen patrons. Some of them gasped
  at the beauty of the Dark Elven woman that walked into the Tavern.
  &quot;Ahrvid, what's taking so....?&quot; she began to ask, then taking in
  the situation at a glance, she sighed. &quot;Not again. Tsk, I must remember,
  never send a man in to do a woman's job. Good minions are so hard to
  find.&quot; Before anyone could intervene, she quickly slipped an emerald
  from a pouch at her waist, stooped to touch it to the shadowknight's chest,
  and chanted, &quot;By Innoruuk's Hate, I bid thee rise, Ahrvid! Live once
  more and serve thy God!&quot; The shadowknight's eyes opened and he blinked
  in confusion, &quot;Mistress?&quot; Those in the tavern's common room gasped;
  it wasn't often they saw a necromancer, a Dark Elf, or a resurrection - all three
  at once was a marvel. &quot;Get up, you imbecile,&quot; she said in disgust.
  &quot;If you can't even handle a matter of personal revenge without my aid,
  how can I trust you to help me with our Task?&quot; <BR><BR>As she stood up and faced the dwarf and Innkeeper, her ebony robes swirled
  and clung to her body like a second skin. The dwarf gave her a long,
  appraising look, and whistled appreciatively. &quot;Och, lass. Tis a shame
  that such a beauty as you has sich puir taste in travellin' companions. You'd
  better take him outside now, or I'll have tae make ye be wastin' another of
  them pretty trinkets, as this waste o' skin ye call friend has been rude to
  'is host and I cannae tolerate discourtesy.&quot; He smiled to take the sting
  out of his words. She glanced at the confident dwarf, and quickly decided now
  was not the time to deal with him. He was unknown to her, and unknowns are
  dangerous. She preferred to know everything she could about an enemy before
  destroying them. Living as long as she had was testament to the effectiveness
  of this technique. She smiled back at the dwarf, a smile both cold and
  beautiful at the same time. &quot;Of course, my handsome dwarf...
  AHRVID!&quot; she snapped, &quot;Wait! for me outside, and try not to get
  yourself killed doing it!&quot; She shot him a look he knew he dared not
  question. <BR><BR>&quot;Now then, master dwarf&quot; she purred, &quot;Could I buy you a
  drink?&quot; The necromancer glided over to an empty stool next to the dwarf.
  &quot;Bartender, bring another round for my friend here, and bring me a glass
  of wine. Red please, blood red&quot; She looked at the innkeeper with a cold,
  deadly gaze. The innkeeper scurried off to fetch the drinks, both thankful
  the dwarf was there, and wishing they would leave at the same time. The dwarf
  eyed the dark lass, suspiciously. He could sense a power about her, much
  stronger than he was accustomed to. He'd have to be very careful with this
  one, he decided. One wrong move could very well be my last, he thought. He
  motioned to a terrified barmaid to re-light the torches. The room was soon
  engulfed in the rosy glow of firelight. Patrons gave wide berth to the pair,
  afraid to draw attention to themselves, and afraid leaving would draw that
  unwanted attention. Most found something particularly riveting on the
  floor...perhaps the Iksar monk that snu! ck his way into a corner and feigned
  death. <BR><BR>The innkeeper deposited their drinks on the counter. The lady idly dipped a
  finger in her wineglass, and circled the rim, then brought her finger to her
  mouth and licked the wine drops from it. A sly smile graced her lips as she
  spoke to the dwarf. &quot;My name is Valtyrra.&quot; The dwarf took a long
  pull from his stein, burped loudly, and ale sloshed out as he slapped it back
  down on the counter. &quot;Thank ye for the drink, lass. &quot; He picked up
  the stein and took another drink. &quot;Tell me, Sir, you who are the soul of
  courtesy&quot; -the dwarf grinned - &quot;how would you view a host who tries
  to poison his guests?&quot; Mid-swallow, the dwarf spewed his drink out upon
  the counter. &quot;Oh, don't worry sir dwarf, your drink is not tainted.&quot;
  Valtyrra turned to the innkeeper and help her cup up to him.
  &quot;Drink!&quot; Nervously, the innkeeper refused. &quot;M-my lady, it's
  not seemly for a c-common man such as myself to drink from your cup.&quot;
  &quot;DRINK, I SAID!&quot; The dwarf, hefting his axe, frowned and said
  &quot;Ye he! ard the lass - do it.&quot; <BR><BR>Nervously, the innkeeper raised the blood red wine to his lips. His hands
  were visibly shaking, as he brought the wine glass closer to his lips. A hush
  permeated the inn, as the patrons held their collective breath. Suddenly, the
  heavy door to the inn flew open with such force it splintered against the
  back wall. A gust of wind shrieked in as it blasted the patrons with icy cold
  fingers. A large hand appeared out of the darkness, groping for the broken
  door. &quot;OH FIDDLEFADDLE- I DONE BWOKE ANODDER DOOR.&quot; A huge ogre
  wedged himself through the remains of the doorway. &quot;WAS DAT YOUSE
  SKELETON OUTSIDE? ME SORRY, ME SMOOSHED HIM. HIM SCARED POOR LITTLE
  BORQ.&quot; The ogre glanced around at the stunned tavern. &quot;IS DERE ANY
  OGRE SWILL IN HERE? BORQ THIRSTY!&quot; Taking advantage of the loud
  disruption, the innkeeper quietly poured the poisoned drink into a nearby
  sink. Nonchalantly sliding the glass over to the dark necromancer the
  innkeeper hissed, &quot;A most delicious vintage m'lady. You ! should have
  tried it yourself... shall I pour you another?&quot; <BR><BR>Aware of what he had done, but more amused than anything that the innkeeper
  had yet again escaped what he so richly deserved, Valtyrra shook her head.
  &quot;I think not, fellow. We'll settle accounts later, you and I. Now, toddle
  along and go sweep the floor or something, the dwarf and I have business to
  attend to.&quot; Frustrated, the innkeeper turned from the pair at the bar,
  and then, recalling the ogre's sudden entrance, went to assess the damage to
  his door. Taking out a handkerchief, he mopped the sweat from his brow, and
  muttered to himself &quot;...should have done what mother told me and
  completed my druid training...nice, quiet forest...&quot; He settled the ogre
  at a corner table with a tankard of Swill, and sent one of the barmaids for a
  couple of stable hands to come repair the door. As the ogre walked over to
  his table, he stepped on something, and a sharp yelp was heard, though no one
  was sure where it came from. <BR><BR>&quot;Now lass, what's this all about, eh? I'm glad 'o the drink, but I don't
  see as how I owe you anything fer it, other than my thanks, which you already
  have.&quot; The dwarf squinted at her, curious what a necromancer who clearly
  worshipped Innoruuk could possibly want from a cleric of Brell. One of the
  downfalls of being a dwarf was curiosity, and although that curiosity was
  usually about ale and ore, gorgeous women definitely had a spot. Somehow, he
  knew his curiosity was going to get him into trouble this time, but he
  pressed on regardless. &quot;Well, my handsome dwarf&quot; cooed Valtyrra
  &quot;A lady doesn't share her secrets with just anybody. Who might I have
  the pleasure of sharing a drink with?&quot; Valtyrra was, in fact, very
  interested in finding out more about the dwarf. Her task might be made quite
  a bit easier with a cleric along. Those emeralds were not easy to come by.
  She didn't mind consorting with the lesser races, providing she got what she
  wanted in the end. She was also i! nterested in this dwarf for other reasons
  too... Ahrvid might be an idiot, but he was undoubtedly a tough idiot. No,
  Valtyrra was *quite* interested in anyone who could defeat Ahrvid in such an
  off-hand manner. She smiled her most disarming smile at the dwarf, hoping her
  beauty would have the desired effect. It did. <BR><BR>The dwarf gazed at her for a second, and then mentally shrugged. What's a
  name anyway? &quot;The name's Bruni, me lady. A right respectable dwarven
  cleric from Kaladim, second cousin (once removed) from his lordship the
  King,&quot; said the husky dwarf, bowing slightly when mentioning his king.
  His curiosity peaked, he pressed on, &quot;I overheard ya muttering something
  about a task' to that louse ye call friend. What task be ye on?&quot; Bruni
  leaned back in his chair, quite proud of the way he had managed to turn the
  tables without divulging too much about himself. Sadly, he glanced at his
  nearly empty mug of ale, resigning himself to sober conversation with this
  bewitching dark elf. <BR><BR>Valtyrra quickly came to the point. &quot;I'd like to hire your services. Or
  rather - Brell's services.&quot; He blinked in disbelief, and asked
  &quot;Brell? What do you need from Him? Shouldn't you be petitioning a cleric
  of Innoruuk for whatever it is you need?&quot; &quot;Ah....no,&quot; she
  explained in a low voice. She checked to be sure that no one was listening,
  saw the Innkeeper staring and glared at him. He blanched and quickly went
  elsewhere. &quot;You see, I have appointed this task to myself - it something
  he is unable to do himself, and his clerics must not know of it. My lord
  Innoruuk has lost something of value. If his clerics find out, they are such
  gossip-mongers that they will eventually let it slip to the general Tier'Dal
  populace, who will lose faith in him.&quot; Bruni pressed on, &quot;I still
  don't see what I - or Brell - have to do with it.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;I'm getting to that! Two nights ago, my lord Innoruuk was dallying with
  that harlot Tunare. Somehow, that witch ensorcelled him, and he lost his
  heart!&quot; The anguish in Valtyrra's voice was palpable. Bruni laughed.
  &quot;Is that all? He's in love, lass! It's perfectly normal.&quot; Her eyes
  sparked in anger. &quot;You fool!&quot; she hissed,&quot; He is the Prince of
  Hate! This is disastrous! Have you been to his plane lately? He's
  re-decorating it in chartruese and puce! There are daisies everywhere! It's
  revolting!&quot; She shuddered, and seemed on the verge of tears.
  &quot;There, there, lass&quot; he said, patting her on the back. &quot;I
  still don't see a problem. In fact, I'd rather abolish hate altogether, if I
  could, and this sounds like it might just do the trick.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;I can't believe I have to explain something so elementary to you,
  dwarf. There is a balance in the world that must be maintained. Good vs Evil
  - Strong vs Weak - Love vs Hate.... Put one force out of balance with its
  opposite, and the balance will be overturned.&quot; She picked up two
  tankards of ale, and put one each on either side of a scale the innkeeper
  used to weigh coins of unsure value. &quot;Add a little here, take a little
  there, and the scale will find its equilibrium point....however, take too
  much from one or add too much to another....&quot; she gestured, and one
  tankard emptied itself, while the other filled to overflowing, until
  equilibrium was no longer possible, and the full tankard crashed onto the bar
  and tipped over, spilling all its contents. &quot;Do you take my meaning,
  dwarf?&quot; Gravely, he said &quot;Aye, I see. Yet I must still ask - what
  do ye need with me and Brell?&quot; He was intensely curious to know. <BR><BR>Valtyrra continued. &quot;Ahrvid and I came to this innkeeper, knowing that
  though he followed Tunare, he loved gold more than trees. He sold us a map to
  get into her Temple by a back
  route, so that we could steal back our Master's heart, which she had locked
  away in the Temple's vault. But
  the traitor sold news of our plan to the rangers. They wished to catch us in
  the act, so they let us penetrate the inner sanctums, all the way to the
  vault, and then the rangers sprang from their hiding places and attacked us.
  We barely made it out alive! We came here of course, to repay the
  innkeeper.&quot; &quot;So, you got the Heart?&quot; he asked, puzzled.
  &quot;No - we found the altar that had held our Master's heart was empty! All
  that was left was this note,&quot; and she handed him a piece of parchment.
  He unfolded it and read: &quot;Tunare sweetie - you weren't home and I didn't
  want to bother you. You don't mind if I borrow this old thing, honey-pie?
  Thought you wouldn't - xxOOxx Bristle-kins xxOOxx&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;You see, dwarf? I need Brell's help. He is great friends with
  Bristlebane, this I know. You must convince him to help us. If only he can
  distract the Mischievious One, I can steal back the heart and restore the
  balance.&quot; Valtyrra took a deep breath, hoping (though this was a
  repugnant emotion to her) that the dwarf would agree. Bruni's eyes goggled.
  &quot;Y'know las, you could do some distractin' of yer own, with your ..er,
  assets....&quot; Bruni pondered the necromancer's words, once he was able to
  focus again. Things were getting complicated quick... by Brell, he could
  REALLY use a good ale right now to help him think! Brell...that was what she
  wanted, or rather, his connection to Brell. Everyone knew clerics had a
  special connection to their god. Valtyrra was asking a lot of him... did he
  trust her enough to risk Brell's anger? He didn't have enough answers yet. <BR><BR>&quot;Valtyrra,&quot; he said, &quot;before I take up with you on this quest
  o' yours, I've got a question or two I'd like answered first.&quot; &quot;Of
  course,&quot; she purred, &quot;I didn't expect you to simply take me at my
  word. Ask your questions.&quot; &quot;Alright. Now, who else knows of
  this?&quot; he asked, &quot;You, Ahrvid... does that shifty innkeeper know?
  And a few assorted gods as well.&quot; Valtyrra pondered a moment. &quot;A
  few in Neriak know, but it's being kept as quiet as we can. No sense in
  disturbing the rabble. My guildmaster knows, but outside of that, I'm not
  sure. My guildmaster is the one who assigned this task to me.&quot; Bruni
  turned this over in his head a bit. &quot;The rangers were waiting for you,
  so they must not only know, but be in on it as well. What is their part in
  all this? Surely they must be aware of the dangers if you could figure it
  out.&quot; <BR><BR>Valtyrra bristled inwardly at his words... the nerve of this man!! If she didn't
  need a connection to Brell so badly, she'd give him a disease he wouldn't
  soon forget! Well, maybe first... he had a certain something about him she
  liked. &quot;Honestly, I don't know the rangers part in all this yet. We
  aren't exactly on speaking terms,&quot; she smirked. <BR><BR>&quot;So, lemma see if I have this straight,&quot; Bruni stated as he looked
  longingly at his empty stein, &quot;Ya be looking ta get me, yerself, and a
  shadowknight who seems to end up dead more often than alive, to interfere
  with the doings of the gods? And not lesser gods either, ach no! We're
  talking Brell, Bristlebane, Tunare and none other than the dark lord himself,
  Innoruuk!&quot; She nodded her assent. He thought a bit more... things HAD
  been rather boring lately. Complete heal chains had turned his brain to mush,
  and he had been looking for some excitement lately. Maybe this would be just
  what he needed. Not to mention, having a traveling companion that looked the
  way she did - it had certain advantages. All she needed was a nice beard and
  she'd be perfect! Anyway,' he thought, bringing his mind back to the matter
  at hand, Brell owes me a favor, so even if this does turn out badly I can
  probably land on me feet,' then said, &quot;Ok lass, I'll go along with ye on
  this harebrained que! st o' yers.&quot; Valtyrra took a deep breath of
  relief... a nearby patron dropped his mug at the sight. &quot;But&quot;
  continued the dwarf, &quot;I ain't gonna be getting meself killed over this.
  We need some more help.&quot; <BR><BR>Two pairs of eyes slowly turned on the large ogre in the corner, noisily
  slurping down his swill with the remains of an unknown monk stuck to his
  foot. Valtyrra recoiled. &quot;The ogre? I'm already saddled with one dimwit,
  are you sure we need him?&quot; &quot;Aye lass. Quite aside from the rangers
  that are after you two, we might have to fight our way to Brell....&quot;
  Puzzled, she asked, &quot;I don't understand, can't you simply petition Brell
  with a prayer and ask him for his help?&quot; She wondered if this dwarf
  really could be of use to her....perhaps she ought to kill him and find some
  other way to accomplish her mission. <BR><BR>&quot;Well....&quot; answered the dwarf in an embarassed tone, &quot;y'see,
  Brell is a mite....indisposed...around this time o' the week. Well, not to
  put too fine a point on it, he's probably stinkin' drunk again. He and his
  brother Gods have themselves a pretty wild shindig every sevenday, that lasts
  2 or 3 days. And then the next day or so, he's usually 'recovering', if you
  get my meanin'. There's really only about 3 days in seven (four if your
  lucky) that he's in a mood to communicate, and today's not one of 'em.&quot;
  &quot;I had to ask,&quot; Valtyrra sighed. &quot;Very well, let's talk to the
  ogre, and see if he's up for a little adventure.&quot; They walked over and
  sat opposite of the ogre. The tavern patrons scooted out of their way; a few
  got up and left, lest any further mayhem erupt and possibly draw them into
  it. <BR><BR>&quot;Why you sit here?&quot; growled Borq. &quot;Dis my table! You want
  steal my swill?&quot; He eyed them suspiciously. Bruni shuddered and replied,
  &quot;Och no, I'd never think o' it, me lad. We have a proposition for
  you.&quot; The ogre's brow crinkled in confusion,
  &quot;Proper-zit-shun?&quot; Bruni sighed and explained, &quot;Er, aye. We'd
  like to hire your services. It'll be dangerous, but I'm sure yer up to it.
  What do you say?&quot; The ogre thought about it...and thought...and thought....
  &quot;Oh for evil's sake! We want you to come bash things for us, understand?
  &quot; Valtyrra exclaimed, her patience at an end. This was taking too long;
  if they didn't get going soon, Innoruuk might take it into his love-besotten
  head to redecorate Neriak itself! Borq smiled beatifically - he loved to bash
  things. &quot;Ok pretty lady! Borq bash now?&quot; And he withdrew one of
  many swords from the satchel on his back. <BR><BR>Valtyrra was about to point out the innkeeper, but the dwarf shook his head
  and mutter softly, &quot;Never mind, lass. You said you were in a hurry,
  anyways.&quot; She pouted briefly, then nodded her agreement, &quot;I suppose
  you're right. Business before pleasure, after all.&quot; Then she looked down
  at the ogre's feet and spoke &quot;There's no use lying there like some sort
  of lizardskin rug, I am an expert on death, you know, and you aren't fooling
  me at all. Get up, monk, you're coming with us.&quot; The young monk stood up
  sheepishly, and apologized &quot;Er - sorry. Didn't mean to eavesdrop, I was
  here first, and then this walking mountain came over and stepped on me.&quot;
  He showed them his tail, which was rather squashed looking and bent at an odd
  angle. &quot;Speaking of which, I can't go anywhere with you, an iksar is no
  good without a functioning tail.&quot; Bruni gestured and intoned a brief
  prayer and the tail un-kinked and un-squashed itself. The lizard's scales
  took on a polished, healthy sheen. ! &quot;You were saying?&quot; Bruni
  grinned. The monk looked at his newly-straightened tail and the shine on his
  scales. &quot;Ok, I'm convinced&quot; he said. <BR><BR>&quot;Good,&quot; said Buni, &quot;Now, let's get started. Brell's house
  isn't exactly close.&quot; The troop finished their drinks and left the inn,
  much to the relief of the patrons. &quot;Oh, wait just a second&quot; said
  Bruni, &quot;I forgot something inside.&quot; Valtyrra eyed him suspiciously.
  The dwarf marched back inside the inn, pulling out a rather large hammer from
  under his cloak. Runes glittered on the handle and the head seemed to have
  faint glow. He strode up to the bar, then swinging the hammer high over his
  head, brought it down on a vat of cheap wine with a resounding crash. The
  barrel exploded with a blinding flash of white light, releasing its contents
  all over the wooden floor. The red wine quickly disappeared between the
  cracks in the floor, and the inn became deathly silent. <BR><BR>Bruni glared menacingly at the innkeeper, motioning for him to come closer.
  Shaken, the poor man shuffled forward. &quot;Now, see here me good man. T'was
  a terrible thing that just happened to that keg, now wasn't it?&quot; The
  innkeeper nervously nodded his head. &quot;If anybody comes sniffing around
  here asking questions, well...&quot; he eyed the innkeeper meaningfully,
  &quot;let's just say next time my aim might be a wee bit off and hit the
  owner instead of the keg, if'n ye get my meaning?&quot; The innkeeper paled
  at the implication, and quickly nodded. The dwarf sniffed at the obviously
  shaken man, and rejoined his companions outside. &quot;Me thought Borq was
  gonna do da smashing,&quot; pleaded Borq. &quot;Next time, me big
  fellow,&quot; answered the dwarf. &quot;Dis one needed a bit of
  finesse.&quot; Valtyrra looked at the dwarf, wondering what would have
  happened if he had meant to be blunt. &quot;Let's be off. Thar be a portal to
  the Plane of Knowledge around here somewheres, an we can get to the god's
  playground easily from ! there&quot;. The group started off. <BR><BR>Within a fortnight they found themselves entering Brell's domain. While
  waiting for the last person to crawl through the low tunnel, Valtyrra looked
  around. They had emerged onto a ledge overlooking a vast cavern. In the
  heights of the ceiling, she could see massive stalactites. There were steps
  leading down from the ledge, that circled the cavern, and she could see veins
  of gold and silver reflecting the light of their torches. Looking over the
  edge, the bottom of the cavern was lost in gloom. She turned back to the
  group, and commented to Bruni, &quot;That was quite clever of your Master,
  dwarf. I would have never thought to look for the entrance the the Plane of
  Underfoot in...&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;Hssst! Keep it down lass.&quot; Bruni whispered, &quot;Ye promised to
  keep it a secret. It's too bad I needed one other person without a blindfold
  to help me open the portal, or else I wouldn't have let even you see its
  location. Brell will nae be happy about unbelievers in his realm, as it
  is.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;OW! watch where you're going, you stupid oaf!&quot; screamed the last
  member of their party, a Barbarian shaman named Sara that the monk had helped
  them recruit, as Borq stepped on her foot. &quot;Borq sorry! Borq can't see
  wid dis cloth over his eyes. Can Borq look now?&quot; the ogre asked mournfully.
  &quot;Aye, ye can all remove yer blindfolds now, friends. It be time ta get
  ourselves ready. We'll have to negotiate a few tunnels and caverns. I may be
  able to get us in to see Brell once we reach his hall, but while he's
  'indisposed' all the defenses are on 'automatic' y'see, so we'll be having ta
  do a wee bit o' fightin'.&quot; &quot;Finally! Let's get on with this!&quot;
  Ahrvid stormed, tearing off his blindfold and throwing it to the ground. His
  sullen, hostile demeanor had not improved one bit since the incident at the
  inn, but he bit off the insult he would have dearly liked to deliver. Now was
  not the time.....but soon, very soon, he'd take care of the dwarf. <BR><BR>Bruni intoned the prayers that enhanced the party's health, and the shaman
  Sara began to cast her own spells of enhancement as well. Bruni looked at the
  monk and said, &quot;Alright then, scalybutt, you take the lead, jist follow
  the stairs down. When ye get ta the bottom, wait for us ta catch up, and I'll
  give ye further directions. There are a few tunnels down there, and it would
  nae be a good idea to follow the wrong one.&quot; The young monk hissed in
  annoyance, &quot;How many times do I have to ask you to stop calling me that,
  dwarf? I have a name - it's Kai-chen. Think you can remember it, this time,
  or are you finally going senile?&quot; Bruni chuckled, &quot;Ah me lad, it
  warms me heart to know ye care.&quot; Shaking her head at males and their
  ridiculous bonding rituals, Valtyrra summoned her pet. She importuned the
  dwarf and the barbarian female to cast a few enhancements on Lobaner, and
  then tossed a kit she'd bought from a passing mage to him. <BR><BR>The party began the long descent into the darkness; Kai-chen in the lead,
  with Borq rumbling right behind. Ahrvid seethed with cold anger, he hated the
  dwarf to begin with, but hated him even more for resurrecting him outside the
  Harpy's Head Tavern as almost an afterthought! He longed for a fight, and it
  looked like he might get his wish... finally. As they began the trek down,
  the group was alert and ready for anything, but as time went on they began to
  relax. Borq sheathed his swords and Kai-chen put his throwing stars away, so
  when the large bat came out of the sky, no-one saw it. <BR><BR>Valtyrra was the bat's target. Luckily she had the foresight to cast a rune
  on herself just after entering, so the surprise attack was harmless. Her pet
  immediately came to her aid, and in her thoughts she heard her mindless
  minion repeating, &quot;Attacking a large bat, master! Taunting attacker
  master!&quot; She cast a quick spell and fell over, seemingly lifeless. Borq
  almost jumped for joy when he saw the bat. &quot;BORQ BARSH!!&quot; he
  bellowed, quickly seizing two swords each larger than the combined population
  of Riverdale, and waded in. The bat turned its attention to this new, rather
  large, menace. The bat's razor sharp talons were soon slicing through Barq's
  armor, but a quick incantation from Bruni and he was bathed in a healing
  white light. Sara quickly muttered a strange chant under her breath, and the
  bat's movements slowed down considerably. The bat turned to attach her, but at
  that moment Ahrvid joined the fray, and stunned the creature with his shield
  before it could attack S! ara. Valtyrra picked herself off the ground and
  soon a cloud of lethal darkness enveloped the bat. Battle was waged for a few
  moments, and then Kai-chen got the killing blow in, when one of his kicks
  landed particularly hard. Ahrvid checked the corpse, pocketed a bat wing,
  then the group continued down. <BR><BR>The rest of the trip was uneventful, but Bruni knew it wouldn't stay that
  way. The bat was a fluke. The path has always been a safe passage down, but
  at the bottom lay the bones of many an adventurer who wasn't up to the
  challenges. At the bottom, Valtryya and Sara sat down while Bruni went to
  talk to the monk. &quot;Ok Scaleybutt, ya did a fair job wit da nasty bat,
  but now is where we see what ya are really made of. Up ahead is a room wit'
  three passages off it. Ya needs ta clear to the room, then the room itself.
  Once ya's done that, we can move into the room and take it from there. The
  beasts between here and dere will make that flying rat we just dropped look
  easy.&quot; Teasingly he asked, &quot;Are ye up to it?&quot; <BR><BR>Kai-chen hissed softly, and started down the path. Up ahead he could see the
  first of his targets. Ah good, he was familiar with these... big and tough, but
  about as stupid as the day is long. He plucked a throwing star out of his
  pouch, and threw it at the closest gnoll. Two came running, but he
  immediately dropped to the ground as if dead. Ahrvid was watching this all
  happen, and as the second gnoll shrugged and wandered back to his post,
  Ahrvid muttered a quick incantation and oily black smoke swirled around the
  feet of the first gnoll who was still wondering how the monk died. Maddened
  that something had the nerve to attack it, the gnoll began to walk over to
  teach a lesson to whoever snared it without warning it's companion. As it
  came into camp, Ahrvid fell to the ground, but the gnoll wasn't fooled this
  time. Borq bellowed his war cry, &quot;BORQ BARSH&quot; and quickly got the
  gnolls attention. The rest of the group leaped into action, and soon the
  fight was over. <BR><BR>It wasn't much longer before the way to the first room was clear, and the
  grouped moved forward. Things were progressing well... Bruni had a new found
  admiration for Valtyrra. He had heard of necromancer's abilities to channel
  mystical energy from the bodies of their foes into the bodies of their
  allies, but this was the first time he had experienced it firsthand. He was
  could feel himself almost crackling with energy. Every time a beast made it
  to camp it was encased in a dazzling display of colors as spells of all types
  were cast. Borq was the only one taking any serious damage, so his healing
  duties were easy. Sara turned out to be a gem in the rough, as she was able
  to slow down every beast before Kai brought it to camp. Borq surprised him...
  there wasn't much of anything else except bone in that head of his, but
  watching him, Kai-chen and Ahrvid bring back the beasts one after another was
  almost like watching a deadly dance. No words were spoken, but each did the!
  ir job perfectly. <BR><BR>Once they entered the cavern, all eyes turned to Bruni for further
  instruction. &quot;Alrighty then, that went well. This next bit could be a
  piece o' cake, or a bloody nightmare. This cave is riddled with pockets o'
  quicksand and pools of magma, and there's only one path through ta the other
  side. At the end of the path, there's a river, and while it's not very wide,
  it's a river o' fire, so ain't anybody going swimming. The path through is
  guarded by patrolling Earth and Fire elementals, which believe it or not is a
  good thing - all we have ta do is watch where they patrol, and that will show
  us where it's safe ta walk.&quot; &quot;And these elementals will just let us
  stroll along on our merry way, I suppose?&quot; asked Ahrvid with a sarcastic
  tone. Bruni rolled his eyes as answered him, &quot;We'll be invisible, ya
  idjit. Fortunately, Brell's summoned minions don't have the ability to see in
  the invisible spectrum.&quot; He turned to Valtyrra. &quot;Lass, I know there
  have been recent improve! ments to casters' invisibility spells - did ye by
  any chance acquire a copy of such a spell?&quot; <BR><BR>Valtyrra cursed. &quot;No, I've had a fixed-duration version that will work
  on me only for a long time, but I haven't yet been able to get the scroll
  with the improved incantations that would allow me to cast the spell on
  others. We'll have to rely on the variable-duration spell for some of you.
  However, I can ensure everyone will be able to see each other, with the added
  bonus of levitation, which should prevent any disasters should we stray off
  the paths.&quot; She sent her pet into suspended animation, and then cast the
  required spells. Sara and Ahrvid were both able to cast their own
  invisibility spells, and Bruni luckily had a gnomish contraption that
  performed the same function, so apart from herself, she only had to cast the
  invisibility spell on the warrior and the monk. <BR><BR>Ahrvid sneeringly brought up another complaint. &quot;With my mistress' spell
  we can float, why bother following any paths at all?&quot; Bruni sighed and
  spoke slowly, &quot;That'd serve for the quicksand, but the pools of magma
  are bubbling constantly, and spraying up hot lava. I dunno 'bout you, but I'm
  not fireproof. Besides, ye can't even SEE the bridge from this side, yet.
  Perhaps once we can see the bridge, we can see if there's a way ta avoid the
  magma pools and cut straight across. Alright, enough jibber-jabbering, let's
  go, and pray the Invisibility doesn't wear off too soon!&quot; Matching
  action to words, he located one of the walking rockmen that was heading further
  into the cave, and followed it. The others had no choice but to follow him.
  &quot;Bouncy! Bouncy!&quot; Borq squealed. &quot;SHHHHH! They aren't deaf,
  y'know!&quot; Bruni admonished. Borq quieted, but it was plain by the grin on
  his face that he was enjoying himself enormously. <BR><BR>As they ventured further into the cave, they could feel the heat emanating
  from the pools, and could hear a vast roaring somewhere ahead, as if from a
  forest fire, that could only be coming from the river. The elementals paid
  them no notice. Miraculously, the invisibility spells did not drop for
  several minutes, and it seemed they would be able to make it across without
  incident, until Borq tripped over a jutting rock. As he went - splat! - the
  shroud of invisibility lifted, and a dozen elementals turned to glare at him.
  They converged on the ogre and began pounding with the single-mindedness
  characteristic of their kind, ignoring the magma and quicksand all around.
  Some of them were consumed by the pools, but the noise attracted more and
  more of their kindred. Each of the party members popped into view as they
  went into battle mode, and they began to wreak carnage. However, for every
  elemental they killed, more came. <BR><BR>&quot;We cannae stay here, we need ta run fer it. If we can get across the
  bridge and destroy it somehow, they will na be able to follow us across the
  river of fire. Dumb as they are, once we are out o' sight, they'll ferget
  about us,&quot; Bruni yelled, as he slammed his axe into the forehead of an
  elemental, smashing it to pieces. The group ran the last few yards, and
  started across the bridge. Bruni turned to block the elementals from
  following, but Valtyrra shoved him out of her way, &quot;Move dwarf, I'll
  take care of this!&quot; Bruni opened his mouth to object, but she cast her
  spell and suddenly the elementals turned tail and ran. On the edges of the
  spell, he felt a tiny fraction of the terror she had induced. &quot;Come on,
  this won't last long,&quot; she said. <BR><BR>&quot;The bridge is made 'o living rock, we must destroy it before those
  beasties come back!&quot; he yelled to the group, once they had crossed.
  Ahrvid stepped up pushing the dwarf aside and growled, &quot;My turn!&quot;
  He concentrated all his hate and anger, calling upon the shadowknight's most
  destructive ability. As he made his preparations, he could see the elementals
  streaming back. As the first of them started across the bridge, he knelt down
  and laid his hands upon it. &quot;Get back!&quot; he roared. The group backed
  away, and he unleashed the power of his Harm Touch. The rocky span detonated,
  and the shock waves from the explosion buffeted the group, Arvid taking the
  brunt of the damage and falling to the ground. Bruni walked over to what was
  left of Ahrvid. &quot;Hey Scaleybutt - see if ye can find his arms, will
  ye?&quot; Once the corpse was reassembled, Bruni resurrected and healed the
  shadowknight. &quot;There ye are - good as new. Good job, by the way.&quot;
  Ahrvid blinked in confusion - was that! a compliment? He must still be
  suffering resurrection effects.... &quot;Right then, through that tunnel and
  we're almost there,&quot; he said, pointing north. &quot;At the end of the
  tunnel is the door that leads into Brell's halls.&quot; <BR><BR>Meanwhile, back at the Harpy's Head Tavern, a storm bellowed with rage as a
  cold darkness stretched its hand to the tavern as hate began to move closer.
  The faint echo of evil laughter and clattering bones....coming
  closer...closer...but there was another sound that demanded attention...the
  clanging of armor, and then silence... Only a moment later the tavern door
  flew open, and a bloody Wood Elf warrior named Seether rushed in. &quot;The
  skeletons are coming!&quot; Seether yelled with little breath. &quot;The
  who?&quot; The innkeeper asked. &quot;The skeletons!&quot; Seether yelled
  once more. &quot;What skeletons?&quot; The innkeeper asked. &quot;These
  skeletons!&quot; Seether yelled as he was yanked back outside by a legion of
  conscripts. Seether let out a thunderous battle cry as he took a Defensive
  stance, wielding his Adventurer's Riding Whip and Sword of the Bloodsworm.
  For every one skeleton taken down, there were five ready to take its place.
  Soon the more powerful of the skeleton army would be approachin! g, and
  Seether would be completely overrun. <BR><BR>After waiting Ahrvid to recover somewhat, the group pressed on. The trek
  though the tunnel was uneventful, and they at last came to the door to
  Brell's palace. Bruni sat down, and started thinking. &quot;What are we
  waiting for?&quot; complained Ahrvid, &quot;We're here, lets go in.&quot;
  &quot;Hold Ahrvid,&quot; said Valtyrra, placing a hand on his arm. &quot;You
  do not go barging into a cod's house if you wish a long life.&quot; &quot;Aye
  lad,&quot; Bruni agreed, &quot;Brell's a tempermental one. We need to handle
  this delicately.&quot; Valtyrra eyed the dwarf suspiciously, remembering his
  &quot;delicate&quot; handling of things back at the Harpy's Head tavern. She
  couldn't come up with any ideas however, and left it to the dwarf on how best
  to handle Brell. Suddenly, the cleric's eyes lit up. &quot;You have an
  idea?&quot; asked Sara. <BR><BR>&quot;Aye lass, I do,&quot; Bruni said as he pulled out an intricate necklace
  and placed it around his neck. &quot;A simple gift from me lord, Brell, for
  being a good wee' dwarf way back when,&quot; he murmured as he touched the
  Disciple Symbol of Brell Serilis lightly. The necklace glowed faintly and
  pint of Brell's blessed stout appeared in his hands. &quot;Ahh, that'll do
  nicely&quot; Bruni said, quite satisfied with himself. &quot;Ok now, listen
  up,&quot; Bruni said as he conjured more stout. &quot;Give me a few minutes
  alone in there, then start coming in one at a time.&quot; He instructed them
  in the order he wanted them to appear, and stepped inside the palace
  balancing the numerous ales. As the door closed, the party could hear him
  yelling, &quot;Ach, woe is me, for Ah've got all this ale, and no free hands
  ta drink it wid!&quot; A booming voice could be heard, &quot;Bruni, is that
  you? And did you say ALE!?&quot; <BR><BR>The voices faded away as the party sat down to wait. After a few minutes,
  Sara stood up and faced the door. &quot;Here goes,&quot; she said, and taking
  a deep breath, headed inside. &quot;Close your mouth boys,&quot; scolded
  Valtyrra after the door closed, &quot;can't a girl take a breath around here
  without your eyes nearly leaving your fool heads?&quot; Borq, Ahrvid and
  Kai-chen obediently shut their mouths. <BR><BR>One by one the adventurers went inside, until only Valtyrra was left. At the
  appointed time, she picked herself up and opened the door. As she walked down
  the corridor, she could hear what was quite obviously a couple of dwarves
  having a grand old time. She confessed to being quite nervous - a dark elf
  that stepped inside Brell's castle was a dark elf that was never seen of
  again. Being a necromancer on top of that, well, she was expecting a quick death.
  Her relief was visible as she entered the room, when Brell took a look at her
  and bellowed, &quot;Ah, ye must be the fair lass Bruni's been telling me
  aboot! He did ye nay favors, dearie. Yas be a much finer looking lady than
  this clod of a cleric ever said! Have a seat, and an ale!&quot; Bruni touched
  his necklace again, and placed a fresh stout in front of her. He gave her a
  quick glance that told her to take the ale and say nothing. All was not as it
  seemed. She sipped the ale silently. <BR><BR>&quot;Now, is that all your companions Bruni?&quot; asked Brell. &quot;Aye me
  lord, this is it,&quot; Bruni replied. &quot;Ah good,&quot; intoned Brell.
  &quot;Perhaps you can explain ta me why yas taken up with an Ogre, an Iksar
  and a couple o' dark elves, one being a necromancer ta boot?&quot; asked
  Brell, suddenly very sober and looking none too pleased. &quot;Really Bruni,
  ya didn't think a mere couple of ales would dampen me senses so much as ta
  not see that, did ya? I mean really, one doesn't get ta stay a deity for long
  if one allows for that, now does he?&quot; &quot;Now, EXPLAIN!&quot; bellowed
  Brell. <BR><BR>Bruni gulped, not expecting this turn. His dwarven temper decided at that
  moment to make itself known. &quot;And did ye think I'd be cavorting with
  folks like this if it wasn't important, now do ye Brell? Or do YOU think I've
  decided taking evilly aligned folks to see my god would be a grand joke, and
  nay, 'tis ok if you kill me, them and let our bodies rot here for ever
  after?&quot; snorted Bruni. &quot;Or, do ya think maybe, just MAYBE,&quot; he
  hollered, standing up and glaring at Brell, &quot;it MIGHT BE
  IMPORTANT??!!&quot; Anger flashed from his eyes, as the rest of the party
  prepared to meet their end, fighting to the last. Brell just looked at him
  for a minute. Everyone was holding their breath, just waiting for something
  to happen. Then Brell started making a choking noise. The party looked at
  Bruni quizzically. Tears began welling up in Brell's eyes, and as the party
  watched in morbid fascination, Brell erupted in boisterous laughter, which
  went echoing up and down the great halls. <BR><BR>Several minutes went by as the god struggled to get a hold of himself. Slowly
  it dawned on Valtyrra that she wasn't going to die... yet. &quot;Ach, ok, ok
  Bruni. Damned clerics anyways, always did have a soft spot in me heart for
  yas. Sit down and tell me what ye want.&quot; &quot;And this time,&quot; he
  said, glaring at Bruni with glassy eyes, &quot;tell me what ya REALLY want,
  not some poppycock story about having too much ale&quot;. Bruni looked at
  Brell, and said, &quot;Me lord, begging your pardon, but it's not me story to
  tell.&quot; &quot;Well then, whose is it?&quot; demanded the god. &quot;It's
  mine&quot; said Valtyrra, as Brell's head quickly swiveled around to see her.
  &quot;Well, out with girl!&quot; said Brell, pounding a large fist on the
  table. <BR><BR>Valtyrra jumped, then composing herself, began her tale. &quot;...so that's
  why, when my original plan to retrieve my Master's heart from Tunare's temple
  failed, I came up with this second plan, to ask Bruni's help to reach you and
  ask for your intervention with your 'brother' Bristlebane.&quot; Valtyrra
  took a deep breath (since it seemed to have such salutary effects on males,
  and even if he was a God, Brell was definitely male) and continued, &quot;So,
  will you help me, Lord Brell?&quot; <BR><BR>Brell erupted in laughter once more. &quot;So, Mr.
  'I'm-the-Prince-of-Hate-I'll-never-succumb-to-the-weakness-of-Love' Innoruuk
  is acting like a love-sick puppy? Ah, that's a good one! Old Gloomy Puss
  Inny, painting his castle pink and planting daisies! I'm sure he's much
  improved, lass, so why do ye think I'd possibly want to change how things
  stand?&quot; Valtyrra spoke once more of the very necessary Balance, although
  she was considerably more courteous than she had been with Bruni when she had
  explained it to him. &quot;Consider one last thought, my lord...just as my
  Master has been affected by His missing heart, what is the heart doing to He
  who holds it now?&quot; <BR><BR>Brell stood up with a look of extreme astonishment on his face. Without any
  warning, he disappeared in a flash of light, and then promptly reappeared,
  swearing profusely. &quot;I'll help ye, lass. I've just looked in on
  Bristlebane in his Plane o' Mischief, and you were right! The place looks
  absolutely gruesome, and me light-hearted, fun-lovin' brother actually
  snarled at me and looked ready to attack me! The change that has come over
  him is terrible, just terrible. And you should see Rivervale and the
  halflings, they're worse than Dark Elves now.&quot; Valtyrra looked mildly
  offended. &quot;Er - no offense but yer race has almost always been a surly
  lot. Although you females have some redeeming characteristics,&quot; he said
  with a wink. Seeing where Brell was looking as he said this, Valtyrra blushed
  a deep purple. <BR><BR>Bruni coughed to get Brell's attention, &quot;So, my Lord, do you have a
  plan?&quot; Brell held his head in hands a few moments, trying to come up
  with a plan. Sara looked around, then suggested &quot;Well, it seems obvious
  to me that if you need to 'retrieve' something, then a rogue is who you need
  to hire.&quot; Brell slowly lefted his head out od hands, and stared at Sara.
  &quot;By the rocks below lass, I think you've nailed it. But, this will take
  a very special rogue indeed. Bristlebane won't be fooled for a second by yer
  run-o-the-mill rogue. Who do we know that could accomplish such a feat?&quot;
  The group looked around at each other at a loss. Then, Sara said something
  under her breath. Ahrvid looked at the girl and almost politely said
  &quot;Well, if you have something to say, then out with it!&quot;.
  Shadowknights can only be *so* polite, after all. <BR><BR>Sara screwed up her courage, and said, &quot;Well, I was saying I know a
  rogue who could do it. My brother. He turned to the thieving ways back when
  he was still a boy. I know recently he's been playing around in a deep dark
  dungeon, trying to pilfer it treasures. He said it was the tomb of a insane
  dragon... Terrafirma, or something like that...?&quot; Brell paled at her words,
  &quot;Lass, ye don't mean Kerafyrm, now do ye?&quot; &quot;Yes, yes that's
  it!&quot; squealed Sara. &quot;He makes occasional trips there and comes out
  with the most marvelous treasure! He said he can sneak right under the
  dragon's nose.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said Valtyrra, &quot;Your brother
  sounds like who we need... And I wouldn't mind meeting a man like that&quot;
  she added softly under her breath. &quot;When does he come back from the
  Sleeper's tomb?&quot; &quot;He left about a month ago. He won't be back for a
  long time. We usually only see him once a year or so. Last time he visited us
  he drew me a map of where he was going next. I have it right here,&quot; she
  said! , drawing a crumpled piece of parchment out from her ample bosum. She
  handed it to Bruni. <BR><BR>The rest of the party looked at each other. They were all too familiar with
  Sleeper's tomb, and what it meant to go there. Not too mention the intricate
  lock they would need to get past first. &quot;Who has done the tasks needed
  to open the dungeon door?&quot; asked Ahrvid. &quot;Ach, I can open the
  door,&quot; said Bruni. He looked at his companions sheepishly, &quot;Well,
  what can I say? A good cleric gets around in Norrath.&quot; Bruni looked at
  the map Sara had given him. &quot;Aye, your brother likes to go in deep,
  doesn't he? I know where this is, but it's a fair ways inside the dungeon and
  past some rather nasty warders.&quot; <BR><BR>Brell looked at the band of adventurer's. &quot;Well,&quot; he said &quot;if
  yer gonna go ta fight dragons, the least I can do is give yas some gear so
  yer hides don't get turned inta ash first fight.&quot; Brell disappeared once
  again in a flash of light, then quickly reappeared holding a large trunk.
  &quot;Go thru here, and take what ya need. I imagine it'll be quite the
  upgrade for nearly all of you,&quot; he snickered as he eyed them. The group
  approached the trunk and began sorting though all the godly items it held.
  &quot;Yer also going to be in need of a mentally unstable Warrior as
  bait.&quot; Brell said with a grin as he waved a hand. &quot;I know of one
  lad who's not had a strike of common sense in years.&quot; With that said,
  Seether appeared out of nowhere laying before Brell, very beat up. &quot;This
  lad tried to take on those skeletons by 'imself...looks like he lost.&quot;
  &quot;What the heck do we need a Warrior fer? We have a Shadow Knight!&quot;
  Bruni said, pointing to Seether and then to Ahrvid. &quot;Ah yes, but you
  don't! want yer Shadow Knight to die outright...&quot; Brell said with a
  grin. &quot;But who in their right mind would die like that?!&quot; Bruni
  replied. &quot;A drunken Warrior like him.&quot; Brell said as he pointed to
  Seether, and healed his wounds. &quot;RAAAAAAAAAAWRRR!!&quot; Seether yelled
  out as he jumped to his feet. &quot;Oh...thank ya...&quot; <BR><BR>The group began the long trek to the Eastern Wastelands of Velious. Seether
  became a shadow to Bruni, or more to the point, Bruni's ale-summoning
  necklace. He seemed to have an unquenchable thirst for ale. After weeks of
  travel they at last came to the mysterious dragon portal in Eastern Wastes.
  They could hear a strange, eerie humming emanating from it, a sound that sent
  shivers down their spines. Bruni approached the portal, and holding small
  statue in one hand, placed his other upon the frozen dragon. A small,
  swirling black hole appeared, slowly growing larger. Finally it was large
  enough to allow the travelers through. A cold wind howled out the swirling
  mist. &quot;Go in, quick!&quot; shouted Bruni over the noise. &quot;It dinna
  stay open fer long, now MOVE!&quot; Seether jumped in first, followed quickly
  by Borq. The rest of the adventurers entered, and finally Bruni threw himself
  into the chaotic maelstrom. The dark hole quickly dissipated until there was
  nothing left but the bitt! er cold of the Eastern Wastes. <BR><BR>Bruni finally came to the end of the dark spiral, landing in a most
  undignified heap at the feet of the others. He got up and brushed himself
  off, looking around. He crept up to a nearby archway and peeked in. Up ahead
  were the large guardians he remembered from past adventures in here.
  &quot;Tis nothing here we want to fight. I think we need to try and slide by
  all these monstrosities and venture in,&quot; he whispered. &quot;And HOW do
  you plan to 'slide by' these creatures??&quot; asked Valtyrra. &quot;They
  aren't exactly going to let us just walk past.&quot; Bruni smiled a crooked
  smile, and with wink disappeared around the corner. The others saw a faint
  white glow, then the strange sound of something large sighing. Seether
  muttered to himself &quot;I thought *I* was supposed to be the insane one
  around here...&quot; <BR><BR>A few sighs later, and Bruni popped his head around the corner. &quot;Come ta
  me, but be very quiet.&quot; The others looked at each other, but trusting
  the dwarf, ventured in. Sure enough, they walked right under the feet of the
  massive guardians, who seemed to be lost in a daydream of sorts. Valtyrra
  eyes were full of questions, but she held her tongue. She was terrified one
  of the monsters would awaken. Slowly, the group crept forward. Sara noticed the
  dwarven cleric wasn't using a spell, but one of the godly items Brell had
  given them. He'd walk to a guardian, but not TOO close, bow his head and
  mutter something, then touch a vambrace. The vambrace would take on a golden
  glow, and then a small sliver of pure white light would reach out and gently
  caress the guardian. A few seconds later the guardian would sigh, and the
  group would move forward. <BR><BR>It was a slow, nerve-wracking process, but they finally made it to the end of
  the guardians. The band of adventurers collapsed in a small cul-de-sac and
  rested. Before Valtyrra could say anything Bruni held up his hand and said,
  &quot;It's a magical Bracer of Brell. It'll calm any beast, no matter what.
  'Tis the only one like it in the world. Brell told me it was won during a 'GM
  event', whatever that may be.&quot; Valtyrra nodded her head and said,
  &quot;A very useful thing, that bracer.&quot; &quot;Aye,&quot; replied Bruni,
  &quot;but it can only be worn by a cleric worshipper of Brell&quot;. <BR><BR>After resting the group resumed their journey. At times places were open, and
  the group could admire the breathtaking beauty of the place - beautiful, but
  nonetheless, deadly. Sara hated when they had to walk past beings that looked
  like they could kill the group with a mere glance. After journeying most of the
  day, Bruni finally announced they had come to a safe place. When questioned
  how he knew, he told them the raiding parties he had been here before with
  often used this spot to regroup. The adventurers shrugged of the heavy
  backpacks and settled in for the night. <BR><BR>Around midnight Ahrvid awoke suddenly. The rest of the party was deep asleep,
  exhausted. He didn't move a muscle, but used every sense he had to 'look'
  around. Then he saw it, a drawstring on a nearby backpack was slowly untying
  itself! He knew immediately that the rogue they were looking for was here, in
  camp, but, how was he to catch him? Then it dawned on him, he had a mystical
  cap lying nearby that allowed him see things invisible. He just needed to get
  it on his head without attracting attention. He watched the workings of the
  rogue as he went from backpack to backpack. Finally the rogue went to a
  backpack that was facing him; the shadowknight surmised the rogue must be
  facing the backpack and not him. Quietly, his hand snuck out and silently grabbed
  the crown and placed it on his head. Aha! He could see the shadowed man now.
  He muttered a soft incantation and waited. <BR><BR>&quot;OW!&quot; shouted the rogue, unaware of what hurt him. It was a minor
  hurt, but it had surprised him. Realizing he had just awakened the party, he
  tried to run but found his feet felt like they were trapped. He could barely
  move at a walk, much less a run. A few seconds later, the sharp pain stabbed
  him again. &quot;Ow, hey, what IS that?&quot; shrieked the rogue. Seether was
  on his feet in a heartbeat and wildly started waving his sword. &quot;Where
  is he, where is he? Lemme at 'em!&quot; he shouted. Ahrvid got to his feet
  and quickly calmed the group down. &quot;I think I've found your brother,
  Sara,&quot; he annouced, quite pleased with himself. <BR><BR>&quot;My... my brother?&quot; she asked, looking around. &quot;Where, I don't
  see him.&quot; &quot;OW!&quot; yelled the rogue, as the shadowknight's spell
  did its damage again. Valtyrra glided to her feet and muttered a quick spell.
  &quot;Ah, there you are,&quot; she purred. &quot;How nice of you to come see
  us.&quot; Sara quickly murmured a spell that allowed the entire party to see
  the rogue then ran forward and embraced her long lost brother.
  &quot;Sara!!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;What in the name of the Tribunal are
  YOU doing here?&quot; &quot;Looking for you, silly&quot; she said.
  &quot;Well, I guess you... OW!... found me,&quot; he remarked. <BR><BR>Bruni strode forward and said, &quot;Bruni's me name boy, and we're in dire
  need of a rogue.&quot; &quot;You come to Sleeper's tomb to get a rogue?&quot;
  Sara's brother asked incredulously. &quot;Naw young one,&quot; said Bruni,
  &quot;We came here to get *you*!&quot; &quot;I told them about you&quot; said
  Sara. &quot;We need the best rogue in the world, and I knew that had to be
  you.&quot; &quot;OW!&quot; shouted the rogue again. &quot;Tell ye what young
  one,&quot; said Bruni, &quot;promise not to go running off, and I'll remove
  that snare from around ye legs. But first, what be yer name?&quot; The rogue,
  seeing his sister, decided to trust the group. Besides, that snare hurt!
  &quot;My name is Zanatar,&quot; he said, &quot;And I promise to not run
  off... for now.&quot; <BR><BR>Bruni chuckled at him, and cast a minor spell. Suddenly the rogue's feet were
  free and the pain stopped. Valtyrra sidled up and said, &quot;Zanatar, we
  have need of your special... skills.&quot; &quot;What's in it for me?&quot;
  he asked. &quot;The ability to continue living enough for you, rogue?&quot;
  asked Valtyrra sweetly. Bruni stepped in before an argument began... damn
  dark elves anyway, he muttered. He calmed everyone down and began explaining.
  A long time later, he finally finished. Zanatar looked at him,
  &quot;Bristlebane's gone... bad?&quot; &quot;Aye me lad, and they'll others
  before too long if we don't do something quickly,&quot; replied Bruni.
  &quot;Without Bristlebane, rogues will have no place in the world!&quot; he
  exclaimed. &quot;Count me in, but you can ALSO count me in for a share of the
  loot&quot; he said, looking at Valtyrra. &quot;Aye me lad, if we live to spend
  it,&quot; said Bruni. &quot;Now, let's make the most of what left of the
  night, and get out of here in the morning.&quot; <BR><BR>The rest of the evening was uneventful. The next morning Bruni's bracer was
  put to work, and before long they found themselves back in Eastern Wastes,
  standing on the dragon statue. Zanatar eyed the Bruni's bracer. &quot;Shame
  that only works for clerics,&quot; he said, &quot;I could put that to mighty
  good use. Would you consider a 'partner', perhaps?&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot;
  said Bruni, looking at him sternly, &quot;I willa not use a gift such as this
  for evil.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; sighed Zanatar, &quot;I had to ask.&quot;
  The group got up, and began the long trek back. <BR><BR>&quot;Well, my Lord,&quot; Bruni said as the weary party trudged back into
  Brell's halls, &quot;We've found the rogue, Zanatar's his name. Let's get on
  with it, if ye don't mind.&quot; Brell raised an eyebrow at the dwarf's
  impertinent tone, but he let it pass, he could see that Bruni was all but
  exhausted. He waved his hands and the party felt a refreshing wave flow
  through them, banishing fatigue and restoring their spirits. 'Well
  done!&quot; boomed Brell's voice. &quot;Let us proceed to my Brother's realm.
  He clapped his hands and an intense multicolored light enveloped them. When
  the light dissipated, the party found themselves with Brell, standing in front
  of a tiny castle located at the base of snow-covered cliffs. <BR><BR>&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute!&quot; roared Bruni, glaring at his god,
  &quot;If ye could transport us in an instant, why did we have to trek to the
  Sleeper's tomb and back for all those weeks?!?!&quot; &quot;I'll explain
  myself to you this once, mortal, but do not presume to speak to your god in
  such a tone again,&quot; Brell said in a quiet yet ominous tone. Bruni
  blanched as he realized he'd offended Brell. Brell continued, &quot;You
  gained a new companion when you left me, and yet another new companion at the
  Tomb. In both instances, I felt it was the wisest course to allow you to
  journey for a time together, so that you might grow accustomed to each
  others' fighting styles, and work out any little problems before the final encounter.
  Does this meet with your approval?&quot; Brell asked. Bruni nodded sheepishly
  &quot;Please forgive me, my Lord, you are infinitely wise and I am infinitely
  - not.&quot; <BR><BR>Brell laughed. &quot;Done! Now then, let us enter. My brother Bristlebane's
  grown distracted and I will cast a glamour that will prevent his notice, but
  keep in mind that I cannot aid ye in fighting any guardians, or He WILL
  notice us and banish you from the Plane of Mischief, and I will have to
  either fight him, which I won't do, or leave.&quot; He turned to Zanatar.
  &quot;You rogue, must remain hidden at all times, for ultimately everything
  we do is but a distraction to permit you to get the Heart.&quot; Zanatar
  gulped, and nodded. Sara shrank the group one by one, and then they stepped
  up to the tiny castle and entered the Plane of Mischief. <BR><BR>The tiny adventurers found themselves on a blue translucent platform on the
  outskirts of a forest. They quickly hopped down and looked around. Brell
  looked around at the scene, dismayed. What used to be a pristine forest filled
  with mirthful mushroom men was now a dark, forbidding place. You couldn't see
  very far into the forest, but one could see the hatred-filled eyes looking
  back out of it. Valtyrra and Ahrvid, and to a lesser extent Borq, felt
  somewhat at home here. Brell knelt down to whisper something to Kai-Chen.
  When he stood up he announced, &quot;Our little lizard friend here is going
  to start clearing the way to the castle beyond. Prepare for battle!&quot; <BR><BR>Kai-chen disappeared into the woods and quickly re-appeared with a twisted
  mushroom man on his heels. Borq launched an arrow, and all too soon the fight
  was over. A few more forays into the forest brought forth numerous deformed
  creatures, all of which met a quick end. Finally Kai-chen said that that was
  the last of them. The small group carefully made their way into the forest,
  and quickly came upon Bristlebane's castle. Or, what had once been his
  castle. The dark tower standing there sent chills through each party member.
  Finally Bruni said, &quot;Well, standing here gawking 'taint gonna git us any
  closer. C'mon me lad and lassies, lets push on.&quot; <BR><BR>The group reluctantly approached the foreboding castle. The castle did not
  bear any resemblance to its former self. As the group crept through its dank
  and dismal halls, they imagined they could feel the press of a thousand
  burning eyes, hatred in every glance. Valtyrra felt quite at home here. They
  reached the base of the tower without incident, but when they tried to open
  the iron door, they found that it was locked. &quot;Psst - Zanatar - are ye
  there lad?&quot; whispered Bruni. &quot;If ye are, we're in the way of
  needin' ye're expertise on this door.&quot; Zanatar did not answer, but they
  heard a soft click and the door gave a loud creak as it swung open.
  &quot;Good lad! Go on an' reconnoiter then, an' see if ye can find what we're
  after. We'll start our way up to the top of the Tower, makin' sure as many
  folks as possible notice us. That should keep the attention off of you.&quot;
  <BR><BR>Bruni and Sara cast the most powerful spells Brell had supplied to them,
  infusing the party with additional health, stamina and other protections.
  Then they walked through the door. Immediately, a guard called out.
  &quot;Halt! Who goes there?!&quot; When he saw the group, such a hodge-podge
  of races and classes that would normally be tearing each other apart, he
  quickly and correctly concluded they were under attack, and tried to yell out
  the alarm. However, Ahrvid reached out and slammed the guard unconscious with
  his shield. Disgusted, Valtyrra smacked him over the head with her staff. &quot;Fool!
  We WANT him to raise the alarm, we're the distraction, remember?&quot;
  &quot;Sorry Mistress&quot;, he said, rubbing the back of his head. He turned,
  picked the guard up off the floor, and shook him. &quot;Wake up, you!&quot;
  Borq reached over and took him from Ahrvid. &quot;Lemme! Borq wake him up!
  Wake him up real good!&quot; and he breathed into his face. The guard coughed
  and gagged. &quot;Gah! What is that smell?!&quot; ! Then he moaned in pain,
  and asked groggily, &quot;Did anyone get the name of that dragon?&quot; Borq
  set him on his feet, but held him up, as the guard seemed none too steady.
  Then the guard opened his eyes and looked up to see Borq's smiling face
  inches from his own. He jumped back from Borq, and ran screaming down the
  hall. &quot;Aaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee! Help! Murder! Ogres!
  It's an invasion! RAID! It's a RAID!&quot; With the alarm having been sounded
  numerous guards began to pour into the corridor. <BR><BR>&quot;Yep, that's done it alright,&quot; Seether said, in frank admiration.
  He and Borq waded into the veritable sea of guards, and happily began
  &quot;distracting&quot; them. Ahrvid and the monk Kai-chen followed close
  behind, not willing to let the warriors hog all the fun. Valtyrra and Sara
  kept their pets close, to protect them and Bruni while they cast their
  spells. Inch by terrible inch, they forced their way down the hall, and up
  the spiraling stone stairs, to the top of the tower. The stairs were slick
  with blood, and the group drooped with exhaustion by the time they reached
  the top. They walked across the tiled floor towards the throne at the far
  end, glancing warily about. In all the hours of fighting, they had not seen
  any sign of Bristlebane. The throne stood empty. <BR><BR>&quot;Oh that's just great!&quot; ranted Ahrvid. &quot;All that, and he isn't
  even here! NOW what are we supposed to do? Go home empty-handed?&quot;
  &quot;On no, we mustn't have that,&quot; they heard and Bristlebane appeared
  in a flash of light. He was in his halfling form, but it was twisted beyond
  all recognition. The normally cheery disposition and mischievous nature of
  the halfling was replaced by a sinister leer and a dark, insane light
  emanated from his eyes. &quot;We can't let our guests leave just yet, can we,
  my sweet?&quot; he said, talking to something he held in his hand. A huge
  cage slammed down from out of nowhere, trapping the group. <BR><BR>&quot;Brell!&quot; Bruni called out. &quot;We need ye're help, Mighty One!
  Heed my call!&quot; Bristlebane let out a high, maniacal giggle.
  &quot;Looking for someone?&quot; He clapped his hands and Brell appeared at
  the foot of the throne. He seemed to be unconscious, his body broken and
  bloody. &quot;I'm afraid that my dear brother is indisposed at the
  moment.&quot; Bruni gasped and moaned in despair. &quot;Ye're a monster&quot;
  he whispered. &quot;Kinslayer!&quot; &quot;Oh, don't be so melodramatic,
  dwarf. He's not dead - yet. I'm having much too much fun playing with him,
  I'm sure he's got eons of entertainment left in him yet. You mortals on the
  other hand, aren't so durable. I doubt you'll even last an hour,&quot; he
  said with a pout. <BR><BR>&quot;Oh - I don't know about that, My Lord,&quot; purred Valtyrra, &quot;we
  Dark Elves are quite talented in the arts of torture, and have been known to
  keep a subject alive and screaming for several weeks at a time. I'm sure I
  could be of great help in that respect.&quot; She smiled seductively at
  Bristlebane. The others turned and stared at Valtyrra. &quot;Lass, what are
  ye sayin' ?&quot; demanded Bruni. Interested, Bristlebane opened the cage
  door and motioned Valtyrra to come out. The others tried to rush out but an
  unseen force held them back. &quot;Yes, wench, what are you saying? Would you
  have me believe that you would turn your coat on your friends and you master
  Innoruuk so easily?&quot; &quot;Why not, my Lord? What are these others to
  me, except tools to be used, to gain what I want? And Innoruuk is my master
  no longer. You are the new Prince of Hate, my Liege, and it is to you I owe
  my allegiance.&quot; As she slinked up to him, her every step a study in
  seduction, the emphasis on that word 'allegia! nce' took on a whole new
  meaning. Bruni roared incoherently in anger at her betrayal. <BR><BR>&quot;Mistress!&quot; Ahrvid called out, reaching through the bars to her.
  &quot;Do not forget me!&quot; &quot;Ah, faithful Ahrvid. Yes, you deserve
  something for your service, don't you?&quot; she purred as she turned back to
  the cage. &quot;My Liege, release him if you would?&quot; Bemused,
  Bristlebane complied. Ahrvid smirked at the others, and walked out of the
  cage and over to Valtyrra. She smiled and laid a hand on his arm, as if to
  welcome him. He smiled back, until he felt a sharp pain in his arm. He looked
  in horror at Valtyrra's hand, glowing a sickly green, her fingernails
  dripping blood from digging into his arm. He staggered to the ground, and the
  flesh began to wither from his body. In mere seconds, all that was left was a
  skeleton encased in armor. The rest of the group looked on in disbelief. <BR><BR>Puzzled, Bristlebane asked the thing in his hands &quot;Why do you think the
  wench killed her own man, my sweet?&quot; Valtyrra responded, &quot;I've said
  it before, my Lord, he was a fool. And fools always get what they
  deserve!&quot; Bristlebane laughed, and her mocking laughter joined his.
  &quot;Ahhh, a wench after my own heart! Come here girl, and give us a
  kiss!&quot; Bristlebane demanded, patting his lap. Valtyrra obeyed, with all
  apparent delight. She began 'whispering' into his ear, describing the
  tortures her people had devised, and tossing occasional glances back at the group.
  Her discourse was actually loud enough that the group heard quite a bit, and
  was punctuated by Bristlebane's insane giggling. <BR><BR>The group glared at her, but she was out of their reach. Every time
  Bristlebane laughed, it sent shudders running up and down their spines, as
  they imagined the 'fun' he had in store for them. Bruni started an impressive
  diatribe, to drown out Valtyrra's voice, ranting at the perfidy of Dark
  Elves, and female ones in particular. Sara listened distractedly, silently
  cataloguing some of the choicer curses for future use. Her full attention
  wasn't on the dwarf however. She studied Valtyrra and Bristlebane. What else
  was that witch up to? Then her eyes widened and she turned to the others.
  &quot;Hsssst. Quiet! Fascinating as your little performance is Bruni, you
  need to shut up and listen to me, right now!&quot; Cut off in mid-rant, Bruni
  gaped at Sara. In a whisper, she continued. &quot;Ignore what she's saying -
  look at her hands!&quot; <BR><BR>Bruni looked over at Valtyrra, and almost missed what Sara meant. Sitting on
  his lap, and 'whispering' in his ear, Valtyrra was stroking Bristlebane's
  arm, and bit by bit her hands came ever closer to his. She was trying to get
  the Heart! However, Bristlebane was on to her wiles. He stood up,
  unceremoniously dumping her from his lap. &quot;Did you think that I was as
  foolish at that man of yours, wench?!&quot; he roared. Valtyrra landed on the
  floor with a hard thump. The landing dazed her slightly, but she quickly
  recovered. Looking at the twisted god, she feared her life would soon be
  over... or worse, it would go on for an uncomfortably long time. Bristlebane
  was getting himself in a righteous uproar, growing angrier with every passing
  second. His hand was clenched tightly around the heart, which seemed to be
  oozing a black ichor over his fingers, maddening him ever more. Steam sizzled
  from up the stone tiles where the heart's blood dripped. Valtyrra was scared.
  She had nev! er been afraid before, but now she was. A mistress of death, she
  never feared what she could control. But with Bristlebane becoming more and
  more agitated, she feared what every citizen of Norrath did&nbsp; permanent death. <BR><BR>Bristlebane was only vaguely aware of what was happening to him. He had
  guessed the shapely dark elf's intentions right from the beginning and had
  decided to toy with her. But, he wasn't mad, really. He only wanted to tease
  her, get her hopes up and watch as he dashed them to pieces later. He had
  pretended to be angry, but it was all an act. However, once he started, he
  didn't seem able to control it anymore. He clutched his precious heart,
  drawing power from its inexhaustible supply. His feigned anger was, slowly
  but surely, turning to real hatred. For a god of mischief, this was an
  emotion completely foreign to him. He made other people mad, but never
  himself. But, this was somehow different. Who was this mere mortal who dared
  trick the master of tricks himself? The more he thought about it, the harder
  he clenched his hand in anger. He could feel the red hot wrath crawl up his
  arm, gathering strength with each passing inch. The rage continued to grow,
  until h! e felt himself losing control. Spittle sprayed out from his lips, as
  his torrent of abuse toward the frightened female continued. A small part of
  his mind screamed at him that this wasn't a trick, that this was not funny,
  but the frenzy soon overcame that last bastion of his mind, and Bristlebane
  fell into the depths of insanity. <BR><BR>Valtyrra was paralyzed. She could barely move from the fear. Her legs would
  never hold her now, if she even had the presence of mind to try and run.
  Suddenly, she felt a light touch on her arm and a comforting voice very close
  to her ear...&quot;Keep him distracted. If you want to live, make sure he's
  watching YOU!&quot; Zanatar!!! She couldn't believe her luck! Zanatar was
  there, and unnoticed by the raging god! She quickly got a hold of herself,
  and tried to think. Distraction... she could always distract a man. <BR><BR>She swept her hand past her leg in an apparent attempt to right herself. As
  she did, she brushed aside the fabric and revealed a perfectly shaped leg.
  Her dress had a rather high slit on the side, and she used that to her
  advantage. She slid a little on the floor, which resulted in her dress riding
  up on her even more. He could see her well-rounded leg and a hint of her
  curvaceous derriere. Bristlebane's tirade didn't show any signs of slowing,
  but his eyes were firmly on her long, lush leg right now. She noticed his
  hand was clasping the heart just slightly less now too. <BR><BR>&quot;My lord,&quot; she began. &quot;Please, I beg you for my life. I never
  meant to anger you in such fashion, &quot; begged Valtyrra. She got to her
  knees and slowly, seductively crawled across the floor to him. She knelt
  abashedly in front of Bristlebane, placing her hands gently on his knees, and
  stared up into his face. She arched her back and took a deep breath, trying
  her best to look both innocent and sexy at the same time. She most definitely
  succeeded. Bristlebane was not prepared for this reaction. He expected her to
  try and run, or attack, but not this. As he looked down at her, seeing her
  assets' straining against her low cut dress, he began to have second
  thoughts. Perhaps killing her was a bit hasty. Someone as stunning as she was
  might be fun to keep around. He slowly lost his anger, but his insanity was
  now well cemented. Bristlebane stood up, and wiping his mouth with his
  sleeve, took Valtyrra by the hands and slowly pulled her to her feet. His
  eyes greedily dran! k in the curves and swells of her exquisite body. <BR><BR>This was exactly the opportunity Zanatar was hoping for. He knew they were
  all dead if something didn't happen, and he was the only one in a position to
  make that something' happen. As he watched, Bristlebane braced himself on the
  arms of his throne and stood up. His hand lingered around the heart, never
  letting go, but just barely holding it. Then, he momentarily released the
  heart to pull Valtyrra to her feet. Zanatar decided at that moment it was
  time to die so his companions may live. He crept behind the god and silently
  drew an evil-looking dagger from beneath his cloaks. The keen edge glinted
  harshly in the soft light. In a smooth, controlled thrust of his hand, he
  plunged the dagger deep into the god's back and twisted it cruelly.
  Bristlebane cried out in pain! Zanatar wasted no time, and grabbing the heart
  he threw it quickly to the cage in the middle of the floor. Bruni caught the
  heart, and quickly handed it over to Brell. Bristlebane could easily get t!
  he heart back from a mortal, but not from another god. Bruni silently prayed
  Brell would not succumb as Bristlebane did. Brell smiled warmly at his
  favorite cleric, and winked, &quot;Na me boy... I'll be just fine. Knowing
  what it is and what it can do allows me to control it, rather than it
  controlling me&quot;. <BR><BR>Bristlebane swept his arm back, and caught the unfortunate thief along the
  side of his head. Zanatar careened off a wall, and collapsed to the floor.
  His head lay on the floor a little too flat for it to look natural. Blood
  began to flow from his mouth and ear, and he died seconds later. Bristlebane
  now noticed for the first time Zanatar. His hand instinctively grabbed for
  the heart, but it was not to be found. Something in his head... Zanatar.
  Zanatar? Why did that body on the ground look so familiar? He reached for the
  heart again, puzzled. Bristlebane felt his head spinning. Brell took
  advantage of the moment, and grabbing the cage carelessly tossed it across
  the room. &quot;Looking for this, Bristlebane,&quot; he asked, holding up the
  heart. &quot;Wha...wha....&quot; Bristlebane murmured as he fell to the
  ground, unconscious. <BR><BR>Bruni jumped up and ran to Valtyrra. &quot;Me lass, that be a fine display ye
  put on there. Are ye ok?&quot; Valtyrra looked up at the dwarf gratefully.
  &quot;You forgive me?&quot; she asked. &quot;Aye, me lady. After Sara showed
  us what ye were up to. How could I not? T'was a mighty brave thing ye did
  lass.&quot; He gently kissed her on her forehead. &quot;I knew ye could do
  it.&quot; Bruni cast a quick healing spell on Valtyrra, and then went to the
  stain on the floor that used to be Ahrvid. He scraped together what he could,
  and summoned the power of his water sprinkler to bring him back to this
  realm. Next on his list was Zanatar. Soon, everyone was up and about,
  although a few felt ill from the resurrection effects. <BR><BR>&quot;What happened to Bristlebane?&quot; asked Sara as she went to stand
  over by Borq. &quot;I imagine the sudden loss of power overwhelmed him for a
  second. He should be getting back up soon,&quot; said Brell. Sure enough, as
  soon as the words were out of his mouth, Bristlebane's eyes fluttered and he
  awoke. As he slowly got to his feet, he looked around his castle, clearly
  confused. &quot;What happened to my castle? Has someone finally played a
  trick on the master of tricks?&quot; he asked. Brell took his friend aside,
  and began explaining. A while later the two came out from conference. <BR><BR>Valtyrra looked at them and said &quot;You know, this is only half finished.
  Brell, you cannot keep Innoruuk's heart. We have to get it back to him.&quot;
  &quot;Aye my pretty lass, we do. And something needs to be done about Tunare
  as well. She should know better. But, that is a job best left to the gods to
  decide. You have done more than we could ever repay.&quot; announced Brell.
  Brell withdrew an odd horn from his robes, and blew a mighty note. It rang
  down the halls and out of the castle. They could hear it echoing thru the
  forest, and off into space. Soon, other horns responded, and feet could be
  heard coming down the halls. Solusek Ro was the first of the gods to arrive,
  then Xegony, then the gifted child god, Quellious. Soon the entire chamber
  was filled with the gods and goddesses, all talking and wondering at once. <BR><BR>When it appeared all had arrived, Brell announced, &quot;Ladies and
  Gentlemen. Thank you all for coming. This day we have some grave decisions to
  make. One of us has dabbled where they do not belong. This caused an almost
  irreparable rift in power, one that we are lucky to have withstood. Look well
  upon these adventurers, for without them, all might have been lost.&quot; The
  meeting continued for a while, as Brell made clear his accusation against
  Tunare. Her face blanched as she came to realize what could have happened.
  The gods, in their usual godly ways, quarreled and argued about how to best
  rectify the situation. As the discussion became more heated, Bristlebane came
  over to the weary band, and ushered them out of the room. &quot;It's not
  fitting for mortal to see how, well, mortal the gods can become. Go forth,
  and leave the rest to us.&quot; He gave each of them a locket. &quot;Wear
  this, and keep it with you always. If you are ever in trouble, this will
  summon a god to come to ! your aid. With the exception of The Nameless, all
  gods will answer your call. This can be used once, and only once, for each
  god. Use it wisely, and go in peace.&quot; The group took their lockets and
  headed back to their own realms. <BR><BR>Later on, it was observed that Tunare's plane was lacking her guardians.
  Mortals from all over came to reap the rewards from her home with fearing the
  guardians who so fiercely watched over it. It was a long time before the
  guardians were finally back again, and by then interest in the Plane of
  Growth had waned. <BR><BR>The group stayed in contact with each other through the years. Ahrvid and
  Seether became good friends. Strangely enough, Sara and Borq announced their
  engagement soon afterwards. &quot;Well,&quot; answer Sara when questioned,
  &quot;He's big enough to be a barbarian, he's loyal as a puppy, and best of
  all, he's *MY* warrior!&quot; Tales of their exploits soon became legend.
  Bruni and Valtyrra seemed to go their separate ways, but there are stories of
  a mighty dwarven cleric and a gorgeous dark elf necromancer venturing deep
  into dark and dangerous dungeons and bringing forth fantastic wealth from
  their depths. Zanatar soon became a favorite of Bristlebane's, and continued
  his roguish ways. He and Kai-Chen also did some exploring and retired very
  wealthy men.</P>
