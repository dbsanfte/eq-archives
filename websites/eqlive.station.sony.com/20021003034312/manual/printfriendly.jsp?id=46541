			Eating and Drinking
		</h2>
	
	Bread, milk and water are staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items, along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with 20 skins of milk and 20 loaves of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time). <BR><BR>When you're running low on either item, your text display shows "You are low on food" or "You are low on drink". If you don't find food or drink soon you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health and stamina suffer. <BR><BR>Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and other items (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=buying">Buying/Selling Items</A>). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement skills and agility. Such items must be manually consumed. <BR><BR><I>To eat/drink an item:</I> <BR><BR>* View your inventory (<B><I>i</I></B>).<BR>* Right-click on the item you wish to consume.<BR><BR>Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used as needed. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it. <BR><BR>
