<h2>Patch, June 5, 2002</h2>
<P><BR>** Acrylia Caverns **</P>
<P>- The Chieftain has gone on a vacation.&nbsp; We're retuning this encounter, and beg your indulgence while we work on it.</P>
<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
<P>- Fixed magician summoned focus earrings<BR>- Characters on horses are no longer immune to Ignite Bones<BR>- The Shadowbond series of spells can no longer be dispelled by the Necromancer<BR>- Nature's melody and Song of the Deep Seas should now stack with Dance of the Blades</P>
<P><BR>** Items **</P>
<P>- Added 'focus' effects to over 150 existing items<BR>- Mischievous Chainmail armor is now Dwarf wearable (for those lil Bristlbane worshipin' dorf rogues)<BR>- Changed several of the new cultural chain skirts from Leg slot to Waist slot<BR>- Keys for Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, Vex Thal are now no-drop on the Firiona Vie server<BR>- The key to the Plane of Air should now disappear when the character leaves the plane<BR>- Fixed Sifaye, Owlbear Feather, Grimling fang and Rockhopper talon darts to use the Throwing skill rather than the Archery skill<BR>- Added a 4 second casting time to Golem Metal Wand <BR>- Added a 3 second casting time on Egg Shaped Pumice <BR>- Added a 4 second casting time to Oil of Fennin Ro<BR>- The effect from Hammer of the Sun (Dawncall) now has a longer range<BR>- Fixed it so you can't fire fishing grubs with a bow (we know this had a lot of you worried...)<BR>- Smithed Acrylia Chain and Plate armors are now magical</P>
<P><BR>** NPCs **</P>
<P>- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now.&nbsp; They will choose their spells a little more carefully.</P>
<P><BR>** Quests **</P>
<P>- Arbogast and Miller should be responding properly now<BR>- Sir Lucan's skeleton should be available again<BR>- Fixed spawns in the Grey for Beastlord Epic<BR>- The Neriak Initiate Breastplate recipe should now work<BR>- Freeport Monk Guild Master Klom Jyson should be responding now<BR>- Made several adjustments that should fix issues with the 10th ring war</P>
<P><BR>** Tradeskills **</P>

<P><BR>** Pet Changes **</P>
<P>With this patch we've made some rather sweeping changes to the way pets work.</P>
<P>- Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures.&nbsp; Pets basically treat mesmerized NPCs as if they were dead<BR>- Pets are neutral to NPCs.&nbsp; Monsters will not attack pets first unless the pet is being aggressive to something<BR>- Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage to that creature<BR>- Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage to that creature<BR>- The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do.&nbsp; In most situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take experience.&nbsp; Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does damage to the target.&nbsp; As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. </P>
<P>- Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command<BR>- /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs<BR>- Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic pets.</P>
<P><BR>** Miscellaneous **</P>
<P>- Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with "damage shields: OFF" to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on<BR>- Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse if they went out of range<BR>- Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even with See Invisible</P>
