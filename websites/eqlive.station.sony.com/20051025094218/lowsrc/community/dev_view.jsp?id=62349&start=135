<h1>Proposed Changes</h1>
	<P>Hey folks,</P>  <P>I wanted to give you all an update on what we are planning for the coming
  weeks as we work on some persistent in-game issues.&nbsp; We know that many
  of you are concerned with the current state of the game and we feel confident
  that the changes we have planned will help to alleviate many of your
  concerns.&nbsp;</P>  <P>First on our plate, and number one on your list of concerns, is collision
  in EverQuest.&nbsp; We are working hard to fix the current problems with
  collision and have many fixes currently on Test.&nbsp; We will most likely be
  pushing these collision fixes to the Live servers tomorrow, June&nbsp;2nd at 3AM PDT.&nbsp; Many of the current issues
  appear to be resolved with this latest push and our programmers are still
  working hard to track down and fix any remaining issues.&nbsp; For those of
  you on Test, thanks very much for your help in getting these issues to
  Grumbuk.</P>  <P>We are also scheduling out many other fixes, with the first round going to
  the Test server this week, and subsequent rounds as the changes are
  made.&nbsp; Currently planned to hit Test this week are the following
  proposed changes;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>- Add a quest to allow the exchange of Gates of Discord spells.<BR>- Correct an issue with the berserker epic quest that left some berserkers unable
  to complete the quest.<BR>- Improve the Eagle Eye spell series.<BR>- Increase the spawn rate of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<BR>- Change berserker snare to have a set duration.<BR>- Correct the pathing in Txevu.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Please remember that this is only the first round of planned changes and
  there are many more to come.&nbsp; As more changes are rolled out to the Test
  server, I will post them.&nbsp; Please feel free to discuss these changes on
  the EQ forums at <A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/">eqforums.station.sony.com</A>.</P>  <P>Thanks for all of your feedback this past week.&nbsp; You have shown, once
  again, what a strong community EQ has, thank you for being an active part of
  it!</P>  <P>Brenlo</P>
