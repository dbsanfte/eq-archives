<h1>The New Buff Box</h1>
	The new buff box is indeed on the Test server right now. Obviously it's still being fiddled with, and the final data on this isn't set yet. But let me tell you what is planned (and encourage those of you who play on Test to make sure to get your suggestions and comments in to us so we can make adjustments as needed). <BR><BR>- The new buff slots do indeed increase the total effects that a person can have. 15 standard buffs and the 6 short-duration buffs. So it will be possible to have 21 buffs up at once. <BR><BR>- Any buff in the new buff box is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone. Because of this, we are not planning to put too many things into this buff box, mostly just 3 tick bard songs. Right now that does include the bard DA song (though not other Divine Aura-type spells), though we'll see how that works out on Test. <BR><BR>- Only beneficial songs qualify for the new buff box -- If a DoT is on you, you won't be able to clear it by zoning. :) <BR><BR>- If you have all six new buff slots full, the seventh song to hit you will reroute to the main effect slots. If one of the new buff box slots free up, this seventh song (that now lives in the main box) will still be refreshed in the main box. The seventh effect will not automatically "pop" into the temporary effect box. <BR><BR>- From the point of view of Cancel Magic effects, these new buff slots are effectively buff slots #16-21. <BR><BR>- This feature will be going to everyone. While there may well be features in the future that will be part of a given expansion as the Raid window was, we have every intention of also continuing a healthy schedule of live enhancements. The new buff box and windowed mode will be there for everyone to enjoy, and part of a person's normal subscription. <BR><BR>"Poxan the Gnomish Padawan Coder did a really good job on the implementation for this one. No obvious brokenness detected in the first run. No bards were harmed in the making of this window." <BR><BR>I stole that last part (and most of the information above) from something Scott Hartsman posted. I couldn't resist leaving that last bit exactly how he wrote it. :) <BR><BR>Oh, and we're still working on an official name for the new buff box. I'll let you know when we come up with one. <BR><BR>Alan
