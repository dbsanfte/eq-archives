		<h2>
			19.5
			Guild Wars
		</h2>
	
	Conflict may arise between
  guilds from time to time. When this occurs, guild leaders may decide to
  declare war between their guilds. If both leaders agree, they can open
  hostilities by using the <STRONG>/guildwar</STRONG> command. <BR><BR>Guild wars may vary in duration from the default of 1 day to a maximum of 14
  days. During this period of time members from either guild may cause harm to
  each other regardless of their adherence to the tenants of Order or Discord. <BR><BR>If the forces in conflict decide that peace would be a better option before
  the war has run its course an early end to the war may be declared. In order
  to accomplish this, both guild layers must issue the <STRONG>/guildpeace</STRONG>  command.
