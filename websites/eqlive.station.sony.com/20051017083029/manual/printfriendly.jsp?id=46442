			Arriving in Norrath
		</h2>
	
	You begin the game in your
  starting city with these items (press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to view them): <BR><BR>* 20 Bread cakes and 20 skins of milk<BR>* Spells (for some classes)<BR>* Standard weapon (dagger, sword, or club)<BR>* Scroll with instructions (a tattered note: right click on the scroll to
  read it)<BR>Next, read the scroll (right-click on it) and follow the instructions.
  Usually it will ask you to give your message scroll to your Guild Master. He
  or she will then give you a basic item of clothing and more information about
  what to do next. <BR><BR>To equip the new item: <BR><BR>* Press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to open your inventory<BR>* Click on the clothing item to pick it up<BR>* Click on the central area of the inventory screen in order to wear it <BR><BR>The central area of your inventory screen is an auto-equip area. Dropping an
  item into the auto equip area will equip the item, provided there is nothing
  in the slot the item goes in and your class, race, and deity can wear or use
  it. If the item cannot be worn it will automatically go to one of the main
  inventory slots. If those are full, the item will go into the first
  container, starting in the upper left most portion of your inventory. If all
  main inventory slots and containers are full, the item will drop to the
  ground. Be aware that some merchants and NPCs are greedy and might pick up
  items they see lying on the ground. This also can be said about other players
  as well.
