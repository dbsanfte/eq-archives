			Appendix D - Rogue Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<EM>Acrobatics</EM>: (3 skill
  levels) - This ability reduces the amount of damage that the Bard takes from
  falling. Each skill level increases the damage reduction. <BR><BR><EM>Adv. Trap Negotiation</EM>: (3 skill levels) - This ability reduces the
  Refresh Timer for the Bard's Sense Traps and Disarm Traps skills, making
  those skills available sooner after use. Each successive skill level further
  reduces the time needed between uses of these skills. <BR><BR><EM>Ambidexterity</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
  makes the Rogue more skilled with the use of two weapons by increasing his
  chance to successfully dual wield. <BR><BR><EM>Chaotic Stab</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability
  allows the Rogue to do his minimum backstab damage on any backstab attempt,
  even if that attempt is not made while behind the opponent. <BR><BR><EM>Double Riposte</EM>: (3 skill levels) - This ability gives the Rogue a
  chance for a double riposte any time he successfully ripostes. The first
  skill level gives the Rogue a 15% chance for a Double Riposte, the second
  skill level raises that chance to 30% and the third skill level makes the
  chance 50%. <BR><BR><EM>Escape</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability allows
  the Rogue to completely hide from an opponent, even one that is actively
  seeking him. When using Escape, the Rogue will be removed from all 'hate
  lists'. If the Rogue is also out of immediate combat he will become invisible
  in a way similar to his Hide skill. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72
  minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Poison Mastery</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chance
  of failure when using the apply and make skills. The first skill level
  removes all chances of failure when applying poison and reduces the failure
  chance for making poison by 10%, the second skill level raises the reduction
  to 25% and the third skill level raises the reduction to 50%. This ability
  also reduces the time needed to apply poisons by 50%. <BR><BR><EM>Purge Poison</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Rogue the power to remove all poison affects from himself. The
  Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time).
