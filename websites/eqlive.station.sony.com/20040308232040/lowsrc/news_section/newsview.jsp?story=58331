	<P><STRONG>avancouvering:</STRONG> Welcome to the chat.</P>
<P>Thank you for coming.&nbsp; We'll be taking questions about the new expansion, Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&nbsp; The new expansion features instanced dungeons, interactive objects, the ability to choose your reward at the Wayfarer merchants, item augmentations and of course 48 new zones and some awesome new NPCs.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>So ask us anything you'd like about the expansion.&nbsp; If we don't have time to answer them all here, we'll be recording the chat and we'll try to answer some of the questions we don't have time for today with an update to the web site.</P>
<P>Please send your questions to avancouvering.&nbsp; Use /msg avancouvering text.</P>
<P>Let's start with quick introductions from the EQLive team members and then we'll dive into the questions.</P>
<P><STRONG>OSmith:</STRONG> Hello all. I'm Oliver Smith, the Lead Designer of EverQuest Live/Legends.</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker:</STRONG> Hey there, I'm Ryan Barker one of the designers on the EverQuest team.</P>
<P><STRONG>slord:</STRONG> Hello, I'm Shawn Lord, Lead Designer of EverQuest Expansions.</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters:</STRONG> Hi, thanks for coming to the chat!&nbsp; I'm Rich Waters, Design Director for EverQuest.</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico:</STRONG> Hello, I am Paul Carrico, Assistant Lead Designer of EverQuest Expansions.</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman:</STRONG> Hi there.&nbsp; Thanks for stoppin' by.&nbsp; Scott Hartsman, Technical Director of EverQuest. :)</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy:</STRONG> Hey, thanks for coming.&nbsp; I'm John Troy, game designer for EverQuest.</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering:</STRONG> Hey, I'm Alan VanCouvering - Community Relation Manager.</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> (This is where we all watch Alan get spammed clear offline... Sorry for the pauses. :)</P>
<P><BR><U>Nilaman</U> Will Call of the Hero be useable in the instanced dungeons?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> Yes it will.&nbsp; There aren't any limitations planned for Call of the Hero in LDoN zones.</P>
<P><BR><U>waldina</U>&nbsp; Does augmenting an item make the item no-drop, if not how will I know in the bazaar?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> If an augmentation is no-drop, then combining it with an item will make the result no-drop.&nbsp; If you remove the augmentation, you can trade the original item once again.</P>
<P><BR><U>Sadista</U> Will the release of LDoN you will also be introducing new skeleton models for necromancer pets; is there an update for the spectre model also planned for the release or later?</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> We're excited about the new skeleton model - it came out really nicely and the animations for it are excellent.&nbsp; We've been talking about other pet models with the art staff, and we'd like to revamp the remaining pets also. </P>
<P><BR><U>TunareSK</U>&nbsp; As someone who used to raid a lot, but now that I no longer have the time to commit to large long raids, I am looking forward to LDoN.&nbsp; Will the rewards offered by the Wayfarer's be on par with some existing raid level rewards?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> They will, especially when you add the better augmentations.&nbsp; It still won't be as good as, say, Plane of Time loot, though.</P>
<P><BR><U>Merrygrin</U> What is the smallest size a raid can be?</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> Raids can be initiated with a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 36 people.</P>
<P><BR><U>Tolian</U>&nbsp; How would you guys compare the raid level content in Lost Dungeons, to The Planes of Power. I understand that this expansion is focused more on dungeon crawls, but what can hardcore raiders expect to find in the new expansion?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord </STRONG>Tolian - We've worked to provide raids that cater to players of a variety of raid power levels.&nbsp; Some raids are aimed at VT quality guilds, while others are tuned for players of elemental and even Time capability.<BR><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Tolian - Since we have a little more of a pause here, I'll continue on yours - The raids were primarily aimed at the highest end of the spectrum, since those players are most in need of additional content.</P>
<P><BR><U>Frodlin</U> is there any way to "unaugment" an item"?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> Yes, but the augmentation is lost.&nbsp; You can't reuse it.&nbsp; The base item can then accept a different augmentation.</P>
<P><BR><U>Elerion</U> Also, are the rumours true, that charm has been disabled in all of these dungeons? If so, could you explain why? Seeing as you have to be 4 people to get in, and the new charm aggro doesn't let charm pet tank for the whole group, what is the reasoning by removing such an integral part of the enchanter's arsenal?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> No the rumors are not true.&nbsp; There are plenty of opportunities to use charm in LDoN zones.</P>
<P><BR><U>Namiko</U>&nbsp; Hi. Epic hold great sentimental value to all players, will they have more/special slot for augmentation, or even special ( quested ? ) special augmentation&nbsp; - sorry for my english.</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> No, they won't be any more augmentable than other existing items.&nbsp; While some people hold sentimental value for them, others never considered it worth to get them and we don't want people to feel pressured to go back and do Kunark content by making the epics any better.</P>
<P><STRONG>OSmith</STRONG> Also, the magician and warrior epics are also being modified slightly. Further information will be available in the update message on Tuesday morning.</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> (modified in a manner to allow them to hold augmentations -- we're not suddenly going back and making anyone's epics better, or anything :)</P>
<P><BR><U>Tuukoh</U> will the lost dungeons be located on Antonica/Odus/Faydwer only... or will there be locations on Velious and/or Kunark?</P>
<P><STRONG>OSmith</STRONG> Lost Dungeons of Norrath does not need any other expansion in order to play it. All it requires is the original copy of EverQuest. So you'll be able to access the dungeons/adventures from the original continents.</P>
<P><BR><U>Arkaven</U> Does '48 dungeons' mean 8 instances of the 6 base zones so a max of 48 groups can be in at any one time?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> Fortunately, no.&nbsp;&nbsp; 48 dungeons means that there are 48 distinct, brand new zones to play in, no matter what level you are. <BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> Each one of those can be instanced thousands and thousands of times.<BR>hartsman At the moment, we're planning for 11,000+ instances to be running at any given time :)<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> This isn't old-style pseudo-instancing that we've done in the past - This type of thing has never been in EQ before, and we look forward to seeing it happen for real next Tuesday.</P>
<P><BR><U>Swatch_zeb</U>&nbsp; Also, are there plans for a retail release for those of us who cannot purchase the expansion online?</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> Yes.&nbsp; Purchasing the retail box also gets you a keychain and an in-game item called the Satchel of Abu-Kar.</P>
<P><BR><U>ludwik</U> about the new LDoN necro skeleton pet model, will this model only work for necro pets? or will it also be applied to necro lich spells and enchanter illusions?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> All illusion spells have been swapped over to the new skeleton model.&nbsp; We're also planning on moving all of the remaining NPCs that use the Luclin skeleton model to the new skeleton some time in the near future.<BR><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> In addition there are several new color mats that will be used on specific types of skeletons, so an ice bone will have a blue color for example.</P>
<P><BR><U>Enit</U> If I bash an object will there be a chance that I will lose the item inside?</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> The more that you interact with objects raises your chance of having a failure to open it.&nbsp; If you fail enough times, the object and the items inside of it will be destroyed.</P>
<P><BR><U>Aebriol</U> with instancing working well, you focus people against the game, instead of each other. Is this a goal for the future of EQ, especially considering high end raiding, that people will compete exclusively against the game and not each other? For future expansions I mean.</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> It's generally hard to say anything's absolute in a game this size, but we are interested in focusing players on their own achievements instead of on too much competition between players or guilds.<BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> Competition is an important aspect of any game or community, so we definitely don't want to eliminate ways for players to compete and excel.&nbsp; However, we do want to get away from achievement by denying other guilds content.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> We've included some ways in LDoN for players to compare their achievement with others, and we'd like to expand on healthy methods of competition in the future.</P>
<P><BR><U>Hibby</U> If I understand it correctly, finishing a task from the Wayfarer earns points, then we "buy" the rewards.&nbsp; Would we end up, saving these points and accumulating them for purchases later?</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> You can save up points to buy higher cost items, you don't have to spend them at the time they are rewarded.</P>
<P><BR><U>Muven</U>&nbsp; follow-up to Namiko: Will any existing items become augmentable?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Muven - Only items with the word Azaliil in the name.<BR><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Correction - Many existing items will be augmentable.</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> All existing worn items will be augmentable in some way.&nbsp; However, some augmentations are only useable on items you find in LDoN.<BR><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> Most, I should say.&nbsp; Very few items are excluded.</P>
<P><BR><U>meddyk</U>&nbsp; I have been Playing this game since beta, I have 2 copies bought every expansion (husband/wife) and even started a 3rd acct Now Im paying for content I cant even accsees In PoP paying for service im not recieving for limitaion of flags guilds ect. How is the new expansion going to be any diff Am I still going to be paying for content i cant even get ?.</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> I wouldn't say that anyone's paid for an entire expansion that they can't use -- that's really not a fair assessment, but we can understand the frustration that some folks feel when there's content that's simply way too high level for them ... cont<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> In LDoN specifically, the content folks have gone out of our way to ensure that more zones of this expansion will be able to used by more people over more level ranges. cont<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> It may seem a little trite, given how often we've been repeating it, but it really is true: "If you're level 20, you get 48 new zones to play in.&nbsp; If you're level 65, you get 48 new zones to play in."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This expansion is all about giving the most game to the most people, and we think you won't be disappointed.</P>
<P><BR><U>Sionistic</U>&nbsp; Are those 11,000 instances game or server wide?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> That would be game-wide.&nbsp; The initial goal, using numbers that we've gotten from beta testing usage (where adventure zone usage is extremely high), lead us to believe that at any given time, we need to be ready for about half of the simultaneous population to be inside these things all at once.&nbsp; cont<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> The great thing about this is that adding more capacity is extremely simple -- In the worst case, in theory, if we filled up, we could even hook our own desktop machines up and start serving adventures from those.&nbsp; ;)</P>
<P><BR><U>xshawnx</U>&nbsp; will spells be rewarded through completing dungeons or purchased?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> All of the LDoN spells will be available via the adventure rewards system.&nbsp; So you'll have to earn adventure points to purchase the new spells.</P>
<P><BR><U>Etrigan</U> If a group member goes linkdead after entering a dungeon, does the dungeon adapt, or will the remaining members have a more difficult time proceeding?</P>
<P><STRONG>OSmith</STRONG> If a member of your group accidentally goes linkdead they'll be able to come back in if the adventure is still going on. If they happen to come back in after the adventure has completed they'll come back near the entrance to the adventure.</P>
<P><BR><U>Elerion</U> I'll take Shawn up on that word. Blame him ;) I hear PvP players complaining about&nbsp; the possibility of exploits with this system, where groups can attack others at the wayfarer camps (or near dungeon entrances), then zone into their own little dimension to med up for the next grief gank. Do you have any plans to prevent this?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Elerion - The scenario you just described is less likely than what's currently possible with the Plane of Knowledge, Plane of Tranquility, and other non-PvP zones.<BR><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Elerion - they still have to go to the camp, acquire the zone, make it to the zone, and then begin the behavior.&nbsp; That said, if we find that problems arise, we can address them as they pop up.</P>
<P><BR><U>Lorkast</U> Will tradeskills be improved further in LDoN and if so how? Is there any tradeskill that you focused on more than others (if at all)?</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> Additional tradeskill recipes were added for LDoN.&nbsp; Smithing and fletching were looked at especially.&nbsp; Many new recipes were added to fill in some skill level gaps (mostly 175 to 215).&nbsp; Baking, Jewel Craft, and Brewing have also had new recipes added.</P>
<P><BR><U>Elerion</U> Will the augmentation combines be nofail? If not, which part will be lost on a fail? Both, or just the augmentation? And also, which skill would it reference to tell your success rate?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy </STRONG>They are no-fail.&nbsp; You don't need any skill to use them.</P>
<P><BR><U>Henryik</U> Is it required to have 6 members in a group in order to start the dungeon? if not, can late comers join after the dungeon has started?</P>
<P><STRONG>OSmith </STRONG>An adventure requires at least 4 members (in a group) to begin an instance. If you aren't a part of the group during the initialization you will not be able to take part in that particular adventure. In other words... Latecomers will not be able to join your adventure.</P>
<P><BR><U>Fred</U> It's rumored that one of the Wayfarer's camps are in the tundra of EverFrost. How will evil players without invis be able to get past the barbarian guards to access the content?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> "Very, very quickly."</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> There is a new transit system in place.&nbsp; If you take the time to learn all about the Wayfarer Brotherhood, they will accept you into their ranks.&nbsp; They will then translocate you to any of the other camps through a dialogue.&nbsp; This will remove the constant risk to evil players.</P>
<P><BR><U>GabstarSH</U>&nbsp; You seem to have individual statistics for the LDON adventure points, but will you have guild totals?</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> We won't have any features to track guild adventure achievement in when LDoN is released, but that sounds like an excellent idea and I'd love to get the feature added in the future.<BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> Thanks for the good idea.</P>
<P><BR><U>Dreamthief</U> will you able to add effects to armor and weapons or just stat increases?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy</STRONG> Augmentations can add worn effects, procs, focus effects, skill mods... almost anything you can find on other items.</P>
<P><BR><U>JustMe</U> why the 4 limit, why not less than that?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> Good question.<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> This is our first run at doing zone instancing in EQ.&nbsp; Some day, it'd be great if we made the whole system efficient enough to run a zone for every person online (cont)<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> ...but for this first version of it, it's just not possible for us to host that many zones without having to buy entirely too much hardware. (cont)<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> We ended up having this happy medium of 4-6 person groups, but the LFG window is seeing all kinds of use, now that people who traditionally like to solo are finding out how easy it is to get into a group, play for an hour in a group, then bail right on time.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> Thanks for all of your great questions!&nbsp; We only have time for a few more, but remember, we'll be looking over the logs and we'll try to answer at least some of the questions that we don't have time for today on the web site later.</P>
<P><BR><U>Xzarkon</U> How was it decided that "buying" your reward was better than finding the items? This reminds me of MUDs in the old days where you get Quest Points, and put those towards new items and equipment. Is there a gameplay factor here, or was this assumed to be the best course for acquiring gear?</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> Acquiring items through adventure points is something we wanted to try with this expansion, but doesn't necessarily mean that's how all future content will be.&nbsp; <BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> We wanted to add a system where every time a player goes on an adventure, they accumulate a bit more credit towards getting an item they'd like.&nbsp; <BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> As an alternative to the current system, where rewards are randomly dropped off specific NPCs, this system makes sure everyone that participates eventually gets something out of it that they'd like to have.<BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> There will also be items dropped in LDoN though, in addition to items you acquire through adventure points.</P>
<P><BR><U>Hibby</U> How does evac/succor/port work while the group is in the dungeon?&nbsp; If an encounter goes bad, can a group "port out" and re-enter the instance?</P>
<P><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> You can port out of the dungeon and still zone back into the dungeon while you adventure time is still active.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> Sorry this is the last question...</P>
<P><BR><U>cardcolletor</U> how many spells on average will each class have added with LDon?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> Each of the hybrids is getting 5 spells, while priests and casters will be getting 8 spells a piece.&nbsp; All of the spells will be available via the adventure merchant system.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> That's all the time we have.&nbsp; We should have a transcript posted on the site tomorrow.&nbsp; Thank you all for stopping in!</P>
