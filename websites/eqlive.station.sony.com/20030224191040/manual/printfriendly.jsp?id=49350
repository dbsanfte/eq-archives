	The Spells Window is located in the middle of the left side of the screen. If your character is of a class that can never cast spells you will not see this window (nor will you be able to open it using the Window Selector). This window holds your eight spell gems (your memorized spells) and a small spell book icon. Clicking the spell book icon will open your spell book. <BR><BR><B>Spell Book</B> <BR><BR>One of a spell caster's main pursuits is the acquisition of spells. In order to put a spell into the spell book, a caster needs to have the appropriate spell scroll. Once you have a spell scroll it is relatively simple to scribe the spell into your spell book. <BR><BR><I>Scribing a Spell</I> <BR><BR>* Open up your spell book and your inventory<BR>* Turn the spell book to the page where you want to place the spell (each of the boxes in the spell book is a spot for scribing a spell - called a spell slot)<BR>* Locate the spell scroll in your inventory and pick it up (left-click)<BR>* Point the mouse at the empty spell slot in your spell book and left-click<BR>* The timer gauge in the spell book indicates the amount of time left until your completed scribing the scroll. Most actions at this point will interrupt the scribing process, so it's best to wait for the gauge to empty.<BR>* A spell icon will appear in the spell book, with the name of the spell under it. <BR><BR><I>Moving Spells within the Spell Book</I> <BR><BR>* Locate the spell icon you want to move.<BR>* Right-click on the spell icon.<BR>* Find the spell slot that you want to place the spell icon in (you can click on the left and right arrows to flip pages of the spell book without concern).<BR>* Right-click on the spell slot that you want to move the spell icon to. The icon should appear in the new slot. <BR><BR><I>Note: You can't delete spells from your spell book.</I> <BR><BR><B>Memorizing Spells</B> <BR><BR>Scribing a spell into your spell book does not allow you to cast that spell. The spells in your book are like money in the bank. You can't spend them (cast them) unless you've got them in your pocket. Your character needs to memorize spells from the spell book in before he can cast them. A character can only memorize up to eight spells (one in each of the spell gems in the Spells Window), so at higher levels a character must choose spells wisely. <BR><BR><I>Memorizing a Spell</I> <BR><BR>* Open the spell book.<BR>* Choose the spell that you wish to memorize.<BR>* Left-click on the spell icon in the book. A spell icon should appear on your mouse pointer.<BR>* Aim your mouse pointer at one of the eight spell gems on the Spells Window.<BR>* Left-click on the appropriate spell gem.<BR>* The gauge in the spell book will fill and begin to empty. This is the timer for memorizing the spell. Most actions at this point will interrupt the memorization, so it is best to wait for the gauge to empty.<BR>* The spell icon should appear in the spells gem. It will appear grayed-out initially, and come to full color slowly. When a spell gem is grayed-out that spell can't be cast. <BR><BR><I>Forgetting a Spell</I> <BR><BR>In order to replace the spell on a spell gem, you must first forget that spell. Once the spell is forgotten another can be remembered in its place. <BR><BR>* Aim your mouse pointer at the spell gem in question.<BR>* Right-click on the spell gem. The spell icon will disappear. <BR><BR><B>Casting a Spell</B> <BR><BR>To cast a spell, simply left-click on one of the eight spell gems. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: Pointing at one of the spell gems will tell you the name of the spell.</I> <BR><BR><I>Note: You can right-click and hold (it is important to hold) on any spell icon (in your spell book or in your spell gems) to learn more about that spell.</I> <BR><BR><I>Also Note: Holding down the </I><B><I>Alt</I></B><I> key will display all of the Tool Tips for your Spells Window.</I> <BR><BR>
