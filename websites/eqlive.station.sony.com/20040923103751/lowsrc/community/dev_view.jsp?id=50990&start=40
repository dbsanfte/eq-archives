<h1>Luclin Update 4</h1>
	I wanted to pop in with another update to cover a few issues that I'm seeing posted around the net.<P>Some people ask why it is that our patch messages include a lot of content changes, and suggest that our time would be better spent fixing bugs than changing or adding content at this point.<P>It is important to understand that the people working on content are not the same people that work on programming.  We are not taking any of our resources away from fixing programming bugs to work on content.<P>I also wanted to reassure you that we are working with NVIDIA and ATI to resolve the issues that are affecting a few of our customers that are using those cards.  We dont have any firm news for you on this right now, but we are working on it.<P>Also note that I've reversed the order of the list.  The list of fixed items is getting long, and really it's the list of things we are still working on that seems the most urgent.  So I've moved the fixed issues to the bottom.<P>---<P>We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list. <P>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of. We will be keeping you updated as things change. Also, check the patch messages for more information. <P><I>Stuff in the works</I>, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <P>- Reducing loading and zoning times<BR>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<BR>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<BR>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<BR>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<BR>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<BR>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<BR>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<BR>- New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely <BR>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working properly<BR>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone<BR>- A few players are being disconnected at random<BR>- Slow framerate on some fast computers*<P>*Every bug has its story.  This one begins as an incompatibility between EverQuest, AMD processors and Umbra (a technology that, ironically, speeds up framerates).  There is a known problem in the Umbra engine that was causing the crashes that some AMD users were originally seeing in Shadowhaven.  In our desire to make sure that both Intel and AMD users could enter the game, we introduced another condition that unfortunately slowed down framerates in certain circumstances.  We have one person working on nothing but this at the moment and he's made significant progress.  We expect this problem to go away soon.<P><BR><I>Fixed</I> since release (in no particular order either): <P>- Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)<BR>- Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die<BR>- Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent<BR>- Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.<BR>- /follow bug that caused folks to crash<BR>- Transparency issues with i810 display adapters<BR>- Crash bug related to root and gate<BR>- Various item and content fixes<BR>- Crash problems in certain zones<BR>- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.<BR>- A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.<BR>- Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans<BR>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<BR>- Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor<BR>- A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing<BR>- A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game. <BR>- Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users<P><BR><I>Note:</I> The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability. It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer. <P><BR><I>Tech Tip</I><BR>- Pauses with <B>Win 98/ME ONLY</B>: A possible solution for those with a fair amount of RAM (technically, anyone with 128 megs or more...) who are seeing pauses while the hard drive runs a bit, might benefit from this simple change (it's also easy to undo). It might also improve load and zone times. <P>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 <P>For best results, change only this setting (don't change a bunch of other stuff at the same time) and see how it performs. And if it isn't better or seems worse you can just erase that line from your System.ini file. I should tell you that this change might make EverQuest better and it might also cost you some performance with your system overall, though this does not seem to be the case for most people. Keep that in mind if you decide to use this tip. <P><BR>Thank you all for your patience. We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible. <P>Alan<BR>
