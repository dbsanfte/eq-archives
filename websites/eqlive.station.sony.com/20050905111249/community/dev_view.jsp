<h1>Halfling Hodgepodge RiffRaff &#8211; Part 1</h1>
<P>Welcome to the first edition of Halfling Hodgepodge
  RiffRaff, THE place to get to know your fellow EQ Community members
  better!&nbsp; If you would like to
  participate watch the <A HREF="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq">EQLive
  Forums</A> for information about this feature every month.</P>  <P><STRONG>Earthchild</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> it was either late 2000 or early 2001.
  Hard to remember. I know I've been playing my enchanter since april of 2001.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Currently on a
  desktop computer but I've played eq on all kinds of computers.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Like above I've played on all types of
  connection but currently have a cable connection</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Wood
  elf/ranger. Ran into the forest was killed by an orc and couldn&#8217;t find
  my body so I deleted the character and made another. I think I was on my
  third character when someone finally told me about the /corpse and /loc
  commands.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game? </EM>No I used to play muds a lot even worked as
  a coder and builder on several.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> My 67 enchanter</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> As an enchanter? Never knew we had much
  choice. Enchanters are a pretty group dependent class so I almost always
  group. Every time I've tried to solo unless I'm going against green or lt
  blue mobs I die or have to run.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I love turning chaos into order, I live for those moments when the
  group makes a mistake and I have to step in. other than that I feel like a
  burden to a group.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> As of Sunday yes</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> Including
  mules 6</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> No</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Shaman, cleric, bard.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> The cost of my drogmor</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> All of the expansions have good qualities
  and bad qualities so to say one if my favorite wouldn&#8217;t be right.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Any zone that I can get a group in to get
  experience </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> I like most of the npc's involved in the
  enchanter 1.0 epic it was fun getting to and talking to them</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> GoD, I think it was the expansion that
  content progressed to a point where enchanters became a problem for designers</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> There is no individual zone I dislike as
  long as I can get a good group of people with me there. there are
  circumstances I dislike</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Any that is immune to both slow and mezz.
  With as little damage as my nukes do it make me feel insignificant</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> Not really my bank is full of tradeskill items and partially
  completed quests.</P>  <P><STRONG>Elemer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> My first character was born on Oct 99', he
  was a dark elf necromancer.&nbsp; I
  wandered around the forest scared to death for the first two days playing, I
  thought the world was huge....imagine my surprise when I encountered my first
  zone line....</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Both, though 98%
  of my /played time has been and always will be on a desktop.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> I started in 99' on dial-up.&nbsp; I still have it just in case.&nbsp; But for the last three years I've been
  on DSL.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> Darkelf
  necromancer... Blargh! Death Death Death, Fear me!</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Nope, and this dates me, my first 'online'
  game would have been Trade Wars 2002.&nbsp;
  My first internet online game was Total Annihilation.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> Level 66 on four characters now.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Grouping is always best.&nbsp; I play MMOG's after all because of the
  social interaction.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> Well, my &quot;main&quot; is my enchanter, he's parked and not
  leveling, I won't go into why.&nbsp;
  Right now I'm leveling up a shaman, whom I love because it's a widely
  loved class to group with, so getting a group is fun.&nbsp; The ability to take a hit, melee some,
  have a pet, both buff and debuff, heal, it's a great jack of all trades
  class.&nbsp; In many ways you could say
  a shaman is my new &quot;main&quot;, but in my heart I'll always be an
  enchanter.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Definitely.&nbsp; Guilds, be they small or large,
  raiding, casual, family or just a bunch of drunken friends on Saturday night,
  are the backbone of EQ I think.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> /blush well I
  used to have 24 on the Nameless, I'm down to 10 or 11 now, with the goal
  being to get down to 8 by the end of the year.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Originally yes.&nbsp; I my enchanter was an erudite
  enchanter of Quellious.&nbsp; The idea
  of an peace loving erudite from a role playing perspective really clicked
  with me.&nbsp; About 18 months into the
  game though, I deleted the original Elemer (level 38 at the time), and
  re-rolled him as an Agnostic.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately religious faction and role playing didn't mesh well with
  the game mechanics.&nbsp; Oddly no
  matter what illusion I took, the NPC's seemed to know what my religious
  tendencies were.&nbsp; Maybe I should
  have worn looser fitting pants?</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Um, none.&nbsp; I've at one point or another played
  every class to at least 30th level.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 18kpp in the Bazaar for a PoP robe
  pattern.</P>  <P><EM>What is your fa vorite expansion?</EM> Kunark was and still is my favorite
  expansion.&nbsp; It brought a real
  sense of &quot;new&quot; that none of the others have since.&nbsp; The continent as a whole was living
  and breathing.&nbsp; The need to travel
  to it by boat.&nbsp; The feeling of
  exploring a lost world.&nbsp; Rolling
  an Iksar and knowing the rest of the world hated me on site.&nbsp; The sense of challenge that
  brought.&nbsp; It took real time to
  just travel to Kunark.&nbsp; Once there,
  you really were in a strange and distant land.&nbsp; It was a great feeling.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> This may sound masochistic but I really
  loved Karnor's Castle.&nbsp; It was a
  great place to play with friends.&nbsp;
  The best thing about the zone was it really helped weed out those
  people that where thin skinned and the best of the players both in play skill
  and personality stood out there.&nbsp;
  Nothing like a little adversity to bring out the best in people.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> I'm sorry, I have to have some fun on this
  one.&nbsp; Fippy Darkpaw, hands
  down.&nbsp; I mean, can you think of
  any MoB that shows a better sense of optimism.&nbsp; I mean, he's failed like 8 quadjillion
  times to single handedly storm Qeynos.&nbsp;
  But does he give up?&nbsp;
  No!&nbsp; Wait 7 minutes and
  he'll be back again.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Gah, Gates of Discord without a
  question.&nbsp; That expansion more
  than any created dissent between the have and have-not crowd.&nbsp; It seemed like it created a huge rift
  between the player bases and made entry into the higher end guilds
  unattainable for a lot of people.&nbsp;
  More than any other I think GoD created a wall between play styles.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> I'd have to say the current implementation
  of The Grey.&nbsp; While I understand
  the reasons why the changes where made (traps, etc) due to a mechanic in the
  way AoE spells worked at the time, it resulted in making what would other
  wise be a fun and challenging group and solo exp zone into what is
  effectively a wasteland that no one wants to go to.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Hmm does the Jester count?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Okay, well in all seriousness I'd have
  to go with any and all enchanter NPC's in the LDoN expansion.&nbsp; One NPC locking down a full group and
  then sicking the group members onto each other is just crazy.&nbsp; You'd think that enchanter NPC's should
  face at least some of the drawn backs of PC enchanters, low hp, and low AC,
  and the ability to be interupted reliably by melee combat.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> Okay this is pure sentimentality; I'll deny it later I'm
  sure.&nbsp; I still have a slice of the
  Wedding Cake that was passed around at the in game wedding of Kuwen and
  Wylderness on the Nameless at Lake Rathetear.&nbsp; It was the last time I think that all
  of my old EQ friends where together and happy.&nbsp; It was a very cool moment in time and
  a singularly great moment of in game role playing.</P>  <P><STRONG>Ethyre</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> About four years ago.&nbsp; Several coworkers and I had been
  playing some network games and one of the Engineers started playing EQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; He got me to try and I was quickly
  hooked.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> I play on two
  laptops since I travel a lot on business.&nbsp; Modern laptops are surprisingly
  capable machines and I get very good quality game play, at high resolutions,
  while sitting on my deck having cold one :)</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> I play through a Wireless Access Point to
  a cable modem.&nbsp; When cable service
  is up, the connection and game play are excellent..</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> My first
  character was a Wood Elf Druid, named Fazool.&nbsp; This was my characters name for
  several years and throughout several games.</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> No, actually I played a text based Multi
  User Dungeon game at the University called &quot;Monster&quot;.&nbsp; In its time, it was an amazing game
  with upwards of a a hundred people playing at a time.&nbsp; We had &quot;guilds&quot; with wars
  and raids on other guilds.&nbsp; We
  even had cheaters and exploits so all the same culture existed even back then
  (fifteen years ago).</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> My Main character is a 68 Enchanter.&nbsp; My sig file says &quot;There is no
  high score&quot; because I don't really believe in grinding to 70 (or the
  limit du jour) just to be high level.&nbsp;
  I play a lot of character, do a lot questing, tradeskills, exploring
  and (recently) a lot of raiding so my leveling is probably lower than most
  people who put in as much time as I do.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> It really depends upon the situation.&nbsp; I two box mostly so I like that if I
  am camping a quest mob or farming, etc.&nbsp;
  When playing certain characters I really like contributing to a
  group.&nbsp; Being unable to play when
  you can't find or form a group is, however, terribly frustrating.&nbsp; In general I like grouping.&nbsp; I have a regularly scheduled
  (&quot;static&quot;) group of rl friends and we have several pre-made groups
  ready to go three times a week.&nbsp;
  In situations like that, where we don't waste time LFG or waiting, I
  love group play.&nbsp;&nbsp; LDoN's
  were great fun for pick up groups.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I am in the midst of a character identity crisis and probably
  changing main characters (only second time in four years).&nbsp; </P>  <P>Five levels ago, I
  would have said my Enchanter was amazing because of the way he could make
  order out of chaos and how he thrived on a hectic pull where everyone else
  panicked.&nbsp; Recent content makes
  this type or role not as important, so my enthusiasm for this character has
  waned somewhat.&nbsp; Now, I would say
  my Magician is my favorite character and I love using an awesome pet for
  clever group and raid help, like off tanking, pet pulling, etc.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> For a long time I was an officer in an
  outstanding guild on Xev called Lions of The Heart.&nbsp; This was a true family style guild
  and, at one time,&nbsp; we had 996
  characters enrolled in the guild.&nbsp;
  I have wanted to see some of the &quot;end game&quot; content in EQ
  and joined most of my EQ friends who moved over to a semi0raiding guild
  called In Via Damnum (now on Druzzil Ro).&nbsp; This is a great guild, with a great
  approach to non-mandatory raiding that enjoys really great participation in
  events.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> I only play
  on one server where I have nine characters (five very active) along with two
  mules across my two accounts.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> No, he is agnostic, which I greatly regret
  and wish I could quest for a change.&nbsp;
  I think a religious journey or quest would be great in the storyline
  of EQ, and allow characters to change deities.</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> I have never played a Warrior, Berzerker,
  Shaman, Ranger or Wizard.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> About 120,000 for one item.&nbsp; I also spent about 110,000 on a
  shopping spree in the bazaar, where I bought thank you gifts for my epic 1.5
  completion party.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Kunark by far.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Revamped Plane of Hate - great gothic
  design, excellent storyline, spooky immersive feeling and good quests.&nbsp; Kedge Keep and Plane of Mischief come
  in close second for being very non-traditional zones with completely
  immersive feel.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> There are too many to list.&nbsp; Some NPC monsters are really
  impressive, I love the actions and dialogue of some NPC quest
  characters.&nbsp; Some are just goofy
  fun.&nbsp; I think I was most
  awe-inspired when my druid first saw Tunare.</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> GoD - ugly zones, non-convincing mob
  graphics, convoluted storyline, unenjoyable solo/group play.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Any boring caves, such as the BB ldon
  caves.&nbsp; Lazy curving tubular
  design.&nbsp; When running through
  these, I know what a tapeworm feels like.</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Wuoshi - My two highest characters are
  non-KOS by now, but I can't tell you how many times I ported and died while
  zoning because he camped the druid rings.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM> <EM>If so what is it and why do
  you keep it?</EM> I do so much questing and item-camping that my bank accounts
  are chock full of such items.&nbsp; My
  most useless first item was &quot;essence of a graveyard knight&quot; form my
  first GM event on Halloween.&nbsp; I
  always kept it hoping it was for some undiscovered quest, but now its just
  for sentimental reasons.</P>  <P><STRONG>Fiach_AB</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> January 2003. It took me 5 minutes to
  become addicted, and 6 minutes to get killed when I targeted an NPC and tried
  to type H-A-I-L in full.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> A desktop. Need
  power. Desktop &gt; Laptop.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> DSL. Need speed. DSL &gt; Dial up.</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character</EM>? Barbarian
  Shaman, of course!</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> No, in the &#8216;80s I played the
  original text-only MUD created by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw (known as
  &#8220;British Legends&#8221; in the US, I think). The tag line was
  &#8220;You haven&#8217;t lived &#8216;til you&#8217;ve died in MUD&#8221;. I
  often played an entire weekend without sleep, and nearly lost my job over it.
  I&#8217;m married now, though.</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 53 *Puffs out his chest with pride*</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Unless I can get a LDON or a raid, I
  prefer to solo. Some of the time. When I&#8217;m not in a group. Or working
  on my epic. Or lonely.</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> The versatility. I can be a tank, a healer, a nuker, a buffer. I
  love being asked for SOW, it gives me something to complain about.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes, Everwatch &#8211; a role-playing
  guild on Antonius Bayle.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 7 &#8211; I
  keep the extra slot free &#8220;just in case&#8221;.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> Fiach is a follower of the Tribunal. I
  think &#8220;worship&#8221; is too strong a word in his case.</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> Bard, Beastlord, Berserker, Cleric, Druid,
  Enchanter, Monk, Rogue, Shadowknight. I&#8217;m having too much fun playing
  my others.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 10K, for a horse (of course)</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Velious. Love it to bits.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> Blackburrow! My first dungeon and still my
  favorite. Very few people there now, so sometimes I stand at the top of the
  pit and tickle the gnolls at the bottom with a slow, just to remind me what
  the trains were like.</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> It simply HAS to be Fippy Darkpaw! I have
  tried to get him past the Qeynos city gates a few times. No luck yet, but one
  day when the zone is empty and I can distract the guards&#8230;</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Gates of Discord. &#8216;Nuff said.</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM> Paludal Caverns. But I&#8217;ll keep going
  back there with every new toon, I guess..</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM> Vengeful Composer. He deserves to die. And
  he does. Every time I see him. Sometimes slowly, gotta love root-rot. *Frowns
  and looks fierce*</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but keep
  around for nostalgic reasons</EM>?
  <EM>If so what is it and why do you keep
  it?</EM> Testament of Vanear. I don&#8217;t need it any more, but it was my
  first &#8220;hard&#8221; quest, and it took me SOOO long. I remember the
  excitement and the corpse runs, and the thrill when I got it. How could I
  give it up?</P>  <P><STRONG>Froguelok_of_Drinal</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start playing EQ?</EM> October 2002 (as a PS2 EQOA Beta Tester)</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a laptop or desktop
  computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable</P>  <P><EM>What was the race and class of your very
  first character?</EM> EQOA
  &#8211; Dwarven rogue named Gwarric</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online game?</EM> Nope I had XBand modem for SNES and played
  a lot of Streetfighter II online</P>  <P><EM>What is your highest level in EQ?</EM> 53 beastlord Vah Shir</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to solo or group?</EM> Solo</P>  <P><EM>What do you like the most about the class
  you have chosen for your main character?</EM> I love the Bengal tiger pet of Vah Shir BST</P>  <P><EM>Is your main character in a guild?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>How many characters do you have on your
  main server?</EM> 8</P>  <P><EM>Does your main character worship a deity?</EM> No</P>  <P><EM>Which classes in EQ have you NOT played?</EM> None &#8211; I have characters on 5
  servers!</P>  <P><EM>What is the most platinum you have ever
  spent on purchasing a single item for one of your characters?</EM> 300PP</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite expansion?</EM> Lost Dungeons of Norrath </P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite zone?</EM> The Twilight Sea</P>  <P><EM>What is your favorite npc?</EM> King Raja Kerrath</P>  <P><EM>Which expansion do you like the least?</EM> Scars of Velious</P>  <P><EM>Which zone do you like the least?</EM>&nbsp;
  Cobalt Scar &#8211; hard to get to and died many times enroute</P>  <P><EM>Which npc do you like the least?</EM>&nbsp;
  Turepta &#8211; Pretty much anything on Taelosia</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item you no longer use but
  keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM>&nbsp; <EM>If so what is it and why do you keep it?</EM> Yeah even 52 BST kept
  newbie gear &#8211; Gulam armor &#8211; for corpse runs and now I have
  outgrown it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a
  souvenir of favorite hunts.</P>
