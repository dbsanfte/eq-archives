<h1>Timorous Deep</h1>
	<BR>Janix wrote:<P><B>Is it intended for players to be able to bind in the Timorous Deep once again?  It has been reported on various sites that a player can cast bind, then camp, and then when he logs back on the player will be bound there.</B><P>Yes and no.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>This was something we were looking at changing some time in the future.  As part of playing around with the idea, we initiated code on the Test server that allowed casters to bind in Timorous Deep again.  That was probably six weeks ago, just after we stopped patching code for such a long time.<P>When it came time to patch code again the change to Timorous Deep went live, in a rather untested and unintended fashion.  Thats why its not working perfectly, and thats why its working at all.  ;p<P>After pushing forward our examination of the idea of re-enabling binding in Timorous Deep, weve decided to allow it.  However, because the implementation wasnt planned to go in quite yet, we havent assigned the time to clear out the bugs.  Well hunt them down when we get the chance.<P>So my suggestion would be to hold off binding yourself there until we get a shot at testing the change and patching the bugs.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Hi Absor,<P>The solution for those casters that wish to bind in the Firepot room in Timorous Deep is to actually get to the room camp out then log back on. Then bind yourself and type /charinfo. You will notice that you get the "your bind didn't take" message but your bind will work.<P>Hope this helps!<P> Dornette<BR> 60 necromancer<BR> The Nameless</B><P>Thats what Ive been hearing.  If nothing else, folks should certainly check their /charinfo after binding there to make sure it took.  If not, you might try logging out and back in again and check the /charinfo again.<P>But Im still suggesting that you hold on until we can get it fixed, just in case.<P>Alan<BR>
