<h2>Of Trollish Love, Catapults, and an Adoring Fan</h2>
<P>Dear Mennix, </P>
<P>I am having secret feelings about a troll, let's just say I'll call him "Mr.X". I am a dark elf and should know better than to fall in love with a troll. But every time I see his big green nose and his floppy ears, I just can't resist it! He's also very kind and understanding, and he gave me a wonderful bracer that he said he'd found on an Iksar Bandit Lord. You know all girls just loves presents. </P>
<P>What do you think I should do? Should I tell him about my true feelings for him? Or, should I break the friendship off and avoid to ever see him again, and live my life without any true love? Yes, he seems to be the love of my life! Even though the answer to this question might be clear to your mind, my mind is clouded by the love of a big green troll and I just can't think clear. </P>
<P>Please tell me what to do. </P>
<P>-Zaerla </P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Zaerla, </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Straight and to the point. Yes, tell your troll love of your feelings. There are many things every person can regret, but losing out on possible love should never be one of them. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Do not hide your feelings. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>You are probably fearful that this troll will reject you and the fear of this rejection keeps you from uttering the words you want to utter. You know what? The possibility of rejection is always there. Yet, what hurts more? Being rejected once, or losing a life of love? I would think losing that love would hurt more. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I don't know why this fear has been instilled in so many of us, but it is something each of us can overcome. Always think of the greater payoff. In your case, the payoff is the love of you life.</STRONG> </P>

<P>Dear Mennix, </P>
<P>As a hard working Gnome inventor, I get commissioned to produce all kinds of unusual contraptions - and, not unfairly, I take a certain pride in my versatility. So now I find myself, honestly, quite ashamed to admit that my latest project has me flummoxed. </P>
<P>A party of Troll businessmen have commissioned me to make a Halfling Catapult. They apparently intend to make Halfling Flinging a high profile arena sport and asked me to provide them with the tools. A simple project you would think, yet it turns out deceptively hard. </P>
<P>Traditional logic tells me that 45 degrees is the best angle to fire a projectile to get the maximum range. Halflings, however, appear to completely thwart my calculations. Is it due to their hairy feet causing wind drag? Could it be that they're so full of hot air that they float for longer? I am completely at a loss. </P>
<P>Please help with any advice you can offer. </P>
<P>-Sprockly Geargrinder </P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Sprockly, </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I applaud you in your endeavors and your inventing genius. I must warn you first though about dealing with trolls. Those troll types are a cunning lot. Don't let their brutish demeanor fool you. They say they want you to build a Halfling Catapult, but think on this a moment. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>You gnomes are not much different in size than the halflings these trolls desire to be seen flung about mercilessly from some giant contraption. Knowing trolls, I can bet you that gnomes will be flung about just as often as halflings are. In fact, if you are successful in fulfilling this contract, I am sure the people Ak`Anon will not be too happy with you, maybe even shunning you from your homelands. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>This whole business of halfling hurling, dwarf punting, and gnome golf is despicable. Just because someone has a growth imbalance causing them to be way above the proper height of four feet, doesn't give them the right to exert their tallness on the rest of us. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>My advice to you Sprockly, don't finish this contraption. Tell those trolls where they can put it. If by chance you do build this thing, I hear there is a gnome named Kilgore who wanted to volunteer to be the first to be flung. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>To soothe your scientific curiosity though, the aerodynamic attributes of the halfling physique can best be described with the following equation. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Yeah, like I would be able to come up with an equation.</STRONG> </P>
<P align=center>***** </P>
<P>Dear Mennix, </P>
<P>I am getting sick and tired of your incoherent ramblings and rants.&nbsp; Slack jawed Ogres and drooling Trolls are constantly asking you for advice and the only thing stupider than them is the pointless stream of garbage that spews forth from out of your mouth.&nbsp; You must of spent to much time rolling in poison oak out in the fields with the other furry footed tree huggers and it has made you delirious. </P>
<P>You and all your kind think you're so important because your tall and well liked, well let me tell you a thing or two.&nbsp; Us Gnomes may be shorter than you and we may have relatively large roundish bellies but we are way more intelligent than you.&nbsp; Do Halflings ever create marvelous creations like our clockworks or do anything beside play fetch with your silly wolves.&nbsp; Halflings aren't even smart enough to where shoes, I mean come on do you know how many sharp rocks are out there in the fields of Norrath?&nbsp; Many people I know say I am over compensating for my small stature and that I have a bit of a Meldrath complex but I say that you Halflings are poisoning our world with your nature prancing and fluffy bunny rabbits.&nbsp; I am biding my time and when I have gained a sufficient amount of power I will invade Rivervale with a legion of my undead servants to put a permanent end to you sickly sweet Halflings, but more importantly I will be gunning for you my dear Mennix, to shut you up for good.&nbsp; Well have a good day my doomed friend and make sure you cast some spells of protection on yourself and sleep with your eyes open because my pet will be lurking in the shadows of the night. </P>
<P>Kilgore, <BR>24th Season Gnomish Necromancer </P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Kilgore, </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Please visit your fellow gnome, Sprockly Geargrinder. I think you can help him test something.</STRONG></P>
