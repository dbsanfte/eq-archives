<h2>A Chat with Kendrick</h2>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Greetings! Thanks for stopping by this afternoon! Welcome to the second of three chats we are having this week with various EverQuest personalities in celebration of EverQuest's 2nd Anniversary.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> I'm Xeraxa, Senior Editor in Web Presence, and I'll let Kendrick introduce himself.</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> Hello! I'm John Capozzi, also known as Kendrick, Game Designer for EQLive/SoV.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Tanlyn: What is your favorite part of Velious and why?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> I'd have to say Thurgadin, because it feels so alive</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> The more lifelike we can make the world, the better, I say. Next question</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Fandarwen: Are normal Hate/Fear armors going to be upgraded? I noticed that the Iksar only armors not only have the same AC, but much better stats than the others.</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> There are no plans to upgrade Hate/Fear armors for other races at this time.</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> Next question?</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Brynath: Why did you decide to limit Velious to 35+?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> Mainly because the bulk of our player base falls within the 30-60 range..</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> That doesn't rule out visiting Velious before then..if you are brave of heart. Next question?</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Oompaa: What is your favorite race/class combo?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> Well, I'm probably best known as a Rogue, and Half-Elf at that..but I also like and play quite a few other races/classes..</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> Next</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> VBob: Have all the monsters in Velious been killed at least once yet?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> No, there are many NPCs in Velious that haven't met death at the hands of adventurers yet.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Balmera: Will more of the history of Norrath be made available in game, rather than just on HHT?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> I'm all for that Balmera, and we are doing more and more daily. I feel that if you "live" in Norrath, you should have the information to ground you in that world..in the world</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> How long have you been a part of EQ?</P>
<P align=left><B><B>KendricK:</B></B> I guess since June of 1998 when I started beta testing Phase .5. I've been a full time employee since last summer.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> What sort of professional background do you have?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Hmm, short answer or long? Former Marine, business owner, network engineer, used car salesman..</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> How often do you actually play EQ now?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Daily.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Ironsword: How long did Velious take to make?</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Start to finish, from concept to ship, was about 12 months</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Aludian: What is your favorite item name in Velious?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> I like "The Hammer Wizards Can Use!"..;) </P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Absor: What's the most fun thing about being a game designer?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Watching the players enjoy my efforts is the big payoff. Because it is a LOT of work..getting paid to MAKE games is nothing like getting paid to PLAY games..;)</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Brynath: Are there plans to upgrade the old worlds to newer technology?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> We've got a commitment to maintain the minimum system requirements of Original EQ...so that limits what sort of tech updates we can do for the existing world. You'll notice we push the envelope further and further with each expansion though.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> How did you become a game designer?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> How did I decided to do this, or how did I make this happen?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> er, decide..;)</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Gaming experience was a big help, and being involved in the very early beta of EQ was another. There, I established something of a reputation with the EQ team, and that helped a great deal</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> I loved the game, and was committed to it, and I like to think that showed.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Balmera: How much of your "vision" of Velious was actually coded into it?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> We hit most of our marks. Linear content, faction choices, new NPC behavior, and "ooh-aaah" factor. </P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> The Plane of Mischief is a neat zone. How much input did you have in its creation?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> The entire team had a hand in Mischief, but the actual designers doing the bulk of the work were Jason Polk and Kayvon Simantob</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Do you have any advice for would-be designers?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Know your audience..first and foremost, you are an entertainer. Entertain. ;)</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> As a game designer, do you need creativity or technical expertise as your primary strength?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> It's a strong mix of both. You need to understand, master, and find ways of exceeding the tools at your disposal, on the tech side. You then need to be creative putting those tools to use. Though, like anything, there are those that are more...</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Technical than Creative, and vice versa.</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Content designers like myself, I guess you could call generalists.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> What's the funniest thing that has ever happened to you while you were playing EQ?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Lol, I've lost count. Probably my personal favorite was dying to Innoruuk...Deathtouched while in the air from his gravity flux.."Innoruuk shouts PULL!"</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> When will we see a Jalen and Kendrick vs. Vasharr on the Halas Docks rematch?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> Lol, I almost forgot about that one..one of the first dynamic events in EQ Beta. Well, I still owe Vasharr..;l)</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Last Question: Do you have any parting comments for us?</P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> I'd like to thank everybody for helping make EQ so strong going into our third year. Like I said earlier, the payoff for a designer isn't the paycheck, it's knowing that people enjoy the work you put out. </P>
<P align=left><B>KendricK:</B> I think that's it.</P>
<P align=left><B>Xeraxa:</B> Thanks for your time John! Come back tomorrow at 3:00 pm PST for a chat with Brad McQuaid.<BR></P>
