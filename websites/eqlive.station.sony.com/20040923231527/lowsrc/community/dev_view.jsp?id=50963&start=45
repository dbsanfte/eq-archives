<h1>Luclin Update</h1>
	I just wanted to inform you of some of the items that we are aware of and are working to fix.  We will be patching as many fixes as we can tonight.<P><I>Bard Songs</I>  Bard songs are broken.  Bards are having trouble getting songs to start or to take hold.<P><I>Group Buffs</I>  there is a problem that seems to be preventing anyone from casting group buffs.<P><I>Crashing when Zoning</I>  some zones are causing some folks to crash and not be able to get back to play with those characters.<P><I>Bolt Spells</I>  some spells are not displaying their effects.<P><I>Mouse pointers</I>  something is up with mouse pointers.  For some they get an extra, others get none.<BR> - NOTE:  Changing resolutions seems to fix this problem for some people.<P><I>Intel 810 and ATI Rage cards</I>  and possibly others, are displaying 'black boxes', often where a texture should be transparent.<P><I>/facepick</I>  sometimes after changing your face it doesn't stay changed.<BR> - NOTE:  This seems to be an issue with folks wearing helmets when making the changes.  It might help to remove helmets before changing faces.  It might also help to zone once before putting that hat back on.<P><BR>I'm sure there are other issues being fixed right now, but those are the ones I have at hand.<P>I also have a few tips and suggestions for folks.  But first I want to respond to this:<P><BR>-Cragganmore- wrote:<P><B>The back of the Luclin CD states: ADDITIONAL LUCLIN SURCHARGE REQUIRED.  Is there some new monthly charge associated with EQ that has not been announced before?  I have read all the web sites and do not recall seeing anything about this.</B><P>There is no extra surcharge required to play Luclin.  I honestly don't know how that got on the CD case, but it's not true.<P>And what are you doing reading the back of your CD case anyhow...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR><B>Tips and reminders</B><P><BR><I>DirectX 8.1 is required to play EverQuest.</I>  I wanted to make that clear.  Problems like "No 3D devices found" and many others can be fixed by upgrading to DX 8.1.  Run DXDiag.exe and make sure the version says "DirectX 8.1 (4.08.01.0881)".<P><I>For those using NVIDIA cards</I>, the 23.11 drivers have proven to give much better performance in EverQuest.  You can find a link to them <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp" TARGET=_blank>here</A> on our driver support page.<P><I>Clipping Plane!</I>  Remember, you can pull in your clipping plane if you are having problems with your framerate.<P><I>Choosing which models to load.</I>  Ester asked me to make sure that everyone understood that when we talk about going to the "options" to choose which models to display, we mean the options BEFORE you log in, not the options in game.  This is done before you log in because it has to know what models to load before you log in.<P>Another tip <I>for the more advanced computer user</I>  It might be a good idea to turn off your swap file, run a defrag and then turn your swap file back on.  It's nice to have an unfragmented swap file.  If you don't know how to do this, then don't worry about it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><I>Oh!</I>  And, yes, there is a typo in the printed manual that comes with the game.  I apologize to all of the budding young makeup artists out there for calling you Rouges rather than Rogues.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

A few more updates:<P><BR>Wrexen wrote:<P><B>I understand that Velious dragon teeth don't need to be soulbound anymore since they're not needed, but why are keys to Skyshrine no longer soulbound? The key represents the trust of the dragonkin to enter and leave the Shrine at will, and it seems odd that those who bind themselves there would find themselves unable to leave. I'm hoping this is unintentional? Or if not, are there going to be other ways to leave the Shrine when we don't have our corpses handy?</B><P>Another thing that Ester asked me to make sure that everyone understood.<P>The teeth are indeed no longer soulbound.  But then, they are also no longer necessary.<P>The Skyshrine key seems like an error.  We'll look into it.<P><BR>Ghoul_Arch_Magus wrote:<P><B>In the patch tonight, please fix Familiars so they do not die when the wizard goes invisible.  Thanks.</B><P>We're aware of this issue.  I don't think that we'll be able to get this one fixed tonight, though.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Another update<P><BR>We are aware that there are folks seeing choppy framerates in certain zones on systems that it would seem should work just fine.<P>We think this might be a sound problem.<P>If you are experiencing poor framerate and you've got all the latest video and sound drivers and you think your system should meet or exceed our requirements, please try turning off your sound and see if that fixes the problem.<P>If it does (or doesn't) please let me know by replying to this post.<P>We are working on a solution to this as I write this message.  I wanted to let you know that turning off your sounds might help and to see if I could get some feedback from those with this issue.<P>Thanks<P>Alan<BR>
