<h1>Update from Shawn Lord</h1>
	<P><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/team_SLord.jpg">Hello everyone,</P>  <P>It's been about a month since my last post here.&nbsp;
  Since then, we've made several changes and additions to the game, both in
  response to the community's requests and in preparation for the launch of
  Omens of War in September.&nbsp; These changes have included everything from
  tweaks to Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Gates of Discord content to the
  complete overhaul of the back-end systems that make up our Alternate
  Advancement system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>  <P>During the recent changes to the Alternate Advancement
  system we can see one example of how our team's constant communication with
  you, our player base, can positively impact the game.&nbsp; In changing the
  way that Alternate Advancement works on our end, we affected over 300
  different abilities.&nbsp; These changes had plenty of potential for disaster.&nbsp;
  Yet, with your help we were able to spot and address few issues that popped
  up almost immediately.&nbsp; Having less than a dozen issues pop up during
  the reintegration of a system that affects hundreds of thousands of players
  in literally hundreds of different ways is a major success.&nbsp; Your help
  and patience made that possible.&nbsp; Thank you!</P>  <P>It's changes like these that will enable us to keep
  EverQuest growing strong for years to come.</P>  <P>Some of you may be reading that and thinking, &quot;that's
  great, but what about class balance, solo instanced adventures,
  etc...!?&quot;</P>  <P>Please remember, even if we're not posting or discussing
  certain topics in the forums, we're listening.&nbsp; The team not only reads
  your posts, but discusses them internally on a daily basis.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
  many of the requests and issues you present to us do not have easy
  solutions.&nbsp; With every change, update, and addition, we must consider
  all of the possible ramifications on nearly 8 years worth of content and
  systems.&nbsp; Because of these risks and the shear scale of the game and our
  player base, we have to take our time with certain changes.</P>  <P>When dealing with hundreds of thousands of customers, who
  have been playing the game a certain way for over 5 years in many cases, you
  try to be as careful as possible in your approach.&nbsp; This means that
  sometimes we may discuss ideas with the best intentions, only to find that it
  may take several months or years to properly integrate the concept into the
  game.&nbsp; That doesn't mean that certain things are never going to happen
  or that we've forgotten about them.&nbsp; This is expecially true when it
  comes to introducing new ways to play the game.&nbsp; It's one thing to make
  a minor tweak or add new content to existing game systems, but adding
  something that may appear to be simple can often turn out to be a really huge
  challenge.&nbsp; So, before we can promise something like Solo Instanced
  Content, we still have work our the kinks on something as simple as the Omens
  of War Task system.&nbsp; Then we'll need to monitor this system's affect on
  the game.</P>  <P>&quot;Absolutes statements&quot; and MMO development don't
  seem to work well together.&nbsp; During Planes of Power, we told you
  that&nbsp;&nbsp; instancing wouldn't work in EverQuest.&nbsp; At the time, it
  wouldn't.&nbsp; A year later, we created Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&nbsp; We've
  seen similar incidents with items, class changes, and just about everything
  else.&nbsp; It's going to happen.&nbsp; When you're dealing with something as
  organic and sprawling as EverQuest, there's no way around it.</P>  <P>As the Live Team works with you to find zones, events, or
  quests that require reworking, it's my job to find a way to make it possible
  for them to make those changes.&nbsp; A current example of that is Tacvi, one
  of the zones in the Gates of Discord expansion.&nbsp; After the original
  designer of this and several other Gates zones (along with the
  &quot;Breakdown in Communication&quot; Quest) moved on to other
  opportunities, several designers were tasked with looking at this work and
  determining a course of action.&nbsp; The immediate goal was to make this content
  function properly (no, Tacvi crashing wasn't a plot to slow people down it
  was simply bad scripting), while transforming it into something that is
  actually... well... entertaining and challenging.&nbsp; To do this, we
  shifted some resources away from Omens development and contacted several of
  the guilds that were banging their heads against the old content.&nbsp; It's
  my understanding that people are&nbsp; finding many of the smaller issues
  resolved and enjoying the changes that Rashere has made to Tacvi so
  far.&nbsp; Look for posts from him about these changes.</P>  <P>While addressing the issues we've found with Gates of
  Discord,&nbsp; maintaining the Live game, and creating new expansions, we've
  also been focusing on another set of goals.&nbsp; In the coming months, our
  team must continue to find ways to improve our internal communication, update
  our procedures for implementing and testing content, and look for ways to
  avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly.</P>  <P>Your feedback in these areas is being heard and we thank
  you for your patience.</P>  <P>EverQuest is a very different game than it was when I
  started playing it 5 years ago.&nbsp; Yet, even after all these years our
  company is still extremely excited about this product and its future.&nbsp;
  I've been asked by my bosses to determine what resources and changes we need to
  help push EverQuest even further into the forefront of online gaming.&nbsp; I
  can't think of a more exciting time in the product's history.</P>  <P>In the two months since I've been back on the team, we've
  given more time for the development of Omens of War and had several more
  people added to the team.&nbsp; Even as we make preparations to enter the
  Omens of War beta on the 9th, we are looking for ways to improve the way we
  do things.&nbsp; Sure, we're going to make mistakes in the years to
  come.&nbsp; Sometimes we'll fix one thing and we'll break something
  else.&nbsp; It's unavoidable with a product and community that are this
  large.&nbsp; EverQuest is a massive game and continuing to grow at a
  monstrous rate.</P>  <P>Just remember, because of you we're still America's
  #1 MMORPG... and we're just getting started.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>
