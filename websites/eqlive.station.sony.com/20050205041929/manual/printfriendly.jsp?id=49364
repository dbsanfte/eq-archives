  the banker is the same as using /consider) and your Inventory Window. <BR><BR>The word Bank appears in the title bar of the window. Below that are eight
  bank slots. These bank slots can hold any items or containers that your
  character can carry. Use these spaces for storing items. <BR><BR><EM>To place an item into the bank:</EM> <BR><BR>* Left-click on the item in your inventory that you want to store in the
  bank. The item should appear on your mouse pointer.<BR>* Aim at the open bank slot and left-click. This should place the item in the

  are your bank coin storage locations. The coins, from top down, are Platinum,
  Gold, Silver and Copper. <BR><BR><EM>To place coins into the bank:</EM> <BR><BR>* Left-click on one of the coin types in your inventory. This will pop up the
  coin selection window.<BR>* Select the amount of coin that you wish to move to your bank, either by
  typing in the amount or by moving the slider.<BR>* Click Accept. This should place the desired number of coins on your mouse
  pointer.<BR>* Click on the appropriate coin section in the Bank Window. This should drop
  the coins into your bank. <BR><BR><EM>Note: The banker will change currency for you. If you want to turn one
  silver piece into ten copper pieces, drop the silver piece into the section
  of the bank window for copper coins. The banker will place ten copper pieces
  into that slot. If you have ten copper pieces that you wish to make into one
  silver piece, simply drop the ten copper pieces into the bank slot for silver
  and the banker will convert them to silver.</EM>
