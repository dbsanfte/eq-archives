			Using Weapons
		</h1>
	
	In EverQuest, you can fight using short-range melee weapons (swords, clubs and so forth), ranged weapons (bow and arrow), or your bare hands. If you've got magical spells, you can use those in combat as well - see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=magicusing">Using Magic</A>. Combat might be dangerous inside a city, as guards are there to protect the citizens. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			12.1
			Acquiring Weapons
		</h2>
	
	Nearly all classes get a basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you do, you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure you hang onto your original weapon for a while - even a basic sword isn't cheap, and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along the way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons. <BR><BR><I>Tip: If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait, you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			12.2
			Weapon Types
		</h2>
	
	You start out with a basic weapon, but as you progress in levels and earn more money, you'll want to upgrade. Even those who specialize in magic usually carry a weapon in case their mana supply becomes depleted. <BR><BR>There are five basic types of weapon, and a skill for using each type. All except for ranged attacks are melee (close combat) attacks. Some weapons are one-handed, meaning that you only need one hand to wield them. If you possess the Dual Wield skill, you can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and use them simultaneously during combat. Two-Handed weapons require both hands and a two-handed combat skill. <BR><BR><I>Blunt</I>: Bashing damage delivered by a dull weapon (bruises your opponent).<BR><I>Slash</I>: Slicing damage delivered by a sharp, edged weapon or a whip (cuts your opponent).<BR><I>Piercing</I>: Stabbing damage from a pointed weapon (pierces your opponent).<BR><I>Ranged</I>: Piercing damage delivered from a distance by a propelled weapon, such as a bow and arrow.<BR><I>Thrown</I>: Projectiles thrown by hand, such as darts and rocks. <BR><BR>With some skills you can deliver manual attacks during combat, such as a Kick or Bash. This adds to whatever weapon damage you dish out.<BR><BR>

			12.3
			Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	Prior to fighting, run through a quick, mental checklist: <BR><BR>* Scribe and memorize any offensive spells you possess.<BR>* Program your Combat skills and spells (if any) to Hot Buttons.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key.<BR>* Makes sure you have a weapon in hand.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <B><I>F8</I></B> to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><I>Green text</I>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><I>Light Blue text</I>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><I>Blue text</I>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it won't be easy.<BR><I>White text</I>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you could win.<BR><I>Yellow text</I>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><I>Red text</I>: You'll most likely die. <BR><BR><I>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a greater challenge.</I><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			12.4
			Attacking With Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target, you can simply press <B><I>a</I></B> (or whichever key you've remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it. <BR><BR><B><I>a</I></B> Initiate auto-attack (on current target).<BR><I><STRONG>Esc</STRONG>ape</I> Remove current target from Target Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><I>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot).</I> <BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says "Your target is too far away." Be sure to remain facing your target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow. Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage, you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>, for information on how damage affects you. <BR><BR>

			12.5
			Developing Weapon Skills
		</h2>
	
	Several things affect whether you get weapon-based combat skills, and whether you can accumulate more later. <BR><BR><I>Class</I>: Depending on what class you choose, you may already possess one or more weapon skills. Most classes with warrior abilities (Warrior, Paladin, Ranger and so forth) give you one or more from the very start. <BR><BR><I>Experience</I>: You usually gain additional fighting skills as you progress through experience levels. <BR><BR><I>Practice</I>: You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve your weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game with practice points available (and you gain five of these with each level). Later, you may have to pay cash along with practice points for tutoring sessions (right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill you want to practice). Some skills can only be practiced if you've reached a certain experience level.<BR><BR>
