			Using Pets
		</h2>
	
	Some classes let you develop the ability to summon undead pets or elemental forces, or to befriend wild animals that aid you in combat. You'll have to find the correct spell for your class and purchase it before you can summon or charm a pet. Look for spells that begin with "Summon," "Befriend," "Charm," or that contain the word "Animal" or "Undead." A variety of pet-related spells also exist that you can use to heal your pet or boost its abilities. <BR><BR>Once you have a pet, you can instruct it to taunt your target, attack, follow you, guard a location, or protect you as follows: <BR><BR><B>/pet guard here</B> - Tells the pet to guard its current location.<BR><B>/pet guard me</B> - Tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, or that it's master attacks.<BR><B>/pet follow me</B> - Tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone line.<BR><B>/pet attack [target]</B> - Tells the pet to attack the designated target.<BR><B>/pet back off</B> - Tells the pet to stop its attack.<BR><B>/pet as you were</B> - Returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.<BR><B>/pet get lost</B> - Will send the pet back to where it came from.<BR><B>/pet report health</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet health report</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet health</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet taunt</B> - Toggles pets taunting.<BR><B>/pet notaunt</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet no taunt</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet taunt off</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet taunt on</B> - Tells the pet to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet stand</B> - Causes the pet to stand up.<BR><B>/pet sit</B> - Causes the pet to sit down. <BR><BR><I>Note: Pets have a limited range at which they can hear commands.
