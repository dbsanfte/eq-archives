			Moving Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	Every window in the EverQuest interface can be moved and placed wherever you want it on the screen. <BR><BR>To move a window, point your mouse at the title bar (at the top of the window&nbsp;- contains the name of the window, such as Main Chat) or at the border of the window. When the mouse cursor changes into the four-headed arrow, just click and hold down the left mouse button. Then drag the window to wherever you want it to be and release the mouse button. <BR><BR>As noted above, pointing your mouse cursor at the borders of windows that can be resized will cause the pointer to turn into the two-headed resizing cursor. To move these windows you need to grab them by the title bar, not the border. <BR><BR>
