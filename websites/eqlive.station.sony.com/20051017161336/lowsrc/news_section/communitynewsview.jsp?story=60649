  members, but to teach them what they know as well. They have no lvl
  restriction, no raiding requirements, and no shortage of fun and games!
  Current members range from lvl 1 to lvl 70 with plenty of toons lvling
  inbetween! Guild focus at the moment includeds LDoNs to equip the guild and
  DoDs to raise AA's at the proper lvls. This is a very sociable guild that
  groups every single day. It is not unusual to look in guild management and
  see several blocks of 6 players in the same zones. =D Send a tell in-game to
  Queen for an invite. To find her, use the command: / queen all<br>

  and 500pp for a group to participate in group duels.&nbsp; Also we are looking for sponsors to
  donate money to help make the prizes larger.</P>  <P>And the prizes will be:<BR><BR>1st place - 1/2 of all entry fees and sponsorship money.<BR>2nd place - 1/4 of all entry fees and sponsorship money 3rd place - 1/8 of
  all entry fees and spnsorship money.<BR><BR>There will be 2 different dueling events, team and 1V1 dueling.&nbsp; A team will consist of a FULL group of
  6 players.&nbsp; Anything will go in
  the matches EXCEPT leaving the PVP area tp avoid being killed, harmed, etc...<BR><BR>The 1V1 dueling will be aimed at players lvl 35-45, while the team duels are
  aimed at groups that have a average level of 20-35.&nbsp; The group and 1V1 dueling entry fees
  will be counted so that 1/2 of ALL entry fees will not be given to the winner
  of one or the other, also because of the group nature of the team duels the
  prizes will be evenly split between all group members.<BR><BR>Send a in-game mail message to Udaian if you wish to enter the touney or host
  a activity.&nbsp; If you do not send a
  mail message for tournament registration, you will still be able to register
  in-person(character) between 1:00 and 2:30 PM MST (-7GMT).&nbsp; The 1V1 touney will start 1 hour after
  registration, and a list of the first round of matches will be mailed to all
  participants, this is a single-elimination tourney so if you lose, you lose.&nbsp; Ater each round a new list will be
  mailed to all continuing contestants until the final battle is finished.&nbsp; Also with the first round list, will
  be instructions on how to conduct the duel.<BR><BR>The team duels will be hosted 1 at a time in the PVP area of Arena at the
  same time the 1V1 dueling is going on so to prevent anything that might
  interfere with a 1V1 duel you are asked to stay on the 1/2 of the PVP area
  that the team duels will be help.<BR><BR>Everyone is invited, wether they will duel or not, to have fun at other
  player events, and to generally just screw around.&nbsp; However it is asked that you stay out
  of the PVP area while duels are being conducted to avoid any... unfortunate
  events.<BR><BR>Have fun, remember to send a in-game mail to Udaian to participate in dueling
  or to host a event, a reminder will be mailed on friday to all event hosts
  and pre-registered duelists to remind them of the fair.<BR><BR>-Event hosted courtesy of &quot;The Disciples of Steel&quot; and it's owner
  Udaian.</P><br>
