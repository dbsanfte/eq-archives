<h1>Legends Calendar Answer</h1>
	I just wanted to pass this information on to you all.  We'll be adding it to the Legends FAQ shortly.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Question: The Legends service has a Calendar of Events that will be listing approved player submitted events, as well as GM run occasions, Dynamic Events and other fun stuff. Since this calendar can include player events, will these be enforceable by the GMs in terms of rights to particular monsters, encounters or zones?<P>Preamble: Such issues are governed by the EverQuest Play Nice Polices as described at <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp." TARGET=_blank>http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp.</A> We encourage our players to be familiar with these policies as, with any server, they will very much govern player conflict resolution on Legends servers. <P>Answer: In the past EverQuest Customer Service did not recognize player created web calendars for spawn contention resolution. The difficulty with multiple calendars, who hosted said calendars and a myriad of other issues made such enforcement not practicable. Given that the Legends service Calendar of Events is a single source, monitored and approved by EverQuest Customer Service, it will be a legitimate factor for the resolution of altercations. However, it will not be the only factor.<P>Legends Customer Service is very interested in the development and maintenance of the player community. In the interest of fair play, we will consider additional factors when finding resolution to such issues as spawn, encounter or zone contention. Such factors could include the ability of the force present to tackle their scheduled target, the current and past conduct of the players or guilds involved in the dispute as well as any record listed on the Calendar of Events. As with any resolution, we will look to find one that is fair, unbiased and mutually equitable to all parties involved. A lofty goal, but one that we hope, with the help and cooperation of the players, to attain.<P>As an addendum, I would like to point out some guidelines we are working on for the Calendar of Events. We will have more specifics ready for everyone at launch. While we will strive to approve submissions in an impartial, unbiased fashion, there are certain things we will not allow. The Calendar is mainly a tool to inform players of events that are open for others can participate in. While notifying others of your intent to tackle a raid zone is nice, if this activity is not open to others, we may not post it. The constant monopolization of encounters will not be allowed. Also, while the fact that you may be logging in and Looking For a Group in Sebilis tonight might be nice to know, it may not be appropriate news for the Calendar of Events.<P>We look forward to seeing you on Stormhammer.<P>Respectfully, <P>Lead GM Bordael<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
