  members and are now recruiting. We have an excellent core membership, and
  have been around for 4 years we just sometimes lack numbers required to drop
  targets we require for progression. We have in the past cleared time to qaurm
  (tho presently don't have the numbers to raid time, hence this advert) , and
  have completed the Ikk trials, we are looking for dedicated, addicted players
  who want to have fun and still enjoy Eq1., our raid times are 6pm gmt to
  10.30 gmt (ish<BR><BR>Server transfers are welcome. Level 65 and 100 aas ideally (looked at on a
  case by case basis)<BR><BR>We would also welcome a guild merger so if your euro guild is suffering / has
  disbanded and you want to join a friendly team trying to get back on the road
  please get your guild leader to contact Genadorm of Xev.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If you would like to check our reputation or our history

  raiding high end targets (currently we aim for time again and uqua), we are
  proud of our reputation and hope you can help us continue to have fun.<A HREF="http://judgement.guildwizard.com/"></A></P><br>
