		<h1>
			11
			Experience Levels
		</h1>
	
	You always begin as a Level I
  character. As you gain experience in the world (mostly through combat), you
  progress to the next level. At higher experience levels, you can improve many
  types of skills and add to your spell casting abilities. <BR><BR>The best way to gain experience is to go out into the wilderness and kill
  creatures within your ability. You can also gain experience by completing
  quests. At first, you'll need to take on rats, snakes and other small
  animals. Once they become too easy for you and stop giving you experience,
  it's time to move on to something larger. <BR><BR>You can tell whether or not killing a certain creature will give you
  experience by the color of its text response when you Consider it. Stay away
  from creatures with red text (too hard). Look instead for light blue responses
  (easier kill) and blue ones (you'll have the upper hand). See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=beforeatt">Before You Attack</A>,
  for a list of the Consider response colors and what they mean.

	
		<h2>
			11.1
			Experience Bar
		</h2>
	
	You can keep track of your experience
  and view your current experience level in the Inventory screen. Even though
  your text display sends you a message each time you advance a level, it's a
  good idea to occasionally check your stats and level status. <BR><BR>The yellow/orange bar is the experience that you've gain toward the next
  level. The blue line just under the experience bar is a magnification of one
  of the five graduated lines (bubbles). This way, you can see more accurately
  your progress towards your next level.

	
		<h2>
			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to
  gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking
  away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one
  on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are
  split among the group members according to their experience levels. The
  higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping
  experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.
