			Retreating
		</h2>
	
	If you do decide that retreating is your best option, look for the safest escape route. Sometimes, you can run over to other characters in the area, and someone will help attack the monster or taunt him away. But those other characters might not be willing or able to help you out. In fact, running over to them might get them killed. While it's certainly a good thing to find help when needed, it's not polite to bring your problems to other unasked. Communicate with those around you, find out if they would be willing to help you before you need it. <BR><BR>There is a term, "training", for rudely running a bunch of dangerous NPCs over a group of unsuspecting characters, and it's something to avoid. <BR><BR>Guards (as mentioned in the previous section) can also help save your life. <BR><BR>
