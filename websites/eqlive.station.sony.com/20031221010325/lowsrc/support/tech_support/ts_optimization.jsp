<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin ~ Optimization</STRONG> </DIV>
<P>Welcome to a quick crash course on how to optimize Shadows Of Luclin. The goal of this page is to ensure you get the most enjoyable playing experience while in Luclin. These tips will be most helpful for users running the game on computers with the minimum requirements. If you are running the game on our recommended specs, please feel free to continue reading; you may learn a thing or two. </P>
<P>For easy access, the following tips will be separated in two segments. The 1<SUP>st</SUP> segment being <B>Pre-Game: Login Screen Options</B>, and the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> part being <B>In-Game: Display Options Menu.</B></P>

<OL type=a>
<LI>Launch EverQuest by running EverQuest.Exe. Once patching is complete, please hit Play. This will take you to the EverQuest Login Screen.&nbsp;Once you are at the Login screen, please select the OPTIONS button.<BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt1.jpg" width=469><BR><BR>
<LI>In OPTIONS, please select your Video Card from the provided list. Select your desired language setting, and you will then enter the Luclin Options screen<BR><BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt2.jpg" width=469><BR><BR>
<LI>In Luclin Options screen, please note the recommended number of models, depending on how much RAM is in your system. <BR><BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt3.jpg" width=469> <BR>
<LI>In the second Luclin Options screen, you will be able to change engine settings.<BR><BR></LI></OL>
<UL>
<LI>Setting <B>Sound</B> to off will increase frame rate for PC's with low-end CPUs. 
<LI>Setting <B>Social Animations</B> to Off will decrease load times. This option is highly recommended for users with 256mb of ram or less. 
<LI>Using <B>Texture Compression</B> will decrease your load time. Please note this feature should NOT be turned on unless your video card specifically supports it. 
<LI><B>Mip Mapping</B> causes the world to blend together better but uses more memory. This should be set to off for systems with less memory. 
<LI>Setting <B>Dynamic Lighting</B> to off will increase frame rate for PC's with low-end CPUs. 
<LI><B>Texture Caching</B> improves load time on many systems, at the expense of using extra disk space. The first time you load any zone or the character selection screen with caching on, it will take time to build the cache. After that load times should be reduced. Changing your settings here will require new caches to be built the next time you play. This setting should only be enabled if you have a fair amount of hard drive space available. 
<LI>For the <B>Resolution</B> setting we recommend you initially set it to 640x480, once in-game you will be able to change to a higher resolution depending on your system's performance. 
<LI>Setting <B>Texture Quality</B> to low will slightly increase your load times while it will have a more significant positive effect on frame rate.<BR><BR></LI></UL>

<LI>Once in the OPTIONS menu, select the DISPLAY tab. <BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt6.jpg" width=469><BR><BR>
<LI>Under&nbsp;DISPLAY options, you will be able to change several setting without having to log out. The recommended settings for optimum frame rate on low-end systems are the following:<BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt7.jpg" width=469><BR><BR>
<LI>Setting for <B>Sky</B> should be Single Layer or to 3D Sky Off for best performance. This will affect the quality of the sky or turn the sky animations completely off. 
<LI><B>Spell Particles</B> have several options:<BR><BR></LI></OL></OL>
<OL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Near Clip Plane:</B> You have the options Near, Medium, Far, Farthest. Set to Near or Medium for lower end machines and Far or Farthest for higher end machines. 
<LI><B>Density:</B> You have the options Off, Low, Medium, and High. Set to Off or Low for lower end machines, and Medium or High for higher end machines. 
<LI><B>Opacity:</B> This is a slider bar from 0% to 100%. Set to 0% for best performance. 
<LI><B>Other Particles:</B> You have the options Off, Low, Medium, and High. Set to Off or Low for lower end machines, and Medium or High for higher end machines. <BR><BR><B>Far Clip Plane:</B> Setting for <B>Clip Plane</B> will determine how far into the distance you will be able to see. Move the slider to the left if you want your clip plane to be lower. Your viewing distance then be decreased as game performance (frame rate) increases significantly.<BR><BR><B>Filter Settings:</B><BR><BR>You are also able to adjust what information you receive from the server in your chat box. The options on the left allow for basic chat functions to be visible or not to you, based on whether the buttons are depressed or not. The options on the right are as follows:<BR><BR><B>PC Spells:</B> Your text options are All, Off, and Group. All allows you to see all messages concerning any person casting a spell. Off shuts these messages off, and Group allows you to see only members of your group casting a spell.<BR><BR><B>Bard Songs:</B> Options here are All, Me, Group, and Off. The only difference with these is the Me option, which allows you to see the text of a bard singing a song directed at you.<BR><BR><B>Critical Spells:</B> Options are All, Me, and Off. This dictates who's critical spells messages you will see (everyone's, your own, or none of them)<BR><BR><B>Critical Melee:</B> The same principle applies to critical melee as critical spells.<BR><BR>If you are on a slower type of connection, such as dialup, you may wish to edit these settings to your liking so that less `data is being sent to your client, providing less lag.<BR><BR><IMG height=352 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/tech_support/opt8.jpg" width=469><BR></LI></UL></OL></LI></OL></OL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
