		<h2>
			12.4
			Attacking With Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in
  EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally
  easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a
  target, you can simply press <STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> (or whichever key you've
  remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the
  attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to
  hit it. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> Initiate auto-attack (on current target).<BR><STRONG><EM>Esc</EM></STRONG><EM>ape</EM> Remove current target from Target
  Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long
  as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another
  swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot).</EM> <BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If
  you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says
  &quot;Your target is too far away.&quot; Be sure to remain facing your
  target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow.
  Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and
  whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage,
  you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent
  is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and
  weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on
  your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A>, for information on how damage affects you.
