<h1>Manual</h1>




	
		<h2>
			5.24
			Mouse Options (Options Window)
		</h2>
	
	<I>Invert Y Axis</I>: When on this reverses the mouse look in the up and down directions. Moving the mouse forward pans the view down instead of up. <BR><BR><I>Look Spring</I>: When on this automatically resets your view back to the center position once you release the right mouse button when using mouse look (or quit panning with the Page Up and Page Down keys). <BR><BR><I>Mouse Look</I>: When on this enables mouse look. Mouse look allows you to you're your character by click and dragging the right mouse button. <BR><BR><I>Mouse Sensitivity</I>: Adjusts the mouse (cursor) speed. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			5.27
			Friends Window
		</h2>
	
	The Friends Window is not open be default. It is designed to help you manage your Friends List. The Friends List is useful for keeping track of people that you meet in game. <BR><BR>Adding a friend to the list is easy. Just type their character name (you need to be accurate) into the text bar near the bottom of the window (to the left of the Add button). Then click on Add. The friend's name should appear in the window. <BR><BR>To remove someone from the list, simply select the name and click on the delete button at the bottom of the screen. <BR><BR>The Contact and Who buttons are shortcuts to make it a little easier to use your friends list. <BR><BR><I>Contact</I>: Starts a /tell to the friend that you have selected from the list. <BR><BR><I>Who</I>: You can use this to find out if your friends are on line. It can be used two way. You can select a friend from the list and click who and it will give you the /who information on that character only. Or you can click on Who with no names selected and it will give you the /who information for the entire list. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			10.10
			Other Skills
		</h2>
	
	<I>Alcohol Tolerance</I>: Drink more alcohol before becoming drunk.<BR><I>Beg</I>: Beg for money from NPCs.<BR><I>Disarm Traps</I>: Safely dispose of traps (Bards and Rogues only)<BR><I>Hide</I>: Remain unseen.<BR><I>Safe Fall</I>: Fall without damaging oneself (Bards, Monks and Rogues only).<BR><I>Sense Traps</I>: Find traps before you set them off. (Bards and Rogues only).<BR><I>Sense Heading</I>: Determine your direction.<BR><I>Swimming</I>: Move around in water.<BR><I>Track</I>: Find a creature or character in the same zone. (Bards, Druids and Rangers only).<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are split among the group members according to their experience levels. The higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			12.1
			Acquiring Weapons
		</h2>
	
	Nearly all classes get a basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you do, you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure you hang onto your original weapon for a while - even a basic sword isn't cheap, and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along the way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons. <BR><BR><I>Tip: If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait, you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.8
			Developing Magical Skills
		</h2>
	
	Some skills relate directly to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, Meditate and Specialization (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=skillsmagic">Magical Skills</A>, for a listing and definition of each skill type). You gain some of these skills through experience, while you're born with others.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.5
			Guards
		</h2>
	
	Guards immediately kill unfriendly creatures if they come too close. This can be good for you (if, for example, some creature is about to beat you to a pulp), and bad for you (if a guard kills a monster you won't get experience for it nor will you be able to loot the corpse). So it's a good idea to know where the local guards are.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			17.1
			Camera Views
		</h2>
	
	During gameplay you can view your character from several different camera angles, zoom in and out, or pan up and down. <BR><BR>To cycle between available views, press <B><I>F9</I></B>. <BR><BR><I>First-person view (default)</I> - View straight ahead (you can't see your character).<BR><BR><I>Overhead (rotating)</I> - View from above (camera rotates as you turn).<BR><BR><I>Rear (rotating)</I> - View from rear (camera rotates as you turn and stays behind you).<BR><BR><I>Overhead (fixed)</I> - View from above (camera does not rotate when you turn).<BR><BR><I>Rear (fixed)</I> - View from rear (camera does not rotate when you turn).<BR><BR>You can also toggle the interface on and off (turning off the interface makes for cleaner screenshots). To cycle through interface views, press <B><I>F10</I></B>. <BR><BR>

			EQClient.ini - Text Colors
		</h2>
	
	<B>[TextColors]</B> <BR><BR>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <BR><BR>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: <BR><BR><B>1</B> - Say<BR><B>2</B> - Tell<BR><B>3</B> - Group<BR><B>4</B> - Guild<BR><B>5</B> - OOC<BR><B>6</B> - Auction<BR><B>7</B> - Shout<BR><B>8</B> - Emote<BR><B>9</B> - Spells (memorizing, scribing, casting, etc.)<BR><B>10</B> - You hit other<BR><B>11</B> - Other hits you<BR><B>12</B> - You miss other<BR><B>13</B> - Other misses you<BR><B>14</B> - Some broadcasts (duels)<BR><B>15</B> - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<BR><B>16</B> - Disciplines or special abilities<BR><B>17</B> - Unused at this time<BR><B>18</B> - Default text and stuff you type<BR><B>19</B> - Unused at this time<BR><B>20</B> - Merchant Offer Price<BR><B>21</B> - Merchant Buy/Sell<BR><B>22</B> - Your death message<BR><B>23</B> - Others death message<BR><B>24</B> - Other damage other<BR><B>25</B> - Other miss other<BR><B>26</B> - /who command<BR><B>27</B> - yell for help<BR><B>28</B> - Hit for non-melee<BR><B>29</B> - Spell worn off<BR><B>30</B> - Money splits<BR><B>31</B> - Loot message<BR><B>32</B> - Dice Roll (/random)<BR><B>33</B> - Others spells<BR><B>34</B> - Spell Failures (resists, fizzles, missing component, bad target, etc.)<BR><B>35</B> - Chat Channel Messages<BR><B>36</B> - Chat Channel 1<BR><B>37</B> - Chat Channel 2<BR><B>38</B> - Chat Channel 3<BR><B>39</B> - Chat Channel 4<BR><B>40</B> - Chat Channel 5<BR><B>41</B> - Chat Channel 6<BR><B>42</B> - Chat Channel 7<BR><B>43</B> - Chat Channel 8<BR><B>44</B> - Chat Channel 9<BR><B>45</B> - Chat Channel 10<BR><B>46</B> - Melee critical filter<BR><B>47</B> - Spell critical filter<BR><B>48</B> - Your target is too far away text color<BR><B>49</B> - Rampage text<BR><B>50</B> - Flurry text<BR><B>51</B> - Enrage text<BR><BR>
