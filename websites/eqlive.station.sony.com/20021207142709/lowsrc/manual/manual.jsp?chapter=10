		<h1>
			10
			Skills and Combat
		</h1>
	
	

	
		<h2>
			10.1
			Skills
		</h2>
	
	<P>Your character possesses a few basic skills at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense Heading and Bind Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally known to those of a specific race or class, while others that you don't originally know can be learned over time (such as Meditation if you are a spell caster). <BR><BR>In order to use a skill you'll want to place it on an easily accessed hot key button. <BR><BR>To do this: <BR><BR>* Click on the Skills Tab (the hand) of the Actions Window.<BR>* Right-click on an empty hot button slot.<BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* Click that Hot Button to use the skill. <BR><BR>Open your inventory (<B><I>i</I></B>) and click <B>Skills</B> to see how proficient you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better you become at it. When your skills improve messages appear in your chat window. <BR><BR></P>

	
		<h2>
			10.2
			Improving Skills and Training
		</h2>
	
	The more you use a skill, the better you become at it. When you improve a skill ranking, a message appears in your Chat Window. In order for a skill to improve, your character must know the basics (for some skills this will require expending at least one practice point in that skill). Skill rankings are tied to your experience level - you can only improve a skill so much at Experience Level 1, improve it a bit more at Level 2, more at Level 3, and so on. <BR><BR>You can develop as many skills as you like - there's no limit. Some skills, however, are better suited for certain races, occupations or experience levels. <BR><BR>One good way to increase your proficiency in a certain skill is to visit a trainer. Trainers are usually masters of certain skills, and are willing to teach you. As a new character, you can visit your Guild hall and spend practice points, credits toward training. Later, you'll have to pay for lessons. <BR><BR>To approach a trainer: <BR><BR>* Visit your Guildhall (your starting note will usually tell you who to look for).<BR>* Right-click on the Guild Master or a trainer.<BR>* The skill page pops up - click on the skill you wish to improve.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Train</STRONG>.<BR><BR>Some skills can't be practiced until you reach a certain experience level (noted on the skill when you visit the trainer). For these, you'll need to practice at least once to learn the basics of that skill.</B><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			10.3
			Putting Skills on Hot Buttons
		</h2>
	
	It is often convenient to program a skill onto a Hot Button. When you've done this, you simply click that button to use the skill: <BR><BR>* Click on the <B>Abilities Tab</B> of the Actions Window, then right-click on an empty Hot Button.<BR><BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* After that, just click that Hot Button to use the skill.<BR><BR>
