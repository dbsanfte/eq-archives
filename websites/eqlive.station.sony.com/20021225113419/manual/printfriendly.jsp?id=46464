	Once your subscription is set up, you simply need to connect to a game server: <BR><BR>1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on the desktop. <BR><BR>2. Type in your Sony Station password and then click <B>Connect</B>. The screen that displays lists all of the available game servers. <BR><BR>3. Click on <B>a server name</B>, then click the large <B>Play EverQuest</B> button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. <BR><BR>Your next step is to create a character. You can store up to eight characters on each game server. When first starting out, it might be a good idea to jot down the name of the server that you created your character on so that you can find it again. If you choose a different server you will find only a fresh set of empty character slots. <BR><BR>
