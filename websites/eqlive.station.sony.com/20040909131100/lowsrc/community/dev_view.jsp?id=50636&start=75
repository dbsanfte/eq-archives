<h1>Bards Chains does not strip SoW</h1>
	Fendryl wrote:<P><B>Selo's Consonant Chain & Largo's Absonant Binding while acting like a snare effect don't strip SoW from creatures.</B><P>This is intentional.  In fact, we went to a lot of effort to make it work that way.  Snare slows the target down, but when the Snare wears off the target gets all of his movement magic back.  We changed this, in part, because players didn't like having NPCs cast Snare on them and destroy their movement spells.  NPCs get the same benefit.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Absor:  In a recent reply to Fendryl's post:<P>"Fendryl wrote:<BR>Selo's Consonant Chain & Largo's Absonant Binding while acting like a snare effect don't strip SoW from creatures."<P>You said the following:<P>"... Snare slows the target down, but when the Snare wears off the target gets all of his movement magic back. We changed this, in part, because players didn't like having NPCs cast Snare on them and destroy their movement spells. NPCs get the same benefit."<P><BR>This is incorrect.  What was changed was ROOT not removing Spirit of Wolf and other movement enhancing spells.  <P>SNARE (including the necromancer and shadowknight Darkness series) still removes them, as makes sense. Snare lowers your movement rate, thus makes sense that it removes Spirit of Wolf, the two magics conflict.  Root just temporarily stops you, and doesn't make as much sense that it should remove Spirit of Wolf.<P>NPCs, by the way, rarely cast Snare, they cast Root.  Which is why Root, and not Snare, was the source of headaches to players.<P>So, basically, Bard "snare" type songs (such as the two mentioned by Fendryl) SHOULD remove Spirit of Wolf.  Otherwise they do not act like other Snare-effect spells in the game.<P><BR>The changes to movement spells as performed by Verant were actually as follows:<P>Snare - Removes Spirit of Wolf<BR>Root - No longer removes Spirit of Wolf<P>You can test this by creating a druid and casting Spirit of Wolf on yourself.  First Root yourself (using the Ensnaring Roots spell).  Note that Spirit of Wolf will stay up.<P>Now Snare yourself.  Note that it overwrites Spirit of Wolf.<P><BR>Which is the opposite that you reported.  I would suggest that bard snare songs should be looked at again to determine if they should behave like the Druid and Ranger "Snare" line, and the Necromancer/Shadowknight "Darkness" line, with respect to how they remove movement spells from PCs.<P>-- Ulmar</B><P>All part of my secret plan to confuse people...<P>I'm sorry.  I got Snare and Root confused.  What you said is exactly the truth.  Root is an independent spell and has no effect on movement spells.  Snare and Spirit of Wolf and spells of that type do affect each other.<P>Which leads me back to the original question about Bard songs that have Snare-like effects.<P>Bard songs are coded in a completely different way than spells.  Their effects and durations and all of that are different than spells.  So the fact that a song that acts like Snare doesn't work exactly the same way as Snare isn't a problem from a game mechanic point of view or for consistency in the world.<P>But I'll ask around about this.  Changing it might be a problem and might break other things (Bards hate it when we do that).  And, well, I wonder if you would be so eager to see this change if NPC bards were able to sing their songs...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Speaking of NPC Bards not singing their songs, why don't they?  Afraid that they'd be too tough?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kenross Cantoforjado &lt;Silent Justice&gt;, 58 songs, Innoruuk<P><BR>btw, I tried to respond to the thread but it wouldn't let me.  I suspect because there's a grammatically correct apostophe in the word "doesn't".</B><P>It has something to do with the whole fact that bard songs are completely different than spells.  I'll poke around and ask some questions on Monday about it.<P>And I'll get rid of the apostrophe... silly thing.<P>Alan<BR>
