<h1>NPC casters</h1>
	Obviously the recent change to the way NPCs choose their spells has been receiving some attention from players.  I think its one of the best changes weve seen in a while (sure, I like the pet thing too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>I just wanted to pop in and let you all know that the intent of these changes is to make things a little more... (I would normally use the word realistic here, but that usually causes me trouble...) internally consistent.  Basically, the tuning stopped when the NPCs were picking spells that were similar to those that PCs pick.<P>But the spell selections arent the only things were changing.<P>For example, and I didnt even know this happened, Enchanter NPCs used to get an automatic chance to hit with their spells, regardless of the resistances of their target.  We took that ability away from them.  Now if they want to have a better chance to land spells they are going to have to cast a Tash spell.<P>The goal here is to make things fairer when it comes to NPC spell casters, and it applies to both sides.<P>We hope to be examining other aspects of this whole fairness thing as time goes on.<P>Alan<BR>

Ghanimaa wrote:<P><B>Firstly, a bug report: some npc casters are casting spells above their levels (blue to 60 casters casting level 60 spells for example). Please look into this.<P>Secondly, please recall that most damaging spells are balanced with a player harming an npc with npc level hps in mind. An npc casting these spells on a player is doing damage that is a much larger percentage of the target's hps than when a player is casting on an npc. There is a reason that spells are "nerfed" in pvp combat. Please consider reducing the damage that npc spells do to players in a manner similar to the way they are balanced in pvp.<P>Third, the price that players pay for being able to cast spells is in hitpoints, armor class, lack of melee ability, and a limited mana pool. While npc casters have a somewhat limited manapool, most don't seem to have any of the other disadvantages that pcs pay to be casters, thus making them essentially warriors who cast. I would ask that you consider scaling down the hitpoints or melee ability of casting mobs, as an npc who can cast for 1200dmg and hits for 250 just like the non-casting warrior npcs in the same dungeon, is over-powered.<P>Thanks</B><P><BR>Actually, thats a sort-of-a-bug thing...  Because NPCs were so stupid about casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities to make them relatively better casters.  Some of those casters might be too good now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis.<P>Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their level, and special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate.  Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.<P>Were not forgetting any of those things:  we know NPCs have relatively more hit points than PCs, we know they do more damage... we know that stuff.<P>You have to keep in mind that these NPCs, though smarter, still dont have the advantages of being played by human beings.  The players get to pick the odds for the most part, they get to pick the timing of the fight and they get to choose from a wide arsenal of classes, spells, items, abilities etc.  And a human can put all that stuff together in ways that even our AI code cant (though Id <I>love</I> to see NPCs splitting PC spawns.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>Thats the price that NPCs pay, and its a pretty big one.<P>But were keeping our eyes on it, playing against these nifty NPCs ourselves and all that.  Well make further changes as needed.<P>Alan<BR>
