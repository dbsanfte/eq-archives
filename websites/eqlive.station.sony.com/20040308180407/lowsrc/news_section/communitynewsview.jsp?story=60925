	<h2>Norrath's Elite Guard Recruiting on Fennin Ro</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	02/17/2004 8:46 am<br>
	<P>Norrath's Elite Guard, NEG, Joining NEG is a unique experience. We aren't a big "Uber" guild. In fact, we make a point of keeping it small. We don't Raid every weekend, we aren't constant talking about the latest price for this or that weapon. We are friends, we are family. If this sounds interesting to you, read on.</P>
<P>Norrath's Elite Guard is a guild on the Fennin Ro server in the game EverQuest. We are a tightly knit group of players that are friendly, generous, and have a pretty wacky sense of humour. We have a good mix of gamers and role-players and a wide range of levels and classes. We tend to have a few more of the "light" races, rather than the "dark" ones, but don't let that stop you from inquiring about joining. One of our creeds is to bring the races of Norrath togther. As a Guard, we try to help people whenever possible. Naturally we try to help our guild mates first, but should a stranger require help we have been known to go out of our way to aid them.</P>
<P>Again, we are not an "uber"-guild. We do not spend hours in guild-chat talking about who has the best&nbsp;weapon or which class outbeats the other.</P>
<P>We do our best to abide by&nbsp;the Rules of Conduct. Especially the Play Nice Policy.</P>
<P>We are friends. We keep each other company, we help each other out in the hunt and in our quests. We have raids, we have contests and we like to party!</P>
<P>So, after all this you still want to join our crazy group of casters and warriors? The easiest way is to ask one of the officers in game. You can find out who's an officer by checking out the roster , you can request an interview from the Message Board or you can submit an application here. </P>
