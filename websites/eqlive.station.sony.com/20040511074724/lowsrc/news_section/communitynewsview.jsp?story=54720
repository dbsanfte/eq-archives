	<h2>Clan Vigilant of Torvonnilous Now Recruiting!</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	03/14/2003 8:51 am<br>
	<P>Clan Vigilant was formed in December '02 by a husband and wife team and for the purpose of categorizing, would be considered a family type guild at the moment. The guild was formed with the desire that all members be active within the guild and form guild groups whenever possible as well as be active on the guild message boards and contribute to the website.</P>
<P>We have quite a few years of EQ experience within our guild (the leaders having transferred from Bristlebane server) and enjoy raiding, questing, chatting, helping each other out and have quite a few members on regularly. Our levels range from L10-L40 with the majority of members being in the 30's. We typically help each other level and you almost always see 3-4 of us together at any given time.</P>
<P>We're hoping to add a few more quality members and hope to gear ourselves up for some raiding and learn what we have to so that we can gear up for the higher end content that we crave. We accept members based on personality, sense of humor, maturity and EQ knowledge. (lvl range should be 30-40 for the best fit but it's not mandatory)</P>
<P>I hope we sound interesting to some of you! If you haven't found a guild yet, or you're in an uber guild and you have an Alt and you want to help us get up there, as long as you're in it for the right reasons, we'd be glad to sit down and chat for a bit to get to know you!</P>
<P>For more information visit our site!<BR><A href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.asp?GuildID=1070">http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.asp?GuildID=1070</A></P>
<P>Thanks in advance</P>
