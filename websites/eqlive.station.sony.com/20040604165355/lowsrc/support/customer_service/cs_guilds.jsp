<h1>Customer Service</h1>


<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Guild Information</STRONG> </DIV>
<P>Anything and everything you wanted to know about creating, joining, and administering guilds can be found in the sections below.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><SPAN class=subHeader>Guild Creation</SPAN></P>
<P align=left>If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are looking for, you may create your own guild. In order to establish your guild, you must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who wish to form this guild.</P>
<P align=left>The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for your guild:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server and issue the <B>#makeguild</B> command. This will create a private guild channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel, although this name can be edited later during the creation process.<BR><BR>
<LI>After the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the members of his guild into the channel. To do this, he needs to tell the guild members the name of the channel and the password for access.<BR><BR>
<LI>Once 10 or more members are in the channel, they need to issue the <B>#approveguild</B> command. The guild leader can then issue the <B>#makeguild</B> command. This will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. <BR><BR>
<LI>In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of the guild's charter. This summary should focus on the guild's role in Norrath and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild need not be included. You may also edit your guild's name in this screen. Once completed, hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for approval. It's important that you double-check the spelling of the guild name because it could be approved with submitted spelling and then could be very hard to change.<BR><BR>
<LI>The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button. Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation screen.The guild leader can edit the charter and the guild&nbsp;name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for approval. <STRONG>IMPORTANT</STRONG>: If the leader is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH, the guild will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit screen. IMPORTANT: If your guild is listed as Initial Approval, it is not fully approved yet. Please do not petition on server to have your guild created at this point. <BR><BR>
<LI>If the name and charter are approved, the guild leader will be notified via email that the guild is ready to be created. <STRONG>IMPORTANT</STRONG>: Please verify that your email is correct in our registration information by:&nbsp;&nbsp;A) Going to "Account" B) Then going to "Change Account" C) Then going to "Edit Registration" from the login screen.&nbsp;NOTE:&nbsp;It is important that you have the correct email address listed, or you will not get your approval letter promptly. <BR><BR>
<LI>After the guild leader has received notification via email that the guild has been approved, it is his/her responsibility to petition and meet a GM to complete the guild creation process. Only the Creator needs to be present for creation.</LI></OL>
<P align=left>For fastest service, try to petition between 2PM and 10PM PST. If this is not possible, you may either petition and allow a Guide to assist you further or locate and request the assistance of the Chat GM.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><B>Joining and Quitting Guilds <A name=2></A></B></P>
<P>When you have decided that it is time for you to join a guild, your best source for information will be your fellow citizens of Norrath. You'll be able to see which guilds they belong to by the guild tags that they display over their heads. Ask them about their guilds; delve deep and see if the guild fits your personality and style of play. Most guilds have websites you can visit to gather more detailed information. </P>
<P>Not all guilds accept new members. Guild membership, and who it is offered to, is solely at the discretion of the guild and its members. <BR>If you are accepted into a guild, the guild leader or an officer of the guild will invite you to join using the<B> /guildinvite</B> command. When the invitation is extended you may either accept or decline.</P>
<P>If you decide that you wish to leave your guild, you may do so at anytime by using the<B> /guildremove</B> command.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><B>Guild Commands <A name=3></A></B></P>
<P><B>/guildinvite &lt;name&gt; &lt;rank&gt;</B> - Invite a person to join the guild. If this person is to be an officer, include the argument &lt;O&gt; (as in Oscar) for the rank. Usable by the Guild Leader and Officers, but only the Guild Leader can make officers. You would also use this function to promote a member to an officer.</P>
<P><B>/guildremove &lt;name&gt;</B> - Remove a member from the guild. Only the Guild Leader may remove Officers. You may use this command on yourself to leave the guild.</P>
<P><B>/guilddelete</B> - Disband your entire guild. Only the Guild Leader may use this command.</P>
<P><B>/guildstatus &lt;name&gt;</B> - Will return information on whether the named person is a member, an Officer, or the Guild Leader.</P>
<P><B>/guildleader &lt;name&gt;</B> - Transfer guild leadership to &lt;name&gt;</P>
<P><B>/guildsay</B> - Sends a message to all guild members</P>
<P><B>/guildwar &lt;name&gt; &lt;duration&gt;</B> - Initiates a guild war against the guild of the Guild Leader which appears in the &lt;name&gt; field. &lt;Duration&gt; sets the duration in real days for the guild war. This defaults to one real day if left blank. The opposing Guild Leader must send the same command with the &lt;name&gt; of the enemy Guild Leader to fully initiate the conflict.</P>
<P><B>/guildpeace &lt;name&gt;</B> - Ends a guild war before the duration has expired. &lt;name&gt; is the name of the opposing Guild Leader. Both sides must send this command to end the war prematurely.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><B>Guild Wars<A name=4></A></B></P>
<P>Conflict may arise between guilds from time to time. When this occurs, guild leaders may decide to declare war between their guilds. If both leaders agree, they can open hostilities by using the<B> /guildwar </B>command.</P>
<P>Guild wars may vary in duration from the default of 1 day to a maximum of 14 days. During this period of time members from either guild may cause harm to each other regardless of their adherence to the tenants of Order or Discord.</P>
<P>If the forces in conflict decide that peace would be a better option before the war has run its course an early end to the war may be declared. In order to accomplish this, both guild layers must issue the<B> /guildpeace</B> command.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
