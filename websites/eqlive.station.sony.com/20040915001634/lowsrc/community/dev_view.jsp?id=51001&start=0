<h1>Luclin Update 5</h1>
	I apologize for the length of time since the last update.  We've been trying to get a good grip on these problems, but some of them are elusive and have evaded our efforts thus far.  We have made good progress on several of them, and expect to have some good results for you soon.  Please note the italicized comments next to some of the entries.<P>We appreciate your patience as we work these few remaining issues out.<P>---<P>We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list. <P>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of. We will be keeping you updated as things change. Also, check the patch messages for more information. <P><I>Stuff in the works</I>, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <P>- Reducing loading and zoning times <I>(Note:  we have a possible improvement for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)</I><BR>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone <I>(Note:  we have a possible fix for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)</I><BR>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<BR>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<BR>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<BR>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<BR>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<BR>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<BR>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<BR>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working/displaying properly <I>(all fixed at this time except for Mind Wrack)</I><BR>- A few players are being disconnected at random<BR>- Partial transparencied NPCs are still showing up half invisible/behind things they're supposed to be in front of.<BR>- Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning properly<BR>- Druid pets, either charmed or 55 castable, cannot be buffed<BR>- Familiars die when the wizard cast invisibility.  When this happens no harm comes to the wizard, but the plan it to have them remain when the caster is invisible<BR>- Luclin ports trying to take people that don't have Luclin (or the Luclin portal stone fragment) and dumping them at the 'safe point' in the zone<BR>- Spell Reinforcement: Only the person who has the AA has their buffs last longer.  There is no change in the most practical case: A person with the AA buffing another person.  The other person does not get the added time<BR>- Slow framerate on some fast computers*<P>*Every bug has its story.  This one begins as an incompatibility between EverQuest, AMD processors and Umbra (a technology that, ironically, speeds up framerates).  There is a known problem in the Umbra engine that was causing the crashes that some AMD users were originally seeing in Shadowhaven.  In our desire to make sure that both Intel and AMD users could enter the game, we introduced another condition that unfortunately slowed down framerates in certain circumstances.  We have one person working on nothing but this at the moment and he's made significant progress.  We expect this problem to go away soon.<P><BR><I>Fixed</I> since release (in no particular order either): <P>- Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)<BR>- Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die<BR>- Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent<BR>- Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.<BR>- /follow bug that caused folks to crash<BR>- Transparency issues with i810 display adapters<BR>- Crash bug related to root and gate<BR>- Various item and content fixes<BR>- Crash problems in certain zones<BR>- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.<BR>- A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.<BR>- Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans<BR>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<BR>- Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor<BR>- A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing<BR>- A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game. <BR>- Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users<BR>- New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely<P><BR><I>Note:</I> The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability. It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer. <P><BR><I>Tech Tip</I><BR>- Pauses with <B>Win 98/ME ONLY</B>: A possible solution for those with a fair amount of RAM (technically, anyone with 128 megs or more...) who are seeing pauses while the hard drive runs a bit, might benefit from this simple change (it's also easy to undo). It might also improve load and zone times. <P>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 <P>For best results, change only this setting (don't change a bunch of other stuff at the same time) and see how it performs. And if it isn't better or seems worse you can just erase that line from your System.ini file. I should tell you that this change might make EverQuest better and it might also cost you some performance with your system overall, though this does not seem to be the case for most people. Keep that in mind if you decide to use this tip. <P><BR>Thank you all for your patience. We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible. <P>Alan<BR>

<B>Hey Absor. Honestly, I was telling my brother this just last week...."Ya know..The Luclin Launch was comparable to Anarchy Online, but they did an incredible job cleaning up quickly". So, from me to the team, Good work. You've got at least one patient person here. I've still got minor issues, but...its Everquest, you guys are on the prowl.<P>Also wanted to say that I totally understand the priority of bugs over say...implementations and features. But..I gotta be honest...I'm getting very scared that the new interface and the /trader command are going to go the way of the Guild Halls (See Original everquest manual...i.e. "You can even buy your own guild hall) These two ideas are a long time coming, and...personally, having written a letter a week to Verant for over a year about the whole /trader command idea, I was very excited when the idea was confirmed. <P>Anyhow, not asking you to hurry, just wouldnt mind some mind candy in the form of an ETA or progress report. THanks<P>-Kluz<BR>Rathe Server</B><P>I just don't have an ETA on those items for you.  I'm not listing them on the Luclin Update thing because, as you noted, they are features we want to add, not bugs that we need to fix.  As such, they fall into a different category.<P>However, you will see those features.  A lot of the work has been done already on both of them.  I had a chance to try out the /trader stuff even before Luclin shipped, and with the exception of some details it's close to done.<P>But I can't really estimate when you'll see either the bazaar functionality or the new interface simply because there are other things taking precedence right now, and those are things that I don't have an estimate for completion on either.  All I can say is that we'll get to them as soon as we can.  I know that's not really what you want to hear, but it's the best we can do right now.<P><BR><B>With regards to the translucent NPC problem, it's not just NPCs.  My offhand sword has a translucent blade, and it disappears behind a portion of the screen (if you were to divide my screen into sections vertically, like a stack, it would disappear behind the middle section) when I see it swing in front of my character's face in first person mode.  It's probably the same problem as translucent NPCs (or anything else translucent), but on the off chance it's not, I thought I'd point it out ...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Tenbil En`Haldar</B><P>That is probably the same thing.  But the real issue is that when NPCs disappear they effectively become invincible, and that's a bad thing.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR><B>Thanks for the update.  <P>I know Verant has acknowledged that some of the new Luclin Bard songs are not working as intended.<P>Could you please include these in the "Luclin Updates" in the future, or comment on them now?  If you read the update, the impression is that there are currently no outstanding bard issues.<P>The main one I have actually tested is Katta's.  The proc seems to still cause complete song lock-up in some circumstances.<P>The others are well discussed in the support forum.<P>(At the least, can you tell us which ARE working as intended.....there is much depate on the forums on "Amplification" and the "Sustenance" ones for example.)<P>Thanks again,<P>Sinban <BR>Level 51 Minstrel<BR>The Seventh Hammer</B><P>I did indeed forget to list the bard songs, and even after I talked to a bunch of people about them... sorry.<P>It does seem that Katta's Song of Sword is causing the problem you described.  We are also taking a look into Amplification to see if the effect is actually working, and we are aware that there is an issue with Battlecry of the Vah Shir.  I'll add them to the next update.<P><BR>Ompa wrote:<P><B>under the things fixed section you have:<P>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<P>Please move this to the being worked on, unless your not going to fix it(in which case please let us know as well), because last I checked something isn't fixed if your 'working on getting' it fixed...</B><P>Will do.  I thought it was fixed, but it seems that for some of these races it is not.<P><BR>Underling wrote:<P><B>That's nice and all, but can someone tell me when my Troll beastlord will have class graphic? It seems like something that would have been put in before the game shipped. I've sent comments before, but the only response I received was the canned reply about luclin problems.</B><P>I'm not going to add it to the list, but we'll certainly get the class icon put in when we get a chance.<P>Alan<BR>
