	p.94: The bottom of this page makes reference to the commands of "/who Guides" and "/who GM-Admins all". Neither of these commands exist. You should use "/who gm all" to get a list of all visible GMs and Guides in game. Furthermore, the description of a Guide is incorrect. A Guide is a volunteer CS representative that serves as the first line of support for customers in game. They can assist with most issues, however will not be able to give you hints or other information that is meant to be discovered in game. <BR><BR>
