			18
			Quests and Groups
		</h1>
	
	&nbsp;

	
		<h2>
			18.1
			Finding Quests
		</h2>
	
	Once you're fairly familiar
  with the game, you may be ready to take on a quest, or an adventure with a
  specific goal. Most quests offer some sort of reward. <BR><BR><EM>Ready-Made Quests</EM>. Many non-player characters have small quests. The
  best way to find out what they are is to hail various NPCs and ask.
  Non-player characters have certain keywords marked in square brackets - for
  example, &quot;I need some help with my [problem].&quot; If you respond with
  a question that includes that keyword, you'll receive more information. <BR><BR><EM>Player-Created Quests</EM>. Players can create their own quests and
  publicize them via chat or message boards. Keep your eyes and ears open for
  any interesting opportunities. <BR><BR><EM>Miscellaneous Events</EM>. Some of the more creative EverQuest players
  organize public events. These include advertised duels, weddings between
  characters, celebrations, and in some cases, even lotteries and contests.

	
		<h2>
			18.2
			Participating in Groups
		</h2>
	
	Adventuring outside the city
  can be dangerous. Joining a group can help you defeat monsters that you normally
  can't kill, carry items that won't fit into your inventory, and progress
  through levels faster than you would alone. <BR><BR>Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience
  received while adventuring is based on the levels of the party members. As a
  general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the
  ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point
  that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>When starting a party, consider the skills of each member that you invite.
  You want a good mixture of combat, spell-casting and healing abilities. At
  the very least, make sure you have a couple of strong fighters, a wizard,
  magician, necromancer or enchanter to cast spells, and someone else with
  healing powers (like a cleric). Use variations of the &quot;/who&quot;
  command to see players of a certain level, race or class. <BR><BR>Groups are temporary groupings, as opposed to Guilds, which allow an ongoing
  affiliation between players.

	
		<h2>
			18.3
			Joining/Leaving/Disbanding a Group
		</h2>
	
	You can either invite someone
  to join your group, or accept an invitation from someone else who has started
  a group. <BR><BR><EM>To invite a player to join your group:</EM> <BR><BR>* Target the player.<BR>* Click the <STRONG>Invite</STRONG> button in the Group Window.<BR><BR>The player you're inviting receives the invitation in the Chat Window, and
  his or her &quot;Invite&quot; button changes to &quot;Follow&quot;. <BR><BR><EM>To accept a group invitation:</EM> <BR><BR>* Ask to join a group or wait for someone to invite you to join.<BR>* Click the <STRONG>Follow</STRONG> button in your Group Window (the button then
  reverts back to &quot;Invite&quot;).<BR><BR><EM>To leave a group (or dissolve a group you started):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Disband</STRONG> button in your Group Window.

	
		<h2>
			18.4
			Group Notes and Tips
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG><EM>F1-F6</EM></STRONG> will
  target group members 1-6 respectively. <BR><BR><EM>Communication</EM>: Keeping in touch with group members is crucial. Before
  combat, make sure everyone is present and prepared to do battle. <BR><BR><EM>Group Leader</EM>: Every group needs a leader. It's a good idea to elect
  someone to make decisions about important party matters. <BR><BR><EM>Group Health</EM>: The names of fellow group members appear in the group member
  window. Below each name is a bar that shows that member's current health
  status. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Spells</EM>: Some spells affect all members of a group. If
  you've got a spell caster in your group, it might be a good idea to pitch in
  and have your spell caster purchase a group-based spell. <BR><BR><EM>Groups and Experience</EM>: Experience points are split between group
  members according to experience level - see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=experiencegroup">Group
  Experience</A>. <BR><BR><EM>Splitting Loot</EM>: To split coin treasure evenly, enable autosplit under <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iogeneral">Options / General</A>.
  Items can't be split and should be fairly awarded on a case-by-case basis.
