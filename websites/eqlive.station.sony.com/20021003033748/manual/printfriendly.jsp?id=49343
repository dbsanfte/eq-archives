		<h2>
			5.13
			Group Window
		</h2>
	
	This window appears just below your Player Window and has the word Group in the title bar. If you are not in a group, the only thing visible in this window will be the Invite and Disband buttons. When you join a group this window will display the health bars of your party members. If those party members have pets, the health of the pets will be shown in the same way they are displayed in the player window. <BR><BR><I>Invite</I> - this button is unavailable (visible, but grayed out) unless you have a player character targeted and can invite them to your group. You can only invite players to your group if you are the group leader (or not in a group at all - making you the leader by default), and your group must have room for one more member.<BR><BR><I>Disband</I> - this button is unavailable unless you are a member of a group. Disband removes you from your group. If you were the leader of the group, someone else will be randomly assigned leadership when you disband. But you can also use the /makeleader command to assign a new leader before you disband.<BR><BR><I>Follow</I> - The Invite button will become a Follow button if someone invites you to join a group. Clicking Follow puts you into that group.<BR><BR><I>Decline</I> - The Disband becomes the Decline button if someone invites you to join a group. Clicking Decline turns down the invitation. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: The tool tip for these health gauges will show you the percentage of the health remaining for your group members or their pets.</I> <BR><BR>
