	Some classes start out with
  one or more spells. To learn (scribe and memorize) a spell: <BR><BR>* Click the spell book icon at the bottom of your Spells Windows to open your
  spell book.<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory to place the scroll on your cursor
  (you can right-click and hold&nbsp;on a scroll first to view its contents).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe (write) the spell.<BR><BR>Scribed spells are permanently recorded in your spell book. But you can't
  cast every spell in your book. You must first choose to memorize those
  spells. Characters can only memorize eight spells, so at higher levels it
  becomes a tactical decision as to which spells to keep 'in-mind'. <BR><BR>* Once it's scribed, click on the spell icon in your spell book.<BR>* A &quot;spell gem&quot; will appear on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the spell gems (the octagonal slots in your Spells Window)
  to memorize the spell.<BR><BR>To cast a spell: <BR><BR>* Click on a target. The target's name should appear in the target window
  (spells that affect only you don't require a target).<BR>* Click on a spell gem that is holding a memorized spell.<BR>* A casting timer will appear. This indicates the time your character needs
  to finish casting the spell.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to disappear, then cast again if you'd like.
