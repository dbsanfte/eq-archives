			Contacting a Game Master
		</h2>
	
	To seek help, type /petition [text], where [text] is a concise message explaining what you need help with. <BR><BR>Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, GMs may be swamped responding to other players' calls. Your petition is received and noted as soon as you send it, and a GM will help you as soon as he or she can. This may take a few moments, so please be patient. Do not send repeated petitions, this will actually move you back to the end of the queue. <BR><BR>When you are contacted, explain your situation. The GM will ask for more information if necessary. You can help the GM by conducting yourself in a calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant details. Be patient and your problems will be solved if they fall within the rules of the game. <BR><BR>
