<h1>Crashing problems with 32 bit color rendering</h1>
	Ester asked me to make certain that everyone had seen these quotes from Rowyl and to make some additional comments.  First the quotes:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>RE: new features available as a result of the new DX initialization code. <P><I>Please note, these features only work with D3D, so don't try them if you are using Glide.</I><P><B>32 Bit Color Rendering</B><P>If your video card supports 32 Bit color 3D rendering then you can turn this on. Currently, the way to turn this on is via editing your eqclient.ini file. Look for the line that reads <B>VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16</B> and change the 16 to a 32. Not only does this use 32 bit color rendering, but it utilizes 24 or 32 bit Z-Buffering (depending on your card) which improves the visual quality of many zones. Cards that I know will work are ones based on the nVidia TNT or Geforce chipsets, ATI Rage 128 and Radeon cards, and 3Dfx Voodoo 4 or 5 cards. There are others, you can check your video card manual or box to see if it lists 32bit color rendering as a feature. Cards that we know do not support 32bit color rendering are the Voodoo 1, 2, or 3, and nVidia Riva 128 based cards (like the STB Velocity 128 and others). <BR><B>DirectX Texture Compression</B><P>This feature will work with any system or card. When enabled it will compress the textures at load time greatly reducing the memory needed to run without swapping to the hard disk. However, it will increase your load time, primarily between server select and character select. If you have a system with more then 128 MB of ram then you probably don't need to turn this on and suffer the longer load times. However, if you are running with 64 MB or less then this could help with your in game performance at the cost of a little extra load time. You turn this one on by editing your eqclient.ini and changing the line that reads <B>UseD3DTextureCompression=FALSE</B> to be TRUE instead. Also, note your video card does NOT need to support DXTC for this feature to work, however if it does you will gain a little more performance from it.<P>-Rowyl<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>and<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>It appears that the 32bit feature doesn't work fully with the ATI Radeon cards. Please use 16 bit mode with these cards until further notice. <P>-Rowyl<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>There isn't really a way for us to give you a comprehensive list of cards that will and will not perform properly under the 32bit feature.  If your card says that it will support it and you're having trouble, make sure you've got the latest drivers for your card.<P>If you are still having trouble using the 32 bit rendering with the latest drivers, then the solution is to use the 16 bit mode.  We want this feature to work with as many cards as possible, but it just might not be possible.<P>Alan<BR>
