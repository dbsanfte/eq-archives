			29.16
			Appendix D - Magician Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<I>Elemental Form</I>: (3 skill levels) - This ability allows the Magician to transform himself into an elemental form. The Magician will be required to attune himself to a single element, and will not be able to attune himself to the others once he has done so. This means that the Magician will only get to choose one of the four elemental forms (Air, Earth, Fire or Water). Each form has three skill levels, each level granting the Magician greater abilities when in that form. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 1 second (about 1/20th of a second game time). <BR><BR><I>Elemental Pact</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Magician the power to summon pets without the use of components. <BR><BR><I>Frenzied Burnout</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability give the Magician the power to drive their pet to extreme aggressiveness, so much so that the pet will literally explode after a short time at such a frenzied pace. The explosion will cause damage to anyone near. The forceful expulsion of the elemental pet will disrupt magic in the area as well. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Improved Reclaim Energy</I>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This ability improves the Magician's ability to regain energy from their pets when sending them away. Any time the Magician with this ability casts Reclaim Energy he will regain almost all of the mana expended during the summoning of that pet. <BR><BR><I>Mass Group Buff</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Magician the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Mend Companion</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Magician the power to completely heal his own pet. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time). <BR><BR><I>Pet Discipline</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows the Magician to better control his pet. The command "/pet hold" will prevent the pet from attacking any foe, even if that foe attacks the pet or its master. The pet will remain passive until given another command. <BR><BR><I>Quick Summoning</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time of conjuration spells. The first skill level reduces the casting time of conjuration spells by 10%, the second skill level makes the reduction 25% and the third makes the reduction 50%. <BR><BR><I>Turn Summoned</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Magician the power to dismiss all summoned creatures within an area. . This ability produces and area of effect fear and damage over time spell that only affects summoned creatures. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR>
