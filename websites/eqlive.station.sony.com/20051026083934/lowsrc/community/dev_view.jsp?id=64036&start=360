<h1>Server Merges</h1>
	<P>On March 22, 2005, we will begin the process of merging
  some of the EverQuest servers.&nbsp; As
  we have seen from the recent success of the Zek merger, combining some of the
  EQ worlds is beneficial for players&#8217; experience.&nbsp; In fact, we have been pleasantly surprised
  to find that the new Zek server now has a higher population than the four
  combined servers had prior to that merger.&nbsp; We hope that by merging some of our
  lower population servers with a higher population server, we will continue to
  enhance your gameplay experience</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Merging Servers</U></STRONG></P>  <P>On March 22nd, Antonius Bayle will merge with Kane Bayle
  and will retain the name Antonius Bayle. </P>  <P>On March 23rd, Bristlebane will merge with Solusek Ro and
  will retain the name Bristlebane.&nbsp;
  </P>  <P>We understand that server identity is important to our
  customers and we will be integrating server titles into the title system to
  allow you to display your server of origin, should you desire to do so.&nbsp; </P>  <P><STRONG><U>Unutilized
  Character Purge</U></STRONG></P>  <P>Immediately preceding the merger, all characters below level
  10 that have not been logged in for over six months will be deleted from each
  of the merging servers and will not be available after the server
  merge.&nbsp; If you have a character on any of the servers being merged that
  is below level 10 and has not been logged in for more than six months, you
  will need to log that character in prior to the scheduled merge date for the
  relevant server.&nbsp; </P>  <P><STRONG><U>Shared Banks on
  Merging Servers</U></STRONG></P>  <P>If you have characters on two servers which are being
  merged together, you will need to clean out the shared bank on one of those
  servers. After the merge, only one shared bank will be available on each
  merged server.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Character
  Limitations</U></STRONG></P>  <P>If you have more than eight characters in total on two
  servers being merged together, only the first eight characters (in
  alphabetical order) will be displayed after the merge.&nbsp; Characters other
  than the eight displayed characters will not be available for selection until
  currently displayed characters are deleted.&nbsp; All characters from both
  servers will remain on your account provided that the character was not below
  level 10 and had not been logged in within the last six months.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Corpses</U></STRONG></P>  <P>Prior to the scheduled merge date for your server(s),
  please be sure that you clear any unclaimed character corpses from the
  world.&nbsp; Character corpses will not be transferred to the newly-merged
  server.&nbsp; Once the merger is complete, all corpses on the servers
  affected by a merge will have been purged.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Duplicate
  Character Names</U></STRONG></P>  <P>It is possible that characters on servers affected by the
  merge will have duplicate names. In the event that characters on the new,
  combined server do share a name, the character with the most played time will
  be entitled to keep the name. All other characters will have the letter X
  appended to their name and will be eligible for a name change.&nbsp;
  Characters can use the in-game /changename command to request a new
  name.&nbsp; The new name is subject to
  the conditions set forth in our naming policy which can be found here: <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp">Naming
  Policy</A>.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>LDoN Leader
  Boards</U></STRONG></P>  <P>After each merge is completed, as characters log into
  their newly-combined server, the leader board will be re-populated with
  standings. Although your points will be unaffected by the transfer, your
  standing may have changed based on the new, combined population totals.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Complimentary
  Character Move</U></STRONG></P>  <P>Shortly after each merger is complete, we will allow all
  customers affected by a merge a one-time, complimentary character move to the
  server of their choice.&nbsp; For each
  customer with an account on a newly-merged server who request such a move,
  all characters associated with that customer&#8217;s account will be
  transferred to the selected server.&nbsp;
  All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>
