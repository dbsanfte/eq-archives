<h1>Scaled Wolves</h1>
	Aegwyn wrote:<P><B>Please bear with the story or skip to the end for my suggestion/question.<BR>Growing up in Cabilis I had never seen a furry animal except one that came across my dinner plate.  Then when I began my Shaman training I saw my masters summoning wolves, yet these weren't the wolves I hunted almost daily to supply Klok Mugruk with scales for armor.  These wolves had fur and were soft.  I was naive enough to ask one of the Shamans why he couldn't summon a wolf native to our lands, I was backhanded for my questioning of a superior but I believed at the time it was more because he was not powerful enough to summon one of the greater scaled wolves of Kunark. But now that I have increased my abilities beyond many of my former teachers I find I am unable to summon a wolf more suited to Iksars.  I have talked to the Scaled Heirophants in the temple in Cabilis and even travelled to the great Plane of Cazic Thule, its only called Fear by those who have reason to be afraid, to seek audience with the great one himself. I have yet to recieve an answer to my questions on this subject.<P>Is there anyway to make it possible for Iksar Shaman to summon a wolf that has the look of the Scaled Wolves well known in Kunark?</B><P>I've heard a similar request from folks that play Iksar Necromancers.  They would like to see their pets look like the Iksar skeletons that we see on Kunark.<P>Unfortunately, in order to allow such a pet to be summoned by those spells we would have to make those models available in all zones.  This would mean adding them to the 'global' graphics file.  Right now this file is pretty much as large as it can get, and we can't add anything to it.<P>Obviously we'll probably be doing something to accommodate new graphics for Shadows of Luclin.  How that will affect our ability to add those (and other) graphics isn't really clear right now.<P>In short, try asking me again after the start of next year and I'll see if we have a different answer for you.<P>Alan<BR>

There are a few interesting ideas along those lines running around.  Right now just isn't the time to look into things like that.  Hang on until after Shadows of Luclin is out the door.<P>Alan<BR>
