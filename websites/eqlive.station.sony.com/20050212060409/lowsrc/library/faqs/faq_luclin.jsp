<P ALIGN="center"><STRONG><BR><STRONG>THE SHADOWS OF LUCLIN&#8482; FAQ</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <P><EM><STRONG>Section #1 - Overview</STRONG></EM></P>  <P><STRONG>1.0 What is EverQuest: the Shadows of Luclin?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>EverQuest: the Shadows of Luclin is an expansion to the world-renowned
  game EverQuest.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.1 What are the features?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Here is a partial feature list. Please note that this feature set is
  subject to change prior to release.</P>  <UL>   <LI>A massively enhanced
       3D graphics engine that makes use of newer technologies allowing us to
       support higher poly counts and more detailed textures</LI>   <LI>Over 25 new zones
       including a new starting city</LI>   <LI>All new, highly
       detailed player-character models</LI>   <LI>An all-new player
       character race: The Vah Shir (Kerrans)</LI>   <LI>An all-new player
       character class: The Beastlord</LI>   <LI>Additional
       non-level-based advancement options for those at level 51 or higher</LI>   <LI>New quests, items,
       NPCs, and more!</LI>  </UL>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.2 Will the minimum system specification for Luclin be raised
  above that of Velious?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes, Luclin is a very ambitious title. In addition to a rich in-character
  feature set, Luclin will sport some of the most stunning visuals yet to be
  seen in online games. In order to achieve this, the minimum system
  specification for Luclin will roughly coincide with that of games being
  released today.</P>  <P>The system specs will be released closer to the expansion's release date.</P>  <P><A></A><STRONG>1.2.1 What will the minimum system specification
  be?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>Required Specs:</STRONG></P>  <UL>   <LI>Windows&reg;
       98/2000/ME/XP</LI>   <LI>Pentium&reg; II
       400Mhz or greater</LI>   <LI>256 MB RAM</LI>   <LI>16 MB Direct3D
       compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. Nvidia GeForce/GeForce 2
       or ATI Radeon)</LI>   <LI>DirectX 8.0
       compatible sound card</LI>   <LI>28.8 K+ Internet
       connection</LI>   <LI>4X speed CD-ROM</LI>   <LI>450 MB+ hard drive
       space<BR><BR><EM>Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128
       MB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new
       character models.</EM></LI>  </UL>  <P><STRONG>Recommended Specs:</STRONG></P>  <UL>   <LI>Windows&reg;
       98/2000/ME/XP</LI>   <LI>Pentium&reg; III or
       greater</LI>   <LI>512 MB RAM</LI>   <LI>32 MB Direct3D
       compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. ATI Radeon or Nvidia
       GeForce 2 or greater)</LI>   <LI>DirectX 8.0
       compatible sound card</LI>   <LI>56.6 K+ Internet
       connection</LI>   <LI>16X speed CD-ROM</LI>   <LI>1.5 GB+ hard drive
       space<BR><EM><BR><EM>Note: DirectX 8.1 or greater is required for Windows 98, XP, ME, and
       2k.</EM></EM></LI>  </UL>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.3 What is the projected release date?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Luclin will go live in December of this year.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.4 Will there be a beta? How do I get in?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes. Luclin will be tested via a closed beta system expected to begin
  around August. People will be invited individually based upon past
  demonstrated desire to test and assist in EverQuest's development. As such,
  people who actively play on the Test server will get priority.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.5 Will Luclin be sold? In what form?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes, Luclin will be sold; however the precise format of sales is still to
  be determined.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1.6 We have 4 accounts in our family. Will we need to buy a copy
  of Luclin for each one?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes, you will need to buy a copy of Luclin for each account that you wish
  to access Luclin content.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG><EM>Section #2 - General Gameplay</EM></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG><BR><STRONG>2.0 Where is Luclin set?</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Luclin is the name of the ringed moon that orbits Norrath which currently
  can only been seen via the Plane of Sky. We expect that Al`Kabor will soon
  pierce the veil of shadow that hides it from view elsewhere in Norrath.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>2.1 What level range will Luclin support?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Luclin will support players of all levels, much like Kunark.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>2.2 Will the maximum level be increased beyond 60?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>No, but we are planning on including some non-level-based advancement
  options for those who wish to advance their characters further. The
  advancement will be measurable but subtle, so-as not to give anyone the
  feeling that they are required to advance as many felt upon the release of
  Kunark.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>2.3 If we did not buy Kunark or Velious, will buying Luclin allow
  our characters to exceed 50th level?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>2.4 How do we get our characters from Norrath to Luclin?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Giant steam-powered gnomish rocketships</P>  <P>Just kidding. Keep an eye on the Journal of Al`Kabor. Something tells me
  he may have some idea about how it's accomplished.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><A></A><STRONG>2.5 I know you are still in the process of
  creating everything. I just want to know if I have messed up my faction with
  the cat-people race on Kerra ridge by killing that named tiger, am I going to
  be KOS when and if I go to the moon?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>As the moon of Luclin has been unreachable for a great period of time, the
  inhabitants there will be greatly unaware of the activities you've engaged in
  on Norrath. Of course actions you take after the portals open might be a
  different story.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../../../../images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Section #3 - The Vah Shir</EM></STRONG></P>  <P><STRONG><BR><STRONG>3.0 Who are the Vah Shir?</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>The Vah Shir are a race of noble cat people that were wiped off Odus and
  deposited on Luclin many years ago in the test of a great weapon by the
  Erudites. The weapon, aimed at the Vah Shir home city of the same name, flung
  the entire city and the inhabitants therein through space, leaving what is
  now known as The Hole. Without their nobility, the remaining cat people,
  dubbed &quot;Kerrans&quot; by the Erudites, were easily rounded up and
  segregated to Kerra Isle.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>3.1 Will we need to purchase Luclin to play a Vah Shir?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Though everyone's client will download the Vah Shir character model in
  order to allow viewing of those of the Vah Shir race, you will need Luclin in
  order to play one.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>3.2 What classes can the Vah Shir be?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>While still subject to modification, we plan to allow the Vah Shir to be
  warriors, rogues, shamans, beastlords, and bards.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../../../../images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>  <P><EM><STRONG>Section #4 - The Beastlord</STRONG></EM></P>  <P><STRONG><BR><STRONG>4.0 What is a Beastlord?</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Beastlords are essentially hybrid class with a heavy reliance upon pets.
  More information will be available as we finalize the details.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>4.1 What races can be a Beastlord?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>At minimum, the Vah Shir will be able to be Beastlords. It is very likely,
  though not guaranteed, that we will open the class up to other shamanistic
  races.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>4.1 Will we need to purchase Luclin to play a Beastlord?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes. Even if we make the Beastlord available to existing races, you will
  need Luclin in order to play one.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../../../../images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Section #5 - New Character Models</EM></STRONG></P>  <P><BR><STRONG>5.0 Is it true that you are building new character models for each
  race?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes. The character models we are building are far more detailed, sporting
  a much higher polygon count and a greater texture depth. They seem more
  lifelike.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>5.1 What about faces?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>The new models will have a greater number of face options available. For
  those who already have characters, we will be creating faces for the new
  models that closely resemble the ones you chose for your old models. We may
  also allow players with existing characters a one-time choice of a new face
  for each character, but that's not guaranteed at the moment.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>5.2 What if we want to get Luclin, but prefer the old character
  models?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>While we sincerely doubt that will be the case, we will include an option
  to continue display of the old models.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>5.3 I spend nearly all of my time in wolf form. What do the new
  models mean to me?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>We're also planning on making new models for anything that players can
  become.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>5.4 Please tell me there are more animations.</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes, we're doing all new combat and social animations, including
  differentiating animations based upon what you happen to have in your hands
  at the given time. In other words, a kick carrying one weapon will look
  different than a kick while carrying two weapons.</P>  <P>In addition, we're working on another aspect of animation that will simply
  blow you away. Unfortunately we can't talk about it just yet.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><A></A><STRONG>5.5 Can you give us some details
  about the new armor and clothing textures? I've heard that they will be
  separate graphic items for Luclin. What does that mean?</STRONG> </P>  <P>Right now all armor attached to characters (with the exception of helms
  and robes) is done by performing a texture swap on the model. The
  &quot;skin&quot; changes to take on the appearance of another form of armor
  without changing the geometry. Hence, characters in full plate look as sleek
  and slim as characters in newbie clothes.</P>  <P>With the character models that come with Luclin, armor will in whole or in
  part when it makes sense will be displayed as attachable geometry. For
  instance, a steel breastplate will actually be an additional item that is
  placed over the chest of the character.</P>  <P>There are still cases where textures may be used, but usually in
  conjunction with geometry. For instance, a boot might be a swapped foot
  texture with an attached piece of geometry for the cuff or neck.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><A></A><STRONG>5.6 I was just curious, well more than curious, I
  feel compelled to ask, will elementals and other pets be getting cool new
  models too?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>We do indeed plan on giving models which players can become a makeover as
  well. Right now this includes the elementals, bear, wolf, skeleton, and
  spectre.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../../../../../images/tribal_divider.gif"></P>  <P><A></A><EM><STRONG>Section #6 - Miscellaneous</STRONG></EM></P>  <P><STRONG><BR><STRONG>6.0 I've heard a lot about the new graphics for Luclin, like grass
  and bushes fading in as you get closer and greater detail textures for
  everything. That's great, but what if my computer can't handle all that? Will
  I be able to turn that stuff off, like the clipping plane works now?</STRONG></STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>We plan to allow users to configure many of the new graphics options that
  will be available. At minimum, we'll let users turn that grass on or off.
  It's also possible that we'll let you set the radius in which it is
  displayed.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>6.1 Will Shadows include the improved UI that came with Velious?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Yes, we are working on removing the last remnants of the obsolete 640x480
  UI.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>6.2 I can't wait for Luclin to come out, except for one thing....
  After 2 years I am out of character slots (on 2 servers, mind you) and don't
  want to destroy any of my memorable companions to invent a new Kerran. Any
  chance for a couple more character slots with this expansion?</STRONG></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>No, we are not planning on expanding the number of characters allowed,
  with possible exception to Sullon Zek, where we might allow one additional
  character to give current people a chance to try out a Vah Shir on that
  server. This is however not written in stone.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>
