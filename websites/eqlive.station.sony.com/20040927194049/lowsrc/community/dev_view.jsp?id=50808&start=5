<h1>Consolidated Scam Warning!  Please read and be aware of.</h1>
	Greetings all!<BR>I have consolidated most of the scam warning posts to this one.  These are the scams that have been brought to our attention. There are several methods that people will try to trick another individual out of his account information. Below are some examples of what to look out for!<P><B>Example 1:</B><P>    <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Subject: Shadows Of Luclin Beta Test<BR>Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 20:44:00 -0500<BR>From: BetaTesting@deleted.com<BR>To: unsuspecting_recipient@somedomain.com<BR>Dear Sony Station Customer,<BR>As you may know, a new Everquest expansion is coming out soon called, Shadows of Luclin. Until we can finallize this expansion and ship millions of copies on to the market, we must make sure that everything works. So therefore, we at Sony and Verant are looking for a few beta testers. We are looking for people that have been dedicated Everquest players for while, and that have not borken any rules. In order for you to have a chance in participating please click here, to go to our Shadows Of Luclin Beta Testing sign up page.<P>After you submit the information please allow 5-6 business days for us to review your account. After that period we will send you an email letting you know if you have been qualified or not along with further instructions on how to start you beta testing.<P><BR>Thanks for Participating,SonyStation.comVerant Interactive<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The link will send you to a web page where it asks you to volunteer your STATION NAME and PASSWORD.<P><B>Example 2:</B><P>    <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Subj: Everquest Patch for Test Server <BR>Date: Tue, 1 May 2001 12:36:08 AM Eastern Daylight Time <BR>From: anon@anon.com <BR>To: anon@anon.com <BR>EQtest103.exe (56065 bytes) <P>Here you go, my e-mail is xxxxxxxx@aol.com, give me an e-mail with any problems, questions, or comments, thanks and have fun!<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The object of the email is to try to trick the recipient into believing that it contains a Shadows of Luclin Expansion Beta Testing file. The name of the file that is attached with the email is eqtest103.exe, but this can easily change. Upon running the attached Trojan file, your computer is infected with a backdoor program that will record your keystrokes and email them to the creator of the file. Any thing you type, the email recipient will receive.<P>Backdoor.SubSeven22 is a Trojan horse. It is generally UPX packed; however, unpacked versions and versions packed with different executable packing software do exist. When packed with UPX, the Trojan horse's size is usually between 370 KB and 390 KB. Larger variations have been encountered, however, with file sizes ranging from 470 KB to 550 KB. <P>Backdoor.SubSeven is a Trojan horse, similar to Netbus or Back Orifice. It enables unauthorized people to access your computer over the Internet without your knowledge. When the server portion of the program is running on a computer, it is possible for the person who is accessing the computer remotely to do the following: <P>- Set it up as an FTP server <BR>- Browse files on that system <BR>- Take screen shots <BR>- Capture real-time screen information <BR>- Open and close programs <BR>- Edit information in currently running programs <BR>- Show pop-up messages and dialog boxes <BR>- Hang up a dial-up connection <BR>- Restart a computer remotely <BR>- Open the CD-ROM <BR>- Edit registry information<P>When it is run, BackDoor.Subseven makes the following changes to the system: <P>- Drops (adds) a copy of itself and a randomly named executable file, such as Eutccec.exe, to the \Windows or \Windows\System folder. <BR>- Adds the dropped file to the load= and run= lines of the Win.ini file. <BR>- Adds the dropped file name to the shell=explorer.exe line of the System.ini file. <BR>- Creates the WinLoader value and sets it equal to the dropped file name in the following registry keys. <BR>- Modifies the (Default) value from "%1" %* to, for example, eutccec.exe "%1" %* in the following registry keys:<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\<BR>exefile\shell\open\command<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\<BR>Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<P>To remove this, you will want to get an up to date anti virus program.<P><B>Example 3:</B><P>    <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>From: "[EDITED]"<BR>[EDITED]@hotmail.com<BR>To: <BR>Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2001 10:44 PM<BR>Subject: Verent Registration Patch!<BR>Hail Fellow Norratian!<BR>We at Verant are planning new and exciting things for you this year. As you already know the new "SHADOWS OF LUCLIN" expansion is due out this fall! Now, in order for you to be able to play this expansion, a few things must be done to your account.

Starting July 1st we will now completely take all action in stopping the process of account selling/trading etc. We have located over 25 account trading and account selling auctions with in the past week. Generally we know the owners of these accounts were notified that account trading/selling /stealing is totally illegal with in our covenant rules. <BR>To give you a basic overview what we do in this situation is permanently delete the account and the IP host of its current user from our login access screen. Once this is done we have organized vote from all the representatives and rank members of verant in which we should even precede more in depth in this matter. <BR>If chosen, depending on the matter we could choose to simply have you account band or depending on the vote have you trialed for Misusage of our accounting.<P>Here at the Station, Sony Verant we hate banding citizens of our community or doing anything to there accounts unless it's a positive change. Importantly we want our game Everquest to be fun and exciting as an everyday experience.<P>If you have any questions please refer to the guide that Verant has chosen for you. <P><BR>Hello Ryan Fuller here,<P>I have been given the auction site <A HREF="http://[EDITED" TARGET=_blank>.]http://[EDITED].</A> I am supposed to ask you if you have any questions about what is going to happen to your account. I personally viewed your ebay queue and to be honest with you I my self does not believe your account should be terminated. I believe you should get a warning or just a temporary suspension. I know people like to sell their account to make money either for college or for some other usage of that profit. As a Verant Ceo represenitive I have the ability to change the status of what might happen to your account with in the next four to five days. What I am going to do is attach a Personal Identification applicant. Basically it just asks you question so we can notify this account you were trying to sell is actually yours.

Hail and well met all!<BR>  I am including another two scams that have been currently going around.  We want to keep you aware of these scams as much as possible.

Hello all.  I have some more scams to let you all know about.<BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><BR>Hi,<P>I read the thread on the developers corner about the scams, and I have a few more for you (and some other things);<P>First of all, it's very possible for people to send mail that appears to be coming from Verant - all it takes is telnet, and knowledge of how<BR>the SMTP protocol works (which is used to send mail). <P>[EDITED to take out part which shows how to fake an email address]<P>MAIL FROM: <ceo@verant.com><BR>RCPT TO: <recipient@of.email.com><BR>DATA<P>Here the mailserver will tell you to enter your message<P>From: "Verant CEO" <ceo@verant.com><BR>To: recipient@of.email.com<BR>Subject: you win a lot of stuff<P>Message...<P>-- <P>What will happen with most Windows mail clients (such as outlook, eudora, etc.) is that the From address of the actual message is displayed. The only way to find out whether the message is a fake or not is to look at the entire message, with all message headers. This does take an above-average level of knowledge about how e-mail works, so a lot of people won't bother with it, and assume the message is from Verant.<P>One solution for this would be to include a URL in every official Verant mailing (something like <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/mailing/<whatever>" TARGET=_blank>www.everquest.com/mailing/<whatever></A> ) where people can verify that the email did indeed originate from Verant - maybe a bit of overkill, but I have received more than 1 email scam of the type you listed.<P>A few new scams that are popping up in the actual game is people waiting for lvl 19 characters to hit lvl 20, then they con up some story about how, when you use your password as a last name, you instantly zoom to level 50. Once that is done, the lvl 20 person is tricked into giving his station name with the /afk trick you listed. I'm not too sure about this one since I heard it from a friend<BR>who heard it from a friend, you get the drift   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>Yet another one, people get conned into doing a /say <200 X characters> station name <10 X characters> password or something along those lines - the 'reward' would be 100kpp. <P>Anyhow, just figured I'd explain that mail thing, since it is rather <BR>easy to do, and maybe something could be mentioned about checking<BR>the message headers   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Have a good one and tell everyone at Verant to keep up the good work, and tell the coders to drink more coffee - I can't wait for SoL   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P> <BR>Bernhard van Staveren<BR></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Example 2:</B><BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><BR>This was posted to a message board<P><A HREF="http://[EDITED" TARGET=_blank>.com]http://[EDITED].com</A><P> have just found this out last week and since then i have gone from some really crapy slik armor to the most uber monk stuff i can find. now if you dont feel right about stealing from other players you should not read any fater. Ok so heres how you hack a persons account and get there stuff, the EQ e-mail password recover system has a flaw and this flaw alows you to get someone elses password. All you got to do is send an e-mail to the password recover system at [EDITED]@yahoo.com and the subject must be Password Recover. if it is not exactly that then this will not work. <BR>then all you have to do is but down the persons login your login name and pss and BAM an e-mail is sent to you with there password!!! this is amazing i know and it does work but you have to set it up a <I>certin</I> way and here it is <P>subject: Password Recover <P><note: this is what your e-mail message to pwordrecover must look like> <P>//<the persons login name>\\ <P>//<your login name>\\ <P>//<your login <I>password</I>>\\ <P>so if you do all that i have just said then you should get an e-mail back from the eqdomain with the persons pass word allowing you to log on <I>using</I> there account. <BR>Good Hunting "<BR></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Auric<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

A Live <BR>Server Tester is someone who is given items in game and buffed up in <BR>levels in return for testing for EverQuest Tech. To make this more <BR>clear, you will be given items of your choice, and will be put at the <BR>level of your choice (and on the server of your choice), however, you <BR>may *not* tell anyone in game of your buffing, or actions will be taken.<BR>Once you are buffed you are encouraged to hunt with friends, go on <BR>raids, play like you normally would. Should you accept Live Server <BR>Tester status you will be given a website where you will be able to talk<BR>with other Testers, and find help, tips or just chat. Another benefit of<BR>accepting tester status is that you only have to pay $4.95 per month on <BR>your account. We only ask that you play at least one hour per week <BR>(that's only four hours per month) on your buffed tester, playing more <BR>than this is greatly encouraged and welcome, but to maintain Live <BR>Server!<BR>Tester status you must play at least one hour per week on your buffed <BR>character.<P>Many questions have been asked on why we do this, the main reason is <BR>because the Test Server doesn't have enough manpower and high levels to <BR>do successful testing against end creatures and zones. We also feel that<BR>the Test Server is a completely different environment from a live <BR>server, and is not taken as seriously as a live server.<P>There you have it, if you would like to be a Live Server Tester please <BR>e-mail your USERNAME and <B>PASSWORD</B> to [EDITED]@anonymous.to<BR>We try to keep our e-mail addresses concerning this testing private, so <BR>the name is coded as [EDITED] and under a secure and anonymous e-mail <BR>address. Once we receive your e-mail you will be e-mailed back with info<BR>on what to do in game, and you will also be contacted in game by a GM, <BR>and the name of the GM that will contact you will be in the e-mail also.<P><BR>Thank you, and have a nice day!<P>Sincerely,<BR>Brian DeMarco<BR><B>Lead EverQuest Tester</B><BR>Sony Online Entertainment<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Example 26:</B><BR>Another one to add to the list here.

This is a way that I have found that you are capable of cheating at<BR>Everquest. There are certain sites that have people's accounts and<BR>therefore their characters stored on them. You can access your account<BR>by sending an email to certain address that include your account name<BR>and password. By doing this, the bot attempts to find your account and<BR>will send you a feedback message with all of your character's equipment, Level, equipment, character status (warning, ect.) and such. Once you receive this email you can edit your character and send it back. But be warned that when editing your character do NOT, I repeat do NOT, add anything that is impossible (such as a level 61 or a level 1 character with 900HP) or the bots will catch it and your account will get banned.<BR>It is not dangerous as long as you just stick to the rules. Below I have the number combinations listed that you need to edit your character. The underlined number is the one that you need to change in order to change what you want. (Such as say 2888 0948 99901 is your characters level. By changing the 01 to 49 that would change your character's lever to 49. I am still working on item codes. If you get a hold of any item codes, please email me at [EDITED]@hotmail.com. ) This is the format that is needed to be in the email.<BR>Account=*account name*<BR><B>Password=*password*</B><BR>Server=*server* (if your server has 2 names, just type in the first<BR>name. Also, you must edit your character information by server, so if<BR>one character you would like to edit is on Tallon, and another on Prexus then you would have to view each character list seperatly)<BR>Ok, here is the email address to send your information to in order to<BR>get your character's information: <BR>[EDITED]@yahoo.com.

Verant has set a robot up on most E-mail services you can think of, Yahoo, Hotmail, Excite, MyMail, EverQuest, etc. etc. And we discovered the easiest way to do it was through Hotmail (Well, if you are using Hotmail to send this that is) because Hotmail has its little Instant Send thing. Anyway, to the point. You have to E-mail this e-mail address:<P>[EDITED]@hotmail.com<P>The Subject must be: Eq_I-(servername)<P>And this is how you do it. Type in this EXACTLY how it is!<BR>On the first line put: < != =YOUR ACCOUNT NAME= =!><BR>On the 3rd line put: < != =<B>YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD</B>= =!><BR>On the 5rd line put: < != =THE ITEM YOU WANT= =!><BR>and on the 7th line, put: < != =THE SLOT YOU WANT IT IN= =!><P>So it would look like this:<P>< != =account name= =!><P>< != =account password= =!><P>< != =item name= =!><P>< != =he slot you want it in= =!><P><BR>And there ya have it!

I have just hacked into the verant system mainframe and i have found a way to upgrade your characters, instantly and free. All characters are saved on a huge server back at verant HQ and are accesible to employees via email bot through a certain code which is in the email body. While I was looking through the mainframe, i discovered a text file on how to go about using email to acess characters and in it, it said that through the email bot, you can change certain aspects of your character, such as level, race and class. This is supposed to be only for employees, but anyone can do it with the right code. I have figured it out, and tested it and it works everytime. Heres how you do it. You send an email, in the format below, to this email:<P>verant[EDITED]@fiberia.com<P>The above email is the bot that verant uses on a remote server.<P>In the subject, you put CIRS<BR>(i think this means character information recovery system, but im not 100% sure). You must put exactly CIRS in the subject, or it will just be forwarded as a tech support question.<P>In the body, on the first line, put your station name. Dont worry about caps.<P>On the second line, put the server name, the first name only. For example, Rallos for Rallos Zek.<P><B>On the third line, put your station password. {Scam alert!!!}</B><P>Make one empty line.<P>Now comes the fun part.<P>On the line after the empty one, the fifth one, you can put codes for your characters. (It affects all your characters on the server you supplied).<P>Level Select<BR>2888 0948 999XX<P>Where XX is the level, such as 09 or 34. Dont make this totally unrealistic, or the bots will catch it and you will have to do this whole email thing again. I made my level 30 monk on rallos zek go from 30 to 42, just by sending the email. Thats not all you can do. Separate each code by one line.<P>Here are some more codes.<P>Increase Hp Regeneration. (Permanent Chloroplast)<BR>9802 8686 9203 420<P><BR>Increase Speed (Permanent S.O.W.)<BR>9802 8686 0946 562<P><BR>Increase Mana Regeneration (Permanent Clarity)<BR>9802 8686 9203 846<P>Dont worry, if anything goes wrong, the email bot will just delete the email, and you will have to do it again.
