		<h2>
			29.23
			Appendix D - Shaman Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<I>Alchemy Mastery</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chance of failure when using the alchemy skill. The first skill level reduces the failure chance by 10%, the second skill level raises the reduction to 25% and the third skill level raises the reduction to 50%. <BR><BR><I>Cannibalization</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Priest Archetype ability Mental Clarity) - Gives the Shaman the power to cast a much improved version of the Cannibalize spell line. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 69 seconds (about three seconds of game time). <BR><BR><I>Mass Group Buff</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Shaman the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Pet Discipline</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows the Shaman to better control his pet. The command "/pet hold" will prevent the pet from attacking any foe, even if that foe attacks the pet or its master. The pet will remain passive until given another command. <BR><BR><I>Quick Buff</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time for beneficial buff spells with a duration. Some spells may be specifically excluded from benefiting by this ability. The first skill level reduces casting times on buff spells by 10%, the second skill level makes the reduction 25% and the third makes the reduction 50%. <BR><BR><I>Rabid Bear</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Shaman the power to transform into a bear. The Rabid Bear form boosts all of the Shaman's combat abilities. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 120 minutes (forty hours of game time). <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery</I>: (1 skill level - cost 8 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Priest Archetype ability Spell Casting Reinforcement) - This ability raises the increased duration granted by Spell Casting Reinforcement to 50%. <BR><BR>
