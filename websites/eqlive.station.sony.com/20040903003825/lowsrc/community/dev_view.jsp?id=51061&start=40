<h1>Caster balance update</h1>
	Most of you probably remember the melee balancing changes we made last year.  We'll I have some information for you from the fellow that spearheaded that project, and is leading the caster balancing work.<P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Caster Balance<P>It's been clear for awhile now that priests and casters haven't been as well balanced as we'd all like them to be.  Balance is a delicate issue and any major changes to overall class power are always researched, debated, and taken slowly.  There are some really big improvements in the works now for helping out with that balance, and we expect those to be on the Test server in the near future.  These changes won't all come in one huge patch, but will show up a bit at a time until casting classes are right where they should be in relative power.<P>We are taking the needs and issues of casters seriously, and we think you'll be very happy with the results you see after we finish our caster balance effort.  We hope you'll be patient just a bit longer, while we take the time to get everything implemented, balanced, and tested.<P><BR>Ancient Spells<P>One specific area we are addressing for casting classes revolves around how much improvement they get from raiding and acquiring high-level items.  When a melee class begins to acquire items from the hardest monsters, they experience a tremendous growth in power.  A melee character sporting Vulak weapons and Temple of Veeshan loot is incredibly more powerful than player who only owns average quality items.  Casting classes don't achieve nearly the same amount of increased power from raid items, and rapidly fall behind melees in relative power when they start raiding.  It doesn't make sense for a wizard who has helped in slaying hundreds of dragons to be using the same spells as someone who has yet to take part in raid encounters.<P>To address this problem, we've introduced the new "Ancient" category of spells recently.  Ancient spells are rare, high-quality spells that can only be obtained from the most powerful monsters.  These spells are improved versions of spells already available to each casting class.  They won't give casters any brand-new, or out-of-class abilities, but are intended to make the casters better at what they already do.  Much like a warrior improves himself by getting a better sword from a dragon, a wizard can now acquire more efficient spells in the same way.<P>As you might expect, Ancient spells are going to be rare and take a certain amount of effort to obtain.  We don't expect many casters to ever get all the Ancient spells for their class.  This is a change from the traditional approach we've had to spells, which has allowed every caster to feel entitled to get every one of their spells.  We'll continue to make core spells available to casting classes off of vendors, or as relatively frequent drops off of monsters, but we want to be clear that Ancient spells are rare and powerful items of treasure, and we intend them to be very hard to get.<P>Only the first set of Ancient spells have been added to the game.  In the coming weeks, we'll continue to add more Ancient spells to the game and expand the selection for casters and priests.  It takes some time to get the spells balanced, tested, and placed on monsters - so expect to see them coming in a few sets at a time.<P>One last thing to note about Ancient spells- the power of these spells will vary depending on what monster drops them.  You can expect Vulak A'err to have more powerful Ancient spells than you might find on Trakanon, for instance.  <P>Rich Waters<BR>Lead Designer, Systems<BR>Sony Online Entertainment<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>Thanks for the update, Rich.<P>Alan<BR>

Do bards get anything similar to this? It seems like they would have the same issues.</B><P><BR>Rich sent me this in reply to your questions:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>During this stage of the rebalance, we're looking at issues specific to pure caster classes (cleric, shaman, druid, necromancer, wizard, mage, enchanter).  Bards certainly also need some improvements, and that's going to receive attention after we finish with the casters.  Bards are a very unique and interesting class, and they differ so much from the rest of the classes that they need to be addressed individually.<P>After we finish with casters and then bards, we'll take an overview look at how everything is stacking up.  The melee changes were very successful, and we have high hopes for this upcoming round of changes as well.  If we find that any particular class or class archetype needs some attention at that point, they'll definitely get it.<P>Rich<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>Thanks again Rich.<P>It's a big project.  There are a lot of details to look at and compare.  And we want to get it right.  So please be patient.  I have every confidence that Rich and the team will nail this down just as they did with the melee classes.<P>Alan<BR>

suleain wrote:<P><B>Hello and thank you for letting the casters know you are looking into things.<P>I do have a favor to ask however.  On various sites, there has been a lot of question and I will admit flaming that these fixes seem to be aimed that the 55-60 crowd.  While it is only logical that if people continue to play their characters the majority of the players will be in this group.  There are people who enjoy playing the levels below this.  I for one have repeatedly played characters up and then started a new one.<P>I would just like to have an answer saying that yes we are looking at ALL levels of play and balance issues.  <P>Thank you for your time.</B><P>We're looking at the whole thing, just as we did with melee.<P>The conclusion might be that only changes are needed post 50.  It might not.  But we're not neglecting any stage of the life of the caster.<P><BR>vallon_sk wrote:<P><B>Clerics, shaman and druids are Pure Casters?? <BR>I've been under the impression since I started in '99, that wiz, mage, ench, and necro's are the only Pure Casters-as they have no other abilities but their magic (with out going into huge discussion that necro can 'tank/melee" with their pet-to a degree). And if a shaman is a Pure Caster, than where do the beastlords fall? And why not add Shadowknight/pally to the list.<BR>Just curious.<BR>Thanks.</B><P>Let's nail down some terminology, for everyone's sake.  I'll edit Rich to make sure he follows the same terminology.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pure Caster means any non-hybrid, non-melee (Necromancer, Magician, Enchanter, Wizard, Cleric, Druid and Shaman).<P>Int Caster are Necromancers, Magicians, Enchanters and Wizards.<P>Wis Casters (or Priests) are Clerics, Druids and Shamans.<P>Hybrids are Bards (though they will probably have to be considered separately for most things), Rangers, Paladins, Shadowknights and Beastlords.<P>Melee are Monks, Rogues and Warriors.<P><BR>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Just wanted to express my surprise and joy that you corrected the mana cost of Glamour of Kintaz for us "Chanter" types  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> It just cost too much mana to use that spell before in places we needed it like the King Room in Seb and Jugs. That definetely corrected the usage problem between Dazzle and Kintaz we had before this, Hats off Gents! Well done!<P>Ldar</B><P>You'll probably see a lot of changes like that.  Some of them will trickle in and some will come in bigger chunks.<P>Alan<BR>
