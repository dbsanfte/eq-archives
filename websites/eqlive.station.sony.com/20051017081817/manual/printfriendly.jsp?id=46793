			14.5
			Guards
		</h2>
	
	Guards immediately kill unfriendly
  creatures if they come too close. This can be good for you (if, for example,
  some creature is about to beat you to a pulp), and bad for you (if a guard
  kills a monster you won't get experience for it nor will you be able to loot
  the corpse). So it's a good idea to know where the local guards are.
