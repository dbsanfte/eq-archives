	<h2>Stratics Launches New EQ II Site</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	07/22/2002<br>
	Our good friends over at Stratics informed us that they just launched their new EQ II site. 
<P>Greetings! 
<P>We are proud to present the grand opening of the newest Stratics web site, <A href="http://eq2.stratics.com/" target=_blank>EverQuest II Stratics</A>! This new web site will contain news and information for this highly anticipated new title. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is here that time begins. Yes, it is true; there have been other events of far greater significance. The sky itself has rained down upon us! Temples lie in ruins. Empires have crumbled, continents lost. These great events and many more, both terrible and wondrous, have taken place since last we spoke and I am sure there are many more of equal import on the horizon. But, it is here that time begins. It is here that hope begins. It is here that the future of Qeynos, nay, the future of Norrath, will be written. I pray it is not scribed in blood." 
<P>-Antonius Bayle IV, Lord of the Great City of Qeynos</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The game is expected to offer a wide variety of exciting new changes. Here is a quote directly from Verant's overview of the new title: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>EverQuest II returns to the rich and culturally diverse world of Norrath. Users will be able to select from a wide variety of both new and old races, as well as an exciting new class system when creating their character. Significant improvements to combat, spell and quest mechanics promise to immerse players even more so than the original. In addition to the new mechanics, users will be able to own real estate, participate in and conduct gladiatorial and theatrical events, as well as have the ability to command horses, ships and other such modes of transport. At release, players will be able to equip thousands of items and encounter hundreds of unique creatures, all within a world so large that it literally eclipses the original Norrath in size.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Please be sure to visit our <A href="http://eq2.stratics.com/" _parent?>new site</A> to learn all about <A href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/" _blank?>EverQuest II</A>. Stop by the forums and discuss the development of the game with other EverQuest and EverQuest II players. If you have any questions about this new site, please feel free to <A href="mailto:eq2admin@stratics.com?subject=EverQuest" Feedback II>contact us</A>! We'd love to hear from you! </P>
