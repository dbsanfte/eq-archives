			29.19
			Appendix D - Paladin Class Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<I>2 Hand Bash</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows the Paladin to use his Bash skill while wielding any two-handed weapon. <BR><BR><I>Act of Valor</I>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This ability allows the Paladin to sacrifice his life in order to heal another. The Paladin can use this ability to transfer all of his remaining hit points to a member of his group. This transfer causes the Paladin to die. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Body and Mind Rejuvenation</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of both Melee Archetype abilities Natural Healing and Mental Clarity) - This ability gives the Paladin one additional skill level of both Mental Clarity and Improved Natural Healing. <BR><BR><I>Divine Stun</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Paladin the power to use spells with a stun component to affect NPCs of levels up to 60th. Those spells will still grant the NPC a saving throw and its normal resistances, it only raises the level limitation for stun spells to 60. <BR><BR><I>Double Riposte</I>: (3 skill levels) - This ability gives the Paladin a chance for a double riposte any time he successfully ripostes. The first skill level gives the Paladin a 15% chance for a Double Riposte, the second skill level raises that chance to 30% and the third skill level makes the chance 50%. <BR><BR><I>Fearless</I>: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Melee Archetype ability Fear Resistance) - This ability makes the Paladin permanently immune to fear effects. <BR><BR><I>Holy Steed</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability allows the Paladin to summon the ultimate steed. <BR><BR><I>Improved Lay of Hands</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Paladin the power to heal completely with his Lay on Hands power. <BR><BR><I>Mass Group Buff</I>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability gives the Paladin the power to make his next group buff spell into an area of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><I>Physical Enhancement</I>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives the Paladin one additional skill level in their Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability abilities. <BR><BR><I>Slay Undead</I>: (3 skill levels - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Melee Archetype ability Combat Fury) - This ability turns the Paladin's critical hits into massive damage to undead. <BR><BR>
