<h1>6 years of EverQuest</h1>
	<P>Not many things are part of our lives for as many as 6
  years.&nbsp; We are in High School for
  4 years, most of us anyway.&nbsp;
  College is also 4 years.&nbsp;
  Few television shows are a part of our lives for 6 years.&nbsp; EverQuest has changed gaming and
  revolutionized virtual worlds. </P>  <P>PC games do not usually have this kind of following, for
  this many years.&nbsp; Granted,
  computer games have not been around as long as other mediums, but in that
  short time, few games have enjoyed this longevity with this measure of
  success.&nbsp; 9 expansions have been
  added to EverQuest and I can think of no other game that has added that much
  content to an already expansive world, rich and alive with content and
  adventure.&nbsp; No game has held my
  interest for nearly as long as EverQuest and it may be that none will; only
  time will tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P>EverQuest has provided us with thousands of hours of
  entertainment and excitement.&nbsp; It
  has been here for us to make new friends and slay dragons with old ones.&nbsp; For less than the price of a movie and
  popcorn each month, we have enjoyed hunting treasure, bringing villains to
  justice and the camaraderie of shared goals.&nbsp; EverQuest brought many of our
  fantasies to life and allows us to live the life of a hero or a villain.&nbsp; This world we created 6 years ago has
  become a backdrop for your stories and your adventures.&nbsp; </P>  <P>6 years may be old for most games but not EverQuest.&nbsp; This game and this world are still
  young.&nbsp; While many of our team has
  changed over these years, and many of our friends have come and gone,
  EverQuest is and will still be here.&nbsp;
  Norrath will remain for years to come to allow you to experience your
  own fantasy story.&nbsp; We are proud
  to have shared these 6 years with you, our EQ community, and while at times
  it has been a tumultuous ride, one thing is certain, we all love this
  game.&nbsp; </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Brenlo the EverQuest Fan</P>
