			8
			Manipulating Items
		</h1>
	
	The world of Norrath is an
  abundant world full of items you can pick up, buy, sell, use or transform.
  When your character is &quot;born&quot; he already has several items - a
  basic weapon, some food and water, and a scroll or two (items vary slightly,
  depending on your class and race). <BR><BR>Before long, you'll acquire some valuables. Eventually, you'll want to buy
  containers to store your items, or put items in a bank for safekeeping. <BR><BR>Some items on your person can't be dropped, sold or traded (such as your
  starting food and weapon). To remove these items from inventory, you must
  either store them in a bank or destroy them.

	
		<h2>
			8.1
			Viewing Your Inventory
		</h2>
	
	Inventory management is an
  indispensable skill. If you're a pack rat you'll constantly need to reassess what
  you're carrying and figure out what to do with the items you've accumulated. <BR><BR>You can view your inventory by clicking on the Inventory Icon. <BR><BR><EM>You can also access your inventory by hitting <STRONG>i</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>The detailed view of your inventory is divided into several sections. You can
  place specific items on different parts of your body - hands, fingers, feet,
  etc. <BR><BR>Eight general inventory slots show all items in your possession that aren't
  coins, armor or weapons you're holding (stored weapons do show up, however).
  Use these slots to store items that you aren't wearing, as well as coins and
  weapons that aren't in use. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Backpacks don't fit into your characters &quot;back&quot; inventory
  slot. They only fit into general inventory slots.</EM> <BR><BR>For certain items, you can stack more than one of that item in a single slot.
  The small number in the corner of the slot indicates how many items of that
  type are stacked. A stack can never contain more than 20 items. <BR><BR>The coin window shows how many platinum, gold, silver and copper coins you
  have (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=moneymatters">Money
  Matters</A> for details). Coins can be stacked, and there's no limit to how
  many you can carry. If you're trading with another player or
  depositing/withdrawing funds at a bank, click on a coin slot to display a
  slider. Use the slider to control how many coins you're fishing out of your
  coin purse. You can also type the number of coins you wish to pick up into
  the box provided.

	
		<h2>
			8.2
			Holding and Wearing Items
		</h2>
	
	Items stored in a general inventory
  slot are not in use. If you want to hold a weapon or wear a new item of armor
  or clothing, you've got to move it to the right location slot: <BR><BR>* Click on an item in a general inventory slot.<BR>* Once the item is floating on your cursor, click on an appropriate location
  slot.<BR><BR>Use this same click-and-drop method to take off a wearable item or store a
  weapon.

	
		<h2>
			8.3
			Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items
		</h2>
	
	You can pick up items you
  find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if
  the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped,
  traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the
  item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form
  of a small, brown bag. <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to give them the item (the person
  receiving your gift will also have to click Trade to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>.<BR><EM>Note: Once you destroy an item, it is gone. Make sure you really want to
  destroy the item (and that you have the correct item) before clicking
  Destroy.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>To pick up an item from the ground:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or
  as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot .

	
		<h2>
			8.4
			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to
  EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and
  sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and
  drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The
  following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player,
  see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A>. <BR><BR><EM>To buy/sell an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<EM>Note: you will have to be relatively
  close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only
  receive the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the
  merchant window</EM>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the
  Control key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button. To buy
  or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG>  or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button.

	
		<h2>
			8.5
			Giving/Trading Items
		</h2>
	
	You sometimes find that you
  need (or don't want) a particular item. You can sell or buy from other
  players. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves
  through the Trade Window. <BR><BR>No transaction is final until both players agree to it. <BR><BR><EM>To give away/trade/sell an item to another player:</EM> <BR><BR>* Open your Inventory screen (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and select an item or amount
  of coins (this should 'float' the item on your cursor).<BR>* Click on the character you wish to trade with.<BR>* This will open the Trade Window.<BR><BR>The trade window has two sections, one for the items and/or coin that you are
  trading out and one for the items and/or coin that the other character wishes
  to trade. At this point you may add or remove items or coins from this window
  as you see fit. <BR><BR><EM>Note: The Trade Window will close if you move too far from the other
  person.</EM> <BR><BR>Both players must click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the action. If either player
  puts another item into the trade window after one player clicks Trade, he/she
  will have to click the button again. <BR><BR><EM>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window
  are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect
  them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal
  as it is.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming
  items!</STRONG> If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra
  items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or
  obtain a container (such as a backpack). <BR><BR><EM>Note: Items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other
  Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items,
  and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing
  quests that give items as rewards.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			8.6
			Inspecting Another Player's Inventory
		</h2>
	
	To see if other players have
  something you might want to trade for, click on their characters. This
  targets them and, if you're standing close enough to them, opens their
  Inventory window. It is often considered polite to ask permission before
  doing such an inspection. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A> to learn how to trade.

	
		<h2>
			8.8
			Item Flags
		</h2>
	
	When you inspect an item
  (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags
  printed right below the name of the item: <BR><BR><STRONG>Magic Item</STRONG>: This means that the item is imbued with magic. If this
  item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures that can only
  be harmed by magic. <BR><BR><STRONG>Lore</STRONG>: This means that you may only have one of these items in your
  possession at any one time. If you attempt to acquire another, you will not
  be able to pick the item up. This will check your bank account. <BR><BR><STRONG>NoDrop</STRONG>: This means that the item cannot be traded to another player
  nor sold to a merchant. However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is
  necessary for many quests. <BR><BR><STRONG>No Rent</STRONG>: A no rent item will disappear from your inventory 30 minutes
  after logging out. <BR><BR><STRONG>Artifact</STRONG>: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you
  play, and that there will never be another one given out. Artifacts are
  usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game
  regularly. Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see
  one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great
  Power. <BR><BR><STRONG>Item Size</STRONG>: The size of any item will be listed (and for containers it
  will show what sized items it will hold). This should make organizing your
  inventory a little easier. <BR><BR><STRONG>A Deity's Name</STRONG>: If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means
  that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects. <BR><BR><STRONG>Weight Reduction</STRONG>: If a percentage for weight reduction is listed on a
  container, that container will reduce the weight of any item placed into it
  by that percentage while it is in the container.

	
		<h2>
			8.9
			Auctioning Items
		</h2>
	
	As you advance in the game, you'll
  find that you sometimes need to get rid of valuable items. You may only need
  an item for a little while, perhaps to accomplish a quest. You might have
  just upgraded your armor and weapons, or maybe you've grown tired of your
  jewelry-making kit. Or, you could need a spell ingredient yourself - the old
  adage &quot;one man's trash is another man's treasure&quot; holds true in
  EverQuest as well. <BR><BR>Auctioning allows you to send out an area-wide message that all players in
  your playing zone can hear. Unlike &quot;/shout&quot; (which is reserved for
  critical situations), &quot;/auction&quot; is only used for buying and
  selling items. The preferred usage is &quot;WTB&quot; (want to buy) or
  &quot;WTS&quot; (want to sell), followed by a description of the item. <BR><BR>To send a message to the auction chat channel, just type /auction [text].

	
		<h2>
			8.10
			Containers and Banks
		</h2>
	
	You've only got eight general
  inventory slots, several of which are nearly always occupied by food and
  drink. Some items can be stacked on top of one another in a single slot, such
  as fish, bread and arrows. Other items take up an entire slot. All add weight
  to your character. If you don't want to continually sacrifice one item for
  another, try purchasing a container or finding a bank. <BR><BR><STRONG>Containers</STRONG> <BR><BR>Purchase backpacks, bags and other containers to increase your carrying
  capacity. By placing items inside a container, you can fit multiple
  possessions into a single slot. To open a container, right-click on it. <BR><BR>Certain containers also serve as catalysts for creating items - for instance,
  you need a bowl to make bread, and a sewing kit to stitch things together. <BR><BR><STRONG>Banks</STRONG> <BR><BR>Banks will gladly store coins for you, and they're also a great way to store
  inventory items. Banks in Norrath are well connected - even if you travel
  abroad, any banker can instantly conjure up your items. You've got eight bank
  inventory slots at your disposal. If you go to another bank, you don't get
  additional slots. <BR><BR><EM>To put an item in the bank:</EM> <BR><BR>* Find a bank and right-click on the banker. Eight bank inventory slots
  appear for you to use.<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory (it &quot;floats&quot; on your cursor).<BR>* Click on a bank inventory slot. <BR><BR>To withdraw an item from a bank, reverse the steps above. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Bank inventory slots work the same way as your character's general
  inventory slots. This means that you can use containers in the bank to
  increase your storage capacity.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			8.11
			Eating and Drinking
		</h2>
	
	Bread, milk and water are
  staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items,
  along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with
  20 skins of milk and 20 loaves of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at
  the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time). <BR><BR>When you're running low on either item, your text display shows &quot;You are
  low on food&quot; or &quot;You are low on drink&quot;. If you don't find food
  or drink soon you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health
  and stamina suffer. <BR><BR>Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and
  other items (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=buying">Buying/Selling
  Items</A>). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and
  other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they
  temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement
  skills and agility. Such items must be manually consumed. <BR><BR><EM>To eat/drink an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* View your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Right-click on the item you wish to consume.<BR><BR>Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used
  as needed. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item
  will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it.
