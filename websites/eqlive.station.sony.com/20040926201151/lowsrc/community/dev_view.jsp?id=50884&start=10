<h1>Ask Brad 9/27/01</h1>
	<B>Ask Brad 9/27/01 </B><P>------<P>Here is a question for you.<P>Who did the sunsets in EQ?<P>I mean, wow.  =)<P>-Sir_Yakk<P><B>The sky in EverQuest is actually a descendant of the sky used in our earlier game, Tanarus and was primarily coded by Shawn Baird.  Then after it was put into EverQuest, John Buckley (graphics programmer) and Rosie Cosgrove (art lead) tweaked it a bit more.  Then Scott McDaniel (art lead) and others added some additional skies (the desert sky, the Plane of Fear sky, etc.)  It mostly involves taking a sky bitmap and then algorithmically modifying the colors and tints depending on the time of day to make it look like morning, noon, or night.<P>And I agree, wow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></B><P>-----<P>Why can't character models be placed in the zone files for every zone rather than the global files?  Might require a huge download but maybe you could just upload an exe that patches the extra data to every file or something.<P>-Itchy_Drawers<P><B>The idea behind having global and local zone character model files is to keep the memory footprint down (as well as load times, but this is a secondary concern).  In other words, it makes sense to not load a bunch of character models that will never show up in the zone you're in.  <P>The global file exists for the much smaller subset of character models that could potentially be displayed in all zones (this would include all the player races and genders, pets, etc.).  We purposely try to keep this file small, and we also have limits as to how many NPC models should be present in a zone specific file in order to keep memory requirements reasonable.  That said, because min specs rise over time and RAM becomes cheaper, we've slowly but surely added to the global file and will most likely continue to do so in the future. </B><P>------<P>Some questions about the Luclin engine:<P>1.)	Will the weather effects be improved in the game? Will we have wind, swaying wind, snow etc? Also, will weather be more gradual and not just 'pop' in and out like it does now?<P><B>We don't have specific plans to modify the weather by the Shadows of Luclin release, no.  I'd love to see it enhanced later though, perhaps combined with a newer, more advanced particle engine (would allow us to do cool thinks like lightning bolts and such). </B><P>2.)Are spell effects going to be improved? Will they look better and will we see any updates to the spell icons?<P><B>Same as above - not specifically for Luclin no, but definitely on our long-term list of cool things to do. </B><P>3.)Will the UI be usable in full screen mode now? Currently I cannot read a book or open my spell book from fullscreen.<P>-Garr123<P><B>Much more of the UI will work in full screen mode, and it will also be more flexible and configurable, and it should also over time support other character/language sets.  This is an ongoing project, though, that you'll see patched in over time. </B><P>-------<P>Whose picture is on the book in the library on the second floor of Tower of Frozen Shadows? The book is lying open on the first circular desk, and when you get near it you get a warning to stay out. Come on, who is it?????<P>Is it YOU?  =)<P>-Az<P><B>Nope, not me.  That's Ronnie Ashlock, the artist who I believe created that object. </B><P>------<P>I posted this on Voodoo Extreme but you haven't done an Ask Brad there in awhile so I'll post it here =)<P>Okay, way back in the hay day of computer gaming, there was one computer that really stood apart from the rest of the "Game boxes" out there, the Commodore 64.<P><B>For me it was the superior Atari 8bit line of machines, but I don't want to re-start that old debate  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> </B><P>What made the Commodore so much better than the rest in my opinion?  The ability of users to make games, and share them in magazines like "Computer Gazzette" and "Compute!".<P><B>Yes, I remember typing in huge, long strings of machine code using BASIC DATA statements - was fun, but I'd always make lots of typos  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/frown.gif"> </B><P>Move ahead a few years and you get the Diku Mud phase.  What made a Diku mud like Duris so wonderful?  The overwhelming vastness of it all really =)  Unlimited zones, zones created just for one use some times.  I know when I was a God (Same as a GM, only roleplayed better ;-))  I would often create a zone, and drag a party into it, then remove the zone when I was finished with it.<P><B>Duris was awesome, as was Sojourn (which I preferred because it wasn't PvP).  </B><P>Now, looking forward, do you ever intend to open up the game to outside designers?  Create a method for out side folks to create dungeons that would be submitted to you.<P>I mean, really, most of your new dungeons don't have new character models, or if new one's were needed you could have someone develop a few in house.<P>Yay, look, Frogloks, Rats, Spiders, Bats... etc... etc...<P>I guess the reason I ask is that our server is swamped with people, and the ability to add a new level 55-60 type dungeon every two months would really heighten the game experience and make the world seem more vast than the tiny crowded place we all dwell in today.<P>140 people in TOV per night should say *something*.<P>~Lythander~<P><B>As difficult and careful the gods of those MUDs had to be when accepting and then balancing player submitted zones, it would be even harder and more time consuming for us.  So much so, in fact, that it's simply more efficient to hire artists and game designers and have them make our zones in-house.<P>That said, I think eventually as both tools and the games themselves improve and expand, this sort of thing might very well be doable.  I think upcoming games like Neverwinter Nights, while not truly MMOGs, will still help significantly in getting the industry and technology to the point where user generated content is a reality. </B><P>-----<P>Question:  For SOL, Would it be better for me to upgrade (see the following):<P>My 128 RD-RAM to 256 RD-RAM<BR>Or<BR>My Geforce2 32meg(RD)4xAGP to Geforce3(yada,yada)<BR>Or<BR>My PIII 866 to PIII 1.0?<P>-Glinlor<P><B>Well, you've got a pretty nice machine there already, and it's definitely above min spec.  If you still plan on upgrading, though, I'd think the additional RAM would help the most - more RAM means less swapping and better load times.  After that, more CPU is always good.  As for a Geforce 3, we're not doing much that would give it a significant advantage over a Geforce 2. </B><P>-------<P>Dear Brad,<P>I am just curious about something about SoL.  I heard that it won't be like Velious in the sense that it won't take 2985798237598237598237589237598 people to fight in a zone.  I, like so many other people, am not in an "uber" guild.  I am sick and tired of not being able to do jack in most of Velious because I'm not in one.  I don't think just because someone is in a great guild that only they should get the good items.  Am I correct in thinking that SoL will be more toward a group or two?  I really hope so.  <P>Thanks,<P>-Leodinus<P><B>You're correct - the majority of the content will be geared more for a group or two.  But that's not to say there won't be some raid content, and please also remember that loot from raid level encounters will almost always be better than loot from less difficult encounters.  Keep in mind that it's out desire that EverQuest ultimately appeal to all sorts of gamers, from the most causal all the way to the most "uber", and everyone in-between. </B><P>--------<P>I have a question regarding the changes with SoL and armor.  They will be changed to attach to the players rather than be new skins on the model, correct?<P><B>Both, actually.  Some items will change the skins, and some will change both the skins and the character's geometry.  Another neat feature is that when we tint these different skins and other textures, it won't necessarily change the color of the texture underneath - in other words, the new character models also support texture layering. </B><P>Will people who choose to view the old models for chars see armor added onto the model? Or just the new models?<P><B>Just the new models - the old models were not created to take advantage of this new technology. </B><P>Also, will armor be visible on some illusions, like skeletons?<P>-Tenon-Akon<P><B>Many of the pets/illusions are being re-done, but we don't plan on having extensive armor choices for them right away.  That said, it does put us in a much better position to add them later. </B><P>-------<P>I have Kunark, Velious and plan to get Luclin. My first question is, will I be able to see the revamped character models in old zones? Such as Gfay, BB, WC, etc, etc, or will they only be visible on the moon?<P><B>Yes, if you purchase Luclin you'll be able to see the new character models in ALL zones. </B><P>Also, if I *don't* purchase SoL, will I be able to see the Vah Shir running around?<P><B>Yes, you'll still be able to see a Vah Shir. </B><P>And will I be able to use any of the new items?<P><B>Yes. </B><P>And will I see new character textures, or will they all be old looking, and the Vah Shir will look revamped?<P><B>Yes, if you don't upgrade to Luclin you'll see the Vah Shir but not the other new character models, nor their new textures and geometry. </B><P>This is all kinda confusing and not very well written probably; oh well, hope you can understand what I'm saying.<P>-MM-KA-SZ<P><B>No worries - the whole character model visibility issue is definitely a little confusing, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify even further. </B><P>--------<P>Hello,<P>I have a question:  why do you make all green mobs aggro when you enter dungeons?  I get attacked by very deep greens in areas like Paw, Sol A, Runnyeye, Dalnir, and Cazic-Thule? <P>Is it possible that you will make the mobs know when they can and can't be beat? It is embarrassing for a level 50 caster to need assistance in a zone that could be easily soloed if the mobs didn't all aggro. <P>I know this would be hard to change that fast but is it possible that the lower level mobs won't be able to bash a high level caster every time? This is probably to prevent farming in mid-level zones but it would make more sense if a monster didn't attack something that could kill it in one blow. It is unfair to the classes that do not melee or have no pets. <P>-SupasexayDr00dman<P><B>There are really two reasons that green mobs still attack characters in most dungeons.  <P>First, from an immersive standpoint, it doesn't make sense that an enemy could just cruise into a dungeon unimpeded.  The mobs in a sense are attacking you as a group, in hope that they'll force you to flee or even kill you, even though they'll probably die themselves.<P>And from a game balance stand point, since there are many zones with green 'yard trash' but challenging 'boss' mobs, we don't really want players just waltzing through a dungeon to their target.  There still needs to be at least some risk associated with doing so.<P>All in all, when this does happen, it probably (but not always) means that the level range differential in the zone is too great.  And in 20/20 game design hindsight, this should typically be avoided - it's generally better that dungeons have a smaller level range differential.   </B><P>-------<P>Dear Brad,<P>I have seen that most of the servers have some degree of significance in the choice of their names.  I'm a Drinal player and am wondering if the name/word "Drinal" has any significance to it.<P>-Daylek Kylan 30th Season Ranger of Tunare- Drinal<P><B>At this point, all that is known is that Drinal is the name of one of the moons that orbits Norrath (Luclin, obviously, being the other one).  Whether there is a god or demi-god associated with the name and/or the moon (as there is with Luclin) is unknown... some legends, however, claim that Drinal wasn't always cold and lifeless, so perhaps its demi-god is dead or forgotten... </B><P>---------<P>I've been playing EverQuest off/on since the early beta days.  The game is phenomenal, and I know you guys have a ton to be proud of; watching EQ grow over the years to become what it has, has been amazing.<P>EQ does a wonderful job, IMO, of mastering "combat" in a massive multiplayer environment.  Each class is useful, and at the same time, they all need each other.  I've played many of the competitor's games, and none of them can even come close to making combat as in-depth, balanced, and diverse as EQ.  There are just so many ways to handle encounters in EQ, and strategy and "skilled" play is incredible.<P>My only beef with the game is the lack of "interaction" in the world.  The social aspect of EQ is so engrossing, it only seems appropriate that there be "social" things to do in the game.  Obviously, the engine for EQ was never made with this in mind, but I was wondering if this was being taken seriously in terms of future endeavors from Verant?  You guys really have one aspect of the genre mastered, IMO, in terms of balance, combat, class diversity, etc, but it just lacks that one "community" feel in terms of guilds, trade skills, vendors, owning property, decorating, etc.<P>Again, good luck with Luclin, and keep up the good work.<P>-Anthony<P><B>We appreciate the praise, as well as the perceptive observations.  <P>When designing an MMORPG one can pretty much approach it from one of two directions:  depth or breadth.   Sure, we'd all love an MMORPG with both, but that's a lot easier said than done.<P>So with EverQuest we decided to focus primarily on combat and adventure, and we are indeed proud of the depth, content, and game mechanics associated with 'dungeon crawling' and the like.  And while it was a conscious choice to do this, we've certainly nothing against other games that focused initially on breadth (these are typically the skill based systems, which offer a lot more choices but less long-term detail in their various professions or skill-trees).  <P>Will we at Verant ever pursue other aspects of character development or other advancement mechanisms?  Well, actually, we already are.  Star Wars: Galaxies is definitely a game focused initially more on breadth and player options.  In fact, the Creative Director on the project, Raph Koster, was one of the lead designers on Ultima Online, which is also a skill based, breadth-focused game.  So we're confident that SW:G will truly be the next step in the evolution of MMORPGs as they relate to a variety of professions and other less combat oriented paths of advancement (not that there won't be awesome battles there as well).  <P>Also, as we enter the age of second generation MMORPGs (of which SW:G is one) I think we'll see games focused on breadth become more and more detailed.  And while EverQuest will always retain the depth you see now in terms of combat and adventure, I wouldn't rule out, at least long term, the exploration of other advancement mechanisms.  After all, everyone's really after both depth and breadth, and it's just a matter of choosing a starting point and then sticking with MMORPG development, iteratively making better and better games, each generation. </B><P>--------<P>Dear Brad,<P>I hope this comes to the right place. I did a follow up on the ask Brad column of 9/1/01.<P>As a pen-and-paper role-player I have had thoughts on creating a world of my own for quite some time now and I know the tremendous amount of work that is involved.<P>What I would like to know is if there is more to Norrath than we can see today or if you are just expanding as you go along. Adding content on the fly, as it were, can cause a lot of problems when meshing existing content with new content but it is certainly possible.<P>I'm not after any specific information but just curious if you have a secret "master atlas" that you use when adding new places and new content?<P>Best Regards from Sweden,<P>-Staffan Friberg<P><B>Both, really.  We do indeed have atlases and quite an extensive set of documents describing the world of Norrath, and it grows every day.  There is a lot of detail regarding many places, events, and persons that either haven't been introduced yet in EverQuest or merely alluded to.  There are also, as people have noticed, many places on the maps that come with the game to which you can't travel (yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> ).  The majority of those places have at least some pre-existing content associated with them, and many have even more.  And then when a game designer sits down to work on a new area or to revamp an existing area, he often consults these documents, afterwards adding to them in detail. </B><P>--------<P>Do you prefer Ketchup, or Mayo with your Fries?<P>-Dargathi Kithkanan.<P><B>Ketchup, although I really like Mayo on my hamburgers, which some people think is strange.  *shrug* </B><P>---------<P>Brad -<P>Can you tell us what database EQ uses? Is it relational? Curious minds want to know. The current rumor is that EQ uses flat files, but that seems a bit ... well, unlikely.<P>-Zego Mandelbrot<P><B>We store virtually all of the data associated with the world in a relational database, but then we export that data to flat files which are then typically loaded into memory so it can be rapidly accessed.  That way the game designers can manipulate and query the data using the advantages of a database, but when it's time to place that data into a live, playable server, the data can be accessed at the speeds necessary for a real time, massively multiplayer game.<P>---------<P>Thank you all again for all the emails!<P>Until next time,<P>-Brad </B><P>
