			Emote Codes
		</h2>
	
	When creating custom socials, you can use a series of "%-codes" that expand into various pieces of information when the social is executed. <BR><BR>The %-codes are: <BR><BR><B>%M</B> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet).<BR><B>%T</B> - Returns the current target.<BR><B>%S</B> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<BR><B>%O</B> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<BR><B>%P</B> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<BR><B>%R</B> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters). <BR><BR>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote: <BR><BR>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <BR><BR>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<BR><BR>
