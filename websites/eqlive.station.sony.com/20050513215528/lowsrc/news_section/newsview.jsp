	 <p><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64050">Read</a> the letter to the EverQuest community from SOE President John Smedley.</p> <p>Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will be increasing our subscription rates in June. Effective June 12, 2005, the new monthly subscription rate will be $14.99/month. While this announcement may be unpleasant, the cost of operating a top tier MMO has increased significantly over the past three years and this change will help us achieve our goal of seeing that every player has a consistently enjoyable experience in the world of EverQuest. We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $41.97, a 6-month subscription will now be $77.94 and a 12-month subscription will now be $143.88. The 24-month subscription will continue to be $199.95. You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires. Subscription rates are subject to tax and value-added taxes, as applicable. These price increases will not affect the SOE Station Access? subscription rate. </p><p> New EverQuest rates as of June 12, 2005: </p><ul> <li>$14.99 per Month <li> $41.97 for 3 Months <li> $77.94 for 6 Months <li> $143.88 for 12 Months <li> $199.95 for 24 Months</li></ul><br> Additionally we'd like to thank our current EverQuest players by offering a 6 and 12-month limited time promotional offer. For a limited time only, you can take advantage of 6 or 12-month promotional subscriptions and reap great savings. Between May 12th and June 11th, 2005, we're offering a special discount on the new monthly subscription price: <ul> <li><b>A 6-month subscription costs only US$69.99 ? that's a 10% discount off of the new monthly plan.</b><br> <li>Even better, a 12-month subscription costs US$99.99 ? a 31% discount off of the new monthly rates.</li></ul> And for those customers subscribing to other great SOE games this is also an excellent time to become Station Access Members. The Station Access subscription provides an easy gateway for SOE fans to a variety of SOE titles for $21.99 a month. The Station Access subscription is good for <i>EverQuest</i>, <i>PlanetSide</i>, <i>EverQuest Online Adventures</i>, <i>EverQuest II</i>, <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i> and the Station Pass games. </p><p> EverQuest subscriptions are recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at the appropriate interval, until you affirmatively cancel your subscription. Note that purchasers of the full game will receive 30 days of game-play included with the purchase at no additional charge (subject to certain restrictions) after supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the period of 30 days of game-play included with purchase, no charges will be made to your credit card. </p><p> Subscriptions are subject to tax and value-added tax, as applicable. </p><p> All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the heading "SOE*EverQuest". </p><p> Please note: </p><p> The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the Station Store (http://store.station.sony.com). The price of the game will vary depending upon the store.</p>

	<h2>Hot New Look for Lavastorm</h2>

		<br>
	
	<p><strong>What all has changed? </strong><br> The new Lavastorm is a graphical update for both the zone and the majority of the NPCs.&nbsp; It gave us the opportunity to revisit one of our favorite old world zones and it shows off what an original EQ zone looks like, when recreated in the new graphics engine. This newly envisioned zone also paves the way for our latest expansion, Dragons of Norrath. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava01.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava01thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava02.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava02thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>What about quests/loot/drops/etc? </strong><br> We kept the previous content intact, but also added&nbsp;new NPCs with new drops as well as task givers who will happily reward you for helping them out. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava03.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava03thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava04.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava04thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Are the new mobs indicative of what we will see in DoN?</strong>&nbsp; <br> They sure are.&nbsp; The new models you see in Lavastorm are a preview of a few of the new models featured in Dragons of Norrath.&nbsp; If you think the new goblins and spiders look great, wait until you see the dragons!&nbsp; <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava05.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava05thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava06.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava06thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Are these mobs new or were they previously in GoD and OoW?</strong> <br> The NPC models in Lavastorm are brand new versions of original EverQuest models, developed specifically for Dragons of Norrath and the new Lavastorm. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava07.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava07thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava08.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava08thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Brenlo mentioned that this zone's art rivals that of EQII, maybe a little boast or something to spark a friendly rivalry? </strong><br> EverQuest is coming up on its sixth year and we continue to provide new content that surpasses the graphical quality of most other games in the MMP space.&nbsp; That's definitely something worthy of a little boasting.&nbsp; When it comes to EQII, I think sibling rivalry is probably the appropriate term.&nbsp; They are family and both teams continually push each other to be the best and exceed expectations. <br> <br> <strong>Any other interesting facts or information you guys think players would want to know?</strong> <br> There's more than meets the eye going on in Lavastorm.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks, players should keep an eye out for unusual events and they will have the opportunity to participate in world changing events as they unfold. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
