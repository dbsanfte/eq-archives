			15.1
			Where You Can Fight Other Players
		</h2>
	
	You can fight anywhere outside the city's gates, or in arenas within the city. The arena zones are clearly marked in your chat window when you enter them. <BR><BR>If you attack another player in the city, the guards might attack and kill you. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			15.2
			PvP Servers
		</h2>
	
	Several servers have been created specifically for player-vs-player (PvP) combat. Currently, there are four - Rallos Zek, Sullon Zek, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=server">Server Selection</A> for more details. <BR><BR>

			Tips for New PvP Players
		</h2>
	
	Here are a few tips to get you started. <BR><BR>* Don't join a PvP server for your first EverQuest experience. It's probably a good idea to become familiar with the game before attempting the more difficult challenge of a PvP server. <BR><BR>* Learn your way around. It's easy to get lost in EverQuest - which is exactly what you don't want to do in times of crisis. <BR><BR>* Find friends you can trust. Other newbies you meet can make great allies in the future. <BR><BR>* Find a guild to join. Remember, there's strength in numbers. <BR><BR>* Use the Anonymous option (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=iogeneral">Game Options: General</A>). The less other players know about you, the better. <BR><BR>* Keep moving. Running is always better than walking, and you can often run away from someone or something that's chasing you. <BR><BR>* Make it a habit to target and consider (/con) everyone you run across. <BR><BR>* Use banks to store anything valuable. Likewise, buy bags - no one can loot items in them. <BR><BR>
