	<h2>Vlos d'Veldrin Wants You!</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> &nbsp;<br>
	3/16/2005 8:45 am<br>
	<P>Are you Elemental flagged? Are you looking for a guild
  that treats it's members fairly and recognizes that they have a real life
  outside of EQ? Do you want to get to the Plane of Time? If you answered yes,
  keep reading...if you answered no, keep reading, we still might be the guild
  for you!</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Vlos typically raids M-W-F (8PM - 11PM EST), however these
  raids are NOT MANDATORY!!! These raids usually consist of OoW rune runs,
  Epics, and occasional PoP backflagging.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Don't feel like raiding? Then don't! We want our members
  gaining XP and AAs. We don't want to burn you out with raids everyday of the
  week! Can't make it that night? No worries! Take your spouse out to dinner
  and a movie, or spend some time with the kids!</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Saturday and Sunday are progression raids (1PM EST - until
  we finish..) These raids usually consist of PoF named, PoA Rings, PoE Rings,
  and Time Progression events... If you're online, you are expected to attend
  the raid. We need full support for the weekend raids, we ask all members to
  strive to attend these events.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Who are we looking for? Well, first of all, we want good
  players, it's that simple. If you are a mature, non-&quot;drama&quot; type
  player that can get from point A to point B without training the raid. WE
  WANT YOU! If you can pay attention and not go AFK at the worst possible
  moments (ie. while we're pulling or moving). WE WANT YOU! If you can play your
  class well and strive to improve in any areas you might be deficient. WE WANT
  YOU!<BR><BR></P>  <P>Specific classes we are looking for:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Clerics (2)</P>  <P>Necromancers (3)</P>  <P>Paladins (1-2)</P>  <P>Rogues (4)</P>  <P>Wizards (4)</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>You must be 66+ and Elemental flagged. If you are an
  exceptional player, we will consider waiving the flag requirement if you only
  need 1-2 flags. If your class isn't listed, but you've truly mastered playing
  your class, fill out an application! We do not care about your gear, if you
  play well and have good attendance, we will gear you. We do not care how many
  AAs you have, you'll easily be able to find an XP group within the guild. We
  do not care what spells you have, if you play well and have good attendance,
  we will fill your spell book. We currently do not have attendance %
  requirements for raids. However we expect new applicants to be active.<BR><BR>I want in!!! Who do I contact? Well first of all, stop in and say hi at <A HREF="www.houseofshadows.com">www.houseofshadows.com</A>, we'd love to see
  you apply! If you are currently on Cazic Thule, contact any of the following
  Officers with questions:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Myphat</P>  <P>Katuyah</P>  <P>Cataluap</P>  <P>Kylearan</P>  <P>Vaprack</P>  <P><BR>If you are not on Cazic Thule, simply type /tell cazic.Kylearan to send an
  Officer a tell.</P>  <P><BR>Submit your app before you move. If your application is accepted, you will
  have a guild tag waiting for you! Cazic Thule has a healthy population, and
  the server rarely goes down. Come join Vlos d'Veldrin if you are interested
  in advancing in the game! </P><br>
