<h1>Server Rule Sets</h1>


<P class=header align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size=3><B><FONT size=4><BR>PvP Rules</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P align=left><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Rallos Zek rules:</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Welcome to Rallos Zek, the oldest PvP server in EverQuest.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Rallos Zek, was the first PvP server in EverQuest. As such, many of the mechanics of the server are very specific. Unlike Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, and Sullon Zek, there are no set teams. The only restrictions set on PvP are level restrictions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>This document includes the PvP rules for Rallos Zek. </FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are within a 4 level limit. For instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41 through 49. There are no other PvP restrictions, such as Race or Alignment.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. As soon as a character 'dings' into 6th level, he or she will become PvP enabled.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Characters will not lose experience when killed in PvP combat, under most circumstances, although the occasional loss of experience is to be expected.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server, the loot rules are "Coin + 1 item". You may loot (or have looted from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item. Items in bags, in a melee slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be looted.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>All combat skills have their effective value capped at 2 levels above a player's current level. Losing two levels will not cause you to lose any combat skill effectiveness. However, losing more than that will cause those skill caps to be lowered so that they remain only two levels above your current level.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>/consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters: 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 4 levels.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial hometowns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for high elves and wood elves. Half elves have no starting city. Erudites have hometowns that match their starting cities. Other cities are not considered hometowns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human hometown. Thurgadin is not a dwarven hometown.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>On Rallos Zek, PvP-related Play Nice Policy situations are expected to be resolved using PvP solutions. However, Non PvP-related Play Nice Policy issues, such as training, causing intentional experience loss, bind point, zone, and portal camping, as well as other various forms of harassment, are not permitted in the PvP environment. <BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>While corpse camping is no longer illegal, corpse camping someone until the point where his or her corpse decays is considered harassment, and will be treated as such.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats, and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any server. <BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Naked corpses WILL disappear when looted by a player character. If you are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse will disappear when it is looted.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Hide skill and all 'invisibility' spells will cause player characters to lose targeting on the character that has hidden or gone invisible. </FONT></LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek rules:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Welcome to Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek, the PvP Teams servers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek, like Sullon Zek, are PvP teams servers. In general the servers are based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Sullon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which race you choose at creation rather than your deity.</FONT></P>

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are within an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 34 through 50, assuming they are on opposing teams.<BR><BR></FONT>

<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team.</FONT></P>
<DIV align=left>
<OL>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle.

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Players may only have&nbsp;three character at a time on this server. However, all of these characters must be on the same team This should allow some freedom to create&nbsp;new characters without invalidating the team system.<BR><BR></FONT>

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat.

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20<SUP>th</SUP> level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Naked corpses WILL disappear when looted by a player character. If you are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse will disappear when it is looted.<BR><BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Rogues will be able to pick the pockets of other player characters that are no more than five levels higher or lower than they are. They will only be able to gain coin in this fashion, they will not be able to gain as much as they can off of non-player characters (unless the player character is carrying an unusually large amount of coin), and a rogue will find it harder to steal from a player character than from a non-player character. A rogue will only be able to pick the pockets on any given player character once every 30 minutes. Also, rogues that get caught with their hands in other peoples pockets when other civilized folks are nearby will have to be very good indeed to escape with their skins<BR><BR></FONT>

<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>The 'Teams':</B></FONT></P>
<DIV align=left></DIV>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare<BR></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek<BR></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some ancient writings that opened up new avenues.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon Corpse or something similar in the near future.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Keep in mind that we will probably be making some changes to this server as things progress.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Firiona Vie (A roleplaying preferred server)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Firiona Vie server is a roleplaying preferred server. To motivate players to take advantage of the roleplaying atmosphere, the following feature list was implemented.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it's a standard "blue" server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the "Zeks".</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster. 
<LI>The Common language will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races. 
<LI>Only one character can be created on each account. 
<LI>The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. 
<LI>Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons. 
<LI>Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers.</FONT> 
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Trivial Loot Code</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a characters kills an NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes effect. This can happen when either a member of your group is too high in level to receive experience from killing the monster, or when a member of your group is outside of the level range of the group for receiving experience from the kill. If any member of the group does not get experience for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code prevents magical, lore, and no-dorp items from appearing on the corpse. Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
