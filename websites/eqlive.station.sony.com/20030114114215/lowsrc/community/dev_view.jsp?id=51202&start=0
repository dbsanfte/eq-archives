<h1>Please Do Not Exploit</h1>
	Ok, that sounds like a pretty obvious thing to say, and normally I wouldn't bother. Most of you already know not to do things that seem like cheating.
<P>But I wanted to make sure that everyone understands that we will suspend and ban accounts that we find using bugs to their advantage. We can and do catch folks doing such things, and it's no fun for us or for them when we take away their accounts.
<P>If you find some odd bug that allows you to do something that you normally can't do, the best thing to do is to use /bug to report the bug and avoid doing whatever causes that bug to happen. Nobody gets in trouble for finding a bug, only for exploiting it.
<P>Thanks for your cooperation.
<P>Alan<BR>
<HR>
Hi again.
<P>Scott wanted me to pass this along to you as a follow-up to what I wrote above.
<P><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=1>quote:</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT face="Verdana, Arial" size=2><BR>I'm not going to repeat the things that Alan's already stated so well. 99.9% of the people who play EverQuest do so in a fair manner, and agree that there is no room for cheating as part of EverQuest.
<P><BR>Unfortunately, this message is addressed to the other 0.1%. 
<P>If you've "accidentally" ended up with items equipped that your race or class cannot normally equip, and/or have any items that haven't been earned in the lines of acceptable gameplay under the EULA, we strongly recommend that you log in your character before tonight's patch and unequip any mismatched items and delete any duplicates.
<P><BR>As of tomorrow's patch, please do not be surprised when items gained in an illicit manner and/or wrongly equipped are creatively, forcibly un-equipped.
<P>We already have logs of who's done what, and we'd like to extend an opportunity to those who may have tried something out "just for fun" to take their actions back.
<P><BR>As a team, we've been congratulated quite a bit lately for many of the positive changes that we've been making to the game, and we're glad to continue to improve upon what we still believe is the most enjoyable online game out there. 
<P>However, please do not mistake our intent. The rule does stand: If you cheat to get around the system, you must be willing to accept the consequences. 
<P>Cheat in EverQuest; Bad Things Happen.
<P><BR>Once again, to the vast majority of people who play EverQuest in the true spirit of the game, we're sorry that we've had to take up your time with this. 
<P>We thank everyone who has submitted /bug reports and feedback here in the Dev Corner on this issue. No punitive action has been or will be taken against those who discover and report bugs, and stop taking advantage of them. 
<P>Thank you.
<P>Scott Hartsman<BR>Technical Director, EverQuest<BR></FONT>
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thanks for the clarification Scott.
<P>Alan
<P>
<P>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin] 
<HR>
As a clarification to the earlier warning regarding item exploits. By "creatively, forcibly" unequipped, we mean the following:
<P>After the patch occurring at 3 AM PDT Wednesday August 14th, any character level 11 and over who is wearing items that cannot be legally equipped by the character, or are equipped in illegal slots, will suffer an immediate duel-style death to forcibly reset their inventory. 
<P>Characters will not lose experience, but will return to their bind.
<P>Please make sure your characters are in legal shape before the patch.
<P>Thank you.<BR>
