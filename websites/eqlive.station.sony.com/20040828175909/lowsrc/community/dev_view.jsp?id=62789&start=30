<h1>A design update from Shawn Lord</h1>
	<P><EM>Greetings Norrath,</EM></P>
<P><EM>This week we have an update for you from the Lead Designer for EverQuest, Shawn Lord.&nbsp; Shawn was with the team for Planes of Power&nbsp;until the start of Gates of Discord and recently returned to us after a brief hiatus.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><BR>Hello everyone,</P>
<P>&nbsp;I've been back on the team for about a month now and I can honestly say that I've never seen so much going on at one time.&nbsp; As I'm sure you can tell from our recent updates and announcements, the Design Team has been working overtime to make changes based on the excellent feedback we've received from all of you.&nbsp; Many of your ideas and concerns have been factored into our plans for both the Live game and the development of the Omens of War expansion. </P>
<P>&nbsp;As you may have noticed from Cory Rohlfs' post last week, the Omens of War expansion is definitely benefiting aesthetically from our recent engine changes.&nbsp; On the Design side we hope to complement those advances with content that's benefited from the lessons we've learned from our earlier expansions.&nbsp; Making new content that is compelling, fresh, and capable of catering to the dozens of play-styles that our hundreds of thousands of friends and customers fall into is challenging... and exciting... and why we're here.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When I see all of the hard work that's being poured into the game  the Live changes; Epic creation; Omens content  right now, I can't help but be excited.&nbsp; As developers, players, and as an industry, we're living in some of the most exciting times in gaming.&nbsp; There are bound to be missteps, skeptical jaunts into the unknown, and thrilling victories for all of us.&nbsp; It wouldn't be an adventure if there weren't.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Thank you for playing and thank you even more for listening to me blather on.&nbsp; It's great to be back in such excellent company.&nbsp; I think I can speak for the team when I say that we all look forward to seeing You in game, in beta, and eventually in Omens of War.</P>
<P>-Thanks</P>
<P>Shawn Lord<BR>Lead Designer<BR>EverQuest</P>
<P><EM>Thanks for the update Shawn!&nbsp; Next week we will hear from our Environmental Art Team so stay tuned!</EM></P>
