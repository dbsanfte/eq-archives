			Meditating
		</h2>
	
	You can decrease the amount of time it takes you to memorize a spell by Meditating. This helps speed up the process of scribing and memorizing spells, but it's a skill-based ability. If you press the Meditate button but nothing happens, that means that you don't yet have the Meditate skill. If you have the skill, it will automatically be used whenever you memorize or scribe a spell. <BR><BR>Meditating for long periods of time helps you regain mana faster, and is more effective than meditating for short bursts. <BR><BR>To meditate just click on the picture of your spell book in the Spells Window.<BR><BR>
