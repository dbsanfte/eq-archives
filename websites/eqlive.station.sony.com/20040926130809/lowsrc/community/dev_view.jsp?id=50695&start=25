<h1>Guide Application</h1>
	Hail citizens of Norrath!<P>Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<P>Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and a journey wrought with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<P>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<P>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with compassion, and filled with joy.<P>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<P>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  That you will be trued.  In the end though, the citizens of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<P>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite you to point your browser to: <A HREF="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/" TARGET=_blank>https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</A> <P>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to Norrath<BR>are grand.<P>A few things to remember:<BR>1) You must have an active, and in good standing, EverQuest account.<BR>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<BR>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<BR>4) You will need good communication skills.<BR>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<BR>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<P><BR>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better than they<BR>already are... come be a part of the Everquest Guide Program!<P>The Everquest Guide Program<P>Thanks,<BR>Jacob Thornley<BR>EverQuest Guide Liaison<BR>Sony Online Entertainment<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

<B>The guide application doesn't actually have you send your password in plain text... it has you log in.  However, this could be made clearer on the application, to avoid confusion.<P>- Xelene Solyric</B><P>Right.  The form is secure, and the information for your login name and password are checked by the same method we use to check your login to the game.<P>It's good that people are worried about the security on our site, and the seeming contradiction about the password thing.<P>You know the site is valid because you got the URL from our main site.  We ask for a validation of your EverQuest account to ensure that you actually play the game.  I'll mention to the people in charge that they might make that clear on the site, thanks.<P>And several people have filled out the application only to lose all that information when their browser crashes.  That's not fun.  Whenever typing something long and complicated to be placed into an e-mail or a browser, I always type it up in a word processor first.  This means I won't lose it if something happens to the browser, and I can spell check it before I let others see it.<P>Just a suggestion.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>I've always wanted to be a guide, and it seems my attempts have always been thrwarted.  I enjoy helping people, which is the main reason why my main isn't even to level 40 yet.  But, here is what you said:<P>1) You must have an active, and in good standing, EverQuest account.<BR>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<BR>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<BR>4) You will need good communication skills.<BR>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<BR>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<P>I'm 17, which I guess is a tough break for me, other than the fact you're missing out on an excellent guid. =P  But why?  Legality reasons?  People don't responsible until they are legally an adult?  <P>And why the no-shared account?  It doesn't apply to me, but my local EQ friend shares his account with his brother.  His brother is pretty trustworthy from what I've seen, and doesn't want anything to do with guides. If you're worried about his brother logging on and doing un-guidely things, then you shouldn't.  I thought the Guide Application asked for another password other then your EQ account's one, but it may have changed since I checked it last time.  We were kinda hoping (however slim the chance) that we could be Guide-Mates, but now there isn't even a slight possibility of it happening...<P>Just curious about the above, and thanks for listening.  Hope you'll need more guides for Luclin.  I'll be 18 by then!<P>~RivenClaw</B><P>Yes, the age restriction is a legal issue.  At 18 you are considered an adult, for the most part, and you are responsible for your own actions.  We certainly have nothing against people under that age of 18, but we need to follow certain guidelines (I'm no lawyer, and I'm not going to let one post here, either  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  )<P>And, well, sharing your account is against the EULA.  Someone that is unwilling to follow the instructions in the EULA might not be the best candidate to be a guide.<P>And, well, letting anyone log on to your guide account is not acceptable.  Sure, that person might be trustworthy.  But there have been so many cases of trustworthy people giving out passwords that it's not even funny.  And, well, if that person wants to become a guide, that's great.  Run them through the approval process and let us be responsible for making them a guide.  Letting someone use your guide account is very inappropriate.<P>Don't share your account, please.  Far too many people are hurt by doing so.<P>Alan<P><BR>
