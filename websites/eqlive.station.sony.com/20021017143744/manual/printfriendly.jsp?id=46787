			Taunting
		</h2>
	
	If you have the Taunt skill, you can use it to draw a creature's attention away from whomever it's attacking. When you successfully taunt a monster, it turns and starts attacking you instead. You'll find that taunting is an indispensable group skill, especially if you want to keep the spell casters in your group alive. <BR><BR>Taunt is a combat skill. To use this skill you will need to set up a button for it on the Combat Skills tab of the Actions Window. <BR><BR>Once you've done that, all you need to do is click on a creature to target it and press the Taunt button. <BR><BR>
