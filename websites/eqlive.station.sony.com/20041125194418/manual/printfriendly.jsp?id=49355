This may improve performance on slower computers. <BR><BR><I>Video Modes</I>: This button will bring up another window. In this window you will be able to select your game resolution, refresh rate and video depth. It is important to note that these options are determined by your hardware and the drivers that run them. If you are seeing fewer options than you were expecting (such as higher resolutions), the first step to correcting this is to see if you can find newer drivers for your video card. <BR><BR><I>Sky</I> (3D Sky Off/Single Layer/Double Layer): Toggles the level of sky detail. In some cases you may want to alter this to improve performance. <BR><BR><I>Fade Delay</I>: Sets the amount of time, in seconds, that all windows wait after they have lost focus before they start to fade out. <BR><BR><I>Fade Duration</I>: Sets the amount of time, in seconds, that all windows take to fade in or out once it starts. <BR><BR><I>Gamma Correction</I>: Adjust screen brightness during gameplay. <BR><BR><I>Clip Plane</I>: The clipping plane determines how far you can see. In some cases reducing the clip plane can improve performance. <BR><BR><I>Particle Density</I> (Off/Low/Medium/High): Adjust number of particles displayed during spell effects. In some cases a lower setting may improve performance. <BR><BR><I>Window Transparency</I>: This sets the default transparency (alpha) level for all windows when they are active (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=isettings">Window Settings</A> for more information on alpha settings). Changing this setting will alter the setting for all windows, even if you have set the window transparency values on specific windows. <BR><BR><I>Fade to Transparency</I>: This sets the default transparency (alpha) level for all window when they are faded active (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=isettings">Window Settings</A> for more information on alpha settings). Changing this setting will alter the setting for all windows, even if you have set the fade to transparency values on specific windows. <BR><BR>
