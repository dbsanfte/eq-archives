	<h2>PlanetEQ Interviews Creator of GU Comics</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>

	<P>Kwill of PlanetEQ recently interviewed Woody Hearn, creator of the popular GU Comics. Here's a snippet:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Where do you get your ideas for your comics? Do other people give you ideas?<BR></EM></P>
<P>Well, since I don't get to play all that often anymore, my key source for ideas comes from the various EQ news sites. If the news has been slow, I just kinda sit at the computer and look at the screen until something strikes me as funny.<BR><BR>I welcome idea submissions from the fans, and give them credit in the by-line for their contribution. What most folks, that submit ideas, don't realize is: the ideas they tend to send me are situational and really only funny to those involved. And, where I would like to do their strip, even if it was just for them and their guild, I can't because it's not in the best interest of the site as a whole. So, I'm pretty selective.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
