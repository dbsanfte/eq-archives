			Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	Prior to fighting, run through a quick, mental checklist: <BR><BR>* Scribe and memorize any offensive spells you possess.<BR>* Program your Combat skills and spells (if any) to Hot Buttons.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key.<BR>* Makes sure you have a weapon in hand.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <B><I>F8</I></B> to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><I>Green text</I>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><I>Light Blue text</I>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><I>Blue text</I>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it won't be easy.<BR><I>White text</I>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you could win.<BR><I>Yellow text</I>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><I>Red text</I>: You'll most likely die. <BR><BR><I>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a greater challenge.</I><BR><BR>
