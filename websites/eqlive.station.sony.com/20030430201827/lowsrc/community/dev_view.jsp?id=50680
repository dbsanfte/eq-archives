<B>i have to speak against adding a confirmation box to the normal translocate, as it couldnt be used to save someone that is asleep on a raid<P>and nothing can really protect you from us, the 'deranged' wizards! flee while you can!<P>Feyr Tlincail<BR>Deranged wizard of quellious<P>*evil laugh*</B><P>Herein lies the problem.<P>The reason we added the confirmation box was that we received overwhelming requests for such a thing at the last Fan Faire.<P>Now you (and others) want the box removed.<P>But, if we remove the box, the folks that asked for it in the first place will be upset, and will begin sending in requests to put it back...<P>I've seen that happen a lot since I started this job.  In a case like this, where there is no clearly correct or overwhelmingly preferred option, which ever option is currently in place will be the one that we are told people don't want.<P>I would imagine that it is just as unlikely that someone will fall asleep and <I>need</I> to be sent home as it is that someone will take advantage of their ability to send someone home against their will.<P>For now, we're going to stick with the box.  But I'll bring this up at the next tuning meeting and see if we can use some other method to make this work.<P>Alan<BR>

This isn't a bug. It was left in to prevent people from spamming others with requester boxes.<P>- Lawrence Poe<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I've had a lot of comments about this topic.  This is how we want this to work.  It's going to work this way for the foreseeable future.  Try it out for a while, see how it works and see if this is really a problem.  While we might change this at some time in the future, it's going to stay as it is for now.<P>Alan<BR>
