	<h2>Cult of Mischief on Tunare is Recruiting 55+</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> &nbsp;<br>
	02/17/2004 8:54 am<br>
	<P>Cult of Mischief (a small performance oriented guild) is recruiting level
  55+ on Tunare. We currently have a core group of level 65s, and we have about
  35 people in total above 55. We would like to grow to about 45.<BR><BR>Although we generally play together, this is not a raiding guild. Your time
  is always your own. We pride ourselves on being able to achieve with tactics,
  what other guilds do with numbers. We may never see the Elemental Planes, but
  we still believe that EQ offers rewarding challenges for a small, organized
  guild.</P>  <P>We feel that when challenges are met and conquered by an underdog but
  unified and determined force, the satisfaction is as great as any mega guild
  raid that rewards 3 of the 60 people that attend it.<BR><BR>This guild is not a democracy, but if you join, and you are patient, I
  promise you will get more out of it than you put in. We have a communal loot
  policy when grouped with guild members, but your time, independence and
  liberty is always respected.<BR><BR>What we can offer you are some flags, some help with key epic mobs, equipment
  upgrades and some help with obtaining the expensive spells. As many of us are
  techs, we have solid web site which members visit daily. But I think the most
  valuable thing we can offer you is a sense of community and time and energy
  devoted to advancing your character. We want to grow, but not at anyone?s
  expense.</P>  <P>At the end of the month we want everyone to feel they are getting
  something out of their time in the cult. All of the mentioned help is given
  at our discretion, in our own time. Only through faith and patience will you
  inherit the promise. We help those most who help themselves. We don?t
  tolerate any malice, immaturity or drama that upsets those within the guild,
  or reflects badly on the guild name.<BR>If you spend some time with us and move on at some point to bigger goals,
  there will be no harm done.</P>  <P>If nothing else, maybe you'll have made some friends along the way. All
  help is freely given and with no strings attached.<BR><BR>We have members in all time zones. If you have any questions, please contact
  Mannus, Santhis, Tyrynt, Concarne or Sabine in game, or visit <A HREF="http://mage.ca/category-view.asp">mage.ca</A> and introduce yourself.<BR><BR>Kill with grace,<BR><BR>-Mannus Mindraider, Dark Elf Enchanter, co-founder and officer of Cult of
  Mischief.<BR><A HREF="mailto:mannus@mage.ca">mannus@mage.ca</A><BR>mage.ca</P><br>
