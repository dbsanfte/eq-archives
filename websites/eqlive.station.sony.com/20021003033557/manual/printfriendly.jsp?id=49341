If your character controls a pet, the red health bar will be split - the top part remaining red while the bottom part turns yellow. The red portion still represents the character's health, while the yellow portion shows the health of the pet.<BR><I>Blue Gauge</I> - Mana - shows your character's mana amount. This bar will not be visible if your character is of a class that does not have mana (such as a warrior).<BR><I>Yellow Gauge</I> - Stamina - shows your character's stamina. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: The tool tip for these gauges will show you the percentage of the resource that remains.</I> <BR><BR>
