	<h2>Important News Regarding Upcoming Patch</h2>
	
	Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast.<br>
<br>
The important part of the message is not that, though.  It's this:<br>
<br>
Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance hat some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<br>
<br>
** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br>
<br>
We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it right away after the patch.<br>
<br>
So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer laying around, the less chance of them disappearing.
