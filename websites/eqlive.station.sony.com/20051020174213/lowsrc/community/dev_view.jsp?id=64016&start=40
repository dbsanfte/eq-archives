<h1>Welcome to Zek </h1>
	<P>On February 8<SUP>th</SUP> a new server will show up on
  your server selection list.&nbsp; Zek
  will host the combined characters of the four current PVP servers (Rallos,
  Tallon, Vallon and Sullon) and will use the Rallos Zek ruleset.&nbsp; It is our opinion that merging the
  four current PVP servers will revitalize the PVP environment, adding new
  challenges and players for you to test your skills against.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Character Purge</U></STRONG></P>  <P>Immediately preceding the merger, all characters that are
  below level 10 and have not been accessed in the past six months or more will
  be purged from all four PVP servers.&nbsp;
  If you have a character on Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek or
  Sullon Zek that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for six months
  or more, you will need to log them in prior to the February 8<SUP>th</SUP>  downtime.&nbsp; Any character that is
  below level 10 and has not been logged in for 6 or more months will be
  deleted and will not be available after the server merge.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Shared Banks</U></STRONG></P>  <P>If you have characters on more than one of the PVP
  servers, you will need to clean out the shared bank on all but one of the
  existing PVP servers.&nbsp; Only one
  shared bank, from one of the four servers, will be available after the
  merger.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Characters</U></STRONG></P>  <P>If you have more than 8 characters combined between all of
  the current PVP servers, after the merger, only the first 8 (sorted
  alphabetically) characters will be displayed.&nbsp; Other characters beyond those 8 will
  not be available for selection until characters are deleted.&nbsp; The characters will be on your account
  provided they were not below level 10 and had been played within the last 6
  months.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Corpses</U></STRONG></P>  <P>Prior to the downtime on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of February,
  please make certain that you clear any character corpses from the world.&nbsp; Character corpses will not be
  transferred to the new merged server.&nbsp;
  All corpses will be purged once the merger is complete.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Character Names</U></STRONG></P>  <P>It is likely that characters will have duplicate names on
  these servers, in the event that characters do share a name, the character
  with the most played time will be entitled to keep the name, all other
  characters will have the letter X appended to their name and will be entitled
  to a name change.&nbsp; You can request
  your name change using the /petition system.</P>  <P><STRONG><U>Complimentary
  Character Move</U></STRONG></P>  <P>We are gathering feedback from our PVP players on how best
  to move forward with the complimentary PVP character move.&nbsp; Look for an announcement in the near
  future.</P>
