			Character Creation Screen
		</h2>
	
	This screen lets you build your character through a series of steps: <BR><BR><B>Step 1 - Pick a Race</B> <BR><BR>Norrath has 13 known races, each of which was established in a specific region of Norrath. All have unique talents and professions - for example, Humans are relatively smart and can pursue nearly all professions, while Ogres have fewer options, but excel in physical strength. <BR><BR>* Click a race to select it. (Notice that the starting statistics and the list of available Classes change for each race.) <BR><BR><B>Races of Norrath</B> <BR><BR><B><I>Barbarian</I></B>: Warriors at heart, most of the Barbarians' history revolves around one war or another. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Halas <BR><I>Classes</I>: Beastlord (Shadows of Luclin only), Rogue, Shaman, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Dark Elf</I></B>: Dark Elves share the heritage and features of other elves in Norrath, but they are more evilly aligned. Home is almost always underground, so darkness poses no obstacle for Dark Elves. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Neriak <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans, Iksar, Wood Elves <BR><BR><B><I>Dwarf</I></B>: Short but strong, Dwarves outperform Humans in nearly all physical tasks. Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded by their dexterity. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Kaladim <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior<BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Erudite</I></B>: Self-pride and intellect persuade most Erudites to forego physical activity in favor of mental challenges. Social grace is their forti, and they believe themselves to be the pinnacle of evolution. <BR><I>Starting cities</I>: Erudin or Paineel (determined by class) <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard, Shadow Knight <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Gnome</I></B>: Distant cousins to Dwarves, Gnomes tend to burrow in the hillsides in underground communities. A lack of surface light lends a pale hue to their skin tone, and they rarely emerge to mingle with other races. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Ak'Anon <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard<BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Half Elf</I></B>: As Human-Elf hybrids, Half Elves share the prominent physical features of both races. Their intellect is a notch above most other races, though they suffer a lack of strength as compared to the other Norrathian races. <BR><I>Starting cities</I>: Qeynos, Freeport, Kelethin <BR><I>Classes</I>: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Halfling</I></B>: Short and Human-like, Halflings are by far the most nimble and mobile race in the world. Outstanding dexterity and agility come naturally, and they're natural travelers. Because of this, Halflings have developed peaceful relations with most other races. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Rivervale <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>High Elf</I></B>: Though they have physical traits in common with Wood Elves, High Elves are far more developed in the ways of the mind. Pale and thin, they prefer to spend their time exercising the confines of the mind, and not the body. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Felwithe <BR><I>Classes</I>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves <BR><BR><B><I>Human</I></B>: Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath. <BR><I>Starting cities</I>: Qeynos, Freeport <BR><I>Classes</I>: All but Shaman and Beastlord <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Iksar</I></B>: A tribal race, these lizard-like warriors carry on a rich heritage of conquest, enslavement and destruction. Iksar are quite intelligent (despite their large size and warrior-like ways) and prefer to socialize within their own circles. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: New Sebilis (also known as Cabilis) <BR><I>Classes</I>: Beastlord (SoL only), Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><I>Racial Tensions</I>: All other races. <BR><BR><B><I>Ogre</I></B>: Ogres spend as much time on the battlefield as Erudites and High Elves do exploring their intellect. With their gargantuan size and strength, they pass most of their days munching on available game and rarely give any thought to pursuing other interests. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Oggok <BR><I>Classes</I>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Troll</I></B>: Despite a two-foot height difference, Trolls get along famously with Ogres, sharing similar likes, dislikes and pastimes. Outdoorsy and not quite bright, they're easily recognizable due to their skin's natural green tinge. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Grobb <BR><I>Classes</I>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><B><I>Wood Elf</I></B>: Yet another variation on the Elven-Human theme, Wood Elves are slightly weaker than Humans, but highly dexterous and agile. Despite their tendencies to be wild and secretive, they are very dedicated to the good of society. <BR><I>Starting city</I>: Kelethin <BR><I>Classes</I>: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><I>Racial tensions</I>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><B>Step 2 - Pick a Class</B> <BR><BR>Your class (your characters occupation) describes your career goal in the game. You can pursue any life you choose in EverQuest, so long as your race permits it. <BR><BR>* Click an occupation to select it. (Note that each occupation gives you specific attributes that are marked with green numbers. When allocating ability points, concentrate on these characteristics.) <BR><BR><B><I>Bard</I></B>: The Bard has the unusual ability to play magical songs whose supernatural effects last as long as the Bard continues to sing. He has some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (self-defense), but his main focus is always his art. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +5 Strength, +10 Dexterity, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Beastlord (only available with Shadows of Luclin)</I></B>: Beastlords are the spiritual warriors of the primitive cultures of Norrath and Luclin. Like the Shaman, the Beastlords have a close relationship with the spirit world. The Beastlord's fighting style is derived from tactics used by wild beasts thus they prefer to fight unarmed or with only small piercing weapons. But the Beastlord is best known for his life-long animal companion. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Stamina, +5 Agility, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Cleric</I></B>: A Cleric is a holy woman born with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of her deity to smite her foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains her ability. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><B><I>Druid</I></B>: A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to call upon Nature for aid and defense. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><B><I>Enchanter</I></B>: The primary focus of this art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which it belongs - enchantment. Spells are crafted to enchant people, places and things. An Enchanter can charm beings and make them fight for a new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword-welding warrior. She even has some proficiency in offensive spells. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Intelligence, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Magician</I></B>: The Magician is the summoner of the arcane arts, and can conjure up everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight on his behalf. While not as offensively adept as a Wizard, a Magician still possesses considerable spell power. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><B><I>Monk</I></B>: The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor. She's very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless Monks by magically enhancing their attacks. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><B><I>Necromancer</I></B>: The Necromancer belongs to the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spells, he can animate dead bodies and skeletons to do his bidding, as well as cast spells to leach life from his victims. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><B><I>Paladin</I></B>: A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to heal simply by Laying on Hands. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +5 Wisdom, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Ranger</I></B>: The Ranger is a hybrid mix between a Warrior and a Druid, sharing the skills of both. He's most at home in the great outdoors. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom <BR><BR><B><I>Rogue</I></B>: Falling somewhere between an assassin and a thief, the Rogue belongs to the secretive class of Norrath. She's quite skilled in weaponry, but prefers to make sudden attacks from behind. Shadier skills include Pick Lock and Pick Pockets. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><B><I>Shadow Knight</I></B>: The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight derives power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part Necromancer and has the innate ability to damage flesh with his Harm Touch. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Intelligence, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Shaman</I></B>: Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><B><I>Warrior</I></B>: A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much punishment as he doles out. By nature, Warriors have more health points than any other class. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Strength, +10 Stamina, +5 Agility <BR><BR><B><I>Wizard</I></B>: The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of destruction. <BR><I>Modifiers</I>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><B>Step 3 - Allocate Ability Points</B> <BR><BR>Your character has primary and secondary statistics. Primary ones are bright green, and represent abilities most beneficial to your chosen occupation. The others are secondary, which means they still affect you, but aren't quite as important. <BR><BR>The box in the top right corner of the screen shows your bonus ability points. The amount differs by race and/or occupation. You can add these points to any ability - but you should probably add most of them to your green "primary" abilities. <BR><BR>* Click "+" to add a bonus point to an ability.<BR>* Click "-" to remove a bonus point from an ability. (You can't decrease any ability below its starting value, however.) <BR><BR><B><I>Agility</I></B>: Physical agility; affects your probability of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some skills. <BR><BR><B><I>Charisma</I></B>: How various factions react to you; affects prices for some merchants. Also affects spell effects for Enchanters and Bards, and helps Bards successfully play more notes. <BR><BR><B><I>Dexterity</B></I>: Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects some skills and Bard songs. <BR><BR><B><I>Wisdom</I></B>: Affects how fast you learn specific skills. For a Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at each level. <BR><BR><B><I>Intelligence</I></B>: Affects how fast you learn many skills. For a Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard, it also affects maximum mana at each level. <BR><BR><B><I>Stamina</I></B>: Health and constitution; affects your maximum number of hit points at each level. <BR><BR><B><I>Strength</I></B>: Physical strength; affects how much you can carry, how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some skills. <BR><BR><B>Step 4 - Pick a Facial Appearance</B> <BR><BR>To change your character's face, click <B>Set Face</B> just above the picture of your character. Click the arrows to cycle through different facial appearances. To return to the full view of your character, click <B>Accept</B>. <BR><BR><B>Step 5 - Pick a Name</B> <BR><BR>Either type in a name, or click <B>Get Name</B> to let the computer pick a name for you. You can't use spaces, dashes or special characters (#, ?, etc.). <BR><BR>* Click in the name field and type<BR>* Click <B>Next</B> to proceed <BR><BR><B>Step 6 - Pick a Deity</B> <BR><BR>The Deity Selection screen displays once you click <B>Next</B> from the Character Creation screen. Depending on your occupation and race, you can either choose from several of 18 specific deities, or remain agnostic (not a follower of any one god, perhaps unwilling to acknowledge their power). <BR><BR>* Click a deity to select it. The name of the god appears in the text to the right. <BR><BR><B>Here are some generalizations about the followers of each of the available gods.</B> <BR><BR><B><I>Bertoxxulous</I></B>: Lovers of decay and disease; dedicated to spreading both. <BR><BR><B><I>Brell Serilis</I></B>: Choose to inhabit the underground; generally a bit solitary. <BR><BR><B><I>Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe</I></B>: True believers of fun and mischief; doctrine disregards trust and honesty. <BR><BR><B><I>Cazic-Thule</I></B>: Followers are ruled by fear; hate, cruelty and torture abound. <BR><BR><B><I>Erolissi Marr</I></B>: Defend justice and innocence; love always overcomes hate. <BR><BR><B><I>Innoruuk</I></B>: Fervid proponents of hate; no loyalty exists between followers, and all that is Good is weak. <BR><BR><B><I>Karana</I></B>: Disciples of rain; respectful of the power of weather in the woodlands. <BR><BR><B><I>Mithaniel Marr</I></B>: Seek courage, honor and good; leave frivolousness to others. <BR><BR><B><I>Prexus</I></B>: Watchguards of the water; doctrine upholds that this deity will one day wash away all of Norrath. <BR><BR><B><I>Quellious</I></B>: Masters of inner peace and enlightenment; knowing one's true self will help bring peace to Norrath. <BR><BR><B><I>Rallos Zek</I></B>: Warriors to the end; emphasizes survival of the strong and the true value of conflict. <BR><BR><B><I>Rodcet Nife</I></B>: Selfless servants to the weak and diseased; preaches healing and cleansing as one's life work. <BR><BR><B><I>Solusek Ro</I></B>: Devoted followers of all things aflame; aggressive and purposeful in all that they do. <BR><BR><B><I>The Tribunal</I></B>: Bringers of justice; the world is black-and-white, and all wrongs deserve an even revenge. <BR><BR><B><I>Tunare</I></B>: Trustees of Nature; the land Norrath is to be protected at all costs. <BR><BR><B><I>Veeshan</I></B>: Worshippers and servants of all Dragonkind; doctrine calls for sacrifice and dedication. <BR><BR><B>Step 7 - Pick a Starting City</B> <BR><BR>The world of Norrath is populated with many cities, but not all are friendly to all races, occupations and beliefs. Race is the primary factor that determines your starting city - you'll always be able to start in at least one of the cities listed in Race. However, choosing a certain deity or occupation may affect your starting city. <BR><BR>You can start from any city with a yellow or white name. (You may be able to choose between two or more cities, or you might only have a single option.) The currently selected city's name is yellow; cities you cannot start from are faded out.<BR><BR>* Click a city to select it (you may or may not have more than one choice)<BR>* Click <B>Next</B> twice to return to the Character Selection screen <BR><BR><I>Tip: If you're planning on playing with your friends in a new city, make sure everyone has a compatible race, class and deity.</I> <BR><BR>

			Background (Window Settings)
		</h2>
	
	The Background option allows you to easily customize the background of the window you are working with. There are two options that you can change in regarding the background. <BR><BR><I>Texture</I>: This option toggles on and off the background texture of the window.<BR><I>Tinting</I>: This option allows you to tint the background of the window. In a window with no texture, the tinting color becomes the background color for that window. You can either choose one of the preset color options or set the red, blue and green color values using the sliders or the text boxes. <BR><BR><I>Note: Choosing white as a tint color is the same as having no tinting selected. So if you want to return the texture to its untinted color, choose to tint it white.</I><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.3
			Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items
		</h2>
	
	You can pick up items you find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped, traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form of a small, brown bag. <BR><BR><B>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</B> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<B><I>i</B></I>).<BR>* Click on the item (it "floats" on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <I>To drop it</I>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <I>To give it to someone</I>, click on that person. This will open the Trade window. Just click <B>Trade</B> to give them the item (the person receiving your gift will also have to click Trade to complete the trade, so don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <I>To destroy it</I>, click <B>Destroy</B>.<BR><I>Note: Once you destroy an item, it is gone. Make sure you really want to destroy the item (and that you have the correct item) before clicking Destroy.</I> <BR><BR><B>To pick up an item from the ground:</B> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot .<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			8.4
			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player, see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=giving">Giving/Trading Items</A>. <BR><BR><I>To buy/sell an item:</I> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<I>Note: you will have to be relatively close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only receive the "consider" information for the merchant, not the merchant window</I>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <B>Purchase</B> or <B>Sell</B> to purchase or sell the quantity of items you've selected.<BR><BR><I>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</I> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the Control key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. To buy or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <B>Sell</B> or <B>Purchase</B> button. <BR><BR>

		<h2>
			13.2
			Acquiring Spells
		</h2>
	
	Some classes (such as a Paladin's ability to Lay on Hands) have one or more spell-like abilities that are very much like skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells, however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spellbook and memorize it before you can cast it. <BR><BR>You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some special quests can also yield spells. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			18.3
			Joining/Leaving/Disbanding a Group
		</h2>
	
	You can either invite someone to join your group, or accept an invitation from someone else who has started a group. <BR><BR><I>To invite a player to join your group:</I> <BR><BR>* Target the player.<BR>* Click the <B>Invite</B> button in the Group Window.<BR><BR>The player you're inviting receives the invitation in the Chat Window, and his or her "Invite" button changes to "Follow". <BR><BR><I>To accept a group invitation:</I> <BR><BR>* Ask to join a group or wait for someone to invite you to join.<BR>* Click the <B>Follow</B> button in your Group Window (the button then reverts back to "Invite").<BR><BR><I>To leave a group (or dissolve a group you started):</I> <BR><BR>* Click <B>Disband</B> button in your Group Window.<BR><BR>
