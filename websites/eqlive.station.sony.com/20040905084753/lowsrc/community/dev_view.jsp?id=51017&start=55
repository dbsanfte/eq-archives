<h1>Upcoming Changes to the Cleric Epic Quest</h1>
	Normally this isn't something I'd do.  But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather close detail.  But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<P>With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people to help in the process.  Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests.  So Clerics tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others.  This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for Clerics trying to complete the quest.  The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among players.<P>So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest.  To reduce confusion and to help people understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details.  These changes will go Live with the patch tonight.<P>For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<P><BR>First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB.  He will appear once each day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days).  The appearance of this NPC will no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<P>The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak.  But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to the Cleric and disappear.<P>At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him.  A killable version of Zordak will appear independent of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster).  Killing Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help...) must kill him immediately.<P>The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<P>The rest of the quest remains the same.<P><BR>The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before.  They will not remove that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to be... rude to each other.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>First let me just say THANK YOU on behalf of the cleric community. I already have my epic, but I'm very happy that future clerics do not have to endure the painful and dreaded Ragefire camp.<P>I only see one problem with the change, and that is on most servers Kunark dragons are usually killed very quickly after spawning.  If Ragefire indeed spawns and remains with his previous loot table, he will be "farmed" for Cloak of Flames and other great loot, making the quest even less attainable for clerics not in first tier guilds.<P>The way around this, I believe:<P>a) Keep Ragefire's dragon form as is (like Nagafen) and not Talendor (I hope I have the right dragon)<P>b) The loot is removed completely from him except the container<P>c) The container is NO DROP/NO RENT until combined with the pearl, when it becomes NO DROP only<P>This will clear up most issues with the changes and would certainly accomplish what you are trying to acheive!<P>Adon<BR>58th Templar <BR>Zebuxoruk</B><P>a)  I don't know really how the appearance of the NPC is a factor.  And, well, I don't actually know what he'll look like.<P>b)  We'll keep our eyes on that.  Right now the loot hasn't changed, but this is something we'll keep our eyes on.  Remember, it works both ways.  If there is no good loot for your friends to gain for helping you with your epic, then they might be less willing to help.<P>c)  The container is indeed no-drop.  I don't know about the no-rent thing.  That seems like a bad idea to me.  How unpleasant would it be to have your cleric go link-dead during the battle?<P>In any case, we'll see how this goes.<P><BR>Rizpah wrote:<P><B>Thanks for the efforts!  Can you consider making it necessary to give the swirling pearl to the merchant in Skyfire for him to spawn the killable version and then the pearl returned (much like the Faydedar trigger is now)?  This would ensure a cleric would have to be ready for this step to get the heart and would avoid the dragon being farmed for loot and twink clerics who may one day do the quest.  It would also avoid grief players killing the trigger and gating or killing the dragon even out of spite.</B><P>This is one of the things we were trying to prevent.  There is a real problem with the whole triggered Ragefire thing.  It becomes a problem when character A hands in the trigger item and group B kills the NPC.  Not only is character A out of luck for getting his item, he's also lost the item he needed to trigger the NPC in the first place.<P>For most epic quests this hasn't really been a problem.  But for this one it has.  The tremendous demand for this one item has caused people to do things like jumping other's triggered spawns and all sorts of other nasty things.  Short of removing the item from the game, there really isn't any way to prevent that behavior short of paying someone full-time to watch people at this one encounter.<P>There probably isn't a perfect solution here.  Let's see how this one works out.<P>Alan<BR>

This has been confirmed (though unintentionally) by GMs.</B><P>Soon.<P>The second Zordak is indeed broken.  We'll have him fixed as soon as we can.<P><BR>KiarahRoM wrote:<P><B>"There probably isn't a perfect solution here. Let's see how this one works out.<P>Alan"<P>perfect solution:  make the container not lootable by anyone who does not have the pearl.</B><P>Perfect, except for the fact that it can't be done.  There isn't a way to link looting to items in the inventory with the current game system.  Nobody knows what the future holds, but right now we can't do things like this.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>"Perfect, except for the fact that it can't be done. There isn't a way to link looting to items in the inventory with the current game system. Nobody knows what the future holds, but right now we can't do things like this."<P>I beg to differ. We can only loot ONE LORE item. How would the "loot table" know I have one already unless they were not linked? I would beg to differ with your above statement saying it can be done with this chunk of code relating it specifically (through a Lore type link) to the pearl and the box. No, I am not a cleric, but I have played with them extensively.<P>Jenrai of the Nexus<BR>Ranger lost forever in the 45th Circle of Life<BR>Emarr</B><P>I just wanted to apologize for saying "can't be done" in this post.  Obviously given the time and resources such a thing could be done.  I should know better than to say "can't", especially considering the talent on our team.<P>The proper response is that it can't be done easily with existing code.  It would require new code to compare a list of dissimilar items (Lore only works on duplicates of the same item) and then only allow looting if one of the listed items exist in inventory.<P>It can't be done with the Lore code as it is.  In fact, I suspect it would be easier and more secure to write a new code for this.<P>However, there are other ways to handle this situation.  Many of the other suggestions would not require new code, just a few new items.  And, well, we have to look and decide if this is actually a problem that needs fixing.  We're talking about the order of the quest, not the difficulty.<P>In any case, we're still evaluating this quest.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

First let me say that it looks like the change for the spawn rate of the SolB version of ol' Rage didn't make it into the patch.  I'm sorry that it didn't happen.  We'll get him on the proper timer as soon as we can.<P><BR>A player wrote:<P><B>Is the cleric quest at the end working as intended?  When I say the end I mean the spawn in Skyfire.</B><P>Once the SolB version is corrected, then I'd be willing to say that the thing is working as intended.  I know that there is a desire for a more frequent spawn in Skyfire, but we just don't want the epic entering the world any faster than it does.<P>But, as I've said, we're going to keep our eyes on this and we'll change things if needed.<P>Alan<BR>
