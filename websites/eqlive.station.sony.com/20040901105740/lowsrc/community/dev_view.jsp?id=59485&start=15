<h1>The Sleeper (11-17-03)</h1>
	<P>Over the weekend several guilds gathered on Rallos to fight with the Sleeper.&nbsp; Unfortunately, their encounter was cut short due to an apparent bug.</P>
<P>I wanted to take a moment here and apologize to those that were there, and to those that have heard about the event through their friends.&nbsp; The bug concerned an NPC in the zone that appeared to have been causing the Sleeper to not focus on the player characters.&nbsp; The decision was made at the time to end the event.&nbsp; Further investigation has only served to make it unclear if this was a real issue or not.</P>
<P>I, on behalf of the company, apologize for any consternation this may have caused during your play time.&nbsp; If anyone is going to defeat the Sleeper, it should be done without any question about the validity of the event.&nbsp; We're very sorry that this first attempt was halted, but at the time it seemed like the best thing to do.</P>
<P>We have resurrected and restored those that participated.&nbsp; We have corrected the potential problem, and have reset the encounter.&nbsp; Other than that one potentially problematic NPC, nothing else about the encounter has been changed.</P>
<P>We want to wish those on Rallos that are planning to tackle the Sleeper the best of luck.</P>
<P>Send me some screenshots of all of you standing around the corpse, I'd love to post them on the site.</P>
<P>Thank you and thanks for understanding,</P>
<P>Alan<BR><BR><BR></P>P. S.&nbsp; Here are the pics:&nbsp;<A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=59558">Sleeper Pics.</A> <BR><BR>
