			Information Related to EverQuest Expansions
		</h1>
	
	This section contains information that applies to EverQuest Expansions and is new to the original game. The bulk of this information regards new or changed skills and abilities available to those who have purchased the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark upgrade or retail box, the EverQuest: The Scars of Velious Expansion and/or the EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin Expansion.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			20.1
			Sense and Disarm Traps (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	These skills now have use within Velious. There are traps, and they range from annoying to deadly throughout Velious. They are invisible and can only be detected and disarmed by rogues and bards. <BR><BR>Use "Sense Traps" to see if there are any traps in the vicinity. If so, you can then use "Disarm Traps" to try to disarm the trap. Once disarmed, the trap will remain inactive for a short period of time while your group passes through the area. <BR><BR>If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be directed towards the closest one. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			20.2
			Corpse Dragging (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence or risk. As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse is considered "assisting the enemy" by the inhabitants of the area. They will react accordingly.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			20.3
			Dragon Circles (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	Players in Velious will notice "Dragon Circles" in the Iceclad Ocean, the Great Divide, the Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar. These dragon circles are teleport locations for the wizard and druid teleports into Velious. <BR><BR>Dragon teeth were needed in order to teleport to these locations. That is no longer the case. As long as a druid or wizard has a spell to group gate a party to any of these dragon circles, all party members will be teleported as well, provided they have the Velious expansion. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			20.4
			Tail Rake (Ruins of Kunark)
		</h2>
	
	The "dragon punch" skill has been replaced by "Tail Rake" for Iksar characters.<BR><BR>
