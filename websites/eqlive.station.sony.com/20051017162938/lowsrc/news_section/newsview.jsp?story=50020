	<P>To Loral Ciriclight, the
  Hand of Tunare,<BR><BR>Your murder of Warlord Bormar has sent the trolls into a frenzy.&nbsp; They continue to arm themselves and
  spread word of your attack from their town crier.&nbsp; They cry for a new leader to retake
  Grobb.<BR><BR>However, your attempt to create a wedge between the trolls and the dark elves
  has partially succeeded.&nbsp; The
  trolls quickly blame your assassination on the weak guards of Neriak.&nbsp; A dark elf agent propositioned me to
  murder the trolls of Gunthak to further enrage the troll legions.&nbsp; It will only be a matter of time before
  the trolls learn of this treachery.<BR><BR>The weakness of Neriak's internal guard became clear when Tier'Dal troops
  marched on Freeport from the west.&nbsp;
  Adventurers banded together in the tunnels of the East Commonlands led
  by a powerful general named Eromreven of Shar Val.&nbsp; The adventurers fought bravely but
  they ended broken on the rocks of the Spine of the World.<BR><BR>I found the body of a decapitated Tier'Dal scout, one torn apart by
  Eromreven's warder and a warrior named Rebelwolf.&nbsp; On him I discovered a potion of
  illusions.&nbsp; When I took a sip I
  was horrified to see my beautiful visage transformed to look like you, a high
  elf.<BR><BR>From within Neriak itself, the High Necromancer, Xon Quexill seeks the bodies
  of Frogloks, both live and undead.&nbsp;
  He is unclear of his motivations but one can easily assume his
  intentions and research. </P>  <P>Even my own composure was
  shaken when I saw the flayed corpse of a young Froglok straining against
  leather bonds with death in its faded milky eyes.<BR><BR>All throughout the kingdoms of Norrath the criers call of war.&nbsp; So eager are the nations to press
  their propaganda that they now give the news away for free.&nbsp; They speak of a battle between high
  elves and the natives of Guktan over a ritual performed within the swamps of
  Innothule.&nbsp; They speak of a horror
  torn from the depths of the fetid ground, a huge horned creature with lidless
  eyes and enveloped in a cloud of green noxious gas.<BR><BR>It appears, under the illusions of their strange potions and the direction of
  Xon Quexill, the dark elves attempt to create a rift between the high elves
  and the guktans as you have done between the dark elves and the trolls.&nbsp; It will take much to restore alliances
  once word of this unholy beast reaches the frogloks.<BR><BR>You should be pleased to know that the council of Felwithe has heard your
  call.&nbsp; Troops of Felwithe mobilize
  in the forest of Greater Faydark with sun shining off of silver armor and
  steel weapons.&nbsp; Let us all hope that
  the silver shine does not soon turn red.<BR><BR>I expect thrice my normal payment delivered to my account by noon tomorrow.<BR><BR>Your servant,<BR><BR>Xarrak, Eye of the Shadow - Master of Spies</P>
