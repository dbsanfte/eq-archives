<P><BR>** New User Interface **</P>

<P>- Fixed the fatigue percentage Label to show 100% when you are not fatigued at all<BR>- Clicking to add new items to a stack in your inventory will now stack those items into the inventory rather than onto the cursor<BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to lose items when looting too quickly<BR>- Tracking window no longer shifts to the top every time an NPC dies<BR>- Training window no longer only shows the first digit of the amount needed to pay for training<BR>- Fixed the bug that was causing left clicking during mouselook to target<BR>- The 'hits mode' menu and filtering for it is done, including the options for normal, abbreviated and number/miss only for the six main melee filters</P>
<P>- UI Skin Creators: We added the following EQType labels:<BR>&nbsp;71 = Current AA pts available to spend<BR>&nbsp;72 = Current exp % being assigned to AA<BR>&nbsp;73 = Last Name of the player</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>** From Neriak **</P>
<P>An uncharacteristic silence descended across the Imperial District of Neriak, city of the Prince of Hate's children.&nbsp; Not so much an absence of sound, more the oppression of pure silence; an almost tangible potential crackling in the air itself, as a quiet before a tumultuous storm. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Nobles and commoners alike stood motionless in the streets, a look of confused expectation upon their upturned faces.&nbsp; The ghouls guarding the entrance of the Dark Academy chittered briefly to one another before melting into the shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>All eyes looked upon the Dark Tower of Sorcery, it's smooth stone walls seeming to almost pulse with a power from within.&nbsp; Darkened windows and oriels looked out upon the silent city of the Tier'dal, imparting an impression of amused malice. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Silence... interminable, suffocating silence...&nbsp; instantly broken by a deafening, mind-rending thundercrack, reverberating from the cavernous walls of the city, shaking the very foundation of every building with immense force.&nbsp; Blinding luminance, lancing forth from every aperture in the tower, burning the eyes of those foolish enough to look on, whilst the thundercrack pained each listener's ears. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Then, as soon as the cataclysmic burst had come, it vanished.&nbsp; The ringing in the ears of every dark elf within the streets below slowly subsided, to be replaced by a lone, maniacal stream of laughter echoing throughout the city from the Dark Tower's summit...</P>
