			Before You Cast a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Prior to casting, make sure you're ready (especially in a combat situation): <BR><BR>* Make sure that you have the spells you plan to use memorized (remember the <B><I>Alt</I></B> key pops up the names of the spells).<BR>* Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost it.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key (you never know when you'll need to hit something).<BR>* Make sure that you have already cast any pre-battle spells (armor or strength-boosting spells) that you might need.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <B><I>F8</I></B> to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><I>Green text</I>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><I>Light Blue text</I>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><I>Blue text</I>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it won't be easy.<BR><I>White text</I>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you could win.<BR><I>Yellow text</I>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><I>Red text</I>: You'll most likely die.<BR><BR><I>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a greater challenge.</I><BR><BR>
