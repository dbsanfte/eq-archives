	<STRONG>MAYHEM AND CHAOS REIGN ON EVERQUEST'S NEW PLAYER VS PLAYER DISCORD SERVER</STRONG> 
<P><EM><STRONG>You Can Run, But You Can't Hide -- Life or Death is the Only Option and the Last Few Players Standing Win</STRONG></EM>! 
<P>Norrath is normally a very safe, secure land. We're changing that. A new level of excitement and competition has been added to EverQuest. Discord, our new competition PvP server, is now live from December 19th to January 12th 2004. Since this new server will only be live for a few short weeks, the EQ team is challenging players to discover who amongst them is the fiercest wizard or warrior. 
<P>Discord is a hardcore Player vs. Player server, offering players fast-paced gameplay with the thrill of eminent danger and the agony of defeat. The battle begins December 19, 2003 and ends January 12, 2004 with the highest-scoring survivors proclaimed the winners. Battles are fought to the death and the slain will not be restored or resurrected for any reason. Any character slain will be recreated as a newbie and will have to start all over again. Corpse looting is allowed, but you'd better hurry, as all corpses will decay in 30 minutes. <STRONG>Each EverQuest account will be allowed one character on the Discord server. Players can reach level 50 with no Alternative Advancements, while an increased experience modifier will facilitate faster paced gameplay.</STRONG> 
<P>Points are based on the victims, not the killer. Players can only gain points from characters that are within 20 levels of them and higher level targets will earn more points. The point total is distributed evenly between each person in a group with any fraction of a point rounded up to a full point. Additionally, if your character is slain, half of your earned kill points are lost. 
<P>The top six surviving players with the most kill points on January 12, 2004, will be proclaimed victorious. The six victors will receive honors that will forever remind Norrath or their strength and bravery. The victorious will be bestowed the following prizes: 
<P>* A class-appropriate item will be named after each winning character in the upcoming EverQuest expansion, the Gates of Discord. As an example, a winning Ranger may have a magical bow named after their character, while a Wizard might have an enchanted staff given their name. 
<P>* Each winning character will receive their named item shortly after the new EverQuest expansion, Gates of Discord, launches. 
<P>* Winners will be allowed a one-time transfer of their character and all gear from the Discord server to another server of their choosing. 
<P>* Winning characters will be awarded a unique title that distinguishes them from their fellow Norrathians. 
<P>Discord is not for the weak or fainthearted, so there will be no in-game support; in other words, Game Masters will not be watching over your shoulder!
