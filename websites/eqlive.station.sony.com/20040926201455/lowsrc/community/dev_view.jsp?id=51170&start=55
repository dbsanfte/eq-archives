<h1>Bazaar functionality now on Test</h1>
	<BR>For those of you with a little free time, you might want to log into Test and try out the Bazaar.<P>Weve got the functionality in.  Now we need your feedback and bug reports.<P>If you see something broken or if you have an idea for an improvement, you can send them to the Dev Corner (or use /bug for bugs).<P>Thanks for helping us out.  We hope you like it.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Thanks for all the feedback so far.  Keep it coming.<P><BR>olavf-saryrn wrote:<P><B>First, let me qualify this by saying I don't have a charater on test server so I am sending this in hopes you can pass it on to the dev team.<P>2 issues come to mind that you might want to look into. <P>First, the traders sachels weigh 25 stone empty, that is 200 stone in weight before anyone even puts objects into them....How will characters be able to move with full packs?<P>Second...what if I want to sell 10 slot tailor made backpacks, or smithed tool kits, or any other containers? Can containers be placed in containers in /trader mode? <P>Just a couple of thoughts.....</B><P>Weight isnt an issue in the Bazaar.  When people carrying too much weight started to die going down a step, we took out a lot of the restrictions for weight in that zone.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bags cant go into bags.  There are two reasons for this.  One is that it would lead to infinite storage capacity.  Just as importantly, putting containers inside containers was known to cause the world to collapse back when it was possible (all sorts of bad things would happen to characters and their stuff).  And, well, nobody really wants that.<P><BR><B>For the PoTC quest there is a great demand for foraged items so my first thought was to try and sell these.<BR>If I set my character to sell food will the character starve or eat his/her profits away ?<BR>Does the old rule of the food in the first inventory slot being eaten first still apply ?<P>Hugs<BR>Mellissa<BR>Druidess of Tunare on Tunare</B><P>As far as I know, your character will continue to eat in the normal fashion.  So you might have to worry about eating yourself out of business.  At least folks selling baked goods will be eating well while they work.<P><BR>RZ_Ceric wrote:<P><B>Are items only in the trade satchels available for people to buy?<P>What if you have something in the bag that you forgot to price, will that be sellible for some default price?<P>Do the bags have to be in your inventory or can they be in the bank?</B><P>Only items in trade satchels can be sold, and those satchels must be on a character that is standing in a stall.  So, no, you cant sell things that are in the bank, and youll have to remember to get the items you want to sell into a satchel and priced.<P>Alan<BR>
