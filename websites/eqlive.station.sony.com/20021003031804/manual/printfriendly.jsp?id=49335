			Window Settings

	Each window has a settings menu that can be accessed by right-clicking on the title bar or on an 'inactive' part of the window (for example, you won't be able to open the menu if you click on one of the spell gems in the spells window, but you can click on the space between the gems). <BR><BR>Some windows have unique options on their setting menus. We'll discuss those under the description of those windows. But there are four options that you will always see when you open the settings menu for a window: Background, Alpha, Minimize and Close. Some of these options may be disabled for certain windows (for example, you can't close or minimize the Window Selector), and they will be 'grayed out'. Options that you can select will be displayed using white text. <BR><BR>
