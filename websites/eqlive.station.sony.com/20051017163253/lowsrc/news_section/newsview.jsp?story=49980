	The ground rumbles beneath the
  feet of many soldiers. From the west rises a massive army of fierce warriors,
  both corporeal and demons wrenched from Hate. Twisted faces filled with
  hatred march with heated anticipation of victory. Leading them through the
  icy hills is none other than the dark lady Lanys T`Vyl, her blood-red armor
  gleaming in the cool morning light.<BR><BR>Across the lands to the east, the great wizard Al`Kabor spearheads an army of
  light. Elven warriors and archers move forward with grim determination to
  keep safe the fair city of Firiona Vie. Resolve is etched upon every
  face; every elegant sword gleams with purity and truth. Meanwhile, back in
  Firiona Vie itself, the princess lays ill in bed. With her father Galeth
  Veredeth at her side, Firiona rests upon silken sheets, slowly gaining back
  the life that has been siphoned from her.<BR><BR>The air swells with silence as the colossal forces are drawn inexorably
  towards each other. An age has passed since a battle of such magnitude has
  been waged upon Norrath. An era has ended, one of peace and prosperity. The
  time of war is upon us.
