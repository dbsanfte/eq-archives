		<h2>
			8.5
			Giving/Trading Items
		</h2>
	
	You sometimes find that you
  need (or don't want) a particular item. You can sell or buy from other
  players. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves
  through the Trade Window. <BR><BR>No transaction is final until both players agree to it. <BR><BR><EM>To give away/trade/sell an item to another player:</EM> <BR><BR>* Open your Inventory screen (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and select an item or amount
  of coins (this should 'float' the item on your cursor).<BR>* Click on the character you wish to trade with.<BR>* This will open the Trade Window.<BR><BR>The trade window has two sections, one for the items and/or coin that you are
  trading out and one for the items and/or coin that the other character wishes
  to trade. At this point you may add or remove items or coins from this window
  as you see fit. <BR><BR><EM>Note: The Trade Window will close if you move too far from the other
  person.</EM> <BR><BR>Both players must click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the action. If either player
  puts another item into the trade window after one player clicks Trade, he/she
  will have to click the button again. <BR><BR><EM>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window
  are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect
  them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal
  as it is.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming
  items!</STRONG> If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra
  items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or
  obtain a container (such as a backpack). <BR><BR><EM>Note: Items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other
  Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items,
  and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing
  quests that give items as rewards.</EM>
