			Merchant Window

	Right-clicking on a merchant will open the Merchant Window (if you are close enough - otherwise right-clicking the merchant is the same as using /consider) and your Inventory Window. <BR><BR>The merchant's name appears at the top of the window, with a display of the items he has for sale below that. If you click on a item in the merchant's inventory, a picture of the item will appear in the Item Being Considered window at the bottom of the merchant window, and the merchant will tell you how much that item costs (text will appear in your Chat Window). Below that are the Buy and Done buttons. <BR><BR>To purchase something from a merchant, simply left-click the item you wish to purchase from his inventory then click the Buy button. If the button is grayed-out then you can't purchase the item, usually because you do not have enough cash. <BR><BR>To sell something to a merchant, simply left-click the item you wish to sell from your inventory then click the Sell button (the Buy button becomes the Sell button when you have an item in your inventory selected). <BR><BR>The Done button on the Merchant Window closes the Merchant Window and your Inventory. <BR><BR><I>Tool Tip: Pointing at an item in the merchant's inventory will tell you the name of that item.</I> <BR><BR><I>Note: Holding down </I><B><I>Alt</I></B><I> key will display all of the merchant tool tips.</I> <BR><BR>
