		<h2>
			19.1
			Guild Leaders
		</h2>
	
	Usually your first task as a
  new player is to find the proper non-player character guild for your class and
  meet its leader. When you hand over the right scroll, you form a lasting
  association with a group and agree to abide by its charter. <BR><BR>Player-created guilds have a leader (usually the creator) who invites other
  players to join. As the group grows larger, he or she can create officers to
  help manage the guild. <BR><BR>The best way to locate a guild leader for a guild you want to join is to ask
  other players. Search out another member and find out the best time and
  location to contact the guild leader.
