<P align=center>&nbsp;<STRONG>Gladiator Tournament Results</STRONG></P>
<P>The Second Annual GenCon EverQuest Gladiator Tournament was held in Milwaukee on August 8-11. This event was held in appreciation of our player base and showcased the skills of our players in head-to-head PVP combat. Hundreds of players competed in the Thursday and Friday Gladiator Tournament to see who could advance to the winners bracket at the end of each day.&nbsp; Eight combatants battled for a right to the title at the end of each day, with last years winner pressent to defend his title.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Allan Matthews won the first day of competition on Thursday gaining the right to return the next day for a battle against Friday's winner.&nbsp; Friday brought a whole new crowd to the SOE booth to face off in the last day of the Gladiator Tournament and witnessed Heather Funderburke winning some very close battles at the end of the day. She, along with the other winners, vied for the right to compete for a One year subscription to EverQuest and the title of "The Gladiator" to be added to one of their in-game characters. </P>
<P>The match was set. Alan and Heather faced off. The battle close and well fought to the end. Allan, using expert tactics defeated Heather in a bout that pitted thier two identically equiped level 24 warriors against each other. </P>
<P>Allan still had one more hurdle to get past to earn the title of The Gladiator. He now had to face Scot Yonan, last year's defending champion, who stood ready to defend the highly prized title. </P>
<P>Alan once again claimed a thrilling victory in yet another close bout. </P>
<P>Will Allan be able to defend that title next year? </P>
<P>All winners recieved a Golden Championship Ring for their primary play character as proof to all that they challenged the best and walked away in victory.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>Test of Tactics Results</STRONG></P>
<P>On Saturday, 32 teams of 3 members each signed up to take part in the first ever GenCon EverQuest Test of Tactics. Each team was provided a choice of identical level 51 characters from 8 different EQ classes to compete in team arean battle.</P>
<P>Claiming a final victory, laying wastes to their opponents, Team Darkstar claimed a Golden Championship Ring for their primary play characters. Their winning team consisted of a Ranger, a Rogue, and a Shadowknight.</P>
<P>Christian Peterson played the victorius Ranger and will present his championship ring to his character, Luldaas of the Innoruuk server. Daniel Kinnear took on the role of the Rogue and will adorn his character, Gnalpus of Tholuxe Paells, with the ring. Allan Matthews, already having proved himself as a Champion in the Gladiator Tournament, proved himself a cunning Shadowknight as well. He will present his ring to his character, Singme of the E`ci server. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>Wizard Battle Results</STRONG></P>
<P>On Sunday we changed things up and had level 51 Wizards face off in battle to see who would be the last one standing. At the end of this day, it was Joe Morgen claimed the Championship and the Ring for his charactr, Pappinin of Morell Thule. </P>
<P>The rest of the day we allowed anyone who dared take a seat and face some of our Dev team in a battle to the Death. In the end the Dev Team closed the day undefeated against everyone who sat down against them, but they did have a few close calls.</P>
