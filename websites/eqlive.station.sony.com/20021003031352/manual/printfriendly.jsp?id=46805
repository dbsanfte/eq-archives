	Normally, your respawn point is near your starting city. Binding (through the casting of a Bind Affinity spell) resets your regeneration point to wherever you're standing. Find a magically inclined player to bind you to a new location when you travel. Otherwise, if you die, you'll resurrect back in your original city, no matter how far away you were when you were killed.<BR><BR>
