<h1>Started out strong</h1>
	<BR><B>"In the coming weeks, we'll be adding more focus items to the game as quest rewards, trade skill items, and as loot off of monsters. There is a high chance that we'll be upgrading many existing caster items to include focus effects, to keep casters from needing to start from scratch with their gear selections."<P>That was posted upon 3/21/02, it is now 5/22/02.  The question that begs to be asked is where are these 'other' focus items?  To date the only non summoned focus item found is the 8th Shawl quest.<BR> <BR>You started off strong with caster balancing but lately...<BR> <BR>Bril</B><P>Sorry about that.  Its no excuse, but the reality is that we have a lot going on here, E3 not the least of them.  Its one rather complicated balancing act.<P>But I assure you that the work on balancing continues, as does the work on the new interface and the bazaar.  Im not going to be able to give you any solid dates, but hopefully well have more for you on all these items soon.<P>I have heard that the next steps in caster balance will be to finish up with pets, then probably move on to the priest classes for a bit.<P>Our desire is to do it properly, and for that well just need more time.  All I can do is ask for your understanding and sympathize with your frustration.  We all want this to be done so we can move on to the next thing, and the team is working very hard to make that happen.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Hey Alan, how's E3 going anyways, I've made it in the past (99 was my last one I think) but life doesn't allow me much travel these days. (I used to the  Siggraph, e3, comdex, nab et al circuit)<P>Anyways, just sitting here thinking about my favorite game, had a few comments come to mind:<P>About the balacing, bazaar, interface, and such "issues"... what I'm seeing a rather small company (Verant is still a small company, even with the backing of Sony) trying to do too many things at once. I think you'd have a better chance at getting thigs out on time if you'd make less "promises" and just started working on one project or 2 at a time. I understand research and developement must go on for future projects, but I personally don't care if the bazaar and new interface come out late, but as yet they haven't come out at all. If you really have 2 full teams, one working on each project, why not merge the 2, bust out ONE project, then focus on the next?<P>I thought of this as a distraction to cleaning my apartment, and thinking "why do I waste all my time trying to clean 4 rooms at once, when I should just clean one to completion, then hit the next?"<P>Consider it. I'm sure you all have a lot more business training than I do, but I've run a quite sucessful company on my own for over 5 years now and I cannot understand the logic of spreading your resources (programmers) so thin. <P>/cheer and good luck at E3, looks like Sony is about to murder the Xbox, and I'm sure Verant is putting up quite a show as well =)<P>my 2?<BR>-Doug</B><P>Im not going to E3 this year.  They didnt need me for the booth so I figured Id stay here.<P>As for resources, theres a reason we cant just drop everyone on one project at a time.  A lot of it has to do with job skills.  You dont really want our designers doing PoP art, and our programmers dont do class balancing (though they do have their opinions...).  So we just cant toss everyone at each project.<P>And, using your example, it wouldnt be all the useful to have 20 people cleaning your kitchen.  With any project theres a point where  more people dont add to the speed the work gets done, and more than that often slow things down.  Heh, just picture a gaggle of artists (thats the official term for a bunch of artists, I think) trying to model the same character...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And a lot of project timing is out of our hands.  We just cant ask them to hold off E3 for a month or two while we do other things.<P>I cant wait to hear the feedback from E3.  I think well impress at least a few people.<P>Alan<BR>
