		<h2>
			11.1
			Experience Bar
		</h2>
	
	You can keep track of your experience
  and view your current experience level in the Inventory screen. Even though
  your text display sends you a message each time you advance a level, it's a
  good idea to occasionally check your stats and level status. <BR><BR>The yellow/orange bar is the experience that you've gain toward the next
  level. The blue line just under the experience bar is a magnification of one
  of the five graduated lines (bubbles). This way, you can see more accurately
  your progress towards your next level.
