			Communicating
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest provides an ongoing
  source of social interaction. You can chat with fellow players on message boards,
  or talk to NPCs and other players within the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity
  &quot;hear&quot; you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text
  portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send
  private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and
  all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>To send messages to characters in the game:</EM> <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text
  cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message.<BR><EM>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode,
  which is the default setting.</EM> <BR><BR><EM>To talk to a non-player character (such as a shopkeeper NPC):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the
  Target Window), then press <EM><STRONG>h</STRONG></EM>.<BR><EM>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</EM><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate
  keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using
  those words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><EM>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using
  inappropriate language.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			7.1
			Talking to Merchants
		</h2>
	
	Merchants usually greet you
  when you first walk into their store or selling booth, but they don't often
  like to talk about anything outside of their immediate realm of existence (in
  other words, don't ask a merchant for directions or favors...). <BR><BR>Before talking to a merchant, you must target him or her. To do so, move the
  cursor over the merchant and click. To speak to the merchant, press <STRONG><EM>h</EM></STRONG>.
  To see what the merchant has for sale, right-click on the merchant. <BR><BR>For more about selling items to merchants, see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=buying">Buying/Selling</A>  Items.

	
		<h2>
			7.2
			Editing/Viewing Chat Text
		</h2>
	
	You can move the cursor or
  edit a line of text before sending a message: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Delete</EM></STRONG> = Deletes the current chat line.<BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Insert</EM></STRONG> = Replaces current chat line. <BR><STRONG><EM>Delete-Backspace</EM></STRONG> = Delete character to right / left of cursor. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Left/Right Arrow</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor left / right. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Home</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor to start of chat line. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-End</EM></STRONG> = Move cursor to end of chat line. <BR><BR>You can scroll through your most recent chat by clicking the scroll arrows or
  by using keys: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Up/Down Arrow</EM></STRONG> = Scroll chat history up / down. <BR><STRONG><EM>Shift-Page Up/Page Down</EM></STRONG> = Scroll up / down through chat text.

	
		<h2>
			7.3
			Chat Modes
		</h2>
	
	You can send messages using
  these chat modes by prefacing your message with the appropriate / command. For
  example, if you wish to Shout &quot;Hello World!&quot; to everyone in your
  current zone, you simply: <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to open the Chat Bar.<BR>* Type: /shout Hello World!<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. <BR><BR>Here some of the available chat modes. <BR><BR><EM>Say</EM> (Default): Use /say [text]. Sends your message to all nearby
  characters. This is the default chat mode, which means that if you do not
  specify a chat mode the game will assume that you want to use /say. <BR><BR><EM>Shout</EM>: Use /shout [text]. Sends you message to all characters in your
  current zone. Use this if you need to tell everyone trouble is coming, or
  need to locate your party quickly. Don't overuse shout, however - it can be
  annoying to other players. <BR><BR><EM>Tell</EM>: Use /tell [charactername] [text]. Sends your message to a single
  character. No matter how far away you are, that character receives your
  messages. <BR><BR><EM>Group</EM>: Use /gsay [text]. Sends your message to your group. This helps
  keep your group organized and informed, and no one outside of your group
  receives your message. All group members hear you, no matter where they are. <BR><BR><EM>Out of Character</EM>: Use /ooc [text]. For speaking out of the context of
  the game and your character. Use this if you're having a problem or have a
  question that doesn't pertain directly to Norrath. These messages can be seen
  by anyone within your current zone. <BR><BR><EM>Auction</EM>: Use /auc [text]. Sends a buy/sell message out to all players
  in the current zone. Use this if you've got something you want to sell to
  other player characters rather than a merchant, or to try to locate an item
  that you would like to purchase. Remember that auction messages are used for
  selling goods and materials, not for chatting. <BR><BR><EM>Yell</EM>: Use /yell. This sends a plea for help to players within very
  short range. You can't specify any text to send with the yell for help.
  Because this is used in emergencies, you might consider using the shortcut,
  /y. <BR><BR><EM>Guild Chat</EM>: Use /gu [text]. Sends your message to you guild. Only
  members of your guild will be able to see the message. Obviously you must be
  a member of a guild for this chat channel to be available.

	
		<h2>
			7.4
			Using Emotes
		</h2>
	
	You can appear to bow, be
  bored, point, or convey other visible gestures by using other special
  commands. EverQuest has a lengthy <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=emotelist">list of built-in
  emotes</A>, and some even trigger animations. <BR><BR>If you don't want to use pre-defined emotes, you can type in virtually
  anything. (Your character won't perform a visible action, but other players
  can see text that indicates your action). <BR><BR><EM>To use the built-in emotes, simply type in the appropriate command, such
  as:</EM> <BR><BR>/sit<BR>/dance<BR>/bow <BR><BR>These emotes may give different messages if you have a character targeted and
  if you have nothing targeted. <BR><BR><EM>To create your own emote:</EM> <BR><BR>/em [text] <BR><BR>For example (our sample character's name is Fippy): <BR><BR>/em scratches his nose.<BR>Would appear to those around you as:<BR>Fippy scratches his nose.

	
		<h2>
			7.5
			Using Different Languages
		</h2>
	
	All player characters in the
  world communicate using a Common Tongue by default, no matter who or what they
  are. However, most races also possess the ability to speak in a native
  language. <BR><BR><EM>To switch languages:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the Chat Window.<BR>* Choose Language from the list.<BR>* Choose the appropriate language.<BR><BR>Once you switch languages, only characters that also speak that language will
  be able to understand what you say. To others, your words will appear as
  gibberish.

	
		<h2>
			7.6
			Communicating with Pets
		</h2>
	
	Some classes can use spells
  to summon or enchant creatures and claim them as pets. Pets protect you and can
  follow a number of commands that you type in. See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=usingpets">Using Pets</A> for
  details.

	
		<h2>
			7.7
			&quot;Feeling Out&quot; Strangers
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest inhabitants can
  detect hostility from a stranger. This ability, called consideration, lets you
  know (through a text message) how a targeted NPC/player/monster feels about
  you. In general, this helps you assess your target's perception of you. It
  also comes in handy when you're considering whether or not to attack a
  monster or other player. <BR><BR>There are two ways to Consider someone. <BR><BR>* Click on the character or monster. Their name should appear in your
  Targeting Window.<BR>* Type /con and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>. <BR><BR>Or <BR><BR>* Right-Click the target.<BR><BR>You can Consider any NPC, player or monster in the game. When Considering
  merchants, however, you have to do so from a distance (or type in /consider
  with the merchant targeted) - right-clicking on one while standing too close
  displays his shop goods. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Player characters (on most servers) will always appear to be Indifferent.
  Also, if an NPC does not know you are there (through invisibility or other
  means) it will appear to be indifferent. That does not mean that he is
  actually indifferent, it just means that he can't see you. He might like you
  or hate you, however, once he knows you are there.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			7.8
			EverQuest Chat
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest's chat rooms are
  not accessible from within the game. Instead, click <STRONG>Chat</STRONG> from the
  Login screen (which appears when you activate the EverQuest desktop icon).
  You can use chat to speak to other players about the game and ask questions.
  Other players are often a great source of answers.
