  roleplaying game (MMORPG). [I wouldn't call it that, but I guess it depends
  where you're coming from - personally, graphical MUD calls to mind, for me,
  something that is chat-based with still pictures here and there.]</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.3 When was EverQuest released?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest was released March 16th, 1999.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.4 What EverQuest Expansions have been released, and what further
  expansions can we expect?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&reg; expansion was released April 24,
  2000. Since then it has become a part of the basic EverQuest package, and it
  provided more than twenty new zones, a new playable race of lizard men called
  the Iksar and raised the maximum player character level from fifty to sixty.
  EverQuest: The Scars of Velious&reg; was released on December 5, 2000. It
  provides nineteen more zones of content designed for characters of about 30<SUP>th</SUP>  level and over. For announcements about future expansions, head to: <A HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">http://everquest.station.sony.com/</A>.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.5 What is an RPG?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>RPG stands for Role-playing Game. People often debate what this really
  means, so we'll attempt to clarify what we mean. When you play EverQuest
  you'll first create a character. This creation of yours can be any one of
  twelve races and fourteen classes, male or female, and you even have the
  opportunity to adjust the character's attributes (for instance, how strong
  the character is, or how intelligent the character isn't). You'll then
  immerse this character of yours into our virtual world and make of him or her
  whatever you wish. You define your character's role in the lands of
  EverQuest, and how well you play that role it is up to you.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>People also often assume that RPG means a
  certain theme or setting. Role-playing can take place in nearly any setting,
  from heroic fantasy to space adventure. EverQuest is a more traditional RPG.
  Our world is one of high fantasy, of sorcery and dragons, of great wizards
  and marauding hordes of orcs. There are quests and puzzles to solve aplenty,
  but it's up to you decide which ones, if any, to pursue. You might choose to
  become a warrior bent on wanton destruction, or perhaps a merchant making his
  profit selling goods from one land to another. Essentially, while we've
  defined the setting, you create the world.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.6 What do you mean by 3D?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We realize that the term 3D is loosely used almost everywhere today. In
  reference to EverQuest, however, we mean it quite literally. Our engine is
  truly 3D - it is not a raycaster, nor does it use a pseudo-3D isometric view.
  You can walk completely around a house or any structure and then enter it,
  all the while adjusting the camera view between first person and any number
  of top-down or third person viewpoints.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.7 What is a &quot;massively
  multiplayer online game&quot;?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>While many modern computer games support multiplayer gaming, few are
  designed to support well over 1,000 simultaneous players. With EverQuest, you
  don't start the server program on a local network and invite a few of your
  friends over to play. Instead, you run the EverQuest client program and use
  the Internet to connect to our world servers. Call or email your friends and
  tell them what city or dungeon to meet you in or, better yet, log on and
  encounter hundreds of other people from all over the world and make a slew of
  new acquaintances.</P>  <P>That's EverQuest, and this is what massively
  multiplayer really means.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.8 What's a MUD?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons/Dimensions) are online text-based RPGs that
  have been around for several years. EverQuest is similar to these MUDs,
  except it was designed from the ground up to depict our world using real-time
  16-bit color fully texture mapped graphics, as opposed to merely a well
  written paragraph.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Also, while most of these MUDs are run by a
  couple of people as a hobby in their spare time, EverQuest is a professional
  and commercial product - our staff will be on hand to meet your needs both as
  a player and as a customer.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.9 Who are you guys? Where did </STRONG><EM><STRONG>EverQuest</STRONG></EM><STRONG>  come from?</STRONG><A></A><BR>989 Studios (formerly Sony Interactive Studios), responsible for PSX hits
  like Rally Cross and NFL Gameday, began development of <EM>EverQuest</EM> in
  March, 1996. In January, 1999 the 989 Studios PC and Online teams spun off
  and formed Verant Interactive, Inc., an independent online game development
  studio. During this period, Verant also developed <A HREF="http://tanarus.station.sony.com/"><STRONG><EM>Tanarus</EM></STRONG></A>,
  an online tank warfare game. In 2000, Verant became part of Sony Online
  Entertainment. The massively multiplayer online first person shooter, <A HREF="http://planetside.station.sony.com/"><STRONG><EM>PlanetSide</EM></STRONG></A>,
  was released in 2003, as will the highly anticipated <A HREF="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/"><EM><STRONG>Star Wars</STRONG></EM><STRONG>  Galaxies</STRONG></A>&#8482;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing

  Windows 2000? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest <EM>should</EM> run under Windows 2000, however there are still
  problems with some 3D cards, their drivers, and Windows 2000. EverQuest will
  not run under older versions of NT.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.10.2 Does EverQuest support operating
  systems other than Windows 9x? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>At this time there are no plans to support platforms other than Win9x
  (and Windows 2000).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.11 Which 3D cards do you support?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest uses both Direct 3D and Glide. Direct 3D is a 3d application
  program interface (API) from Microsoft that allows us to support most 3D
  cards currently on the market as well as future cards. Glide is a 3d API from
  3DFX and works with their cards (Voodoo Graphics, Voodoo 2, etc.).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.11.1 I am not a technical wizard -
  could you explain what D3D is?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Direct 3D (D3D) is part of DirectX, which is a software add-on to Windows
  9x that most modern games use. Direct 3D is the part of DirectX that allows a
  game or other program to utilize the various 3D cards out on the market. If
  you would like to learn a bit more about DirectX or Direct 3D please visit
  the Microsoft site and read the documentation. The address is <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/</A></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.11.2 Is a 3dfx card required to play
  the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>A 3D card is required, however it doesn't necessarily have to be a 3dfx
  card. Your card needs to be a Direct 3D compliant card, and should be at
  least as fast as a 3dfx card. You may want to consult some of the many
  articles, both on the web and in printed magazines, that compare and contrast
  the features, performance, etc., of 3d cards.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.11.3 What version of Direct X is be
  used?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest requires DirectX&nbsp;8.1 or newer.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.11.4 Does EverQuest support OpenGL? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest uses Glide (the native 3dfx API) and Direct 3D (Microsoft API
  that most modern 3d cards support). We do not support OpenGL (nothing against
  it, just with both Glide and D3D, there's no real need).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.12 Is the game downloadable or is it
  on CD?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>CD-ROM.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.13 What kind of music is there in
  EverQuest? MIDI files, or music directly off the CD?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest uses MIDI files and supports most major sound cards, including
  those that use MIDI sound fonts.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.13.1 Has any consideration been given
  to the use of 3D sound in EQ?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes - EverQuest supports 3D sound using Direct Sound 3D. We support both
  EAX and A3D.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.14 Is game info saved on servers or
  on our hard drive?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Servers. We are very sensitive to the fact that hackers exist, and have
  implemented several plans, including maintaining important information on the
  server side, to guard against them.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.15 How much of the world is actually
  on the client side? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Basically, like any other game, the graphics and world are on the client
  side but your critical data like characters are on the server side. Static
  information that isn't going to change is on the client side. And that
  typically is most of your graphics. You don't want to be downloading those
  all the time.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.16 Do you have enough servers to meet
  demand?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We do our best to see to it that there are a sufficient number of servers
  available. We have been adding new servers at a fairly rapid pace to keep up
  with demand. We will continue to do so.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.17 Are there hot keys or programmable
  macros in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.18 Do you plan to continuously update
  the game even this long after its initial release?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Absolutely. The world of EverQuest will continue to be a constantly
  evolving and expanding universe.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.18.1 Are the patches real time as
  you're playing the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The game checks your version when you log in and updates it then. If
  we're doing a major change, we will do our best to notify you in advance when
  we'll have the servers down for that purpose. Other, more minor changes, can
  be made within just a few minutes, sometimes only requiring certain zones to
  go down, instead of the entire server.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.19 How much will EverQuest cost me in
  the stores?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The MSRP is currently $39.99, but it is up to the retail store to set
  retail pricing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.20 Is there a monthly fee to play
  this game? And if so, how much?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We currently have several pricing plans:</P>  <UL>   <LI>&nbsp;</LI>   <LI>$12.95 per month <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>$35.85 for three months <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>$65.70 for six months <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>EQ included in <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/allaccess/">SOE All Access Plan</A></STRONG>       - $21.99 per month </LI>  </UL>  <P>You may also extend your current EverQuest subscription for an additional
  12 or 24 months by signing up for the new EQ 12 or 24 month plan&nbsp;- and
  reap great savings off of the new rates:</P>  <P>Extend for 12 months for $119.95 US (a 23% discount off of the new monthly
  rates).</P>  <P>Extend for 24 months for $199.95 US (a 35% discount off of the new monthly
  rates).</P>  <P>Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don't miss out.</P>  <P>All pricing plans (except for the 12 and 24 month extension plans) are
  recurring, meaning you will continue to be billed at the appropriate
  interval, until you cancel your subscription. Note that purchasers of the
  full game will receive their free month of game play after supplying valid
  billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the free month,
  no charges will be made to your credit card.</P>  <P>New York State and Texas residents will be charged sales tax.</P>  <P>All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the
  heading &quot;SOE*EverQuest&quot;. If the card is MasterCard, Visa, Discover,
  or JBC, <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/allaccess/">SOE All
  Access Plan</A></STRONG> charges will appear on your credit card will show as
  &quot;SOE*All Access&quot;. If the card is Amex, it will show as &quot;SOE
  All Access&quot;.</P>  <P>Please note:</P>  <P>The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You will
  need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online at the <A HREF="https://store.station.sony.com/">Station Store</A>. The price of the
  game will vary depending upon the store.&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In addition, you get a free month upon signing
  up.</P>  <P>In addition to the fees described above, if you
  are a resident of an European Union&nbsp; country, you will also be charged a
  VAT tax equal to 17.5% of the applicable fee.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.21 Is there a manual with EQ?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, a full manual is in the box. You will also find updates to the
  manual in your EverQuest folder in text and MS Word format, under the names
  eqmanual_supplement.txt and eqmanual_supplement.doc.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.22 How does the EverQuest staff
  handle player complaints about lost equipment due to bugs?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Our GMs and Guides are available via the /petition command in-game. In
  the chat window type /petition &lt;text&gt;, where the &lt;text&gt; is a full
  description of your problem. These petitions go into a queue and are answered
  in the order they are received. When the bug is verified and the GMs are able
  to further verify that you actually lost something, they may be able to
  replace it.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.23 Does the EverQuest team actually
  play the game or do they just take input from their &quot;playing&quot;
  designers?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>When we assembled the team we made sure many of the artists, programmers,
  and world builders were into this genre. Since those early days, we have
  always placed high emphasis on ensuring that designers have an understanding
  of this game from personal experience. Accordingly, almost all of them play
  the game quite often. This is a game we've all wanted to make <EM>and play</EM>  for many years.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.24 How did you build an online
  cohesive society in EverQuest? What elements do you think will add to this
  environment?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We think the focus we have on this not just being a player vs. player
  game but rather also a very cooperative game has helped to build a sense of
  community. Allowing people to group, to talk to other party members, and to
  talk to people regardless of where they are is a great aid to finding and
  keeping friends in game. And the ability to split experience amongst members
  of a group adds to this as well, giving people a bonus for playing together.
  Also, keeping the server population down enables people to recognize names
  more easily.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>1.25 Are you trying to create a
  &quot;realistic&quot; world for EverQuest? That is, are you attempting to
  create a living, breathing world &quot;simulation&quot; where non-player
  characters have their own daily schedules, the world has its own interactive
  &quot;ecology&quot; and there is an overall dynamic &quot;economy&quot;? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, but only where it really adds to gameplay. EverQuest is not an
  experiment or a simulation, and our focus is on making the game world fun.
  Our emphasis is on adventure and exploration, and making sure the game
  mechanics are fair and enjoyable. Game balance definitely takes precedence
  over any attempt at creating a super realistic virtual world.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>2.0 About the beta test.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>2.1 What phase of beta testing are you
  at currently?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The EverQuest beta test is now over - the final, which was Phase 4, ended
  March 12th, 1999.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>  <P><STRONG><U>3.0 Features.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.1 What's the screen resolution for
  the game and number of colors?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>640x480 16bit color (that's 64,000 colors). 800x600 and 1024x768 modes
  are supported on some 3D cards. If you have EverQuest: The Scars of
  Velious&reg; expansion, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 modes are supported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.1.1 I absolutely love the graphics in
  the screenshots I've seen on the Internet. I have noticed, though, that most
  game designers who dedicate too much time to graphics lack good artificial
  intelligence (AI) in their monsters, etc.</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Well, here's what one of our beta testers had to say on the subject of
  EverQuest's AI:</P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><EM>&quot;I have seen many game
  companies striving toward a graphical work of art often overlook the basic AI
  of the opponents. This has not been the case in EverQuest. This game has the
  most advanced AI I've seen. Bar none. Even the little intricacies that make
  the game more believable were taken into account. As I am battling one
  creature (say a large bat for this purpose), I've seen a giant rat come up to
  me, stop, and watch the fight as if sizing me up. You really get the feeling
  that these things are looking you in the eye, and trying to decide if you are
  dinner, or something to be feared.</EM></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><EM>Some attack without
  warning, others circle in from behind. Still others will act like they are
  going to go right past you, and suddenly turn around and lay into you with swords,
  fists, or teeth. The AI definitely appears to be modeled on creature
  intelligence, some just fight smarter than others. The smart ones will even
  retreat from a fight and go get help. I have no doubt that the AI programmer
  is somewhat of a sadist. A sadist with a sense of humor.</EM></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><EM>You'll know that sense of
  humor when you see a hill giant way off in front of you in the distance, and
  2 minutes later find that it has made a wide circle to sneak up on you from
  behind.</EM></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><EM>Add to this some truly
  impressive tracking and following code, and SPEED. These creatures are FAST.
  There just isn't any outrunning some, you better hope you have the strength
  or the speed to get away quickly, and they will follow you for a great
  distance. I have seen one gnoll retreat from a fight, go get helpers, and
  return on two different tangents to surround the intruders. I've seen groups
  split up, half appearing to have lost interest in the fight, only to turn and
  rush in.</EM></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><EM>I've really got to put my
  hats off to this AI programmer, I think he could give the ReaperBot guy
  pointers.&quot;</EM></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.2 Can we run the game at higher
  resolution if we have the horsepower for it?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, you can run at 800x600 and 1024x768 if your 3D card supports those
  resolutions. If you have EverQuest: The Scars of Velious&reg; expansion, you
  can run 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 if your 3D card supports those resolutions.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.2.1 Does high resolution cause more
  lag if I am only using a modem (assume a very fast machine and SLI Voodoo2)?
  Does more information need to cross the phone lines if in high-resolution?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The resolution you run EQ in has nothing to do with Internet lag -- the
  exact same amount of information is being passed between your client and the
  server. But a higher resolution might reduce your framerate (the number of
  times your picture updates in a given period of time). Better hardware will
  increase your framerate, so you need to balance your resolution and display
  options for the kind of hardware you have.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.3 How big is the game world?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Huge. From the beginning, it took a very long time to walk from one end
  to the other. Our first expansion added an additional 40% (in terms of
  geography) to the existent world, and the most recent one has added about 20%
  of <EM>that.</EM> And, we plan to keep on making it bigger by filling in
  empty portions of existing continents as well as adding more lands and planes
  and such.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.4 What kind of communication is there
  in the game? Can we send messages privately or broadcast to the entire
  server?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You'll be able to do the following:</P>  <UL>   <LI>&nbsp;</LI>   <LI>Say things to people in
       your general area (use /say &lt;text&gt;). <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Shout things across the
       zone you are in (use /shout &lt;text&gt;, /ooc &lt;text&gt; for out of
       character comments, or /auction &lt;text&gt; for auctioning and bidding
       on items). <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Tell someone a message
       privately (use /tell &lt;name&gt; &lt;text&gt;). <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Say things such that only
       people grouped with you can hear (use /group &lt;text&gt;) <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Say things such that only
       people in your guild (if you are in a guild) can hear (use /guild
       &lt;text&gt;) </LI>  </UL>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.4.1 How exactly does communication
  work, i.e., when a character says something how will nearby characters see
  it?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>If a character says something, any other players nearby see it displayed
  in their chat window.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.4.2 Are chat programs like ICQ or IRC
  automatically disabled during the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest runs in full screen mode and doesn't allow task switching in
  order to deter the use of third party software that may be used to modify
  EverQuest gameplay.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.4.3 What happens to the people who
  follow you around spamming you, etc.?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can type /ignore &lt;character name&gt;, and then you won't see his
  spam anymore. If harassment persists, please use the /petition command to
  report the problem.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.5 The game is server based - can I
  switch servers to go meet friends on another server?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. But you will have unique characters on each server. So a player can
  play on any server he wishes, but characters can not travel between servers.
  There are times, however, when we give players the option to move their
  characters permanently to another server to help alleviate crowding.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.6 Are there other ways to travel than
  walking? Horses, boats or teleport spells?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Ships and horses at this time, yes. Horses will be available in the
  Shadows of Luclin expansion pack.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.7 When traveling in the wilderness
  between towns, is the player's view first person throughout the entire period
  of travel, or is there an overhead view of the map of the region?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Traveling long distances is exactly the same as walking around a city or
  dungeon. The views themselves are the same throughout the game - you can choose
  from first person or from several third person viewpoints. But there are no
  overlay maps available to the player in EverQuest. You'll have to learn the
  landmarks for areas just like your character would, by going there and
  looking around.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.8 How does combat work; is it real
  time or turned based?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Real time, but we must stress that this is not a 'twitch' game. It won't
  matter how quickly you can click that mouse button. Weapons have speeds, and
  they will 'go off' (e.g. swing, fire, etc.) at that speed. It's like playing
  the piano to a metronome - it's real time, but you can't exceed a set pace.
  Every weapon has a speed. A dagger attacks quickly with generally low damage,
  where a big two handed sword hits harder, but swings more slowly.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.8.1 So EverQuest isn't a
  &quot;twitch&quot; game - does this mean there will be no advantage to having
  quick reactions (at least in melee combat)? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Well, you can't rule out the player's reactions completely - he or she
  does have to control the game either via the keyboard or mouse. But the
  emphasis is definitely on the character's statistics, items and class
  abilities, not the player himself. Weapons and spells have speeds, characters
  have attributes and skills, and these are the components of combat. The game
  is in real time, but not at the pace of a shooter like Quake or Unreal.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.8.2 Does your sword or other weapon
  swing automatically?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. We call it auto-attack, which allows you to concentrate on different
  skills and other combat options in the heat of battle. For instance, warriors
  can kick and monks have a lot of special attacks. It allows you to do those
  while you use your basic swing automatically.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.9 Will someone with a better
  connection have an advantage over someone with a poor connection?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Not normally, no. Certainly having a better connection will reduce lag
  and some warping, but it typically won't put you at a disadvantage
  necessarily in terms of game play. The exception being some high level
  gameplay involving very large numbers of players in combat, where a lot of data
  is being transferred to your machine over the Internet. These cases are rare,
  and for normal gameplay as long as you are connecting to our servers with a
  28.8 bps connection or better, your gameplay will be much the same as
  everyone else's. We have designed the game such that we aren't sending out
  more data than a 28.8 can handle. Also, we've done several things to reduce
  lag, including using very mature network code (descended from our Tanarus
  game), as well as keeping the number of people down per server, to reduce
  server lag.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.10 Is there night and day and how
  long does an EverQuest day last in real time?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, there is night and day - the entire cycle is approximately 72
  minutes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.11 How dark is night? Do I need a
  spell or torch to see at night?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Well, many areas are lighted, but if you're talking about whether you can
  see with no torch or spells in the bottom of a cave, I'd say no. Unless your
  chosen race has infravision or some other form of special night sight.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.12 Is there an active economy in the
  game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, there is an economy in EverQuest, primarily player-driven. Prices in
  the player-driven economy will change according to supply and demand -
  typically if an item is offered for sale more often than bought the price
  will go down.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.13 Is there weather in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, it can rain, snow, and also be foggy.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.13.1 Do you take damage from the
  elements without proper protection (e.g., frostbite and cold damage on
  Velious without proper clothing)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Not exactly. Certainly there are specific spells that will do
  elemental-type damage to a character. Right now at least, there are no
  weather effects that cause harm to a character, however, there are certain
  'elements' that can cause a character harm, such as lava.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.14 How many cities and other zones
  are in the game? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest was launched with twelve cities and over seventy zones total in
  which to adventure. EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&reg; brought that total to
  over a hundred. Nineteen more zones were added in the EverQuest: The Scars of
  Velious&reg; expansion, for a total of about 120 zones at this time. Some
  zones were added as free, downloadable add-ons, such as Paineel and the Hole.</P>  <P><STRONG>3.15 EverQuest is playable from
  different viewpoints. Has any thought been put into ensuring that no one
  viewpoint has an undue advantage over another?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It's pretty hard to look down a hall or a tunnel or a street in the top
  down view. Also, there's a lot of information and detail in the background
  textures that you might miss if you're not in first-person mode. By their natures,
  different views have different advantages and disadvantages.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.15.1 Has the EverQuest development
  team done what they can to ensure a player won't be unduly hampered (or
  favored) by his or her choice of view?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>If a person were to stick to any one view they would be at a
  disadvantage. EverQuest features several different user definable camera
  views that a player can switch between depending on the situation. &quot;Hmm,
  I can't tell whether or not I can jump across this ravine... (toggle to top
  down view) Oh man! That is farther than it looked in first person view I
  better find another way.&quot; Or (in first person view) &quot;Get ready!
  There is a band of orcs coming out of the forest!&quot; (I would not have
  seen them if I were in top down view until they we almost upon me.) So yes,
  if you stick to one view, and only one view, you will probably be at a
  disadvantage when compared to someone who takes advantage of all the possible
  views.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.16 How do we control our characters?
  Keyboard, mouse, joystick, or a combination?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Keyboard or mouse - we also support mouselook. Many players favor a
  combination of both mouse <EM>and</EM> keys.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.17 Is there a screen capture utility
  in EverQuest?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, just hit the '-' key on your numeric keypad and a .bmp file will be
  written to your EverQuest directory with a name that consists of EQ and a
  sequential number, beginning with zero.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.18 On the creatures page there are
  deities. Is there some kind of religion in EQ?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are many different religions, and deities who represent each.
  Actual &quot;<EM>worship</EM>&quot; is not really involved, but your
  character chooses a deity (in some cases you can choose to be agnostic)which
  can make gameplay slightly different, depending on the choice.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.18.1 Do religions affect how I should
  role-play my character in some ways?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>How you role-play your character is up to you. But non-player characters
  are very aware of your choice of deity, and some of them will react to the
  religion of your character. Some may be pleasant, and others might be willing
  to kill your character over it. So it is probably best to choose a religion
  that suits the nature of your character, and be ready to accept the reaction
  that this choice will cause in the citizens of Norrath.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.18.2 Are there specific places of
  worship for each of the deities in the game? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Throughout the lands of Norrath you will find temples dedicated to the
  various gods of the pantheon..</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.19 Can you give us hints as to the
  story line? What will be one's purpose in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There's no set story line as such, just a vast history and background to
  the world. The players make the stories by interacting with the world.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.19.1 Is there a central plot or just
  mindless wandering and killing things?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is a rich history, plenty of quests, and also the ability to
  mindlessly wander and kill things.- It's up to the player to determine how
  involved he wants to get.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.19.2 Have all the religions/race
  histories been completely written by the EverQuest team? Do you accept
  submissions, maybe doing contests?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The religions and histories of the world before the player characters
  arrive has already been written, and since that time, more historical events
  have taken place. The historical (significantly affecting the world in some
  more or less permanent way) events are created by the Quest Masters in conjunction
  with the design team, and implemented by the Quest Team with the help of the
  Customer Service staff. There are, however, hundreds of other events that
  take place every day which are conceived, designed and put into place by and
  for players (such as bazaars, contests, weddings, guild events and much more)
  themselves. The Harpy's Head Tavern will very likely be accepting and
  displaying player fiction at some time in the near future. Contests are also
  distinct possibilities for the future.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.20 Is mouselook supported in 1st
  person view?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.21 Are towns closed after dark, </STRONG><EM><STRONG>a
  la</STRONG></EM><STRONG> Daggerfall?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22 When adventuring can we form
  parties?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. You are encouraged to form parties, and many dangerous areas are
  more safely accessible when players form parties - in fact, some exotic
  places require several parties to survive.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22.1 What about people who prefer to
  play solo? Is the solo player &quot;crippled&quot; to the point of
  unplayability or are you just limited in where you can go and what you can
  do?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You are a bit limited in where you can go and what you can do (especially
  in more difficult areas), but definitely not 'crippled' - there are
  definitely race/class combos in EverQuest (troll shadowknights come to mind)
  that do fine as a solo character. But keep in mind that EverQuest has been
  built as a cooperative game, and grouping is encouraged and rewarded.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22.2 Is experience shared among party
  members? And how?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. It is split up according to the level each character is at the time.
  The higher the level, the larger the share of experience split.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22.3 If I'm in a party and we kill a
  monster, is the experience shared the same way as if two people not in a
  party kill a monster together?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, it's different. Only the party or individual that does the largest
  percentage of damage to the creature will gain experience upon its death. You
  will want to group up when fighting monsters. Consider this: a warrior makes
  the kill, but a cleric has been healing him - the cleric should get some
  experience too. If the two are not grouped, the cleric will not gain any
  experience for the kill.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22.4 Is there a limit to the number
  of players that can be in a group? If so, how many?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Groups are limited to six party members.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.22.5 Is there a command to divvy up
  the gold the group (party) collects? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. Use /autosplit to automatically split monetary treasure as it is
  looted from the corpse of your fallen opponent. There is also a social key
  which can used for this purpose (just click on the &quot;socials&quot; button
  near the bottom right of your interface). When money is split, the coins the
  NPC carries are divided up as evenly as possible, with the leftovers going to
  the person doing the looting. If three people are in a party where an NPC
  carries four silver, for example, the two non-looters will get one silver
  each and the looter will get 2 silver. NPCs do not make change.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.23 Are there huge underwater areas,
  sort of like an underwater continent?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Not an entire continent, but entire zones, yes. Underwater combat
  requires interesting strategies. And underwater zones are pretty exciting to
  explore as well.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.24 Is there a notoriety system in
  which one can tell thieves and murderers apart and so they are punished by
  the law or a bounty system?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, however we would hesitate to call it a <EM>notoriety</EM> system,
  because it works very differently than other systems you might have seen. In
  EverQuest there is a faction system. Certain NPCs are aligned with certain
  factions. Upsetting one member of that faction will upset all members of that
  faction, and pleasing one member of that faction pleases all members. If you
  murder an NPC who has a circle of friends, those friends will remember what
  you have done.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.25 Are there any plans for special
  servers just for those players who role-play &quot;properly&quot;?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Probably not. The debate as to what constitutes &quot;proper&quot;
  role-playing is eternal, with few who agree with each other.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.26 Are you able to see the names of
  others just by looking at them?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, names and the guild to which a character belongs (if any) can be
  optionally displayed, appearing over characters' heads. In addition, there
  are some other indicators you may see, such as &lt;AFK&gt; when a player is
  away from his keyboard and has used the /afk command, and &lt;LD&gt; when
  they have gone linkdead for some reason. If you choose not to see those names
  for whatever purpose, you can turn off the display of player names or
  non-player character names (individually) by using your display options.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.27 Is there a &quot;rent&quot;
  system? Are there restrictions as to where you can rent, and will the items
  you rent with have upkeep?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can camp anywhere, although it takes thirty seconds to do so. There
  is no upkeep on items. You can't rent space, such as apartments, in
  EverQuest, but each character does have an individual bank space, upon which
  no rent is paid.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.28 Are there central meeting places
  like taverns or fountains to meet other people? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. There are many landmarks players have come to use as meeting places,
  with taverns and banks among them.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.29 Are there player owned vendors in
  the game, and do they have a weight and item limit? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We don't feel that there is a need to make merchants 'officially' for
  characters to be able to sell and trade items, nor do they require any
  additional abilities. Basically, anyone can be a merchant or a vendor.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>3.30 How have you prevent the gaining
  of wealth by continually creating new characters for their starting items? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>When you begin the game, your character starts out with items that are
  neither tradable nor droppable and are of no value. No coin is given to
  starting players - that is earned by selling items gathered from killed NPCs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>4.0 Characters.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.1 How many characters can one person
  have on one account?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Eight per server.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.2 If I have more than one character,
  can I have both online at the same time and trade between them?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, you may only have one character online per account at any given time.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.3 Will character improvement be skill
  based or level based?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Both skill and level based.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.4 How many classes and races are
  there? And what are they?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are thirteen races: barbarian, dark elf, dwarf, Erudite, gnome,
  half-elf, halfling, high elf, human, ogre, troll, wood elf, and Iksar (Note,
  if you never obtained an expansion after the original EverQuest came out, you
  will not have access to the Iksar lands or race.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>There are fourteen classes: bard, cleric,
  druid, enchanter, magician, monk, necromancer, paladin, ranger, rogue,
  shadowknight, shaman, warrior, wizard.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.4.1 Is there a possibility of adding
  new races/classes as the game expands?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Absolutely. As was mentioned before, the Iksar race was only
  &quot;discovered&quot; after adventurers found the continent of Kunark. We
  look forward to adding quite a bit to the game.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.5 Can a character be multi-class like
  a warrior-mage?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are some hybrid classes, like paladins (warrior-clerics), and
  shadowknights (warrior-necromancers) but there are no true multi-class
  characters <EM>a la</EM> AD&amp;D.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.6 Are certain classes reserved for
  certain races or can all races be of any class?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, certain classes are reserved for certain races.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.7 Will there be alignment in the
  game? And how much of an impact will it have on gameplay?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is no alignment in EverQuest, but we do have a faction system. It
  is a complex system of allegiances that determine the reactions non-player
  characters have with each other and with player characters. It's not the same
  as an alignment in the classical role-playing sense. But the religion of
  characters and non-player characters is considered as a part of that system
  and the actions of a character will change their faction.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.8 Can we play male or female
  characters?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.8.1 Are there inherent differences
  between male and female characters?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Choosing male or female only affects your appearance, and not necessarily
  your gameplay (other than the way you personally choose to role-play). There
  is no difference in the statistics or options given to male or female
  characters.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.9 Are we able to select how our
  character looks? I mean eyes, hair and such?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are currently eight faces per race/gender from which to choose.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.10 Are clothes, armor and weapon
  visible to other players?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. But due to some restrictions imposed by our decision to support as
  wide of a selection of computers as we can, we have chosen not to display
  some item types. For example, at this time cloaks are not displayed on
  characters, whereas breastplates and boots are displayed.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.11 Can I have a shop or be a
  blacksmith like in Ultima Online?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is no &quot;blacksmith&quot; class or official occupation per se,
  because we don't feel this is necessary. Any player at any time is welcome to
  sell or trade items, and there are in-game features to accommodate players
  who like to do this often. There are several trade skills in the game,
  however, including blacksmithing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.12 Is there a set of attributes we
  select at the creation process that will remain the same through the game
  like intellect, strength and so on?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, there are basic statistics that cannot be changed after character
  creation, including strength, charisma, stamina, wisdom, intelligence,
  dexterity, and agility. These can only be increased or decreased with special
  items and spells.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.13 Am I able to put a biography on my
  character for when people look at me?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. In order to do so, use a camera angle which permits a view of your
  character, then right-click it as if to inspect yourself. When the inspection
  screen opens, you will be able to click in the black box in the lower right
  hand corner and type your description. Please remember that the player rules
  of conduct regarding language in Norrath apply here as well.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.14 Does my character age? And if he
  does can he die of old age?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.15 Can my character eat and is it
  actually required to survive?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, your character can and will need to eat. However, eating and
  drinking is not tedious, and one cannot actually starve to death although it
  will have an effect on his stamina. Food and water are automatically consumed
  from your inventory as they are needed. As long as your character has the
  supplies he needs in his backpack you don't need to worry about feeding him,
  he'll do it on his own.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.16 Can my character sleep?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are ways to rest in the game, but your character does not need to
  sleep.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.16.1 Does resting replenish hit
  points?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, but having a healer of some kind as a friend is more efficient.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.17 Are we able to wear disguises?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can alter what you wear, which will change your appearance, and some
  classes are capable of casting certain spells which change their apparent
  race, but, no, you really can't be disguised in such a way that a character
  standing in front of you will not know who you are. Unless the other player
  has the PC name display turned off, they will still see your name.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.18 Is there a maximum level my
  character can attain?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Currently, the maximum level is 60, unless you have never purchased an
  expansion set for EverQuest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.19 How many items can I wear or have
  equipped?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are twenty-one body locations in which to wear items, as well as
  general inventory in which you can hold containers that allow you to carry
  even more.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.20 When our characters gain
  experience will they change forms or change into a higher form in the class,
  e.g. wizard-sorcerer, knight-paladin?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Above level 50, a player's class name will change based on what the former
  class was. Other than that, no.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.21 Will there be a location available
  to a &quot;medley&quot; of races to begin their adventure in Norrath, or will
  all starting characters be &quot;restricted&quot; to geographic areas based
  on race?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Some of the races have more than one starting location, but there is no
  one starting point for all races.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.22</STRONG> <STRONG>What is the
  &quot;name filter&quot;?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The names you choose for your characters in EverQuest need to fit in a
  setting of high fantasy. Also, names must be unique - no two characters can
  have the same name on the same server. Please refer to our Naming Policies on
  (<A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.station.sony.com</A> ).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.22.1 What if I switch servers and
  some one has my name on the new server?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The person who was on that server first will get to keep the name - you
  will have to choose a new name on that server.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.23 How will height affect combat?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Negligibly, though taller races may have to look down in order to see
  shorter opponents.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.24 Does a character take any damage
  from high falls into water, or does the fact that the player lands in water
  negate damage from any height?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>If you fall far enough, even into water, you will take damage.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.25 Do races have bonuses associated
  with being in their preferred environment? And drawbacks relating to the
  environment as well (e.g. dark elves in sunlight)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We don't have that particular sort of drawback, but there are some, yes.
  For example, humans have a tougher time seeing in dark areas because they
  don't have any special form of night vision.</P>  <P><STRONG>4.26 Are players able to save their
  player info at any time to avoid crash losses?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, however, the servers save character data whenever anything
  significant changes about them, to reduce the chance of a server crash
  causing losses.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.27 Can GMs address problems caused by
  the game? If I lose skills/stats/items from bugs, can a GM restore me?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>GMs are able to fix problems resulting from bugs if that bug is
  verifiable. And we feel it is important that we are able to verify the vast
  majority of bugs and address (i.e. fix) how negative effects on the game and
  gameplay. Please refer to the GM/Guide FAQ on ( <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.station.sony.com</A> ).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.28 Is aiming at specific parts of the
  body a part of combat? What about special attacks such as tripping your
  opponent or impaling him with a pole arm? Or is it just
  stick-the-pointy-bit-into-the-soft-bit? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is more to combat than just swinging your weapon - there are many
  combat related skills that can come into play during combat, but aiming for
  specific locations is not part of EverQuest's combat system.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.29 Is there a kind of &quot;super
  class&quot; (e.g. If you are a high enough level necromancer, could you
  complete a special quest and become a lich)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest has always been about &quot;balance&quot; and whenever we make
  changes in game, they are intended to balance classes as well as possible
  without homogenizing them completely. If we ever create this sort of
  possibility (and who knows what may happen in future?), we can assure you
  that the new class will have both advantages and disadvantages and would not
  be properly classified as a &quot;super&quot; class.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.30 Do races have different languages
  and if there are can we have spells to translate ?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are languages and skills associated with understanding those
  languages; there are currently no spells that translate languages in the
  game.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.31 In the case of a paladin are there
  certain acts that, if committed, would strip the paladin of his bonuses, thus
  becoming a fighter?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. The worst that might happen is that his guild or members thereof
  would change how they feel about him based on negative factions.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.32 Are certain armor/weapons off
  limits to mages (e.g., no mages in full plates wielding 400 lb halberds)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are race and class restrictions to items.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.32.1 Can paladins and shadowknights
  (both hybrid classes that can fight well and use magic) cast spells while
  wearing plate or other heavy armor?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Both classes may cast in full plate, and even pure magic-users can still
  hold staffs and such while casting (no, they can't wear plate). Why? Because
  it becomes very tedious, regardless of 'realism,' swapping items in and out
  all the time before casting.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.33 Can clerics wield weapons?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, they can wield blunt weapons such as maces.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.34 Trolls traditionally have innate
  regeneration - do they in EverQuest and what does it do?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, trolls heal (get their hit points back) more quickly than do other
  races.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.35 What exactly are shadowknights?
  Are they similar to paladins (warrior/clerics) or more like the traditional
  anti-paladin?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Shadowknights are warrior/necromancers, not warrior/necromancer/clerics
  (that would be too powerful). Nor are they warrior/evil clerics because we
  didn't want them to just be stereotypical anti-paladins - we wanted them to
  be something new and different.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>4.36 After looking at all of the exotic
  races one can play in the game, why would someone want to play a human?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are several reasons, the significance of which will depend on what
  one wants out of a character, of course. Among the best of these is that
  innate ability in one more areas is offset by deficiencies in other areas;
  for example, if a player's priorities lie in the area of brute force, then
  s/he is likely to play a troll or an ogre, but with the drawback of a very
  low intelligence. Dark elves, who can see in the dark and who tend to make
  excellent magic-users, are generally despised by many of Norrath's
  inhabitants, which makes it more difficult for them to find merchants who
  will sell them anything, or even purchase any goods they might have to offer.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Humans, on the other hand, are probably the
  most well-rounded race in the game. While it is possible for a human to excel
  at and specialize in some class or trade, they are comparatively neutral in
  their inborn statistics, so while they don't have the strength of an ogre or
  the enhanced senses of an elf, they don't suffer any special drawbacks,
  either (comparatively speaking).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>  <P><STRONG><U>5.0 Skills.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.1 Are all skills available to all
  classes or races, or are some race or class specific?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Some skills are available to all races and classes, such as swimming.
  Some, however, are available to only certain races and classes; for instance,
  sneak is only available to the rogue class.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.2 Can you tell us some of the skills
  in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The skills are listed in the manual as well as on the web site (<A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.station.sony.com</A>). The
  manual is available on the web site in Acrobat Reader's .pdf format, but it
  is also available in text and MS Word 97 formats for printing. Chapter four,
  which you can get to by a link from the manual table of contents, contains
  all the skill information.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.3 Do I have all the skills available
  to my character at the beginning or do I need to learn them?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You start with some and you earn others as your character progresses.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.4 How do I learn new skills? From
  NPCs or can other players teach me? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>To learn new skills and improve on old ones, you must find a trainer in
  your class, or practice the skill as much as possible. Some skills you must
  train in, at least once, before you are able to use it at all.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.5 Do skills deteriorate when not
  used?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.6 Is dual weapon combat available?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Dual wielding is a skill some classes get.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.7 How will skills be raised? Will it
  be on a level/distribute points scale or more along the lines of practice a
  lot while you level?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so much per
  level, and certain skills aren't available to the player until he reaches
  certain levels.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.8 What miscellaneous skills are
  there? Are there other arts like bandaging?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are a lot of skills, many related to combat, and many non-combat
  related skills as well, including the binding of wounds. Please see the skill
  listing on the web site (<A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.station.sony.com</A>)
  for a complete listing (answer 5.2 has more details about the location of
  this information).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.9 Is swimming available to all races
  or is it limited?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>All races can start out with swimming as a skill.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.10 How are skills activated? Are they
  automatic or do I have to use them manually?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Some skills trigger automatically, while others are activated manually.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>5.10.1 If some are manually activated,
  how will I access them? Buttons, quick slots, hot keys, or what?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>In your interface you have quick slots which can be used for any sort of
  skill by creating a hotkey out of a button found elsewhere, or by typing in a
  command.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>6.0 Magic.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.1 How many types of magic are there?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are five primary types of magic.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.2 Can you tell us some of the spells?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Sure: levitate, water breathing, healing, Shock of Frost and other
  offensive spells.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.2.1 Why haven't you released an
  in-depth listing of all of the spells and their effects for each class?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Many of the spells are listed in the manual that comes with the game,
  however, we do not plan on officially releasing a full list. We would
  consider that a spoiler, in that many of the spells are hidden and must be
  quested for in-game. And some of the fun of discovery comes with using a
  spell for the first time to discover exactly what it does.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.3 Is magic mana-based, or do you use
  reagents or spell books?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The magic system is primarily mana-based, however some spells require
  components (both consumable components and non-consumable components,
  depending on the spell). Spells are stored in spell books, from which the
  caster memorizes them. All of a caster's spells can be kept in the spell
  book, but only eight of them can be memorized at one time.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.4 Do I have all the spells available
  to my character at the beginning or do I need to learn them?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You start with some; you earn others as your character progresses.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.5 How do I learn new spells? From
  NPCs or can other players teach me?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can find or purchase spell scrolls and then inscribe that scroll into
  your spell book.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.6 Do spells deteriorate when not
  used?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.7 Can I create new spells?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Research is a skill available to certain classes, which may result in a
  &quot;new&quot; spell, but there is <EM>not</EM> an unlimited ability to
  create spells that do not currently exist in game.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.8 Can I enchant weapons? </STRONG><A></A><BR>No, although we'd like to add that ability to the enchanter class in the
  future. Enchanters can, however, enchant/create jewelry. And magicians can
  summon temporary magical weapons.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.8.1 Is that all the enchanter is good
  for, enchanting magic items?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. The enchanter class is a very valuable member of any party.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.9 Area of effect spells - will PKers
  be able to kill non-PKers with them?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, PvP area of affect spells will only affect other PvPers and NPCs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.9.1 How are area of effect spells
  handled? Are my group members immune from my area of effect spells? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, they are immune from offensive area spells cast by a caster in their
  group, unless you and your party members are PvP enabled.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.10 Can you elaborate on how balanced
  magic and non-magic attacks are?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No one class has an inherent advantage over the other. A mage might beat
  a warrior under certain conditions, and vice versa.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.11 I hear that you have tried to
  emphasize the use of ships for long distance travel, instead of making a
  transport type of spell commonly accessible?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Teleport spells exist, but they are fairly high level, somewhat hard to
  come by, and a bit expensive to cast.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.12 Concerning spell targeting, do
  spells automatically hit the target or is some actual aiming required in
  order to hit your target with a spell?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>They will automatically target, however, that doesn't necessarily mean
  they always successfully hit the target. Line of sight and distance are
  important factors in the casting of targeted spells.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.12.1 From how far away can I cast a
  spell on a target?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It depends on the spell.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.13 Can a necromancer summon, command,
  or create undead?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.13.1 Is there a limit as to the
  number of undead a single necromancer can create/control at one time, and if
  so, does greater experience allow you to create/control more?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, characters are limited to one 'pet' at any given time. The higher
  the level, the more powerful the undead - it's not the quantity here, but
  rather the quality.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.14 Do spells cast instantly or do
  they have a casting time?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Different spells have different casting times. There is also a recovery
  time for every spell, so that you may have to wait a little while before
  starting to cast the same spell again.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>6.15 Are clerics just traveling
  healers?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. Clerics are pretty formidable fighters who can wear armor and wield
  maces.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>7.0 NPCs and creatures.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.1 How much interaction is there with
  the NPCs? Do they just sell and buy stuff?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>They do a lot more than that, including providing in-game information and
  quests.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.2 Can you kill NPCs?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, and that's fairly integral to the game.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.2.1 If an NPC dies, will it be
  replaced by another, or will it just return? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The NPC may or may not return right away, nor will he necessarily be in
  the same place.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.3 Do monsters all act the same during
  combat? Do some retreat when hurt, or follow you until either they are dead
  or you are?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The latter, depending upon the intelligence and type of monster you are
  fighting.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.3.1 Is there a change in monsters and
  NPCs depending on time of day?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It depends on location. Some places have daytime guards and nighttime
  guards, while one notorious forest has a completely different (and much more
  dangerous) set of monsters during the night hours. So there may very well be
  lots of changes. Some NPCs move around, too, so it would be difficult not to
  perceive some difference in how areas are populated.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.3.2 Do NPCs treat different members
  of a group differently, depending upon the level of the party member or for
  other reasons?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Again, it really depends on their intelligence. Certain NPCs will always
  go after spell casters or clerics. Certain NPCs will go after the last one to
  hit them really hard. Certain NPCs, like an animal, will attack whatever is
  closest since they don't know any better. Certain ones will flee at certain
  times while others will fight to the death - it all depends on the NPC. While
  levels aren't always factors in the differing behavior, they may be at times.
  When you are several levels higher than some NPCs, they won't attack you any
  more at all (no doubt out of fear), so if you are sufficiently high but have
  a lower level player in your group, that same NPC who ignores you might
  attack the other guy.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.4 Do NPCs use magic?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Some, yes. If they do, you can certainly expect them to have some combat
  related magic as well.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.5 Are some of the creatures/monsters
  the same races and classes as our characters? I mean can I fight a human mage
  NPC?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.6 How many types of monsters are
  there in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are currently over 250 non-player characters (NPCs) -- see the
  Bestiary in the almanac on <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.station.sony.com</A>  section for a partial listing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.6.1 Is that 250 NPCs or 20 types with
  palette swaps?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>That's over 250 different character figures. There are things like a lion
  body with two different head models (for lion with mane or lioness without),
  and there are many more with different size or textures. Most of these have
  multiple texture sets, creating hundreds of different NPCs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.7 Can I hire an NPC to protect me? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Magicians can summon elementals, and necromancers can raise the dead -
  these creatures can be instructed to protect their master from harm. But, no,
  NPCs are not for hire, in general.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.8 Are there animals, and if so, maybe
  a taming skill?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are animals, and other monsters, and these animals may be charmed.
  (please read the description of enchanters)</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.9 Traditionally orcs, goblins, and
  the like have a hierarchy of leaders. What most fantasy games lack is the
  portrayal of this system. In EQ, do beasts travel in packs with obvious
  leaders and obvious goals (e.g. to acquire gold, hunt for food, etc.)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The more intelligent the monster, the more intelligently it will act. We
  have put a lot of effort into our NPC AI system. We may not have achieved a
  level of AI that makes it completely obvious which orc is the leader and what
  his motivations are, but there is certainly a feel for which is the most
  powerful and most dangerous.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.10 Do &quot;evil&quot; races such as
  trolls, ogres, and dark elves, have towns and cities that reflect their
  general alignment? Like killing members of other &quot;hated&quot; races on
  sight? Or perhaps some other method to discourage unwelcome tourists?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are definitely hatreds between some of the races on the world of
  Norrath, and those races would not allow each other to enter their cities and
  other areas they control. While the guards of any given city are extremely
  loyal, the more money-conscious merchants may be a little more tolerant.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.11 Is it possible for a member of an
  unwelcome race to sneak into another race's city and stay out of sight to spy
  or something?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, it certainly is possible under the right circumstances for an
  unwelcome race to sneak into another race's city.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.12 Are there outside GMs (in other
  words, GMs that don't work for Verant)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>In a way, yes. The Guide Program began early in beta and at the time
  consisted almost completely of volunteer customer service representatives.
  Early on, Game Masters were assigned to each server to work with the
  volunteers. The program has been extremely successful thus far, and is a very
  important part of our customer service infrastructure. There are no plans to
  have actual Game Masters who are not located onsite.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.13 Can a player flee from guards if
  they're fast enough? If guards are not invincible, will they team up (call
  for back up) if they are losing?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It is possible that you could flee successfully from a guard, and yes,
  they will team up on you if they can.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.14 If someone is attacked by an NPC
  and runs to town to obtain help from the guards, will a guard kill the
  monster with one hit?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>That would depend on how powerful the monster is and how powerful that
  particular guard is. But in most cases the city guards do their best to
  defend their citizens.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>7.15 Do guards &quot;spawn&quot; like
  they do in UO, or can a group kill off the guards of a city and effectively
  fend off the other guards by, for example, sinking their ship when they
  attempt to retake the city?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>For the most part, guards do 'spawn' back into the city, they don't come
  back in from the outside (so 'defending' a city from the guards isn't exactly
  as you describe it). But it might also be possible to take a city and defend
  it from the guards as they spawn.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>8.0 Items and properties.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.1 Are there some magic items in the
  game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Not just <EM>some</EM>, but literally thousands.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.2 Are some items unique, where there
  is only one in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, we call them artifacts. They will be awarded rarely to characters
  who do remarkable things, often as a result of some historical quest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.3 Are there some weapons or armor
  that are the best in the game? Will everyone be wearing the same armor or
  using the same weapon because it's the best there is? Or will armor and
  weapons have advantages and disadvantages?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>'Best' is subjective and relative to what the player wants for his
  character. It is also situational. If one item gives you fire protection, it
  may be essential in the volcano level, but useless in the underwater zone. In
  addition, there are some classes who can't wear all types of armor. Our races
  come in three sizes, as well, and armor may not always be available in every
  size.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.4 Are all items useable by all races
  and classes?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Some are, some aren't. Weapons can be set to be usable by only particular
  races, classes or chosen religion.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.5 Do weapons, armor and other items
  wear out with use? If so, do we have a blacksmith skill or a spell to repair
  them, or will some NPCs be able to do it?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is no item decay in EverQuest, but there is a blacksmithing skill.
  You will be able to create items, but will have no need to repair them.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.6 Is there player owned housing in
  EverQuest?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.7 Do a long sword, broad sword, and
  short sword all look the same or do they each have their own look?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Many items have different appearances, both in the 3D world and as icons
  in the inventory screens.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.8 Is there ship-to-ship combat? If
  so, are there projectile weapons and spells for crew members, or do ships
  have their own methods of attack (e.g. cannons)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, there is no ship to ship combat in EverQuest. The emphasis in
  EverQuest is on interacting with your character and other characters, not on
  vehicles.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.9 Are we able to interact extensively
  with our environment? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We are very happy with how interactive the world is, and just how many
  places you can go. But if you are asking whether you can burn down buildings
  or defoliate the landscape, no.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.10 Can people purchase 'safety deposit'
  boxes or some such in order to store items and other valuables?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>One can store items and money in banks, which are typically found in the
  various cities of Norrath. The bank vaults are free and the use of each is
  limited to the single character who owns it, but there are no rentable
  storage spaces.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.11 Are boats hollow? Will things be
  able to be stowed away below deck, and will you be able to go down into the
  boat?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The larger ships can be explored and have rooms and such, but you cannot
  store items on ships.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.12 Are rivers barriers to travel
  without swim skill? If so, how do bridges/ferries come into play (as
  strategic chokepoints)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There will be ferries and bridges and you can swim. But, for the most
  part, only bodies of water as large as oceans and some lakes are truly
  barriers to travel without a boat.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.13 Is there an upkeep associated with
  owning a house? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can not own housing in EverQuest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.14 How does the money system work?
  i.e. just gold, or gold, silver, and copper, all of certain worth?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Platinum, gold, silver, and copper. Also, some gems and such. There is a
  ten to one ratio of value between successive currency. So ten copper have the
  value of one silver, ten silver have the value of one gold, etc.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.15 Can we log off safely on ships?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, sailing is a very dangerous method of transportation and it is not
  uncommon for a monster to attack a ship at sea, or for the ship to lose
  passengers in various deep waters. Actually, in most situations if you log
  off on a ship, your character should end up back on the dock. If you die on
  the ship, however, the corpse will drop to the bottom of the ocean as soon as
  the ship hits a zone line because a corpse is limited to the zone in which it
  was created.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>8.16 Are there public ships/caravans
  that can take you safely from city to city or continent to continent?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Not as such. In a few places there are guards who travel routes the
  player characters take, and traveling with them makes your journey much
  safer. At this time there are no 'caravans' per sebut there are large public
  boats that take characters from continent to continent and you can always
  round up a party of players to go with you.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>9.0 Quests.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.1 What kind of quests can we expect
  in EverQuest? Simple quests, like go fetch something for an NPC, or more
  complex quests that will require either teamwork or finding clues as to how
  to accomplish the quests?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Both.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.2 Are the quests generated
  automatically or are there GM-run major quests once in a while?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Both.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.3 How are the quests reset? I mean can
  I do the same quest over and over?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can some repeat quests to some extent, however, others are restricted
  by level. GM-run quests are sometimes historical and in such a case, will
  only ever be run once per server.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.4 Are quests be reserved for larger
  guilds, or are there NPC dictated adventure for those who opt for a
  party-based system? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are be plenty of quests for all sorts of people, whether
  individual, or in parties, or members of large guilds. On each server is a
  representative who schedules and organizes various non-historical quests,
  usually from three to five a week. Historical quests are done less often, by
  members of a special Quest Troupe with the assistance of the server GM and
  Guides. In order to prevent favoritism, there will never be quests designed
  specifically for any guild or person(s) other than those minor quests run on
  some servers for players who wish to change back from PVP to non-PVP status.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.5 You mention that GM's are able to
  provide quests/adventures for any player at any time. However, how do you
  actually accomplish the feat of having GM's provide quests for 1500 + players
  per server? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Our GMs are not providing custom quests for players. They have a pool of
  quests (containing hundreds of quests that can be run at varying intervals)
  which have been written by GMs, guides, and other customer service
  representatives and which have all been approved by the Quest Masters. Each
  server has a Quest Coordinator among its volunteer customer service staff who
  arranges for quests to be done on a regular basis. They try to spread them
  out throughout the day, in order to accommodate our players from around the
  world.</P>  <P><STRONG>9.6 Are there bulletin boards in the
  towns that tell of quests and things that are occurring?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are bulletin boards in some towns, but these are for players to
  use, our quests are not announced using them. For the most part, in fact,
  events and quests are rarely 'announced'. Spontaneity is important, and
  crowding caused by announcing such things tends to make them far too
  unwieldy. More often than not, there will be a few &quot;actors&quot; running
  around emoting or shouting to get some attention when a quest is beginning.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.7 Are there raids/bands of orcs, or
  whatever type of monster or race? If so, are they real raids as in attacking
  towns and such? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.8 Where can I report QUEST problems?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Email us! <A HREF="mailto:eqtesting@soe.sony.com">eqtesting@soe.sony.com</A>.
  This email is for quest problems only, no HINTS will be given out. Use this
  address to report anything from bugs to spelling errors that occurred while
  following or completing quests. When reporting bugs, please include the
  following information (when applicable)(the more, the better):</P>  <UL>   <LI>&nbsp;</LI>   <LI>What server this
       occurred on. <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Your character's
       name/level/deity/and starting city. <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Your character's dialogs
       and the NPC's responses. <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>The NPC's exact response
       when turning in quest items (for each item, if more than one). <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>Your email address so
       that we may contact you if we need more information. <BR><BR><BR></LI>   <LI>The exact names of any

       happened (if possible). </LI>  </UL>  <P>Please be aware that we may not reply to your
  email. We often get hundreds of emails reporting the same problem, and just
  don't have the time to reply to them all personally.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.9 Can I stack items and turn them in
  for a quest?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. Items should NEVER be stacked when giving them to an NPC for a quest.
  Also, items should NOT be stacked in containers that &quot;COMBINE&quot;. One
  example, Brin Stolunger of the Qeynos warriors guild asks players to get 5 Snake
  Scales and 5 Bat Wings. There must only be ONE of an item per slot, filling
  up the container, THEN 'combined' to make a new item that Brin will accept as
  a quest item. Always read the quest VERY carefully before attempting to turn
  in the items.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.10 Should I give all my quest items
  at the same time?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes. Do NOT give an NPC a quest item, then go adventuring for a few hours
  and come back with another quest item. NPCs do not remember who gave them
  what item, and reward the player who turned in the last item to complete a
  quest. If you give three quest items to an NPC, and another player gives the
  fourth, then that player will get credit for completing the quest that you
  worked so hard on. When doing a quest, store items in the bank until you have
  gathered them all, and then give them to the NPC.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.11 Why does the NPC say, &quot;Thank
  you very much&quot; when I turn in a quest item?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>When give an NPC an item and he/she gives the generic &quot;Thank
  You&quot; text, this means that the item was NOT a quest item OR the NPC
  ALREADY has this quest item and is waiting for the others to complete a quest
  (see previous question)</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>9.12 If the NPC asks for a Large Snake
  Rattle, will any snake rattle work?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>NO. &quot;Large Snake Rattles&quot; are NOT the same as &quot;Giant Snake
  Rattles,&quot; a &quot;Ruined Blackburrow Gnoll Pelt&quot; is NOT the same as
  a &quot;Blackburrow Gnoll Pelt,&quot; yet, people often make this mistake.
  Writing down the exact item(s) needed by an NPC for a quest is good idea.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>10.0 Guilds.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.1 Are there guilds in the game? Are
  they game-operated guilds like a thieves' guild or just player run guilds?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Both.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.2 Are there special guild functions?
  Like ranks or the ability to buy a guildhall?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There are ranks and special guild communication commands, but there are
  no guildhalls.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.3 Can guilds have special clothes or
  uniforms, or a logo on their shield?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. They do, however, have the option of showing their guild name behind
  their player character name, above their heads.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.4 If my guild becomes very big and
  active, will there be special quests for it? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, although there may be static quests that exist in game, or dynamic
  quests you may run across in which your guild may be involved. Designing and
  holding quests for specific guilds, and then awarding special items for
  completion of that quest would not be fair to all players.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.5 What is the government like in EQ?
  Are there company rulers (Like Lord British and Blackthorn), or could players
  start their own government? If so, do you support them in some way, give them
  tools or such?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is no overall ruler of the lands of Norrath - there are many kings,
  dukes, lords, etc. ruling different parts of the land. As for players
  starting their own government, they could take over an area, and attempt to
  hold it and enforce their own laws should they choose to do so (as long as
  they do not interfere with the player rules of conduct, of course).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.6 Can guilds declare war and fight
  without interruption or penalty?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It depends where they choose to conduct their battles. A guild war in the
  streets of Qeynos will not be tolerated by the guards.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.7 Is there some way that newbies are
  introduced in-game to other newer players to adventure together, or is
  everyone just be thrown into the common &quot;town center&quot; to fend for
  themselves?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>EverQuest is a game with an emphasis on cooperation and group play,
  however we don't feel we can force players, new or otherwise, to interact
  with others. We can only provide the tools to make it easier for them to do
  so (the fact that you can send a &quot;tell&quot; to a person anywhere in the
  world, &quot;gsay&quot; to people in your group, sharing experience with
  people in your group, etc). The fact that new characters all start in town,
  where other new characters start, at least gives them a good chance to find
  each other, if they choose to do so. You can also use other commands to find
  players of your class, like - /who who all enchanter - which will give you
  all enchanters on your server. You can narrow it down by typing a level
  number, such as 5, like so - /who all enchanter 5 - which will give you all
  level 5 enchanters in game. Most newbies just use /shout in their newbie zone
  to ask for hints.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.8 Are guilds officially recognized
  in some way in the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes - you can see the guild name displayed next to the player name.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.9 Do you work along with famous,
  very dedicated guilds or players? Perhaps honor them with a role of a villain
  for players to battle against, or give the guild special privileges? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Again, this goes along with our need to be fair to all players and
  groups. We try never to do for one player or group what we would not try to
  do for all players or groups. The unfortunate part of doing such things is
  that all too often it allows for the perception of favoritism and even that
  can be very disheartening to those who are on the outside looking in.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.10 Is there a way for players to
  declare their own quests in game through a sort of world wide notice? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We encourage the use of player run web sites for this purpose.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.11 Is there be a limit to the number
  of official guilds on the game? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>There is a limit, yes. This is created by the fact that guild data is
  data that the servers need to use, that needs to be passed to the client, and
  that needs to be searched and modified. The more data, the longer it takes to
  do these things. Guilds are created on a first-come, first-served basis, and
  must meet certain requirements (see our&nbsp;Guild Page in the Customer
  Service section&nbsp;for more details). If guilds fail to maintain their
  membership requirements, they will be removed from the system and they no longer
  count against the limit.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>10.12 Is it okay to have a multi-race
  guild?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Sure, you are welcome to make a multi-race guild.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>11.0 Pkilling and other player vs.
  player issues.</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>(note that in this section two new
  terms are used: +pvp and -pvp (pvp stands for player vs. player). Previous
  FAQs have used the term PK and non-PK. Essentially, +pvp means PK, and -pvp
  means non-PK).</STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.1 Is player killing (PK) allowed in
  the game?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Player killing is a subject that is debated constantly on the net, and
  both sides to this eternal argument have great points. We want to accommodate
  both gameplay styles (player killing and non-player killing. So, soon after a
  player creates a character, he or she can choose whether they want to
  participate in player killing or not. If they choose not to, then they will
  be immune to other player's assaults, and can only die in battle against
  NPCs. But those who like the added danger of player vs. player competition
  can simply create their character with player killing switched to on and then
  do battle with those who have chosen similarly.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>There has been some concern that this feature
  could limit freedom and role playing, but if you really think about it, the
  bottom line is that the only thing you can't do in EverQuest because of the PK
  switch is kill another player who doesn't want to be killed. And while this
  will purposely curtail the few who can only have fun at the expense of
  others' enjoyment, the rest of us can go ahead and have a great time playing
  the game, regardless of whether our personal definition of role-playing
  includes player vs. player or not.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>We also have created PvP servers. On these
  servers all player characters are PvP enabled, and there is no option to
  switch to non-PvP status. Be aware of this when choosing which server to
  start your new character on.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.2 I've heard about this PK switch.
  How does this work? Is it something you select at the beginning when creating
  your character or is it something one can toggle on and off at will?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Shortly after creating your character, you have the option of becoming
  +PvP (by completing a very simple quest). If you choose not to PK, only NPCs
  can kill you. If you choose PvP and change your mind later, it may be
  possible to switch back, but it will require a long and hard series of tasks
  to switch back to -PvP. These quests can only be granted by a GM.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.3 If I have my PK switch set to
  -PvP, can I heal a friend while he fights another player?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. But a PvP player can heal and cast beneficial spells on any
  character, regardless of his or her PvP status.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.4 Can I steal items, or pickpocket,
  with a -PvP character? Wouldn't that make it impossible for people to
  retaliate? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You may not steal from another player if you are -PvP. You can, however,
  steal from NPCs. If you are +PvP, you may steal from both +PvP players and
  NPCs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.5 Are there negative consequences to
  Pkilling? Like getting arrested in cities, not being able to shop, and other
  similar deterrents?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Only if you are caught in the act by a city guard or some other NPC who objects
  to the killing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.6 Are some areas safe-zones or can
  you be killed anywhere - even in shops?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No safe-zones, but there will be consequences if you do it in civilized
  areas.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.7 Are there any environments where a
  -PvP player can challenge another -PvP player? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, there will be arenas and other locations where -PvP characters can
  fight one another, but generally the victor will be unable to loot the
  loser's corpse. Also, a -PvP character can challenge another -PvP character
  to a duel, and if both consent, they can fight to the death just as if they
  were +PvP.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.7.1 Can someone I'm dueling have his
  or her friends heal them during the fight? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, no one else may interfere in any way.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.7.2 Is there the possibility of
  allowing multiple people to participate in duels? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Guildwars allow multiple people to fight one another under the same sorts
  of regulations that govern dueling.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.7.3</STRONG> <STRONG>Isn't dueling
  technically PKilling? Why should someone who is -PvP be allowed to duel?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>The -PvP option is designed to allow adventuring without the necessity of
  dealing with non-role-playing attacks from PKs. The dueling option is meant
  to further player interaction in a role-playing context. If someone you've
  never met or heard of challenges you to a duel, and you think it is out of
  context, you have a right to refuse the challenge. If, however, a particular
  player has really started to bug you (or vice versa) in a way that makes
  sense within the gaming parameters, you can interact with that player in an
  aggressive manner without having to relinquish your -PvP status.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.7.4</STRONG> <STRONG>Given the
  dueling option, could not EverQuest just eliminate PKilling completely?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Well, we could, but this method allows players who get a thrill of living
  dangerously the opportunity to do just that with other like-minded
  individuals. +PvP players don't need to request a duel with each other - they
  can just start swinging.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.8 Is there an in-game explanation
  provided for the PK switch(e.g., the blessing of a god of peace, or something
  like that)?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes - there is a force (or forces) of Discord in the world, and its
  Priests grant powers to some, with the inherent drawbacks included.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.9 Are EverQuest GMs biased against
  pkillers, and do they interfere with a player's game play?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We really don't have pkillers on any of our regular servers. Those
  players who enjoy being able to fight one another have all signified that
  choice and it is obvious by the color of their names. The customer service
  representatives have no reason to favor or neglect either type of player.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.10 Is there a reward for killing
  staff people?</STRONG><A></A></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Customer service representatives are prohibited
  by their own policies from being involved in combat alongside or against
  players while in their GM/Guide personae. Only in the presentation of a
  dynamic (either historic or non-historic) quest would they be permitted to do
  so.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.11 What are the consequences if you
  PK a lot, randomly?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You must live with whatever reputation you earn in EverQuest. Considering
  the group nature of gameplay, being unable to make friends is a very big
  penalty all by itself.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.12 Is there an option to enable a
  player to tell if another character is +PvP or -PvP?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Yes, a +PvP character will have his name displayed in red.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.13 Any chance of there being a way
  for +PvP players to kill -PvP players, maybe by contract or something?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.14 Are races balanced such that one
  race is not that much stronger than the others in player vs. player combat?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Well, balancing the races and classes doesn't necessarily mean that each
  race/class combo should be able to go toe to toe with each other and be about
  even. Our idea of balance is that each race/class has a compelling reason for
  playing it, such that they will all be needed in adventuring and questing.
  There will undoubtedly be some race/class combos that do better one on one,
  especially in a PK situation (note, that's one on one - some of these
  'weaker' race/class combos might be extremely deadly when they work together,
  which adds another dimension to the whole PK environment).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.15 Which race is the most
  interesting for player-killing?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>That's rather subjective, and we encourage everyone playing the game to
  try them all out and come to their own conclusions and preferences.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.16 Do you receive experience points
  for killing another player? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No. In EverQuest, if you want experience, go quest and adventure. If you
  want to PK somebody, go ahead, and if you win, loot him (you can get his cash
  on hand and one item), but you won't receive experience, nor will your skills
  go up in PK combat. This is to avoid inherent potential abuse - such as two
  players sparring with one another to increase their skills.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>11.17 What are the &quot;Team&quot; PvP
  servers?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Team PvP servers consist of four teams. A member of a given team may
  freely attack any member of another team, but not their own. Note that this
  does not rule out the possibility of traitors or alliances between teams. The
  names of the servers are Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The four teams are:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Humans - Barbarians, Erudites, Humans;</P>  <P>The Elves - Half Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves;</P>  <P>The &quot;Shorties&quot; - Dwarves, Gnomes,
  Halflings;</P>  <P>and The Dark Races - Dark Elves, Ogres, Trolls,
  and Iksar.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>12.0 Character Death</U></STRONG></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.1 How do you deal with death? Is it
  permanent or do you just lose some stats, skills, and items?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>It is not permanent, however, there are serious penalties. You will want
  to carefully avoid death, but if you do make an error, it doesn't mean that
  the character you've worked hard on for six months is gone. The
  &quot;statistical&quot; cost of death is a loss of experience, but there are
  other associated costs, such as the task of recovering your corpse.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.2 Is there a limit to the number of
  times you can die?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No official limit, but given the penalties, you won't want to do it
  often.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.3 When monsters die, will they
  remain as sprites or fade away slowly like in Quake?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>Corpses deteriorate over time.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.4 When you die, do you resurrect
  with penalties? Must you run off to a temple in &quot;ghost&quot; mode, or
  what?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You do come back with penalties - but not as a ghost, nor where you died,
  but rather at your 'bind' point.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.5 Can you fall from great heights
  and will it kill you? </STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>You can fall, you will take damage, and that damage can kill you.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.6 Can I log off from a fight to
  survive?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>No, if you log off, your character will still be in the game for a few
  minutes. He will defend himself, but I'd say it's certainly not without
  significant risk.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG>12.6.1 In Tanarus, if you hit the
  ALT-Q, you actually send a signal to the server indicating you want to
  willingly leave the game. But if you lose your connection (local brownout,
  blackout, rodent chews through power cord, etc.) this signal is not sent. In
  this situation, couldn't you simply be listed as &quot;XXXXX has been
  disconnected&quot; without any penalty and without your character remaining
  in the game for a few minutes?</STRONG><A></A><STRONG><BR></STRONG>We handle both cases in the same manner to avoid abuse by the less than
  honorable who would intentionally drop signal (ctrl-alt-del, reset, etc.) to
  avoid defeat.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><U>13.0 Security Notice.</U></STRONG><A></A><STRONG><U><BR></U></STRONG>All members should beware of scams that ask for your credit card
