			8.5
			Giving/Trading Items
		</h2>
	
	You sometimes find that you need (or don't want) a particular item. You can sell or buy from other players. All player characters can buy, sell and trade items among themselves through the Trade Window. <BR><BR>No transaction is final until both players agree to it. <BR><BR><I>To give away/trade/sell an item to another player:</I> <BR><BR>* Open your Inventory screen (<B><I>i</I></B>) and select an item or amount of coins (this should 'float' the item on your cursor).<BR>* Click on the character you wish to trade with.<BR>* This will open the Trade Window.<BR><BR>The trade window has two sections, one for the items and/or coin that you are trading out and one for the items and/or coin that the other character wishes to trade. At this point you may add or remove items or coins from this window as you see fit. <BR><BR><I>Note: The Trade Window will close if you move too far from the other person.</I> <BR><BR>Both players must click <B>Trade</B> to complete the action. If either player puts another item into the trade window after one player clicks Trade, he/she will have to click the button again. <BR><BR><I>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal as it is.</I> <BR><BR><B>Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming items!</B> If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). <BR><BR><I>Note: Items dropped to the ground may be picked up by greedy NPCs or other Player Characters. Don't consider the ground a safe place to store any items, and try to keep inventory slots available when trading items or completing quests that give items as rewards.</I><BR><BR>
