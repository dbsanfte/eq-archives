			Money Matters
		</h1>
	
	As a new character, you don't have any money. You'll spend most of your early playing sessions earning money to buy food, drink and items. You can earn money by looting the corpses of small animals you've killed and selling those items. <BR><BR>There are four denominations of coins in Norrath - platinum, gold, silver and copper. The exchange rate is 10 coins for each higher-value coin: <BR><BR>1 platinum = 10 gold.<BR>1 gold = 10 silver.<BR>1 silver = 10 copper.<BR><BR>Once you do have some money you may want to deposit it in a bank for safekeeping (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=containers">Containers and Banks</A> for more details). Most cities have banks in which you can store coins and general inventory items. <BR><BR><B>Merchant Prices</B> <BR><BR>When you buy something, coins automatically transfer from your inventory into the seller's window. If you sell an item, coins are placed in your inventory. <BR><BR><I>Tip: If you're in good standing with a merchant, that merchant may offer you lower prices on items.</I> <BR><BR>
