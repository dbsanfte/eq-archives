	<P>EverQuest now requires that clients have DirectX 8.1 or higher installed. <BR><BR>To determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your system: <BR><BR>1. Click on start; <BR><BR>2. Go up to the run box. <BR><BR>3. In the Run window, type DXDIAG then hit ok. This will launch the DirectX diagnostics tool. <BR><BR>Your version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of System Information. Version 8.1 is listed as "DirectX 8.1 (4.08.01.0881)" <BR><BR>Please do the following prior to playing EverQuest. It is very important that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to avoid potential problems: <BR><BR>1.

Go to the website for your video card manufacturer. There are a number of different manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the website for the manufacturer of your card. You can, at your option, go to the chipset manufacturer site. Most will be able to use either <A href="http://www.3dfx.com/">www.3dfx.com</A> (for Voodoo cards) or <A href="http://www.nvidia.com/">www.nvidia.com</A> (for TNT/GeForce cards). </P><BR><BR>3.

If you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can right-click on "My Computer", go to properties, click on "Device Manager", and open "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers". If you use a SBLive sound card, you can run "LiveUpdate" from the Windows Control Panel off of your start menu.
