	<P class=header align=center>Installation Troubleshooting</P>
<P><BR>Below you will find a list of common problems, along with possible solutions, that may occur during the installation of EverQuest. </P>
<P>If you are having troubles installing the game from your CD then you might want to try a few things. First check to see if your CD is physically damaged in some way. If it is damaged then you will need to return it to the store from which you purchased the game to exchange your damaged copy for a new one. Unfortunately, we cannot replace CD's. </P>
<P>Secondly, your CD-ROM drive may be unable to read the CD. In this case, you will want to try lowering the buffer and optimization settings on your CD drive. Do this by right clicking on My Computer at your desktop. Left click on Properties, go to Performance, File System, and then finally CD-ROM. Put the cache size at small and set the optimization to "no read-ahead." </P>
<P>Lastly, you may want to copy the contents of the entire CD to a temporary directory. Once the entire contents of the CD are in the temporary directory you will be able to run the installation from there by double clicking on setup.exe.</P>
<P>If you receive an _INST error while installing the game, a virus scanner running during the installation process may cause this problem. For Norton's Anti-Virus you will want to disable the "auto-protect" feature and then hit Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the Task Manager. From this list select "Navapw32" and hit the End Task button. Close the Task manager, if it remains open. Any other virus scanners should simply be disabled from the system tray (the bar where your date and volume controls are located). You should now be able to install EverQuest.</P>
