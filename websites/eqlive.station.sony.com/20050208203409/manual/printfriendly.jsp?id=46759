		<h2>
			13.2
			Acquiring Spells
		</h2>
	
	Some classes (such as a
  Paladin's ability to Lay on Hands) have one or more spell-like abilities that
  are very much like skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or
  meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells,
  however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spellbook and
  memorize it before you can cast it. <BR><BR>You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell
  caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some
  special quests can also yield spells.
