<h2>Mom! Dad's on the Computer Again!</h2>

<P class=header align=center>Mom! Dad's on the Computer Again!</P>
<P align=justify>In EverQuest he is a ranger on the Seventh Hammer server. In real life he is a husband, father of two, and a bartender. Tim Baer, known as Timmy to those who frequent Fogerty's, a local bar in San Diego, has been playing EverQuest with his two sons for almost eight months now. Critics of the gaming industry often say that online gaming has no true social aspects and promotes solitary behavior in those who play. What values can a game have beyond the immediate entertainment factor? Those who spend time playing online games are neglecting aspects of real life. Not Timmy!</P>
<P align=justify>Timmy is one of those people who make great bartenders. He treats each patron as a personal friend, knows everyone's names, and can talk about almost anything. When he talks about his sons, ages 8 and 15, and their latest EQ session, his eyes light up with pride at their EQ accomplishments.</P>
<P align=justify>Between Bottomline's sets, a local San Diego band, and occasional lulls in slinging drinks, I parked on my barstool and shot off questions regarding EverQuest and gaming to Timmy to learn more about why this game attracts so many different people. The first thing I wanted to know is why he liked EverQuest.</P>
<P align=justify>"What I like about the game is that it is a lot like a game I played during the '70s by TSR. I think EverQuest has taken a lot of what is best from that game and added a larger picture where you can interact with more than just the few people in your group. The idea of the game having an economy is also interesting to me because it allows lower level characters that can spend thrifty to gain an advantage over characters who choose to spend their money as soon as they get it."</P>
<P align=justify>Many parents are rightly concerned about what is happening in their children's online worlds. No parent can really know with whom his or her child is associating online. Timmy and his wife have these same concerns for their sons.</P>
<P align=justify>"I can, as a father, honestly say that my boys require little monitoring on the game. It is nice to see that most players can keep their vulgar language to a minimum. Even with the misspelled words to avoid the bad language filter, both my boys know enough to be trusted playing the game and to avoid others that use such tactics. I like the fact that you can report players that are rude and vulgar, players that should not be playing the game. With just the basics like not giving out personal information online and the report and petition tools in game, I think it allows me to monitor less and do other things around the house while I am awaiting my turn to play."</P>
<P align=justify>If a child is spending time playing a game, does real life education suffer? Timmy doesn't believe so for one very good reason. "They can't play until all the work is done."</P>
<P align=justify>Timmy also believes there is more than just the entertainment value of EverQuest. Real life lessons can be learned. </P>
<P align=justify>"EQ has been a tool for learning as well as a source for fun! My children have become more familiar with the computer and its functions as a result of extended playing time. It certainly adds to the ability to speed type accurately, especially during the heat of battle. It allows them to interact with a variety of people from different parts of the world and different walks of life. It helps to show how completing various tasks (quests) can benefit you. It helps to illustrate how saving your money can benefit you, and it also provides an outlet to the pressures of school and other stresses like homework and boredom."</P>
<P align=justify>When asked if EverQuest brought his family unit closer together Timmy replied, "No. My family has always been a tight family. However, it sure makes for some interesting conversation at the dinner table."</P>
<P align=justify>As more and more computers are showing up in the home and companies are creating even more ways for people to use those computers, what is going to become of "outdoor" activities, traditional father and son experiences? When asked if a father should be playing online games with his sons instead of outside tossing the ball with them, Timmy replied, "I believe that any interaction you can have with your children can be good. I also see how talking about the game and their adventures gives us more to communicate about and with a teenager that can't be all bad. As for sports, sure, throwing a ball is great and other sports are fun as well. However, EQ also allows them to teach me about the different aspects of characters, skills, and quests (which is great for a young man's confidence to be able to teach dad something)."</P>
<P align=justify>Here is a man who believes that any type of bonding with his children is good bonding. Here is a man who sees more than just a game. He sees an educational tool for his boys. Here is a father who takes an active interest in his sons' lives and entertainment, and a man who happily admits to being able to learn from his children. Here are a father and two sons who play EverQuest and have fun doing so. Now, what about the wife? What does Timmy's wife think of this whole EQ thing?</P>
<P align=justify>"As long as it is done in moderation, we will leave it at that! We still need to do some work on her to get her playing though!"</P>
