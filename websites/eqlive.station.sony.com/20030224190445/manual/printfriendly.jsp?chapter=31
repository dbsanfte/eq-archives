			Photosensitivity Seizure Warning
		</h1>
	
	<B>WARNING: READ BEFORE PLAYING</B> <BR><BR>A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while playing video games, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. <BR><BR>If you, or anyone in your family, have an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to playing. If you experience any of the following symptoms while playing a video or computer game -- dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions -- IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming play. <BR><BR>

			Attacking with Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target, you can simply press <B><I>a</B></I> (or whichever key you've remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it. <BR><BR><B><I>a</I></B> Initiate auto-attack (on current target). <BR><STRONG><EM>Esc</EM></STRONG>ape Remove current target from Target Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><I>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot). </I><BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says "Your target is too far away." Be sure to remain facing your target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow. Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage, you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and weapon skills.&nbsp; Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A> for information on how damage affects you. <BR><BR>

			Hot Buttons Window
		</h2>
	
	The Hot Buttons Window is located at the bottom left of your screen. Hot Buttons can be created from any other button in the interface. This allows you to keep the buttons that you use frequently in one easy to find location. The Hot Buttons window has ten banks of buttons, each bank with ten buttons, so there should be plenty of room. <BR><BR><I>Creating a Hot Button</I> <BR><BR>* Make sure your Hot Button window is open and the spot for the Hot Button that you want to create is visible.<BR>* Locate the button you want to copy. This can be just about any button you find on the screen, as well as spell gems and inventory slots. If clicking it causes something to happen, then it can probably be made into a Hot Button.<BR>* Left-click and hold on the button. After a second or two a copy of the button with pop onto your mouse pointer.<BR>* Point your mouse pointer at the Hot Button spot and left-click. This should create a new Hot Button. <BR><BR><I>Deleting a Hot Button</I> <BR><BR>* Find the Hot Button that you want to remove.<BR>* Left-click and hold on the Hot Button. After a second or two the Hot Button will pop onto your mouse pointer.<BR>* Aim your mouse pointer at a place on the screen that has no windows and left-click. This should remove the Hot Button from your cursor.<BR>* Deleting a Hot Button does not affect the source button, so don't worry about deleting one you need. You can always make a new Hot Button. <BR><BR>

			Talking to Merchants
		</h2>
	
	Merchants usually greet you when you first walk into their store or selling booth, but they don't often like to talk about anything outside of their immediate realm of existence (in other words, don't ask a merchant for directions or favors...). <BR><BR>Before talking to a merchant, you must target him or her. To do so, move the cursor over the merchant and click. To speak to the merchant, press <B><I>h</B></I>. To see what the merchant has for sale, right-click on the merchant. <BR><BR>For more about selling items to merchants, see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=buying">Buying/Selling</A> Items.<BR><BR>

			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are split among the group members according to their experience levels. The higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.<BR><BR>

			Appendix B - Skills and Combat: Skills
		</h2>
	
	p.49: The next-to-last paragraph on this page reads, "You can have anywhere from 0 to 100 points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher skill ranking". This section is incorrect. This section should read: <BR><BR>Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master". <BR><BR>If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your skill. <BR><BR>p.52: The "Tiger Claw" skill is listed under "Other Skills". It should be listed under "Combat Skills" on p.51. <BR><BR>

			Appendix F - Hits Mode - Combat Text Display Options
		</h1>
	
	/hitsmode allows you to create separate windows for your combat text. This is a rather advanced feature, so it might take a little practice to get the results that you want. <BR><BR>Here is the technical jargon: <BR><BR>Usage: /hitsmode &lt;my|me|other&gt; &lt;on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5&gt; &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;COUNT&gt; &lt;FONTSIZE&gt; &lt;HEADER&gt; &lt;BG&gt; &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; <BR><BR>my = My Attacks, me = Me Getting Hit, other = Others Attacks <BR><BR>If you choose M2 through M5, then:<BR>&lt;X&gt; and &lt;Y&gt; are the screen location.<BR>&lt;COUNT&gt; is how many lines of text will be displayed. The acceptable range is 1 to 10.<BR>&lt;FONTSIZE&gt; is a font size of the text. The acceptable range is 0, 1, or 2.<BR>&lt;HEADER&gt; is either on or off. 1 to turn on and 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;BG&gt; controls the background. It is either on or off. 1 to turn it on or 0 to turn it off.<BR>&lt;WIDTH&gt; is the width of the background.<BR>&lt;FORCEDRAW&gt; is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty. <BR><BR><I>note: m5 is only valid for My Attacks. It's ignored for other types and m4 is used instead.</I> <BR><BR>off - nothing displayed (turns off all these hit messages, including those in the standard chat window)<BR>on - displayed as normal in the chat window (standard/default mode)<BR>M2 - displayed at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (displays all information shown in the chat damage message)<BR>M3 - displayed in condensed form at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (damage type, target damages and damage amount)<BR>M4 - displayed as just the damage # at a given X,Y position for a given number of lines in a given font size. (only displays damage number)<BR>M5 - displayed in condensed form at given X, Y position (only for My Attacks - displays type of hit and damage number) <BR><BR>/clearhits will clear the current setting for the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode command. <BR><BR>These setting are saved in the INI file and will be persistent. <BR><BR><I>Special Notes:</I> <BR><BR>The first time you use this setting, it is best to set all the parameters. However, you don't have to reset them all every time you want to make a change. <BR><BR>Using -1 in place of any given parameter will default back to the setting saved in the INI file. So you can use -1 for any parameter that you want to remain as it is while you change others. <BR><BR>You can also stop short of full parameters. If you don't include trailing parameters (for example you leave off &lt;WIDTH&gt;, it will use the settings for those parameters from the existing INI. <BR><BR>
