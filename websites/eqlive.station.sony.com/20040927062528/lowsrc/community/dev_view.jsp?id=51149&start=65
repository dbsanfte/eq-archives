<h1>Protection of the Cabbage Quest</h1>
	<BR>Another note from Rich:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>If you are not a Druid and you've completed the Protection of the Cabbage quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.<P>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another earring after verifying your loss.<P>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the "out of charges" bug. <P>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged Xanthe's earring back.<P>Please keep in mind that the earrings are LORE, and you can't have two of the same lore item.  If you have a Xanthe's Earring on you, don't try to make another one or the ingredients will be lost.  The same is true of the alternate earring, so be careful if you're trying to get one of each, we don't want people to lose their items. <P>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.<P>Thanks,<P>- Rich<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks again Rich.<P>Alan<BR>
