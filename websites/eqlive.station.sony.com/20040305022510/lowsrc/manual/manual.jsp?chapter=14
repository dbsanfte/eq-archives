<h1>Manual</h1>




	
		<h1>
			14
			Other Combat Notes
		</h1>
	
	

	
		<h2>
			14.1
			Looting a Vanquished Foe
		</h2>
	
	Once you've killed something, you can check its corpse for useful items. Many things you recover from dead creatures are valuable items that you can sell to merchants or other players. <BR><BR><I>To loot a corpse:</I> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It "floats" on your cursor.<BR>* Click on a free slot in your inventory.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.2
			Taunting
		</h2>
	
	If you have the Taunt skill, you can use it to draw a creature's attention away from whomever it's attacking. When you successfully taunt a monster, it turns and starts attacking you instead. You'll find that taunting is an indispensable group skill, especially if you want to keep the spell casters in your group alive. <BR><BR>Taunt is a combat skill. To use this skill you will need to set up a button for it on the Combat Skills tab of the Actions Window. <BR><BR>Once you've done that, all you need to do is click on a creature to target it and press the Taunt button. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.3
			Dueling
		</h2>
	
	Even if you're not on a player vs. player server you can still challenge someone to a duel. Once you start a duel, it continues until one player defeats the other, or one player leaves the zone. Only player characters can duel. <BR><BR><I>To start a duel:</I> <BR><BR>* Target the player you want to duel.<BR>* Type /d and press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG>. <BR><BR>To accept a duel, your target must follow these same steps. <BR><BR>Dying during a duel is similar to dying in any other manner - see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>. <BR><BR><I>Note: For non-player-killers, participating in a duel doesn't give the winner the right to loot the loser's corpse.</I><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.4
			Combat Damage
		</h2>
	
	Whenever your opponent hits you with either a weapon or spell, you take damage and your health is depleted. Keep an eye on your red health bar - if it falls below 1/3, you may want to consider retreating until you're healed. <BR><BR><I>Tip: If your party includes a spell caster, that character can spend his or her time casting healing and boosting spells on the others while they fight.</I> <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A>, for additional details on taking damage. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.5
			Guards
		</h2>
	
	Guards immediately kill unfriendly creatures if they come too close. This can be good for you (if, for example, some creature is about to beat you to a pulp), and bad for you (if a guard kills a monster you won't get experience for it nor will you be able to loot the corpse). So it's a good idea to know where the local guards are.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.6
			Retreating
		</h2>
	
	If you do decide that retreating is your best option, look for the safest escape route. Sometimes, you can run over to other characters in the area, and someone will help attack the monster or taunt him away. But those other characters might not be willing or able to help you out. In fact, running over to them might get them killed. While it's certainly a good thing to find help when needed, it's not polite to bring your problems to other unasked. Communicate with those around you, find out if they would be willing to help you before you need it. <BR><BR>There is a term, "training", for rudely running a bunch of dangerous NPCs over a group of unsuspecting characters, and it's something to avoid. <BR><BR>Guards (as mentioned in the previous section) can also help save your life. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			14.7
			Using Pets
		</h2>
	
	Some classes let you develop the ability to summon undead pets or elemental forces, or to befriend wild animals that aid you in combat. You'll have to find the correct spell for your class and purchase it before you can summon or charm a pet. Look for spells that begin with "Summon," "Befriend," "Charm," or that contain the word "Animal" or "Undead." A variety of pet-related spells also exist that you can use to heal your pet or boost its abilities. <BR><BR>Once you have a pet, you can instruct it to taunt your target, attack, follow you, guard a location, or protect you as follows: <BR><BR><B>/pet guard here</B> - Tells the pet to guard its current location.<BR><B>/pet guard me</B> - Tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, or that it's master attacks.<BR><B>/pet follow me</B> - Tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone line.<BR><B>/pet attack [target]</B> - Tells the pet to attack the designated target.<BR><B>/pet back off</B> - Tells the pet to stop its attack.<BR><B>/pet as you were</B> - Returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.<BR><B>/pet get lost</B> - Will send the pet back to where it came from.<BR><B>/pet report health</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet health report</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet health</B> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.<BR><B>/pet taunt</B> - Toggles pets taunting.<BR><B>/pet notaunt</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet no taunt</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet taunt off</B> - Tells the pet not to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet taunt on</B> - Tells the pet to taunt its opponent.<BR><B>/pet stand</B> - Causes the pet to stand up.<BR><B>/pet sit</B> - Causes the pet to sit down. <BR><BR><I>Note: Pets have a limited range at which they can hear commands. If a pet isn't responding to you, he just might be too far away.</I><BR><BR>
