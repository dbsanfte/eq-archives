	<h2>John Smedley Discusses Station Exchange</h2>

	<P>Hello Everyone, <BR><BR>We have a big announcement coming out in the press in the next day, and I
  wanted to make sure you heard it from me directly rather than reading an
  article about it.<BR><BR>Starting in late June, SOE will
  begin offering a new service called Station Exchange. This secure service
  will allow EverQuest II players on specific servers to buy and sell the right
  to use items, coin and characters. To be clear, all we are doing is
  facilitating these transactions. We are NOT in the business of selling
  virtual goods ourselves.<BR><BR>I'm sure this is going to come as a shock to many of you, since for the past
  six years, we have held the line in not allowing these sorts of things to
  occur. I'd like to explain the primary drivers for this change from our
  perspective:<BR><BR>First: It's obvious that a large percentage of our players either don't mind
  this activity or actively participate in it. We've done a fair amount of
  homework on this subject, and we believe this is a $200 million dollar market
  worldwide, and there are a huge number of our players taking part in the
  buying and selling of virtual goods. We have conducted polls, and the vast
  majority of players either doesn&#8217;t care about it or would like to
  participate in it. We believe that by allowing this to happen on select
  servers, we can have a solution for both the many players who want to
  participate in this and for those who don&#8217;t.<BR><BR>Second: Dealing with fraudulent transactions of one type or another takes up
  roughly 40% of our customer service people's time. We have players calling us
  up or requesting in-game service for activities related to these sorts of
  transactions constantly, even though they are specifically disallowed by our
  EULA. You may ask why the percentage is that high when it's not allowed in
  the first place? The answer is simple. Many times, people in these situations
  aren't up front with us about what actually happened. &quot;My sword
  disappeared from my inventory&quot; comes to mind, when what actually
  happened is the player has sold the item to someone else. Our CS people have to take the time to
  investigate this claim because if something legitimately happened, we of
  course want to take care of the player's needs. We believe that by taking
  this course, we will free up a great number of resources to deal with other
  things for our players.<BR><BR>Third: We see this as a potentially interesting model for future games. If we
  came up with a game specifically designed around these sorts of transactions,
  it might be pretty cool. Online gaming is always evolving, and we&#8217;re
  going to see how a sanctioned exchange service shakes out in EQII. From our
  perspective, it's always wise to keep pushing the envelope.<BR><BR>With the big reasons we're doing this laid out, I'd like to now tell you
  about the process:<BR><BR>On Wednesday, you'll see some press about Station Exchange. After about a
  week, we will conduct an in-game poll that's going to ask whether you:<BR><BR>1) Want to play on an &quot;Exchange enabled&quot; server<BR>2) Do not want to play on an &quot;Exchange enabled&quot; server<BR>3) Don't really care<BR><BR>Based on the results of this poll, we will light up a certain amount of new
  servers that are specifically &quot;Exchange enabled.&quot; If the percentage
  of players who want this service is high enough, we might consider converting
  some existing servers to &quot;Exchange enabled.&quot; Players who want to play
  on those servers will have the opportunity to transfer over to the
  &quot;Exchange enabled&quot; servers for free on a one-time-only basis (but
  you can't ever move that character off these servers). We will, of course,
  let people who don't want to stay on an &quot;Exchange enabled&quot; server
  off with a free transfer. <BR><BR>I want to be clear here: We will be lighting up a few new servers that are
  specifically &#8220;Exchange enabled,&#8221; and the number of existing
  servers we convert to &#8220;Exchange enabled&#8221; will be based on how
  many people actually want to be on &quot;Exchange enabled&quot; servers. <BR><BR>In addition to the issues listed above, you may ask, &quot;What about
  farming?&quot; The simple answer to this is that we're going to continue to
  heavily enforce the rules of EQ II, and those rules don't permit players to
  monopolize spawns or in any way harm the play experience of another player.
  We will continue to enforce these rules, but we also think that by providing
  a legitimate way for players to buy and sell the use of virtual goods, there
  will be fewer problems on the non-Exchange servers.<BR><BR>I realize this is a lot to think about, and I expect a pretty good debate to
  start on this subject. We welcome all your feedback, as it will help
  determine the future of this service. All I ask is that you consider the fact
  that we're really addressing this problem in the best possible way for all
  sides of this issue.<BR><BR><BR>John Smedley<BR>President, Sony Online Entertainment</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Learn
