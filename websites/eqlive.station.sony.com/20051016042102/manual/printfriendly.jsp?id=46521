			7.4
			Using Emotes
		</h2>
	
	You can appear to bow, be
  bored, point, or convey other visible gestures by using other special
  commands. EverQuest has a lengthy <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=emotelist">list of built-in
  emotes</A>, and some even trigger animations. <BR><BR>If you don't want to use pre-defined emotes, you can type in virtually
  anything. (Your character won't perform a visible action, but other players
  can see text that indicates your action). <BR><BR><EM>To use the built-in emotes, simply type in the appropriate command, such
  as:</EM> <BR><BR>/sit<BR>/dance<BR>/bow <BR><BR>These emotes may give different messages if you have a character targeted and
  if you have nothing targeted. <BR><BR><EM>To create your own emote:</EM> <BR><BR>/em [text] <BR><BR>For example (our sample character's name is Fippy): <BR><BR>/em scratches his nose.<BR>Would appear to those around you as:<BR>Fippy scratches his nose.
