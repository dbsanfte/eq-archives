									<span class="smalltitle">Report from the
  Wilds #4</span><br>
									<P>To Ciric Azilebane, High Priest of Quellious,<BR><BR>Dearest Friend,<BR><BR>War has found the Faydark. We always knew the shadow of Crushbone's jagged
  axe lay north of the elven nations but not until the past few nights did we
  truly know the danger. For centuries the elves have used Crushbone as a trial
  by blade and by blood of the merits of those sent into the wilds. We had no
  idea of the forces the orcs had built up in the caves under the citadel of
  Crushbone.<BR><BR>Until last night.<BR><BR>I received word from the criers of Tanaan that elven rangers had spotted
  powerful orcs and even an orc warlord north of Felwithe. I returned to the
  Greater Faydark to learn the truth of these reports.<BR><BR>The elves had mobilized. Rangers, paladins, and spellcasters prepared under
  the guidance of the battlemasters of Kelethin and Felwithe. All bureaucracy
  was tossed aside. They were ready for battle. They wore suits of shining
  steel armor and white silk embroidered with the ancient elven glyphs.<BR><BR>For three days these armies waited and prepared. Mercenaries from all over
  Norrath traveled to the lands. Some waited with grim determination on their
  faces, their hands gripping the leather-wrapped hilts of their enchanted
  blades. Others treated it like a celebration on the beaches of North Ro, drinking and singing bawdy tavern
  songs.<BR><BR>I traveled with a scouting party to hunt down the orcish warlord. In the
  north east of the forest we spotted him and two of his elite guards. He was
  huge, scarred from a hundred wounds and eyes blazing red as hellfire. He wore
  a cloak of soft elf-hair and a boiled leather chestguard of thick dwarvish
  skin. His eyes burned with the fury of centuries of oppression under the
  elvish cities but they also spoke of calm and logical strategy. He would not
  rush into the hail of elven arrows as the other orc warlords had. He knew his
  enemy and we did not.<BR><BR>On the evening of the third day, war finally began.<BR><BR>The ground opened up. The armies of Crushbone poured forth from the hidden
  entrances to underground caverns. They rushed in waves, too close for the
  elvish archers to thin them out with steel barbed arrows. Scouts and
  messengers cried out as heavy axes hewed into their backs.<BR><BR>The lines of the elves broke quickly into smaller units of elvish
  spellcasters and blademasters. I saw an elvish general cleave down five orcs
  in five strokes of his jeweled greatsword. I watched a beautiful elvish
  enchanter command one dominated orc to cut open another with his jagged
  sword.<BR><BR>Chaos filled the forest. Mercenaries began to turn sides, splitting the
  armies into threes and fours. Bands of dark elves, ogres, Iksar, and the
  traitors of the elflands turned their own weapons and magic upon the elf
  commanders. Others were crushed between the armies of Felwithe and those of
  Crushbone. My mind reeled in horror.<BR><BR>The worst had yet to come.<BR><BR>I felt a burning flair across my back as a blade pierced through my armor and
  sunk into my side. I turned to defend myself, my hammer held high. I met the
  burning green eyes of a young paladin of Felwithe. His mouth had turned into
  a snarl and my own blood dripped down the keen edge of his sword. Illusions
  of dark domination or deception flew away; this elf knew who I was and
  planned to kill me. I was in shock.</P>  <P>All of the prejudice of the elvish nations, all of the
  ill-favored looks and street-side whispering manifested itself into murder in
  this inferno of battle. What had been a joke among the young paladins of
  Norrath now became a killing stroke of a sword.<BR><BR>He would have succeeded. Instead, an arrow exploded out of his throat in a
  shower of red blood. The green-eyed paladin fell into the mud next to me. The
  arrow's owner, a half elf in dark chainmail, wrenched the jeweled sword from
  the paladin's dead hand and tore two rings off his fingers. He winked at me before
  running off into the woods to continue his plunder of the dead.<BR><BR>Healing warmth filled the deep wound in my back. Juror, the barbarian mystic
  and my greatest friend, picked me up on his massive shoulder and rushed me
  south. A camp of mercenaries loyal to the elves had formed near the ancient
  Combine spires. There, half a league from the bloody battles of the north,
  our spells healed the wounded and recovered their strength.<BR><BR>A report came in that Warlord Mish, the leader of the orcish forces, had been
  slain. The mercenaries cheered into the night. I did not cheer. The vision of
  the murderous glare of the elven paladin made my heart cry. Tears filled my
  eyes.<BR><BR>I would not remember this day as the day the orcs and the elves met in
  battle. I would remember it as the day the elves battled each other.<BR><BR>May the Mother guide our hand,<BR><BR>Loral Ciriclight<BR>High Priest of Tunare<BR>On the Fourteenth Day of the Month of the Silver Moon, 3201 PD<BR><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50016">Report from the Wilds #1</A><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50017">Report from the Wilds #2</A><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50020">Report from the Wilds #3</A></P>

									<P>*
  The following is found on a note of tanned vellum written in black ink in small
  economic handwriting *<BR><BR>High Priest
  Yeolarn of Tunare,<BR><BR>Though unable to defeat Ithiasor, the black dragon of the Swamp, I learned
  that others had faced and defeated this great wyrm.&nbsp; I was correct in my assumptions of
  this Veslin Savok.&nbsp; It appears he
  was an agent or mercenary of the trolls of Grobb.&nbsp; Veslin accepted this chest from the
  proud slayers of Ithiasor and promptly delivered it to the troll instigators
  of Grobb.<BR><BR>Our Felwithian spies are not the only ones in search of information. </P>  <P>Froglok agents of Gukta
  also watch the shadows to protect their new and unstable city.&nbsp; One of these agents sought adventurers
  to recover this chest from the trolls of Neriak; no easy task.<BR><BR>I accepted.<BR><BR>I traveled through the dark forest of Nektulos  to the doors of&nbsp; Neriak
  itself.&nbsp; The Tier'Dal Dragoons
  have grown weak in recent days and I was able to easily dispatch them.&nbsp; I used to question such actions but in
  this age of war, such actions come easy.&nbsp;
  I met with five fellow adventurers, old friends I have hunted with in
  the far lands.&nbsp; Canerit the monk,
  Lord Garmok the Warlord, Yridian the Vah Shir Beastlord, Amril the elven
  warrior, and Kanadrix the mage.&nbsp;
  Amril was critical in learning of the Guktan spies and acquiring the
  layout of the troll stronghold inside Neriak.<BR><BR>We took little time in our small but powerful attack.&nbsp; My companions, experienced in battle
  against the Muramite legions and demons of the lower planes, took little time
  in cutting down the guards of Neriak's foreign quarter.&nbsp; We traveled quickly to the south into
  the slums of the trolls.&nbsp; It was
  there we realized how powerful these troll usurpers had become.<BR><BR>They fought with a fury never seen within the walls of Neriak.&nbsp; They fought with strange weapons, some
  not seen in thousands of years.&nbsp;
  The weapons and magics contained within that ancient chest were
  powerful indeed.&nbsp; The blades of
  the trolls cut deep.&nbsp; Three times
  the trolls sent us running back into the forests of Neriak.<BR><BR>Our fourth attack, however, delivered our victory.&nbsp; Using chaos as our own weapon, we
  managed to separate the overlord of the troll resistance, Warlord Bortar,
  from his advisor and personal guard.&nbsp;
  We battled him at the gates of Neriak.<BR><BR>Even alone the warlord fought like ten men.&nbsp; Bortar smashed Garmok, an ogre of
  nearly five hundred stone, against the ebony walls.&nbsp; He cut deep gashes into the stone
  floor with his enchanted axe.&nbsp;
  Only with our combined strength did the warlord fall.&nbsp; Garmok's runed blade spilled black
  blood from a deep wound in Bortar's side.<BR><BR>We returned the chest to a Froglok conspirator outside of Neriak and received
  little more than a word of thanks for our efforts.&nbsp; The spy network of Guktan keeps its
  lips as sealed as our own.<BR><BR>I do not know if the slaying of Warlord Bortar will prevent the troll uprising.&nbsp; A people can only be repressed for so
  long before they grow strong and vindictive.<BR><BR>I will continue my search for information and continue my actions towards the
  safety of Felwithe.&nbsp; Many others
  have joined in our cause.&nbsp; While
  it is my greatest hope that the council of Felwithe will see to the defense
  of our city, I will not depend on it.&nbsp;
  The mercenaries and adventurers of Felwithe have saved us before, once
  again they are our greatest hope.<BR><BR>Loral Ciriclight</P>  <P>Hand and Eye of Tunare</P>  <P>Seventh day of the Month
  of the Harvest Moon, 3202 PD.</P>

									* The following is found on a note of
  tanned vellum written in black ink in small economic handwriting *<BR><BR>High Priest Yeolarn Bronzeleaf of Tunare,<BR><BR>War is upon us.&nbsp; Six months ago we
  lost the port   of Firiona Vie  to the forces of Lanys T'Vyl.&nbsp; Two
  weeks ago, our own city of Felwithe came under attack by Tier'Dal
  terror troops.&nbsp; I watched our shop
  owners bleed to death on the cobblestone streets of my home.<BR><BR>Never more than now has Felwithe faced imminent danger.&nbsp; It is all around us.&nbsp; Rifts tear open between worlds.&nbsp; Holes break open to the lost lairs of
  beasts from the old ages.&nbsp; Yet for
  centuries the council of Felwithe chose to remain passive.<BR><BR>It is clear that we must move on our own.&nbsp; I begin to gather information and I
  begin to plant the seeds within those who will act on Felwithe's behalf.&nbsp; I have sent my spies to the far
  reaches of Norrath in search of information.&nbsp; They already begin to return with dark
  and sinister plots.&nbsp; It is these
  plots that I will report to you over the following weeks.<BR><BR>Last week one of my troll spies traveled to Neriak and listened to the trolls
  who reside there after the fall of Grobb.&nbsp; The trolls speak of battle.&nbsp; They speak of murder.&nbsp; It is clear that they no longer
  consider Neriak their home, if they ever did.&nbsp; They speak of a lord, one Bortar, who
  may lead them in battle against Gukta.<BR><BR>A rift opens between the Tier'Dal and the trolls.&nbsp; We can exploit this rift and perhaps
  aggravate a conflict between our two enemies.&nbsp; I will seek to learn more and if an
  opportunity reveals itself, I will act upon it.<BR><BR>Many of my agents travel through the city of New Tanaan, the new hub of travel
  for the adventurers of Norrath.&nbsp;
  One of my agents discovered a human named Veslin Savok who sought
  adventurers to recover a chest for him from a dragon named Ithiasor the Black
  in the Swamp   of No Hope.<BR><BR>I spoke to this Veslin, an untrustworthy fellow if I ever saw one, and I
  accepted his task.&nbsp; I do not know
  if he is an agent of Rasp's Wayfarers or perhaps of the Ebon Hand.&nbsp; After a failed attempt to learn more
  of this black horrid beast, I enlisted the power of Vinceremo.&nbsp; This powerful band of mercenaries and
  hunters traveled to the Swamp and faced the great wyrm, Ithiasor.&nbsp; The battle did not go well.<BR><BR>I have yet to learn more from this source but I fear the great wyrm will
  return unscathed to whatever dark hole it crawled from.<BR><BR>Lord Yeolarn, I will continue to send these reports to keep you
  informed.&nbsp; It is my hope that you
  will succeed in stirring the council of Felwithe into action.&nbsp; I saw your actions on the bridges of
  Felwithe.&nbsp; I saw you wield your
  staff like the warrior elves of Takish Hiz.&nbsp; I know fire burns in you as it burns
  in me.<BR><BR>Should you be unable to stir the unmoving rock of Felwithe's council, I will
  do what I can to enlist the aid of the hunters, adventurers, and mercenaries
  of Norrath.&nbsp; They do not fight for
  the protection of Felwithe or for the word of Tunare, but with the right
  motivation they can serve our purposes.<BR><BR>May the Mother watch on us all,<BR><BR>Loral Ciriclight<BR>High Priest of Tunare<BR>Hand and Eye of the Church of Felwithe<BR>Nineteenth Day of the Month of the Amber Leaf,

									<p><strong>What all has changed? </strong><br> The new Lavastorm is a graphical update for both the zone and the majority of the NPCs.&nbsp; It gave us the opportunity to revisit one of our favorite old world zones and it shows off what an original EQ zone looks like, when recreated in the new graphics engine. This newly envisioned zone also paves the way for our latest expansion, Dragons of Norrath. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava01.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava01thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava02.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava02thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>What about quests/loot/drops/etc? </strong><br> We kept the previous content intact, but also added&nbsp;new NPCs with new drops as well as task givers who will happily reward you for helping them out. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava03.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava03thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava04.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava04thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Are the new mobs indicative of what we will see in DoN?</strong>&nbsp; <br> They sure are.&nbsp; The new models you see in Lavastorm are a preview of a few of the new models featured in Dragons of Norrath.&nbsp; If you think the new goblins and spiders look great, wait until you see the dragons!&nbsp; <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava05.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava05thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava06.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava06thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Are these mobs new or were they previously in GoD and OoW?</strong> <br> The NPC models in Lavastorm are brand new versions of original EverQuest models, developed specifically for Dragons of Norrath and the new Lavastorm. <br> </p> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tr align="center" valign="middle"> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava07.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava07thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> <td><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava08.jpg"><img src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/content_images/lava08thmb.jpg" border="0"></a></td> </tr> </table> <p><br> <strong>Brenlo mentioned that this zone's art rivals that of EQII, maybe a little boast or something to spark a friendly rivalry? </strong><br> EverQuest is coming up on its sixth year and we continue to provide new content that surpasses the graphical quality of most other games in the MMP space.&nbsp; That's definitely something worthy of a little boasting.&nbsp; When it comes to EQII, I think sibling rivalry is probably the appropriate term.&nbsp; They are family and both teams continually push each other to be the best and exceed expectations. <br> <br> <strong>Any other interesting facts or information you guys think players would want to know?</strong> <br> There's more than meets the eye going on in Lavastorm.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks, players should keep an eye out for unusual events and they will have the opportunity to participate in world changing events as they unfold. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
