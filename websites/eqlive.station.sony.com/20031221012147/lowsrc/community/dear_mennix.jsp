<h2>Respect, Iksar, and the Single Halfling</h2>
<P>Dear Mennix,</P>
<P>While I don't usually seek advice from others than elven-kin, I find myself seeking advice from where I may get it, and unfortunately that leads me to you... even if you are a halfling.&nbsp; It is my hopes that you can for once put aside your treacherous advice leading many to their fall, and offer real hope in my plight.</P>
<P>I am a rather young ranger by all accounts, and have yet to travel the paths of the planer realms in which I hope to visit my Goddess some day and ask her the secrets to life on Norrath that I have pondered for many a moon, however in my travels and endeavors to become better at my craft, tracking and bending my bow to those in need, I have found myself traveling often in the company of men, Vah Shir, Iksar, and even on occasion a gnome or two (confoundedly annoying little things they are).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now as normal elven etiquette would dictate, an elven-kin should rarely entrust ones life to those who do not breath the air of the Faydwer and find solace in the trees, however I have often trusted my life to people whom I now consider true friends who follow other paths and are not of elven decent.&nbsp; Some of these lesser folk I confide in would be shunned in places such as my home town of Kelethin, and find themselves quickly at the wrong end of Lt. Leafstalker's troops, yet I would gladly give my life in their behalf to save them in battle.</P>
<P>It is about one of these friends that I really need advice however, a human enchantress.&nbsp; While elven women are far more beautiful in many aspects than that of the humans who are plain looking and are often non-believers in that of the glorious Tunare, I find myself captivated by this particular enchantress and have subtly given my heart to her.&nbsp; She is almost as lovely as the elven women of my homeland and every moment I spend with her makes me feel alive and anew, as when I did as a child running through the trees of Greater Faydark hunting the Vile Orc with my father.</P>
<P>My question is this: Most of the people in my homeland do not look kindly upon elves and men interacting on such a personal level, and do not condone the courtship of the two races.&nbsp; Traditionalism in my homeland is very strong, and with my parents equally so.&nbsp; While my mother and father tolerate my enchantress friend, they do not like me spending as much time with her as I do for fear they will lose me to her.&nbsp; How do I go about telling them that I have lost myself in her eyes, lost myself in her charm, and would give my life to save her against the evils of Innoruuk and Bertoxxulous?</P>
<P>Respectfully,</P>
<P>Dragowulf Bowcraft<BR>Ranger of Tunare<BR>Residing on The Tribunal</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Dear Dragowulf,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>While I usually chuckle at the arrogance of elven-kin, I do have a great appreciation of your lady folk. Well, ok, all lady folk. This appreciation makes me the perfect person to give advice about relationships, regardless what my critics have to say.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Having respect for one's parents is a grand thing, honoring them and their wisdom. But, there comes a point in our lives that we must honor ourselves first and do what we believe to be the right thing. It is a time when parents need to respect the child. If they did a good job raising you, instilling their values in you, encouraging your goals, always at your side, then they should have no fear that you would do the wrong thing. They need to step aside, respect you, and allow you to make your own decision. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Of course, too many parents see the child as a reflection of themself, but in all truth, that is never the case. An individual can only be a reflection of the individual. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Here's what I would do, and I strongly encourage you do the same thing. Take that lass into your soul and do not look back to the scowls of your parents. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>This is your time to live, your time to forge your own paths. Explain to your parents that although you value them and all they have taught you, it is now time for you make your own decisions. Do not be tied down by tradition. Make new traditions!</STRONG></P>

<P>Dear Mennix,</P>
<P>Throughout the land of Norrath and the moon Luclin, you find many races that differ.&nbsp; Not one race is like the rest.&nbsp; All though some share the same sort of name (High ELF, Dark ELF, Wood ELF, Half ELF) does not make them one bit related.&nbsp; From the planet of Norrath to the moon Luclin to the Planes of Power, you find races mix together to create something new.</P>
<P>The reason of my writing is to question the Iksars.&nbsp; I myself am an Iksar. I was born and raised as a Monk. Not that that matters at all.&nbsp; Iksars live on the continent off Kunark and are hated by everyone.&nbsp; WE are evil to them and we don't care that much either.&nbsp; WE come and kill their guards just to get into a city and cause havoc.&nbsp; Some cities are so hard to get into we must use underground tunnels of all sorts.</P>
<P>Lately though, our people have gone astray.&nbsp; They begin to befriend elves and halflings.&nbsp; They abandon their teachings.&nbsp; They start to do good and enter cities without killing guards.&nbsp; They harm not one little being they see.&nbsp; How could our teachings have left them?&nbsp; We are creatures that are to be feared by all.&nbsp; Yet, some are making a mockery of themselves.</P>
<P>The population of Cabilis has always been small.&nbsp; Day after day we seem to grow smaller.&nbsp; Our people leave and begin a new way of life.&nbsp; Although we are not your peoples friend Mennix, I ask you to help me.&nbsp; What can we do to regain fear?&nbsp; What can we do to show them to remember the upbringing?&nbsp; What can we do to keep our people the way they should stay?</P>
<P>Forever worrying,</P>
<P>Lizokii</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Dear Lizokii,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Yeah, I don't get that either. Good Iksar? I have yet to see one. Not unless dead Iksar are considered good.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Some of my critics condemn me for my extreme dislike of your people. Well, guess what? I don't really care. You're all lizards. Upright walking, talking, scaly, evil, lizards! If I didn't know better, I would say the Iksar are nothing but one of Bristlebane's jokes gone horribly wrong. But no, His Jovialness can do no wrong in the chuckles department.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Ok, mini rant over. You did ask me for help, and I always help all those who ask. You ask how your people can regain fear, how to remind them of their upbringing. Let me tell you how.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I have recently discovered a special ritual that if performed correctly, will allow your people to become the fearsome and cunning lizards ther are meant to be. This will take some personal sacrifice for every Iksar, but do trust me, if you follow the steps below, your people will see the true light of their being.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Mennix's Special Ritual to Demostrate to the Iksar People Their True Paths</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Step 1 - Dress in frilly clothing.<BR>Step 2 - Wear a big floppy hat.<BR>Step 3 - Stand on one foot. Don't use your tail for balance.<BR>Step 4 - Say this incantation. "I look pretty, yes in'deedy. I look swell, can't you tell. I'm a cutie, bet your petutie. We love Mennix, give him a yell."</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Give it a try. I'm sure it will work!</STRONG><BR>&nbsp; </P>
<P align=center>**********</P>
<P><BR>Dear Mennix,</P>
<P>I was hoping you could help me with my problem.&nbsp; You see, I am a High Elven Paladin who seems to fall for the wrong men.&nbsp; A while back I started a relationship with a Halfing warrior who I will refer to as Mr. Jerk.&nbsp; Well Mr. Jerk had more training than I did, but we were still able to patrol the Fay together.&nbsp; One day Mr. Jerk decided to be ... a jerk... and said that he was getting "bored" in the forest and wanted to move on to "bigger and better things" knowing that I was still not ready to leave.&nbsp; Bam! There he goes, just leaving me like that... pffttt.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I grieve for like... almost a few minutes.&nbsp; His friend, also a halfling warrior, stayed in the forest.&nbsp; He was nice, sweet, and all that crap.&nbsp; I will refer to him as Mr. Elsewhere.&nbsp; Mr. Elsewhere and I had plenty of fun together and he stayed with me until I was able to leave the forest... then he left without me.&nbsp; Where did he go?&nbsp; I dunno! No letter, no warning, just gone!<BR>&nbsp; <BR>Time passes and I meet with a dwarven paladin who I'll call Mr. Quickie.&nbsp; Well it seemed like me and Mr. Quickie were a match made in The Plane of Growth.&nbsp; But then it happened, Mr. Quickie lived up to his name time and time again.&nbsp; He and I were matched in experience when we met, but he just kept getting better and better and then he too moved on to bigger things.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>I guess what I'm really trying to say with all this is... so are you seeing anyone?</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>Single and Available</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Dear Single and Available,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Seeing just one? You must be kidding!</STRONG></P>
