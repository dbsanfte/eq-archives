<br>
The important part of the message is not that, though.  It's this:<br>
<br>
Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance hat some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<br>
<br>
** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br>
<br>
We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it right away after the patch.<br>
<br>
So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer laying around, the less chance of them disappearing.

									Hello All, <br>
<br>
We apologize for the problems some of you have experienced getting into EverQuest after the launch of Luclin. As of just a bit ago, we patched a new graphics DLL that fixes the problems some of our users (AMD users in particular) were experincing crashing to desktop. This does not mean that all crashes to desktop have been fixed, but this code had the potential for a lot of side effects, and fixing it is a big step forward. <br>
<br>
In the coming week you will see us concentrating on fixing many of the problems that remain. We are also hard at work on optimizations for both framerate and loading time. Load time is a particularly big target for us to work on, and we have some promising results in development. Our goal is to have that code out to you as soon as possible, but it needs to really be tested properly before we will feel comfortable doing that. <br>
<br>
In addition, we're also working on server side stability in a few zones, most notably Hollowshade Moor. These should be taken care of very rapidly as well. <br>
<br>
Thanks very much for your patience. <br>

Some of the things that are being considered are area (not group) Resistance songs, and haste songs that will exceed the normal haste cap. Going beyond the current haste cap will only be possible using one of<br>
these bard songs.</blockquote><br>

									<P>In a perfect world, we would all get along. The Dark Elf Yelinka would not have to worry about being agnostic. Tigo would not have to question why Mayor Gubbin allows Iksar to laze about Rivervale, and Liynk, the Vah Shir, would stop tripping over Gnomes.</P>

<P align=center>Faster than a speeding snail.<BR>More powerful than a strong ale.<BR>Able to leap small tree stumps in a single bound.</P>
<P align=center>Look! Down on the ground!</P>
<P align=center>It's a drunk. It's a mop. It's Mennix! <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Yes, it's Mennix - the Handsome Halfling from Rivervale who travels the lands of Norrath dishing out sagely advice to everyone, whether they want it or not. Mennix - who can change his mind in a heartbeat, bend steel with the help of a vice, and who, disguised as a sexy halfling,&nbsp; <A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/mennix/weekly.jsp">advice-giver </A>for a great web site, fights the never ending battle for Truth, Justice, and extended lunch breaks.</P>

									<P>The great Erudite family Opulentia has a problem. It seems a daughter of this self proclaimed superior clan has chosen the direputable path of the Necromancer. Poor Majix Opulentia, big brother and oh so proud Enchanter, may just have to face an unsuperior reality. </P>
<P>On the Rivervale front, the Handsome Halfling consoles a brother and puts his unshod foot down on a minor indiscretion concerning the wearing of footwear. </P>
<P>And last but not least, Mennix advises a Dark Elf to stick with Hot 'n' Spicy Toelings and stay away from trying to eat little folks, lest it be hazardous to his health.</P>
<P><A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/mennix/weekly.jsp">Dear Mennix</A> is published every Thursday, barring holidays and sleeping in late, and is everyone's first choice in mental salvation. Make Dear Mennix a weekly habit and you won't be disappointed. If by chance you are disappointed, Mennix assures us he can easily pass the blame on to others.</P>
