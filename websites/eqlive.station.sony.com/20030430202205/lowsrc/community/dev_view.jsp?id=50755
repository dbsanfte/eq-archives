<h1>Summon Companion</h1>
	<B>Summon Companion is a good spell that for some reason you only gave to Mages. Necromancers have the same issues that make this spell worth while. Why not give this to the necromancer as well. I get tired of recasting pets and medding again. Allot of time wasted.<P>Nastar</B><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>We've heard many compelling arguments for giving this to other pet classes. I have updated Summon Companion on Test Server to be usable by Necromancers, Enchanters, Shaman, and Shadow Knights in addition to Magicians. <P>Necromancers, Enchanters, and Shaman will get the spell at level 44 and Shadow Knights will get it at level 52. <P>- Lawrence Poe<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While we initially wanted to keep this spell unique to Magicians, one of the practical uses of the spell is to help pet casters get passed any pathing problems they might encounter.  We understand that giving this to other classes might bother some folks that play Magicians, this seems to be the best course.  The spell, while unique, isn't as much of a balance spell as a convenience spell.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Clerics too? God forbid my amazing Unswerving Hammer get lost... =P<BR>Kappaphi Doomprophet<BR>Vicar, Saryrn</B><P>Don't mock the mighty Hammer!<P>...<P>Ok, go ahead.  I mean, what's it gonna do, tickle ya?<P><BR>Aeloryn wrote:<P><B>With due respect, I think that you might want to omit enchanters from the list of classes getting this spell. That is unless you plan on giving us the ability to park our pets. Currently the enchanter pet follows the enchanter around as a mindless bodyguard. This spell still won't help overcome bad pathing for an enchanter since we can't have our pets sit down like mages and necros.<P>So, either ditch the spell for enchanters or give us the ability to have our pets stay somewhere.</B><P>Actually, it is exactly because enchanters can't control their pets that I would think that they would be happier to get this spell.  Pathing can take a pet on a rather wild trip when it's just trying to follow you in some places.  That's why you get this spell.<P><BR><B>Personally i see no problem with this spell being given to others... its basically preventing a rampaging pet to slaughter half the zone (or train it worst case) and bring it to the master.  Theres only a few mild problems with it right now.<P>1: After being charmed you cant summon a pet (that is still alive becuase you cant summon a new one)<P>2: Summoning a pet doesnt always seem to work.<P>3: I'm not sure if this was intentionally put in, but when summoning if you left a pet on "guard here" mode it instantly begins leaving after summons.....  possibly this was just overlooked.<P>ArtyD</B><P>Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug.  Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that on to Ester.<P>You can't summon a pet that is in combat or is on the aggro list of an NPC.  This was put in purposefully to prevent some potentially nasty exploits.  For those that have asked, no we won't be allowing the magician version of the spell to do this as a bonus.  It's not allowed for a reason.  And it might be why the pet doesn't get summoned sometimes.<P>You tell your pet to guard a spot, well, he's gonna guard it.  They're dedicated like that...<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>Quote - Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that on to Ester.<P>Very nice of you to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information regarding this very case.<P>A couple things:<BR>1) It is NOT a rare case.  This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets charmed.  I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times as they wish.  GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain the ability to summon / resummon a pet.<P>2) I have personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times.  I have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very problem.  So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times.<P>3) Bug or intentional, it is NOT fair in "any" circumstance for pet owners to be stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet.  If this is a bug, please fix it promptly.  If this is intentional, please seek employment elsewhere.<P>4) The "rogue pet" fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without the intervention of a NPC.  A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones.  <P>I have personally had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the lake in Qeynos Hills.  When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling, and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which charmed it.  Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill.<P>-Anthe</B><P>When I said that it sounded like a rare case, I meant just that.  It's probably not that common that you get charmed.  I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a character.<P>And I looked it up.  The bug has been in the database since December.  So we are aware of it, and have been.  Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of it.<P><BR><B>I commend Verant for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations (i.e., pathing).  Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after granting it to Mages?  This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger raids begin for most charaters.  <P>Now if you would only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters.<P>Sarasate</B><P>Well, this is a case where were conflicted.  There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be a useful tool for any pet caster.<P>We decided to err (if we were indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician only spell...).  After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our minds.<P>As for the fear thing...  you'll have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that.  The same issue applies here.  But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue.  It is something to consider for a 'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided.<P><BR><B>Please dont give this spell to Enchanters..<P>Enchanters mess with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff..<P>I do not want the ability to "Summon".  I am distinctly an Enchanter not a generic "Caster" and dont want to be treated in such a way.<P>Provide me a roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon.  Then give me access to other Summoning abilities.<P>Mahar Delusion<BR>Enchanter</B><P>Of all the responses we've received on this issue, this is the kind that has baffled me the most.<P>Several enchanters have responded saying that this spell won't help them and that they don't want it.  I suggest that you will find it useful in some cases.  And, well, who in the world would say no to a new spell?  Seems odd to me.<P>As for your concern that there is no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer.  Don't buy it if it doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter.<P><BR>Aeadiel-Sevaan wrote:<P><B>Does this spell wipe pets aggro list?  If it doesnt i think it should.  Would be totally pointless if a enc summoned his pet back and it just took off after the mob it was on again.</B><P>There's no need for that.  If the pet has something on its hate list, that something will have the pet on its hate list, and the spell won't work anyhow.<P><BR>Korinna wrote:<P><B>Not to ruffel any feathers, but isnt't the reasoning for giving all pet casters the summon pet spell contrary to the same reason you won't allow other (than necro) pet casters get voice graft? As you stated with regards to Summon Companion, it's not  balance issue.<P>I personal can't stand playing the straight caster classes, but for those who do, voice graft I've seen to be used as a nice way for the friendly comedicly inclined players to pass the time while on their rears. I'd imagine the necromancers out there wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner & Jibantik- of course, the militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage in freeport!</B><P>It is certainly a possibility that all pet classes could get Voice Graft.  There is no compelling gameplay reason that they shouldn't have it.<P>But, at the same time there is no compelling gameplay reason that they should.  There was such a reason for Summon Companion.  So I don't foresee a change for Voice Graft, but you never know.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>A primary Enchanter question --<P>Will Summon Companion be useable for charmed pets?<P>I mean, the chances an Enchanter are going to be using this spell for their own summoned pet is very slim.  However, with a charmed pet, I have a good reason to buy this spell.  Thanks for any input.<P>Logix Spybreak<BR>55th Dark Elven Enchanter<BR>Ayonae Ro</B><P>No, it's not going to work on charmed pets.  As several people have noticed, it would lead to the spell being used as a substitute for Call of the Hero and a other possible abuses, such as summoning NPCs to a safe spot to kill them.<P><BR>Tsnoi wrote:<P><B>"Provide me a roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon. Then give me access to other Summoning abilities."<P>Absor, let me answer this, please?  Enchanters have always had limited summon abilities.  Unlike other casters, the enchanter can summon a life essence and attach it to his tiny daggers thereby enchanting them to serve as a pet.  This same force that is bound to the pet originally can be "resummoned" from somewhere in the zone back to you.  I don't see why summoning a creature back to you would be any harder than creating that creature in the first place.<P>Notice, even though the mage might be considered the best summoner in the game, many classes have summon abilities.  All magic uses learn a bit of each school of magic though they learn to use them quite diffently.  After all, a lot of the spells are all about how you look at them.  Fear could be viewed as summoning fright from deep within the targets mind, and enduring breath may summon air directly into the targets lungs.  Enchanters learn these because their studies focus on spells that effect things all ready in existence even though they are the exact same spells used by other classes (thats why one version of the spell can be scribed by any class that accesses that spell.) So you already have access to other summon spells if you wish to view it that way, but you will never have access to some of the spells that other classes have spent their lifetime researching.</B><P>People never seem to believe me when I tell them that it's easy to come up with an in-context reason for anything.  This one is pretty easy.  I like yours.  But for me it's just as easy to say that the enchanter just recreates the pet at the new location, pulling its energy out (he put it there afterall) to use to form the new one.<P><BR>Slibus wrote:<P><B>Is giving all pet casters Summon Companion your solution to the pathing problems/bugs that have existed in your game for the better part of it's existance?<P>Between that, and the upcoming nerf of Call of the Hero, every mage 55+ will be quitting out of frustration.</B><P>It's certainly helpful for dealing with pathing problems, yes.  And, yes, that's the only reason we're passing it out to other classes.<P>Does this mean that we are not working on fixing pathing problems?  No.  It means that we recognize that they exist and want to make dealing with them easier.  Keep sending us pathing issues and we'll keep fixing them.<P>But don't tell me that handing this spell out to others is ruining Magicians.  It's not.  As for the potential change to Call of Hero... we dont even know what that will be, if anything, so I think it's a little too early to be worried about that.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>In response to the exerpt .. "other possible abuses, such as summoning NPCs to a safe spot to kill them" ..<P>I have to say, at least in jest, that would be SO fun.  Id love to exact revenge on that Myconid Priest that proceeded to gate back to his lair and proceed to summon me there to his "safe spot to kill".  What satisfaction to shout "Myconid_Priest_00, You will not evade me!" muahahaha.  Hey, i'm over level 50, the mobs get to do it, why not me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Qyen Vimwarder<BR>59th Templar of Tunare<BR>Solusek Ro<BR>Dealers of Death</B><P>I can't deny the visceral appeal of that...<P>Alan<BR>
