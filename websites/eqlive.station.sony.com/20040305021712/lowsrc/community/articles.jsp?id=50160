<h2>A Chat with Absor</h2>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Xeraxa:</SPAN> Greetings! Thanks for stopping by this afternoon! Welcome to the first of three chats we hope to have this week with various EverQuest personalities in celebration of EverQuest's 2nd Anniversary.<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>Xeraxa:</SPAN> I'm Xeraxa, Senior Editor in Web Presence, and I'll let Alan introduce himself. =)</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Hello all ! I'm Alan VanCouvering, Community Relations Manager for EverQuest. My job is, basically, to convey information between the EverQuest Live team and EverQuest customers. I have a few other duties involving the web site and other things."</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Absor, how important is community for EQ?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> EverQuest is all about community. The game is fun, but fun with friends is better.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What exactly did you do before you became CRM for EQ?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I worked for the Small Business Administration as a computer specialist. I was also the editor of EverQuest Express in my 'spare' time.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Did you play a lot and do you still play?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I have always been and continue to be a 'casual' player. I play when I have spare time, which isn't as often as I'd like.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> You mentioned EverQuest Express. Do you time to write much anymore and do you miss writing your editorials?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I don't write much at all anymore. I really miss editorializing. There's a freedom to being able to be sarcastic at times. :)</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What happens at a tuning meeting?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Wow...<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> A lot happens. In many ways it's like any other company meeting.<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Old business, new business...<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> But we get a lot more animated. The topics are a lot more interesting too. I can't really describe the whole process, though.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What one thing would you do if you were not limited by technology?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Personally, I'd teleport to work. But in game... I think the the real trick to a great game will be when things are truly dynamic.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> When playing EQ are you more of a powergamer or a rolepayer?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Roleplayer.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Are there any plans to increase the size of a group from 6 players to 8 or more?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Not really. The basic group size probably not going to change. Though we are talking about some added functionality for groups that I can't go into right now...</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> How many races/classes have you played?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Just about all of them. I have the tendency to play a lot of classes and races. I won't be telling you what class I play the most, though. That's just like asking for trouble. :)</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Do you twink?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Nope. I have on about two occassions that I can think of. But I've turned down more items from friends than I can think of.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Why don't you answer more questions on the boards?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I've been a little busy with the second anniversary and other such things. But that's not an excuse. I do need to post more.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What character models are your favorites? Least favorite?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Actually, I've just seen the original art for the Ogre. It's now the background on my PC.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> When will druids spell like harmony be castable indoors so they are more wanted in 50+ dungeons?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> It's not going to happen as far as I know. But we are certainly not done looking at all the possibilities for 'balancing' classes.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> How do you think Warrens turned out?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Great! I had a bit of a chance to look at it on Test last week. It's nice.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> About the Warrens . . . do you foresee any of that "special code" that is geared to benefit lower levels going into any other zones?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> The idea of using the Warrens for new code like this is to try it out. The goal is to use these rules 'going forward'. It would only go into existing zones if it was a really great thing.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Will the team try to make uber farming less a possibility?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> That's kinda what we are trying out with the Warrens now.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> So, what is your highest level character and where does he/she like to hunt?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Sorry. That's the sort of thing I just can't tell you. It only leads to thoughts that I might favor one class over another, and that's not true.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> How do you see the future of EQ?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> In my crystal ball?<BR><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I see EverQuest as the leader in the market for a long time. We're pushing ourselves to be the best.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Can you describe in short why patches take so long to complete, technically 9 hours is very long.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> There are a lot of servers, and there is a lot of data to get out. I don't know all the in's and out's of patching, but we certainly do it as fast as we can.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Do you have any ideas how a roleplayer can feel less "ostracized" by the power players?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Sure. As a roleplayer you have the whole world as your community. Don't worry about those that are not interested in roleplaying. I could take an hour on this one... but I'll leave it at that.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Does Verant realize that the risk vs. reward in Velious is totally screwed up?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> We don't really think so. Many people are finding the rewards just fine for the risks.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Are there any new races/classes planned in the future?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Not that you know about... I don't have any new things to announce here, and new races and classes are on the list of things that I'm not announcing. :)</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What's your typical workday like?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I spend most of my morning on e-mail. I then read boards for the rest of the day, while handling other duties as they pop up. There always seem to be a lot of things that pop up...</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> What other games do you play?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Mostly, EverQuest. I played a lot of Planescape. But when I have game time, it's often dedicated to pen and paper games.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Will you be at the San Diego Fan Faire, and can we party in your room?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> I can't afford a room... But I will be there. And maybe we can all pile into Aradune's room. :)</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Do you find it difficult to deal with all the challenges of such a massive project?</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Yup. But I love a challenge. And with the people that I get to work with, the hard stuff is easy. A smart group with a love for the game. It's hectic, but fun.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>Questions:</I></SPAN> Last question: why aren't things more random? Many mobs are timed spawns and people know this.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Absor:</SPAN> Good question. And, well, I don't know the answer. We are using more and more 'randomization' as we move forward. Maybe you can ask Brad this one Friday.</P>
<P align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Xeraxa:</SPAN> Alan, thanks for taking the time to chat with us! And thanks to everyone who showed up to participate! Come back tomorrow, same bat time, same bat channel, and we'll have John Capozzi from the EQ Live team here.</P>
