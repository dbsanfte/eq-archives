			Tips for New PvP Players
		</h2>
	
	Here are a few tips to get
  you started. <BR><BR>* Don't join a PvP server for your first EverQuest experience. It's probably
  a good idea to become familiar with the game before attempting the more
  difficult challenge of a PvP server. <BR><BR>* Learn your way around. It's easy to get lost in EverQuest - which is
  exactly what you don't want to do in times of crisis. <BR><BR>* Find friends you can trust. Other newbies you meet can make great allies in
  the future. <BR><BR>* Find a guild to join. Remember, there's strength in numbers. <BR><BR>* Use the Anonymous option (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=iogeneral">Game Options:
  General</A>). The less other players know about you, the better. <BR><BR>* Keep moving. Running is always better than walking, and you can often run
  away from someone or something that's chasing you. <BR><BR>* Make it a habit to target and consider (/con) everyone you run across. <BR><BR>* Use banks to store anything valuable. Likewise, buy bags - no one can loot
  items in them.
