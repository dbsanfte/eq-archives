		<h2>
			11.2
			Group Experience
		</h2>
	
	Grouping will make it easier to
  gain experience, especially after your first few levels. Three people hacking
  away at a Kobold or a Gnoll are much more effective than trying to take one
  on yourself. Each time a party defeats an opponent the experience points are
  split among the group members according to their experience levels. The
  higher your experience level, the larger your portion. There is a grouping
  experience bonus, the more people in your party, the larger the bonus.
