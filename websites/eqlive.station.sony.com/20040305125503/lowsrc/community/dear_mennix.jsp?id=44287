<h2>Opposites Don't Always Attract</h2>
<P>Dear Disgusting Little Halfing Advice Giver, </P>
<P>Being a Dark Elf, I would never lower myself to asking advice from a lowly race such as a halfling, but I will make an exception for this query because it can simply not be answered by anyone else. </P>
<P>You see my problem is that I am constantly bombarded by come-ons from disgusting little halflings such as yourself. It seem that somewhere in their deluded little minds, they actually think they might have a chance with someone as smart, beautiful,and as powerful as myself. That I would even give a millisecond of attention to them, besides the thought of letting my pet skeleton play with their insides, is completely incomprehensible to me. Despite my obvious hatred of all things not Dark Elf, they keep persisting in their hopeless quest to win over my favor. </P>
<P>Why is it that these halflings are so attracted to me when I despise them with the every molecule of my being? And how do I get them to stop? </P>
<P>Ktsari Delamorte <BR>Dark Elf Necromancer </P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Ktsari, hottie little dark elf who secretly adores us halflings,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Believe it or not, most beings of my persuasion, halfling male, are attracted to smart, beautiful, and powerful women. It doesn't matter if you despise us or not, for that is of little importance to us. We halfling males all know that deep down in everyone's hearts, we are simply irresistable. If they want to admit it or not.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sure, go ahead and hate us, but don't deny us our admiration of strength, intelligence, and beauty. It doesn't even matter that your clothing is somewhat skimpy, it is the whole package that draws us, not just the wrapping. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We also like the challenge. Halflings and dark elves are not traditionally friends, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate your aesthetic charms. Sure, we don't trust you a bit, but we sure do like the way you look, and we have a respect for your power and intelligence. What's wrong with all of that?</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>*****</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>hello short tasty thing that should be on a stick...</P>
<P>I Was wondering what the deal is with all the wood elf and dark elf girls that seem to be extremely attracted to me. Now, not that I am complaining &amp; it is quite nderstandable seeing how I am quite the stunning Iksar, but it does get to be somewhat of a problem when attempting to rid the face of Norrath of these silly soft skinned guards only to have your tail suddenly grabbed by an elf girl, a certain wood elf druid comes to mind in particular. </P>
<P>Is it that the delicate little elf girls are truly attracted to we Iksars, or is it that they know how the tide will turn and we will rule Norrath with an iron fist and they are trying to gain favor and save their own hide? Tho oddly enough, unlike most of you soft skins, these dark and wood elf girls are not as nearly as repulsive, or delectable looking (in the case of Halflings of course) as the rest of you but are actually somewhat.attractive.</P>
<P>Pondering Lizard<BR>Ammut<BR>35 Necromancer<BR>Quellious</P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Ammut,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I think it's time you take a step back from whatever is you've been drinking. I think you're drunk.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I seriously doubt any elven lass is an enamored with you as you wish they were. Let's not forget, you are a lizard afer all. You're not a halfling, too bad you. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>But, who am I to dash your dreams. If you truly want to believe that you are adored by elven girls, then it's your fantasy I guess. Good luck with that.</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>*****</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dear Mennix,</P>
<P>I am in desperate need of some advice. As a Vah Shir beastlord, Norrath is a refreshing change of secenry to me. I mean, the sun moves here, the time changes, there are big ol gnoll-dogs to squash, and of course, there ar taverns on almost every corner. But the problem I have is not with Norrath, but half of those who populate it, men.</P>
<P>Everywhere I go I get cat calls (no pun intended). They offer to buy me expensive things, take me to new places. They write me poetry, love sonnets, and balads (most of it bad). Its gotten bad enough that one of the Qeynos guards pinches me on the rear every chance he gets!<BR>&nbsp; <BR>I dont want to resort to physical violence (claws can be deadly), and my warder just thinks the whole thing is hilarious, so what should I do, oh wise halfling?</P>
<P>~Katashey</P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Katashey,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Use your claws.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Try not to hurt those who are honestly expressing themself to you, for I find nothing wrong in letting another person know that I find them attractive. As for the gifts offered, it is your choice to accept them or not. If you don't want them, just kindly say no thankyou. The main problem here is that guard who insists on pinching you.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>No one, absolutely no one, has the right to even touch you without you wanting them to touch you. This piggy thug is not pinching you; he is assaulting you. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Oh, I am sure he will just say in his defense that he thought you wouldn't mind because you never told him to stop. Well guess what? You never should have had to tell him to stop. The fool should have enough respect not to make such untoward advances in the first place. You are not a piece of meat.</STRONG></P>
