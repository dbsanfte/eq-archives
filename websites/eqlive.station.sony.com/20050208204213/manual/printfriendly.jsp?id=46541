			Eating and Drinking
		</h2>
	
	Bread, milk and water are
  staple goods for all citizens of Norrath. Many merchants sell these items,
  along with rat steaks, bear meat and fancier food items. You start the game with
  20 skins of milk and 20 loaves of bread. Generally, you'll consume these at
  the rate of 1 per game day (about 6 hours playing time). <BR><BR>When you're running low on either item, your text display shows &quot;You are
  low on food&quot; or &quot;You are low on drink&quot;. If you don't find food
  or drink soon you'll become very thirsty or hungry. Eventually, your health
  and stamina suffer. <BR><BR>Visit a city merchant to stock up on baked goods, water flasks, milk and
  other items (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=buying">Buying/Selling
  Items</A>). Many merchants also sell alcohol; however, ale, beer, wine and
  other similar drinks do nothing to quench your thirst. In quantity, they
  temporarily hinder your ability to speak (type) and affect your movement
  skills and agility. Such items must be manually consumed. <BR><BR><EM>To eat/drink an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* View your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Right-click on the item you wish to consume.<BR><BR>Bread and milk items in your general inventory slots are automatically used
  as needed. If right-clicking on an item doesn't do anything, then that item
  will automatically be eaten or drunk as you need it.
