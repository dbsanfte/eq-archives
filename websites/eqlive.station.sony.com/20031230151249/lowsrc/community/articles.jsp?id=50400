<h2>Moorgard of Mobhunter</h2>
<P>Moorgard, the driving force behind the EQ news site, <A href="http://www.mobhunter.com/index.jsp">Mobhunter</A>, strives to present a different side to every story, and have a chuckle in the process. </P>
<P>We learn a bit more about the guy from Minnesota, not Wisconsin, in our ongoing series of Community Leader interviews.</P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/pointing2a.jpg" width=200 align=left vspace=4 border=0> 
<P><STRONG>Who is this Moorgard guy from Wisconsin?</STRONG></P>
<P>I have no idea. This Moorgard guy is from Minnesota, thank you very much! I'm a 33-year-old male with an English degree who has also lived in Phoenix and Denver at various points in my life. I've been the general manager for a chain of record stores, a Web usability editor for a fantasy sports site, and a copy editor for a marketing company. I'm married with no kids, but we do have three cats.</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>My apologies, Minnesota. I also get Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule mixed up at times. What is Mobhunter's mission?</STRONG></P>
<P>Well, actually, our mission is to provide perspective on the game. To make players think globally, not locally. That is, to get folks to see that there is a lot more going on than just the things that affect their class or guild. Basically, we try to take the news and talk about it in such a way that the reader will occasionally say, "Hmm, I never thought of it that way."</P>
<P><STRONG>Do you think Mobhunter has contributed to the EQ community? Why?</STRONG></P>
<P>I know that our site has carved its own niche in some dark, sticky corner of the EQ universe based upon the feedback, both good and bad, that Mobhunter has received. If we have contributed anything, I hope it has been first and foremost to entertain our readers, and secondly to provide a perspective on EQ news that&nbsp; people don't get elsewhere. There is so much bandwagon-hopping and conclusion-jumping that takes place on the various message boards that it's easy to lose site of--for lack of a better term--the big picture. Our role, as I see it, is to step back, have a chuckle, and try to present a different side to the story. If we make people think, then we've done our job.</P>
<P><STRONG>Who else is involved with Mobhunter?</STRONG></P>
<P>My partners in crime are Kohath and Csenicier. They write occasionally (I wish it was a little more frequently!), but are mostly responsible for the coding and behind-the-scenes stuff that happens at the site. Mobhunter is 100% handwritten code, so we have to water and feed it properly. We also have a network of friends and readers who contribute stories and ideas on a regular basis. Really, Mobhunter wouldn't be what it is without the support.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Does your wife play EQ? If so, who's more uber? Does playing an online Game together make your relationship stronger?</STRONG></P>
<P>No, my wife doesn't play EQ, though the Vah Shir race almost convinced her to start. Just as well, really, because I'd have to spend all my free time twinking her!</P>
<P><STRONG>In your view then, what is the big picture?</STRONG></P>
<P>Well for instance I play a monk, so it would be very easy for me to look at every decision you guys make, and every item you put into the game, from a monk perspective only. This happens all the time, which is what results in the reams and reams of class envy posts that are so common. I try to get folks to look at a wider perspective, that there is a rather intricate system of checks and balances in place between the classes, and a plus for one class doesn't mean a negative for yours. It's about what's healthiest for the game as a whole, not just for your class or character.</P>
<P><STRONG>If you could change one single thing about EQ, what would it be?</STRONG></P>
<P>Just one? /giggle... While it's completely unrealistic, I'd take some of the pressure away. Pressure to level. Pressure to get items. Pressure to beat other guilds to mobs. This is especially true at the high-end game. Sure, pressure is part of life, but I'd rather it not be such a big part of a video game I supposedly play to relax. Too many people need vacations from EQ!</P>
<P><STRONG>What is your most memorable EQ moment, in or out of game?</STRONG></P>
<P>Out of game but EQ-related, I'd say the Minneapolis Fan Faire. Meeting cool people and realizing that not everyone who plays EQ is a pale zombie was both refreshing and reassuring. In game, there are so many. Completing my Robe of the Lost Circle, and later my epic. The first time I turned the corner past the fire giants and saw the door open with Lord Nagafen behind it. The first time I soloed a hill giant in West Commonlands. But at the top of the list has to be killing Dorn for the first time. I still kill him every time I pass through North Ro, too! Gee, guess that's more than one...</P>
<P><STRONG>What NPC do you always go out of your way to kill? You know we all have that special one that plagued us when we were newbies.</STRONG></P>
<P>Easy: Dorn B'Dynn in North Ro. I can still remember being a young monk, dutifully hunting orcs and spiders in the desert, and hearing the dreaded shout of "Dorn to zone!" He would suddenly pounce on my mesh-armored behind and pummel me into a bloody mess on the sand. Every single time I pass through the zone I check his Dervish camp, and if no one is fighting him, I return the favor to his dark elvish backside. It never fails to provide me with satisfaction.</P>
<P>He's one of those horribly under-conned mobs, by the way, that could kill most solo players even after he had turned green. He might as well have been a dragon or a god sitting there in the middle of the sand, laughing at all the newbies.</P>
<P>Is this interview over yet? I have the sudden urge to log in and kill him.</P>
<P><STRONG>It's over. Go fulfill that urge!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Thanks Moorgard!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>-Mennix</STRONG><BR></P>
