<h1>Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme</h1>
	<P>Welcome to the very first Halfling HodgePodge
  Extreme!&nbsp; Your resident Community
  Halflings collected questions from the EQ Community then presented a
  selection of these questions to the EQ Developers.&nbsp; Here are the questions we selected and
  the responses to those questions!</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Will future updates to the game (whether
  in the form of an expansion or in the form of a storyline such as the Age of
  War) introduce new class/race combinations, such as a Vah Shir Monk, a Wood
  Elf Beastlord, or a Froglok Magician and Enchanter?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>It&#8217;s something that comes up
  from time to time, but we don&#8217;t have plans for more at the moment.&nbsp; Racial diversity is part of the charm
  of the game.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Post Mistmoore revamp, Ring of Scale
  faction is MUCH MORE difficult to raise.&nbsp;
  Could you add a viable way to raise Ring of Scale faction?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>We added a quest to the new Mistmoore
  a bit ago to allow players another route to raise Ring of Scale faction.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is there ever going to be a way to opt out
  of the jester's illusion effects?</EM></STRONG><EM>  </EM>It&#8217;s not likely.&nbsp; The
  jester doesn&#8217;t actually cast illusions, but rather does a forced shape
  shift similar to what you&#8217;d see in various raid encounters.&nbsp; That being said, it is probable that
  his effects are going to be changed so they only affect the group of the
  player who cast it.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Given the success and popularity of Unrest
  and Hatesfury missions, are there plans for more such missions, both in the
  Unrest and Hatesfury zones and in other zones?</EM></STRONG><EM>&nbsp; </EM>Those missions were
  done as a precursor to the type of content we are adding in Depths of Darkhollow.&nbsp; Many of the monster missions with the
  expansion take you back to old world zones to experience their story from a
  different perspective.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>When can we expect some more old world
  zones to be re-envisioned with new graphics and possible difficulty/level
  adjustments?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>It&#8217;s
  definitely something we intend to continue doing.&nbsp; In fact, a new version of Nektulos is
  on the way with Depths of Darkhollow.&nbsp;
  The zone&#8217;s difficulty isn&#8217;t changing, but it&#8217;s has
  undergone a complete graphical revamp similar to Lavastorm.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Are &quot;stances&quot; still considered
  for druids, and if so, will damage over time spells be affected too or only
  nukes?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>They&#8217;re still
  on the plate, yes, but the specifics haven&#8217;t been worked out yet.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Are there plans to update the Froglok
  Cultural armors to include the new classes?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>Yes</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Have you thought about this issue (older
  zones being unpopulated making obtaining rare tradeskill items hard if not
  impossible) and ways to keep 'old' tradeskill recipes viable or are you
  content with how it works now?</EM></STRONG><EM>&nbsp; </EM>There are many changes being
  discussed that may impact this that have not been fleshed out at this time. </P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Are there any plans to implement a
  &quot;Max # of combines&quot; threshold, so that if you did not get a skillup
  after this threshold value, example: 150 combines, you would automatically
  get a skillup on combine 151 (and then the counter would reset for the next
  run of combines.)? </EM></STRONG>The same as above, many changes are being
  discussed that may impact skillups but have not been decided upon at this
  time.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>In the past, spells from older expansions
  appeared on vendors INSIDE the new expansion because fewer and fewer people
  went to those old locations. An example would be spells sold in the Abysmal
  Sea, can we please have this happen for Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Planes of
  Power spells in Depths of Darkhollow and Gates of Discord in the next
  expansion at the latest?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>There
  will be a host of new Research based recipes in Depths of Darkhollow which
  will allow players to research spells from Planes of Power and a spell or two
  from other, newer expansions.&nbsp; The
  expansion will also have areas where you can obtain the spells originally
  include with omens of war.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Can the developers tell us what they have
  decided Manaburn will be? What time frame they have on getting it live?</EM></STRONG><EM>&nbsp;
  </EM>We've currently working on unraveling the manaburn code. We are
  hoping to get this addressed shortly after the launch of Depths of
  Darkhollow.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Will a command to remove headgear graphics
  ever be implemented like in EQII?</EM></STRONG><EM>  </EM>We currently have no plans to do this with our existing character models.
  </P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is the extremely prevalent line of sight
  issues in most zones since Planes of Power, where a player can see and target
  an NPC, but you receive a Cannot See Target message when attempting to cast,
  an intentional design decision, or a bug?&nbsp; If it is a bug, should these be
  reported?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>This is a known
  issue that we plan to correct. Basically, the line of sight checks need to do
  a few more ray-casting samples to allow for a bit more leeway in what we
  consider visible. Right now only one line of sight ray-cast is performed, and
  it is done too low to the ground and the floor can sometimes interfere with
  it. It's high on the list of things to improve when we get a chance.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Why does the chat function often eat the
  last character of a message? Type &quot;/gu Hello&quot; and guild sees
  &quot;Hell&quot; or &quot;/rs Stay here Group 1&quot; and raid only sees
  &quot;Stay here Group&quot;.</EM></STRONG><EM>&nbsp; </EM>We have not narrowed down the
  exact cause of this issue due to the lack of examples.&nbsp; In order to be able to fix this issue
  we would really need to get specific cases from the community.&nbsp; If you could /bug the text and what
  you typed, it would go along way to solving this issue. </P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Will the shield gfx bug (shield turned
  upside down and arm going thru it) for Dark Elves and High Elves on drogmor,
  ever get fixed?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>There are
  currently no plans to fix old graphics bugs.&nbsp; This includes the old bugged
  animations and equipable items.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>With the change made to the quantity of
  AMMO to allow the player to stack to 100 from 20, can we expect the same
  change to be made for Bandages? Also, could we expect this change for Food
  and Drink as well?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>We have
  no plans on changing any other item types to be stackable over 20 for now. A
  big reason why we chose to only change ammo slot items is due to the fact
  that the items are expended much more rapidly than food, drink, and bandages.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is there any chance that we can get trader
  bags (for bank and trader use) that have say, 20 slots?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>Larger bag sizes aren&#8217;t
  currently possible due to some limitations in the original game code.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Are you still intending to change the Bard
  Vishimtar Ring effect into something more substantial or keep it in its
  current form?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>We
  don&#8217;t have any plans to change the item at this time. The feedback
  after the resist mod went in was that the item was inline with other effects.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is there the possibility to increase the
  necessary epic drops so as to prevent farming, or make those needed items no
  drop?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>There&#8217;s
  definitely a possibility, though it would have to be a global change to all
  epics, instead of a specific one. It&#8217;s something to keep in mind for
  the future, though there aren&#8217;t any immediate plans to change them.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is there a plan to fix the links of an
  item that has the BiC augment in it?&nbsp;
  Maybe either fix the links or add a turn in of the final augment that
  is linkable.</EM></STRONG><EM>&nbsp; </EM>Yes. The plan is to have this
  fixed in next month&#8217;s patch. </P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Is there any work being done to repair,
  replace, and automate the Server Status page off the EQLive site so that it
  will once again show individual server up/down status information?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>That's not our department,
  unfortunately. We would like to see this automated too.&nbsp; </P>  <P>&nbsp;<STRONG><EM>I
  really appreciate the &quot;link all&quot; button on looted corpses'
  inventory. Would it be possible to replace it with a &quot;loot all&quot; button
  while looting one's own corpse?</EM></STRONG><EM>  </EM>We've heard the many requests for this feature and we agree that it's a
  good idea and something we would like to do, it's just a matter of finding
  the time to do it at this point.</P>  <P><STRONG><EM>Are there any plans on adding endurance regeneration
  to existing Bard Mana/Hit Point songs?</EM></STRONG><EM> </EM>Endurance was built and tuned around the innate regeneration so
  that endurance using classes weren&#8217;t even more beholden to spell
  casters than they already were.&nbsp;
  Adding endurance regeneration to spells goes against this principal so
  we don&#8217;t see it happening anytime soon.&nbsp; Items&#8230; sure.</P>
