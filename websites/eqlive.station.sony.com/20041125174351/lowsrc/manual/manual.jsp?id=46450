			3.11
			Acquiring, Selling and Buying Items
		</h2>
	
	The most common method of acquiring items is to defeat monsters in battle and take their stuff.&nbsp; It is important to note that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage you and/or your group did to that NPC was greater than anyone else or their group. It is considered good etiquette not to interfere in a combat unless asked (or you ask if the person needs aid and they say yes). <BR><BR><B>To loot the corpse of an NPC (monster) or player you've killed:</B> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It "floats" on your cursor.<BR>* Click on a free slot in your inventory.<BR><BR><B>or you can use the shortcut method:</B> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Right-click on an item in that inventory and the game will 'auto-equip' it by trying to place it in the most appropriate spot in your inventory (if there is room).<BR><BR><B>To buy/sell an item:</B> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (Note: you will have to be relatively close to the merchant for this to work.&nbsp; If you are too far away you will only receive the "consider" information for the merchant, not the merchant window).<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling multiple items.<BR>* Click <B>Purchase</B> or <B>Sell</B> to purchase or sell the quantity of items you've selected.<BR><BR><I>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</I> <BR><BR><B>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</B> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<B><I>i</I></B>).<BR>* Click on the item (it "floats" on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <I>To drop it</I>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <I>To give it to someone</I>, click on that person. This will open the Trade window. Just click Trade to give them the item (the person receiving your gift will also have to click <B>Trade</B> to complete the trade, so don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <I>To destroy it</I>, click <B>Destroy</B>. <BR><BR><B>If you accidentally drop an item, you can pick it up:</B> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot. <BR><BR>
