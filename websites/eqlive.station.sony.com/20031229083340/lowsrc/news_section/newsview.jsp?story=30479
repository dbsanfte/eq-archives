	<h2>Updated Patch Information</h2>
	
	March 28th, 1:30 pm<br>

<br>
IMPORTANT NEW MESSAGE<br>
<br>
***Combine Button Containers***<br>
<br>
First of all thank you to everyone who posted the problem with the Velious Tailoring recipes and other recipes that appeared to be broken after the patch.<br>
<br>
With the most recent patch, we fixed a bug that is causing some confusion with these recipes.<br>
<br>
There was a bug that allowed certain recipes to work in any container of its type, where they were intended to work only in special containers of that type.  For example, there are recipes that were intended to only work in the Coldain Tanner's Kit that could be completed in any Sewing Kit.  That bug was repaired along with some other minor bugs associated with combine button containers in this last patch.<br>
<br>
Please make sure that you are using the proper container as instructed by in game instructions or npc's when combining trade skill components or quest components in any combine button container.<br>
<br>
The Velious Tailoring Recipes are currently functioning in the Coldain Tanners Kit. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br>

*Server-Side Filter Clarification*<br>
<br>
If you use the Chat Filter options in game to turn off OOC, Shout, Auction, Guild Chat, Damage Shields or any form of combat miss, this filtering will occur on the server automatically.  This means that once you turn them off, these messages will not even be sent to your computer.<br>
<br>
All other messages will remain filtered on the Client Side (by your computer rather than the server) even if you turn them off, until you type /serverfilter ON.  When you do that then they will be filtered at the server.  This may, however, prevent you from seeing certain spell particle effects and possibly some damage animations.  /serverfilter OFF will allow these messages to be sent to your computer once again.<br>
<br>
The advantage to filtering things on the server rather than at your computer is that it reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to your computer.  For people that don't have the best connections to the Internet, and/or for those in locations where a lot of data is being sent (such as in raid situations), server-side filtering should make the game more stable.<br>
