<h1>Scam Warning Again</h1>
	Let me start by saying this:  <B>Never give out your password.</B><P>I certainly admit that the scammers are getting more creative, and theyve learned how to spell.<P>The latest scam (which I cant display properly here) is an offer of a free copy of Ruins of Kunark.  This is a pretty clever scam.  Theyve copied the art and our web site to present a reasonable looking email, represented as coming from our mailing list.<P>There are two key things about this scam that identify it as such.<P>The first is the email address that it was sent from.  The copy I have here was sent from Freeq account [eqaccountstatus@vgnmail.com].  It isnt too hard to spoof an email address and make it appear to be from a Sony Online email address, so this wont always be a clue.  Just because it has an email address that appears to be from us doesnt mean it isnt a scam.  In this case, however, the fact that the email address is definitely not ours is a good hint that something is up.<P>The second, and most important clue, is that it asks for your EverQuest account information.  The key to these scams is always to get your account name and password.  <B>Never give out your password.</B><P>I suspect that those of you that read this board or one of the fan sites, that you already know never to give out your password.  So Id like to ask you to do me a favor.  Warn a friend.  Its never fun to hear that a friend lost all of his or her stuff because of one of these scams.<P><B>Never give out your password.</B><P>Here is the text of the scam (at least they were kind enough to link to our store...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> ).  And in a boldly ironic move, they linked to the EULA.<P>-----<P>PLAY EQ FREE!!!<P>GET IN THE GAME!<P>Swords, sorcery, dragons, trolls, knights and wizards... it's all right here in EverQuest. Whether you want to play as a sneaky rogue, or courageous barbarian, you can be whoever you want to be online. EverQuest is the #1 online role playing game, and there are over 420,000 other players waiting for you to join them. <P>7 days a week - 365 days a year<P>Whenever you're game, we're ready and waiting!<P>You're invited to sample EverQuest to see just what you've been missing...for FREE.
