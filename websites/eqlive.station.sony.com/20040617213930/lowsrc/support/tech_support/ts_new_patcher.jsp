	<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>EverQuest Patcher Help</STRONG> </DIV>
<P align=left><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Important Note: If you are unable to download files with the new patcher, <A href="/support/tech_support/EverQuest.zip"><FONT size=3>download this file</FONT></A> to your EverQuest directory (default location is C:/Program Files/EverQuest/) and run it. You must have Internet Explorer installed on your system for the EverQuest patcher to work properly.</FONT></B></P>
<P align=left>One thing vitally important about the new EverQuest Patcher is its functionality. Not only do you have the ability to customize the patcher for your personal preferences, this patcher takes advantage of differential patching technology. Say for instance that we created an addendum to a certain file. Let's use EverQuest.exe as an example. In the past, we would have downloaded to you a brand new EverQuest.exe file. Now, with differential patching, we are only downloading the appended part of the EverQuest.exe file thus shortening the download process.</P>
<P align=left>This page has been created to help everyone get accustomed to the new patcher. Below, you will find some information on the new options and how they work with each other.</P><IMG height=328 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/images/patcher1.gif" width=469> 
<P align=left><B>Checking Files</B><BR>Like the previous EverQuest patcher, once you double click the EverQuest shortcut on your desktop, this new patcher launches and begins scanning for files that you need.</P>
<P></P><IMG height=328 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/images/patcher2.gif" width=469> 
<P align=left><B>Patching</B><BR>Once the patcher determines that your game should be updated, files are downloaded to your computer. The experience bar indicates how much of the file downloading process has occurred. The blue line will tell you how much of the current file has been downloaded, and the orange line will keep you informed of the overall status of the entire download. Once a couple of files have been downloaded to your system, a numerical time will appear below the experience bar estimating how long it will take to complete the download process.</P>
<P></P><IMG height=328 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/images/patcher3.gif" width=469> 
<P align=left><B>Play now enabled</B><BR>Once all files are downloaded, you can click the Play button to enter the game. If you notice the AutoPlay button, you will see a check box. Put a check in this box and you will not have use the Play button. Once you receive any needed files, you will be automatically taken to server select to begin playing. If Autoplay is selected and you wish to deselect while files are still being transferred to your system, simply hit the Cancel button. The transfer will be paused so that you can deselect Autoplay. To resume downloading, just use the Download button and the process will begin where it left off.</P>
<P></P><IMG height=328 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/images/patcher4.gif" width=469> 
<P align=left><B>Download button enabled</B><BR>The Download button will be enabled depending on your choices under Advanced options. Keep reading for information on using Advanced options.</P>
<P></P><IMG height=328 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/images/patcher5.gif" width=469> 
<P align=left><B>Advanced Dialog Box</B><BR>The Advanced dialog box is accessible by clicking on the Advanced button. This will allow EverQuest players to modify their downloading options. The first frame, "Package Downloads" indicates what EQ expansion packs you currently have installed on your system. Occasionally, a patch is offered that is specific to a certain expansion and can only be downloaded by choice. For example, say there are some new sounds added that are specific only to Kunark. To obtain these new sounds, you will need to make sure the box for Kunark is checked so that these files can be received. By putting a check in the appropriate boxes, you can stop wondering if you received the most current patch for an expansion. Click on the<B><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </FONT></B><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">" </FONT><B><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">i </FONT></B><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"</FONT> next to each package to read the most current patch message for that package.</P>
<P>Also in this frame is the option to auto download files. Choosing this option will save you the extra step when launching the game by automatically downloading any files you may need. Deselect this option and manually download needed files by clicking on the Download button when it is activated. </P>
<P>Once you change any option, you can Save those options or cancel and start over. If you think one of your EverQuest files may be corrupted, then use the Complete File Check to run a complete scan of every file in your EQ directory.
