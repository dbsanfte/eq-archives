	<B>[WindowsXXX]</B> <BR><BR>Sections labeled in this fashion store the full screen window locations (per resolution) as set by you in game. You should not edit this section manually. <BR><BR><B>[KeyMaps]</B> <BR><BR>The KeyMaps section stores your keyboard customizations as set in game. It is best for this to be edited in game. <BR><BR><B>[WindowColors]</B> (Velious Only) <BR><BR>This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode. It can be set using the /wincolor command in game. <BR><BR><B>[LoadSocialAnimations]</B> (Luclin Only) <BR><BR>This setting will tell the game to load or not to load (=TRUE or =FALSE) the social animations (such as /wave and /cheer) created for the Luclin models. If you turn these off you will not see any social animations. Not loading social animations can improve load times for those with systems below the recommended specifications. <BR><BR><B>[UseLuclinHumanMale]</B> (Luclin Only)<BR><BR>There are a series of lines like this in the ini file, each pertaining to a specific race and sex. Setting these lines to TRUE will tell the game to load the new Luclin character models for the specific race and sex. Not loading some of the new character models might improve performance on systems below the recommended specifications. <BR><BR>
