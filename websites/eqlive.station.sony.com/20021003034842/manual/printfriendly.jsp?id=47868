			Appendix B - Skills and Combat: Skills

	p.49: The next-to-last paragraph on this page reads, "You can have anywhere from 0 to 100 points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher skill ranking". This section is incorrect. This section should read: <BR><BR>Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master". <BR><BR>If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your skill. <BR><BR>p.52: The "Tiger Claw" skill is listed under "Other Skills". It should be listed under "Combat Skills" on p.51. <BR><BR>
