	<h2>Veksar Discovered!</h2>
	
	<P>Akish squatted in the tepid water of the lake, playing his thin fishing line out with careful claws. Absently, he scratched at the scales on his neck and yawned. The setting sun melted slowly into the waters around him, casting the wading ruins in gold and bronze. Even the Lake of Ill Omen could be beautiful at times, he thought.</P>
<P>Suddenly his line began to thrum and dance. Akish smiled and tugged at it carefully to snare his meal. He felt the hook bite deep. With a yank, Akish set it and began to pull hand over hand. His catch struggled, swinging the line through the lapping surf. Akish ignored the play and continued to pull the line with practiced ease.</P>
<P>But then the line went slack. Akish frowned and drew the line high above his head, testing. His eyes followed the thread as it cut away from the water. The line lifted free, pointing towards a rising swell within the lake. Akish's frown deepened as he watched the wave approach, sunset-bronzed waters rippling, gaining speed, rolling into a rounded hump. Akish stumbled back a step.</P>
<P>Water exploded, lashing the shore with white, seething waves. The fisherman cried out, raising his arms in pitiful defense, but his howl was drowned by a roar of rage. Ancient eyes glowered. Bone-white claws slipped free of withered skin. Corrupted scales glistened as long-dead muscles flexed to strike.</P>
<P>The fading sun cast its last light on the restless lake. Scarlet waves smoothed and settled. The waters stilled, silently waiting for the coming night.</P>

<P align=left>Veksar, city of the ancient Iksar, has been found. Drowned beneath the black waters of the Lake of Ill Omen, it has waited silently for centuries. Most thought it to be a tomb, only another ruined echo of the Iksar on a continent filled with the same. They were wrong. New mysteries are growing beneath the waves. Ancient secrets are coming to light. . .and life.</P>
