<h1>EverQuest Third Anniversary  State of the Game</h1>
	Since the launch of The Shadows of Luclin, EverQuest has attracted many new players, giving us our largest number of subscribers ever.  <P>Given the sudden arrival of so many new adventurers into the world of Norrath, which greatly exceeded our expectations, we've taken time to enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels.<P>At the same time, we're in the process of making a number of changes aimed at improving the game for players of all levels.  Stay tuned to this page for a more detailed report.<BR> <BR>Some of the changes we are making are substantial and sweeping, others are more cosmetic and fun.  At their core they all have the same goal:  To allow more entertaining and less frustrating access to the rich and rewarding world for which EverQuest is famous.<BR> <BR>We had assumed that such design revisions for lower levels would not be necessary for a three year old game.  Indeed, we had already begun a great task designed primarily for the most seasoned of adventurers, which we will explain soon. However, our upsurge in new subscribers has convinced us otherwise.  <P>This update is the first of several designed to revise the entry game of EverQuest.  These changes should make our many new adventurers' journeys and tales even more exciting.  To our many new adventurers in Norrath we say, "Welcome!"<BR> <BR>We sincerely hope that our loyal EverQuest veterans will be pleased by the changes in the coming weeks aimed specifically at the higher levels.  <BR> <BR>In addition, we would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, both old and new, for their support since the launch of Luclin.   We hope you have noticed the many improvements we have made over the past months.  However, we are certainly not done fixing problems and updating content as you will see in the months to come.<BR> <BR>Thank you for helping the population of Norrath reach new heights.  The adventure has just begun!<BR> <BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR>

<B>First off, it wouldn't let me respond directly to the post (EverQuest's Third Anniversary: State of the Game).  I'm not sure why, the subject field was blank, with no way to fill it in.  I suspect the 'submit reply' form didn't like the ':' in the subject or something.  Anyway, on to my post:<P>Are you referring to changes other than those involving the caster balancing?<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Given the sudden arrival of so many new adventurers into the world of Norrath, which greatly exceeded our expectations, we've taken time to enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This would seem to indicate that you have already made some sort of changes.  Care to explain what you are referring to?  This whole post just has me a little confused.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">This update is the first of several designed to revise the entry game of EverQuest.

How does a post make gameplay "even more exciting"?<P>I'm glad that you are seeing an influx of new subscribers.  That can only mean good things for everybody, players and developers alike.  But this post has me truly baffled.  I get the feeling I missed something somewhere.<P>Confused,<BR>Chromus Domus<BR>Bald Gnomish Matter Relocation Engineer<BR>Tholuxe Paells</B><P><BR>I've edited the post topic.  It's a little less grammatically correct, but it should show up in the form properly now.<P>You didn't miss anything.  These are changes that are coming next week, not something that's already in.  We just wanted to give a heads up about what was coming.  We'll update you later with more details when we get all of our virtual ducks in a row.<P>Alan<BR>
