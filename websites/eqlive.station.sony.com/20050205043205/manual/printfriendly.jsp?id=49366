		<h2>
			5.33
			Give Window
		</h2>
	
	To open the Give Window pick
  up an item and left-click on a Non-Player Character. The Give Window says
  Give in the title bar, and looks a lot like the Banker Window, and it works
  much the same way. There are four slots into which you can place items that
  you wish to give to the NPC, along with four coin slots. To complete or
  cancel the transaction, use the Give or Cancel buttons on the bottom of the
  window. <BR><BR><EM>Important Note: Never stack items when giving them to an NPC to complete a
  quest. The NPC see the items in the stack as a single item.</EM>
