<h1>Halfling Hodgepodge Insider</h1>
	<P><STRONG>Charles Bryant</STRONG> <STRONG>&#8211; Celrak &#8211; Associate Game
  Designer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start
  playing EQ?</EM> I started playing EQ right around when Kunark was released.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a
  laptop or desktop computer?</EM> I always ran EQ on my desktop. I remember the
  old days of two-boxing with my now ancient 450 mhz celeron running a TNT1.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on
  dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Right now, cable. Dial up for the majority of my
  EQ play time, though.</P>  <P><EM>What was your very
  first character, both race and class?</EM> An Iksar Monk! </P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first
  online game? </EM>First online game? Not by about eight years, but it was my
  first 'online' RPG.</P>  <P><EM>What other MMO's
  have you played?</EM> I've played most other main-stream MMO's to date, but
  none have held my interest nearly as long as EQ has and I don't think any of
  them will come close.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to
  solo or group?</EM> I prefer to raid :) Second to that, the most fun I have is
  almost always with a group.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main
  character in a guild?</EM> Not anymore. /LFGuild on</P>  <P><EM>How many characters
  do you have on your main server?</EM> I have eight characters across two
  accounts, but only about five are above level 50.</P>  <P><EM>Does your main
  character worship a deity?</EM> Cazic-Thule, this weeks Iksar god of choice
  (and possibly next weeks, as well)</P>  <P><EM>What is the most
  platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your
  characters?</EM> Keep in mind that this was before I started working at SoE
  (no, we do not get free unlimited amounts of platinum!), but I think it cost
  about 2.1 million. You can try to guess what it was, but I can't promise I'll
  tell you&nbsp; :] </P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite zone?</EM> There are so many classics its really hard to pick just
  one. Some of my all-time favorites were Temple of Veeshan, Chardok, Cazic
  Thule, and Sebilis.</P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite npc?</EM> People tell me I look a lot like Celrak Blightblood, but I
  just don't see it. Mort &amp; Gage are great too -- I can't leave out the
  super banking duo.</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item
  you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons?</EM>&nbsp; If so what is it and why do you keep
  it? If you're trying to get me to give up my shroud of longevity you'll have
  to pry it from my cold dead fingers!</P>  <P><EM>What is A day in the
  life of a dev/ career in game development with SOE and EQ REALLY LIKE?</EM>  All I can tell you is that it's quite a ride. The rest is G-14 classified!</P>  <P><STRONG>Ian Noble &#8211;
  Keridon &#8211; Associate Game Designer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start
  playing EQ?</EM> April, 1999</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a
  laptop or desktop computer?</EM> Both </P>  <P><EM>Do you play on
  dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> Cable </P>  <P><EM>What was your very
  first character, both race and class?</EM> Barbarian warrior</P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first
  online game?</EM> Yes </P>  <P><EM>What other MMO's
  have you played?</EM> EQ2, SWG, WoW, City of Heroes, Asheron&#8217;s Call,
  Dark Age of Camelot. </P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to
  solo or group?</EM> Group </P>  <P><EM>Is your main
  character in a guild?</EM> No </P>  <P><EM>How many characters
  do you have on your main server?</EM> 8 </P>  <P><EM>Does your main
  character worship a deity?</EM> Yes, Brell </P>  <P><EM>What is the most
  platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your
  characters?</EM> 3k </P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite zone?</EM> Unrest </P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite npc?</EM>&nbsp; Mistmoore</P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item
  you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons?&nbsp; If so what is it and why do you keep
  it?</EM>&nbsp; I still have several keys
  that are no longer used, such as the Tooth of the Great Divide.&nbsp; After spending the time to get them I
  just haven&#8217;t wanted to destroy them.</P>  <P><EM>What is A day in the
  life of a dev/ career in game development with SOE and EQ REALLY LIKE?</EM>&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s usually a lot of
  fun.&nbsp; Being able to come up with
  and implement quests, events, and NPCs that I would enjoy running into while
  playing is one of the best parts of the job.&nbsp; Coming up with ideas and working on
  those quests etc. make up a large part of my time.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll usually spend the rest of
  my time fixing bugs and reading message boards looking for issues or just
  interesting threads.</P>  <P><STRONG>Carly Towle &#8211;
  Xenaida &#8211; Associate Game Designer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start
  playing EQ?</EM> Aug. 1999</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a
  laptop or desktop computer?</EM> Desktop</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on
  dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> cable</P>  <P><EM>What was your very
  first character, both race and class?</EM> My very first character was a half
  elf rogue. </P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first
  online game?</EM> Yes</P>  <P><EM>What other MMO's
  have you played?</EM> DAoC, Shadowbane, WoW, City of Heroes, The Realm</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to

  no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons?&nbsp; If so what is it and why do you keep
  it?</EM> Happy Love Bracers. I mean, c&#8217;mon! Those are awesome!</P>  <P><EM>What is A day in the
  life of a dev/ career in game development with SOE and EQ REALLY LIKE?</EM>&nbsp; There's always something to do. From
  the second you get into the office you are coming up with ideas, talking to
  players, fixing or adjusting things, trying new things out, writing stories.
  It never ends! We are constantly keeping up the live game and adding new stuff,
  so there's never really much time to spare. It all pays off when you see
  people really enjoying the changes you've made.</P>  <P><STRONG>Kevin Carter
  &#8211; Oshran &#8211; Associate Game Designer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start
  playing EQ?</EM> I started in the Fall of 2002, right after LDoN came
  out.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a
  laptop or desktop computer?</EM> Both.&nbsp;
  I usually dual-box with a healer on the laptop and a tank on the
  desktop.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Do you play on
  dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> DSL</P>  <P><EM>What was your very
  first character, both race and class?</EM> I originally rolled a dark elf
  warrior named Barrenzin.&nbsp;
  Barrenzin's career was short lived.&nbsp; After getting killed a few dozen
  times, mostly by his own guild master, Barrenzin retired. A few months ago, I
  named the mission giver for the new evil lvl 10 - 20 armor missions 'Barrenzin'
  in honor of confused newbies everywhere.&nbsp;
  </P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first
  online game?</EM> Yes.&nbsp; Before
  EverQuest came around, I was a pen-and-paper RPG fanatic.&nbsp; I still play a lot of pen-and-paper
  RPGs (D&amp;D, Rifts, Rune Quest, Aberrant and Star Wars), but EverQuest was
  the first game that really opened my eyes to the advantages of online
  gaming.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What other MMO's
  have you played?</EM> City of Heroes, Star Wars Galaxies, World of Warcraft,
  and EverQuest 2</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to
  solo or group?</EM> I prefer group play, hands down (that's the point of an
  MMO after all) but I also think some of the newer MMOs on the market have
  highlighted the benefits of solo options for those in-between times when you
  are waiting/looking for other group members.&nbsp; I'm fine with solo content, as long as
  it's not the focus of the MMO.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Is your main
  character in a guild?</EM> Yes. They don't know I'm a Dev yet, but I think
  they're getting suspicious.&nbsp; I
  know too much for a &quot;casual gamer.&quot;&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>How many characters
  do you have on your main server?</EM> Three.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Does your main
  character worship a deity?</EM> Yeah, Cazic Thule.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What is the most
  platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your
  characters?</EM> Not that much.&nbsp; I
  usually get hooked up by guild mates =)</P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite zone?</EM> Paludal Caverns (and not just because of the crazy
  XP).&nbsp; I really like the layout and
  scope of the zone as a whole.&nbsp; It
  feels like the kind of cave you'd imagine in a Tolkein novel.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite npc?</EM> Karsor the Mad, the NPC that trades Muramite Runes for
  spells in Omens of War.&nbsp; He was
  originally conceited as a merchant of some kind, but I didn't write his
  dialogues until very late in the Omens expansion cycle.&nbsp; I was still an apprentice at the time
  and working the craziest hours of my life, so I was feeling a little loopy
  when I sat down to write out the lines that the players would read when
  speaking with Karsor.&nbsp; Karsor's
  current ramblings just flew out of my head (originally typed in all caps) in
  about a half hour.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item
  you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons?&nbsp; If so what is it and why do you keep
  it?</EM> Sporali Defender's Blade.&nbsp;
  I wandered into Runnyeye when I was a newbie and that was the first
  item I found that was way better than what I currently had.&nbsp; I was so pumped up that I called up my
  buddy who introduced me to the game.&nbsp;
  He laughed pretty hard when I read him the stats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What is A day in the
  life of a dev/ career in game development with SOE and EQ REALLY LIKE?</EM>  It's a lot of fun.&nbsp; You get to be
  creative and see/hear players responding to and figuring out your content;
  that's the part I enjoy the most.&nbsp;
  Otherwise it's a lot like any other office job with paperwork,
  databases, documentation and emails.&nbsp;
  Occasionally, I'll find a conspiracy theory on the boards and get a
  good laugh; I wish we had the time and resources to pull off all the plots
  we've been accused of orchestrating!&nbsp;
  </P>  <P><STRONG>Brian Motisko
  &#8211; Gordish &#8211; Associate Game Designer</STRONG></P>  <P><EM>When did you start
  playing EQ?</EM> I started playing EQ on May 14th, 1999. I don&#8217;t know if
  that is a good or bad thing that I know the exact date.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play EQ on a
  laptop or desktop computer?</EM> I use a Desktop.</P>  <P><EM>Do you play on
  dial-up, cable, or DSL?</EM> People still play on dial-up?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been on cable since before
  I started playing EQ.&nbsp; I once
  tried to patch EQ at my parent&#8217;s house on a dial-up and had a download
  time of like 200 hours.&nbsp; It was
  scary. </P>  <P><EM>What was your very
  first character, both race and class?</EM> My very first character was a human
  rogue that I leveled to 4.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Was EQ your first online
  game?</EM> It was my first MMO but I used to do some sim racing over the
  internet.&nbsp; It was great; we had
  all kinds of racing leagues.</P>  <P><EM>What other MMO's
  have you played?</EM> EverQuest, EverQuest2, PlanetSide, Star Wars Galaxies,
  Dark Ages of Camelot, Anarchy Online, Asheron&#8217;s Call, World of
  Warcraft, Matrix Online, Guild Wars, Lineage 2.</P>  <P><EM>Do you prefer to
  solo or group?</EM> I like to group.</P>  <P><EM>Is your main
  character in a guild?</EM> Yes, I&#8217;ve been an officer/guild leader since
  May of 2000.</P>  <P><EM>How many characters
  do you have on your main server?</EM> My main is level 70 and I have 4 other
  level 70 characters that were once my mains or that I leveled up so that I
  could multi box.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Does your main
  character worship a deity?</EM> Unfortunately he is agnostic.&nbsp; If I could re-roll I would have made
  him Solusek Ro.</P>  <P><EM>What is the most
  platinum you have ever spent on purchasing a single item for one of your
  characters?</EM> Hmm I&#8217;m not sure probably around 100,000K.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite zone?</EM> I think Plane of Fear is my favorite zone.&nbsp; It was an awesome zone to learn how
  agro and social agro works in EverQuest.&nbsp;
  I used to pull Plane of Fear on my Shaman all the time for my guild.</P>  <P><EM>What is your
  favorite npc?</EM> This will probably be Lady Vox for old school.&nbsp; There is something about charging a
  dragon in her lair that always made fighting her fun.&nbsp; My other favorite was the Avatar of
  War back when he was hard to do.&nbsp;
  When we first started trying him he was a straight up beater.&nbsp; Now with more levels and AA&#8217;s he
  has become fairly easy.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>Do you have an item
  you no longer use but keep around for nostalgic reasons?&nbsp; If so what is it and why do you keep
  it?</EM> I have a full set of rubicite in the bank that I bring out on
  occasion.&nbsp; With armor dye&#8217;s
  though it kind of ruined the effect of showing up where all red armor.&nbsp; I also have a full set of shaman
  planar gear from the plane of hate.&nbsp;
  I have a sword of truth from Seru.&nbsp; I might have a few server first items
  too in the bank that I never got rid of.</P>  <P><EM>What is A day in the
  life of a dev/ career in game development with SOE and EQ REALLY LIKE?</EM>  It&#8217;s great to work here at Sony Online Entertainment.&nbsp; I have been treated well compared to
  other companies that I have worked for.&nbsp;
  Working on EQ is fun for the most part.&nbsp; I love the game and I love making it
  better.&nbsp; EQ has been a big part of
  my life for the last 6 going on 7 years shortly.&nbsp; It&#8217;s great when you create
  content or make changes that people like.&nbsp; The frustrating part is when you work
  so many hours on something and then players don&#8217;t like it for one reason
  or another.&nbsp; Working in the game
  industry is tough when you&#8217;re away from your family because you work
  long hours.&nbsp; Working on EQ is like
  a 24/7 job because when I leave the office for the day it doesn&#8217;t
  end.&nbsp; I&#8217;m usually checking
  the boards, playing, or working on stuff from home.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to separate your home
  life from work and you really need to try and leave your work at work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very difficult thing to
  do when you care about a game that is being played 24/7.&nbsp; </P>  <P><STRONG>Joel Sasaki &#8211;

  every night before I would log out I'd gate back there to camp out.&nbsp; I even spent a few nights setting my
  alarm to try and be the first one to his spawning point after an update or
  after someone else would kill him.&nbsp;
  It is the one an only quested piece of equipment I have ever camped to
  complete.</P>
