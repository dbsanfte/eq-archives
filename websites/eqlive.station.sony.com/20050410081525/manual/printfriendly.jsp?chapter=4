	This section takes you through
  installing the game, creating an account, running the tutorial and starting
  and stopping EverQuest.

	
		<h2>

		</h2>
	
	Before installing any
  software, you should run ScanDisk and Disk Defragmenter to ensure that your
  hard drive is working properly and is problem-free. (To do so, click <STRONG>Start</STRONG>  &gt; <STRONG>Run</STRONG>, then type scandisk or defrag and click <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.) <BR><BR>The next step in installing the game is to make sure your system meets or

  If the directory does not exist, it will automatically be created. <BR><BR>6. (Optional) Install the DirectX 8.1 drivers.<BR>* The DirectX 8.1 files included on the game CD contain drivers for most
  video cards and sound cards. For brand-new or lesser-known hardware, you may
  need to contact your manufacturer to obtain the latest DirectX drivers.<BR>* If you already have DirectX 8.1 installed, click No when prompted. If you
  are not sure, check by running dxsetup.exe (located in the Program
  Files/DirectX directory).<BR>* To install DirectX 8.1 drivers, click Yes to proceed, then follow the
  on-screen instructions. <BR><BR>7. When setup is complete, click <STRONG>Yes</STRONG> to reboot your computer. <BR><BR>8. Congratulations! You're now ready to play EverQuest ...<BR>* To connect and begin playing, double-click the EverQuest desktop icon.

	
		<h2>
			4.3
			Creating an Account
		</h2>
	
	This section shows you how to
  create an account. Once you've done that, you can log into a game server. <BR><BR>Before you can log into EverQuest, you must have an active Internet
  connection through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a valid player
  account. You'll also need a valid credit card, an EverQuest registration code
  (printed on the jewel case) and your e-mail address. <BR><BR>To create an account: <BR><BR>1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on your desktop.<BR>* Each time you start the game, it automatically downloads the latest patches
  and game news. It is a good practice to read the patch news. Once this
  finishes, click Play Online. <BR><BR>2. Click <STRONG>Account</STRONG>, then <STRONG>New Account</STRONG> to display the account
  registration screen. <BR><BR>3. Enter your name, address, e-mail address, and date of birth.<BR>* Left-click in a field, then type in the information. You can use <STRONG><EM>Tab</EM></STRONG>  to move the cursor to the next field. <BR><BR>4. Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> to proceed. <BR><BR>5. (Optional) Enter your PC specifications and answer other general interest
  questions, then click Next to proceed. <BR><BR>6. Type in a login name and your EverQuest account key.<BR>* The login name displays whenever you connect to the EverQuest servers, and
  can also be seen whenever you are in the EverQuest chat rooms.<BR>* When entering your account key, carefully check to make sure you correctly
  enter zeroes and ones. Remember, a zero (0) is skinnier than the letter
  &quot;O.&quot; <BR><BR>7. Type in a Sony Station login name and password.<BR>* If you don't have a current Sony Station account, create one by entering a
  login name and password. <BR><BR>8. Click <STRONG>Finish</STRONG>. Your registration information will be sent to the
  server and processed. <BR><BR>9. Once you receive your confirmation e-mail, repeat Steps 1 and 2. <BR><BR>10. Click <STRONG>Change Account</STRONG>. <BR><BR>11. Type in your Sony Station name and password (from Step 7), then click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG>.
  <BR><BR>12. A subscription window appears. Click <STRONG>Now</STRONG> to start a subscription.
  <BR><BR>13. Select a payment method and fill in all required billing information,
  then click <STRONG>Finish</STRONG>.<BR>* Your billing information will be processed (this may take a few minutes).
  Once it's accepted, you can click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG> to return to the
  front-end screen.<BR>* If you encounter any problems with the billing process, please contact our
  Customer Service department immediately. <BR><BR>14. Click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG> to begin playing EverQuest.

	
		<h2>
			4.4
			Logging into EverQuest
		</h2>
	
	Once your subscription is set
  up, you simply need to connect to a game server: <BR><BR>1. Double-click the EverQuest icon on the desktop. <BR><BR>2. Type in your Sony Station password and then click <STRONG>Connect</STRONG>. The
  screen that displays lists all of the available game servers. <BR><BR>3. Click on <STRONG>a server name</STRONG>, then click the large <STRONG>Play EverQuest</STRONG>  button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. <BR><BR>Your next step is to create a character. You can store up to eight characters
  on each game server. When first starting out, it might be a good idea to jot
  down the name of the server that you created your character on so that you
  can find it again. If you choose a different server you will find only a
  fresh set of empty character slots.

	
		<h2>
			4.5
			Exiting the Game
		</h2>
	
	Your character does not
  require food, drink or rest whenever you're not playing. The next time you start
  the game, your character's previous condition is restored. (For example, if
  you were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when you resume
  playing.) <BR><BR>To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Click <STRONG>Sit</STRONG>  on the Main Tab in the Actions Window, then <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> (this takes
  approximately 30 seconds). Then, click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>. <BR><BR>Or: <BR><BR>* Type /sit and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to make your character sit down<BR>* Type /camp and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to start the 30 second camp
  timer <BR><BR>When you return to the game later your character will be where you left him.
  Keep that in mind when choosing your campsite.

	
		<h2>
			4.6
			Creating a Character
		</h2>
	
	Once you log in and select a
  game server, the Character Select screen appears. It lets you create, manage and
  delete characters. Each of the eight Create New Character slots can store a
  single character that you create. The rest of this section shows you how to
  create a character, step-by-step. <BR><BR>* Click any <STRONG>Create New Character</STRONG> slot to begin. This displays the
  Character Creation screen. <BR><BR>* Follow the steps in the rest of this section to create a character. When
  you finish, you will return to this screen, and your character's name will
  appear in the slot you just chose. (In the future, you must select a server
  each time you log in, then click on a character slot to activate it.) <BR><BR>* Then click <STRONG>Enter World</STRONG> to start playing.

	
		<h2>
			4.7
			Character Creation Screen
		</h2>
	
	This screen lets you build
  your character through a series of steps: <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 1 - Pick a Race</STRONG> <BR><BR>Norrath has 13 known races, each of which was established in a specific
  region of Norrath. All have unique talents and professions - for example,
  Humans are relatively smart and can pursue nearly all professions, while
  Ogres have fewer options, but excel in physical strength. <BR><BR>* Click a race to select it. (Notice that the starting statistics and the
  list of available Classes change for each race.) <BR><BR><STRONG>Races of Norrath</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Barbarian</EM></STRONG>: Warriors at heart, most of the Barbarians' history
  revolves around one war or another. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Halas <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (Shadows of Luclin only), Rogue, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dark Elf</EM></STRONG>: Dark Elves share the heritage and features of other
  elves in Norrath, but they are more evilly aligned. Home is almost always
  underground, so darkness poses no obstacle for Dark Elves. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Neriak <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow
  Knight, Warrior, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Barbarians, Erudites, Half Elves, High Elves, Humans,
  Iksar, Wood Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dwarf</EM></STRONG>: Short but strong, Dwarves outperform Humans in nearly
  all physical tasks. Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded
  by their dexterity. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kaladim <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erudite</EM></STRONG>: Self-pride and intellect persuade most Erudites to
  forego physical activity in favor of mental challenges. Social grace is their
  forti, and they believe themselves to be the pinnacle of evolution. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Erudin or Paineel (determined by class) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard,
  Shadow Knight <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Froglok</EM></STRONG>:
  Frogloks are a short race of sentient amphibians. Although they can swim
  underwater for long distances, they're clumsy on land and can only hop from
  place to place.<BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Gukta/Grobb,
  Antonica<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Cleric, Shaman,
  Paladin, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksars, Ogres,
  Trolls, Dark Elves<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Gnome</EM></STRONG>: Distant cousins to Dwarves, Gnomes tend to burrow in the
  hillsides in underground communities. A lack of surface light lends a pale
  hue to their skin tone, and they rarely emerge to mingle with other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Ak'Anon <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Rogue,
  Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Half Elf</EM></STRONG>: As Human-Elf hybrids, Half Elves share the prominent
  physical features of both races. Their intellect is a notch above most other
  races, though they suffer a lack of strength as compared to the other
  Norrathian races. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport,
  Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Halfling</EM></STRONG>: Short and Human-like, Halflings are by far the most
  nimble and mobile race in the world. Outstanding dexterity and agility come
  naturally, and they're natural travelers. Because of this, Halflings have
  developed peaceful relations with most other races. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Rivervale <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>High Elf</EM></STRONG>: Though they have physical traits in common with Wood
  Elves, High Elves are far more developed in the ways of the mind. Pale and
  thin, they prefer to spend their time exercising the confines of the mind,
  and not the body. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Felwithe <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Iksar, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Human</EM></STRONG>: Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath. <BR><EM>Starting cities</EM>: Qeynos, Freeport  <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: All but Shaman and Beastlord <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Iksar</EM></STRONG>: A tribal race, these lizard-like warriors carry on a
  rich heritage of conquest, enslavement and destruction. Iksar are quite
  intelligent (despite their large size and warrior-like ways) and prefer to
  socialize within their own circles. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: New Sebilis (also known as Cabilis) <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight,
  Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial Tensions</EM>: All other races. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ogre</EM></STRONG>: Ogres spend as much time on the battlefield as Erudites
  and High Elves do exploring their intellect. With their gargantuan size and
  strength, they pass most of their days munching on available game and rarely
  give any thought to pursuing other interests. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Oggok <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Troll</EM></STRONG>: Despite a two-foot height difference, Trolls get along
  famously with Ogres, sharing similar likes, dislikes and pastimes. Outdoorsy
  and not quite bright, they're easily recognizable due to their skin's natural
  green tinge. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Grobb <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Beastlord (SoL only), Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Everyone except Dark Elves and Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Vah
  Shir</EM></STRONG>: Vah Shir are a feline race that walks upright. They're as tall
  as Barbarians, and are selfless and focus only on the good of others. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Shar Vahl<BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Warrior, Rogue, Shaman,
  Beastlord, Bard<BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Indifferent to all
  other races<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wood Elf</EM></STRONG>: Yet another variation on the Elven-Human theme, Wood
  Elves are slightly weaker than Humans, but highly dexterous and agile.
  Despite their tendencies to be wild and secretive, they are very dedicated to
  the good of society. <BR><EM>Starting city</EM>: Kelethin <BR><EM>Classes</EM>: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior <BR><EM>Racial tensions</EM>: Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 2 - Pick a Class</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your class (your characters occupation) describes your career goal in the
  game. You can pursue any life you choose in EverQuest, so long as your race
  permits it. <BR><BR>* Click an occupation to select it. (Note that each occupation gives you
  specific attributes that are marked with green numbers. When allocating
  ability points, concentrate on these characteristics.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bard</EM></STRONG>: The Bard has the unusual ability to play magical songs
  whose supernatural effects last as long as the Bard continues to sing. He has
  some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (self-defense), but his main focus
  is always his art. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Dexterity, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Beastlord (only available with Shadows of Luclin)</EM></STRONG>: Beastlords are
  the spiritual warriors of the primitive cultures of Norrath and Luclin. Like
  the Shaman, the Beastlords have a close relationship with the spirit world.
  The Beastlord's fighting style is derived from tactics used by wild beasts
  thus they prefer to fight unarmed or with only small piercing weapons. But
  the Beastlord is best known for his life-long animal companion. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +5 Agility, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Berserker</EM></STRONG>:
  Berserkers are fearsome fighters, wielding two-handed axes and hurling
  throwing weapons. They have the best throwing arms of all Norrath classes.
  Their innate rage causes them to reach a frenzied battle state known as
  &quot;berserk&quot;.<BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cleric</EM></STRONG>: A Cleric is a holy woman born with the power to heal,
  and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of her deity to smite her foes.
  Prayer is how the Cleric gains her ability. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Druid</EM></STRONG>: A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all
  flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He
  is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to
  call upon Nature for aid and defense. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Enchanter</EM></STRONG>: The primary focus of this art can be summed up by
  the name of the arcane order to which it belongs - enchantment. Spells are
  crafted to enchant people, places and things. An Enchanter can charm beings
  and make them fight for a new master, or magically enhance the capabilities
  of a sword-welding warrior. She even has some proficiency in offensive
  spells. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Intelligence, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Magician</EM></STRONG>: The Magician is the summoner of the arcane arts, and
  can conjure up everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to
  fight on his behalf. While not as offensively adept as a Wizard, a Magician
  still possesses considerable spell power. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Monk</EM></STRONG>: The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure
  weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor. She's very religious as
  well, and the gods are known to bless Monks by magically enhancing their
  attacks. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Necromancer</EM></STRONG>: The Necromancer belongs to the dark brotherhood of
  the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spells, he can animate dead
  bodies and skeletons to do his bidding, as well as cast spells to leach life
  from his victims. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Paladin</EM></STRONG>: A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of
  good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights
  nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to heal
  simply by Laying on Hands. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +5 Wisdom, +10 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Ranger</EM></STRONG>: The Ranger is a hybrid mix between a Warrior and a
  Druid, sharing the skills of both. He's most at home in the great outdoors. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rogue</EM></STRONG>: Falling somewhere between an assassin and a thief, the
  Rogue belongs to the secretive class of Norrath. She's quite skilled in
  weaponry, but prefers to make sudden attacks from behind. Shadier skills
  include Pick Lock and Pick Pockets. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Agility, +10 Dexterity <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shadow Knight</EM></STRONG>: The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight
  derives power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part
  Necromancer and has the innate ability to damage flesh with his Harm Touch. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +5 Stamina, +10 Intelligence, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Shaman</EM></STRONG>: Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch
  doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary
  focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells
  as well. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +5 Stamina, +10 Wisdom, +5 Charisma <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Warrior</EM></STRONG>: A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its
  forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much
  punishment as he doles out. By nature, Warriors have more health points than
  any other class. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Strength, +10 Stamina, +5 Agility <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wizard</EM></STRONG>: The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is
  spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar
  and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her
  a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of
  destruction. <BR><EM>Modifiers</EM>: +10 Stamina, +10 Intelligence <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 3 - Allocate Ability Points</STRONG> <BR><BR>Your character has primary and secondary statistics. Primary ones are bright
  green, and represent abilities most beneficial to your chosen occupation. The
  others are secondary, which means they still affect you, but aren't quite as
  important. <BR><BR>The box in the top right corner of the screen shows your bonus ability
  points. The amount differs by race and/or occupation. You can add these points
  to any ability - but you should probably add most of them to your green
  &quot;primary&quot; abilities. <BR><BR>* Click &quot;+&quot; to add a bonus point to an ability.<BR>* Click &quot;-&quot; to remove a bonus point from an ability. (You can't
  decrease any ability below its starting value, however.) <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Agility</EM></STRONG>: Physical agility; affects your probability of being
  hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Charisma</EM></STRONG>: How various factions react to you; affects prices for
  some merchants. Also affects spell effects for Enchanters and Bards, and
  helps Bards successfully play more notes. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Dexterity</EM></STRONG>: Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver
  with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain
  skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects
  some skills and Bard songs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Wisdom</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn specific skills. For a
  Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects maximum mana at
  each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Intelligence</EM></STRONG>: Affects how fast you learn many skills. For a
  Necromancer, Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or Bard, it also
  affects maximum mana at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Stamina</EM></STRONG>: Health and constitution; affects your maximum number
  of hit points at each level. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Strength</EM></STRONG>: Physical strength; affects how much you can carry,
  how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some
  skills. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 4 - Pick a Facial Appearance</STRONG> <BR><BR>To change your character's face, click <STRONG>Set Face</STRONG> just above the picture
  of your character. Click the arrows to cycle through different facial
  appearances. To return to the full view of your character, click <STRONG>Accept</STRONG>.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 5 - Pick a Name</STRONG> <BR><BR>Either type in a name, or click <STRONG>Get Name</STRONG> to let the computer pick a
  name for you. You can't use spaces, dashes or special characters (#, ?,
  etc.). <BR><BR>* Click in the name field and type<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> to proceed <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 6 - Pick a Deity</STRONG> <BR><BR>The Deity Selection screen displays once you click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> from the
  Character Creation screen. Depending on your occupation and race, you can either
  choose from several of 18 specific deities, or remain agnostic (not a
  follower of any one god, perhaps unwilling to acknowledge their power). <BR><BR>* Click a deity to select it. The name of the god appears in the text to the
  right. <BR><BR><STRONG>Here are some generalizations about the followers of each of the available
  gods.</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bertoxxulous</EM></STRONG>: Lovers of decay and disease; dedicated to
  spreading both. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Brell Serilis</EM></STRONG>: Choose to inhabit the underground; generally a
  bit solitary. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Bristlebane Fizzlethorpe</EM></STRONG>: True believers of fun and mischief;
  doctrine disregards trust and honesty. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Cazic-Thule</EM></STRONG>: Followers are ruled by fear; hate, cruelty and
  torture abound. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Erolissi Marr</EM></STRONG>: Defend justice and innocence; love always
  overcomes hate. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Innoruuk</EM></STRONG>: Fervid proponents of hate; no loyalty exists between
  followers, and all that is Good is weak. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Karana</EM></STRONG>: Disciples of rain; respectful of the power of weather
  in the woodlands. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Mithaniel Marr</EM></STRONG>: Seek courage, honor and good; leave
  frivolousness to others. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Prexus</EM></STRONG>: Watchguards of the water; doctrine upholds that this
  deity will one day wash away all of Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Quellious</EM></STRONG>: Masters of inner peace and enlightenment; knowing
  one's true self will help bring peace to Norrath. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rallos Zek</EM></STRONG>: Warriors to the end; emphasizes survival of the
  strong and the true value of conflict. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Rodcet Nife</EM></STRONG>: Selfless servants to the weak and diseased;
  preaches healing and cleansing as one's life work. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Solusek Ro</EM></STRONG>: Devoted followers of all things aflame; aggressive
  and purposeful in all that they do. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Tribunal</EM></STRONG>: Bringers of justice; the world is
  black-and-white, and all wrongs deserve an even revenge. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Tunare</EM></STRONG>: Trustees of Nature; the land Norrath is to be protected
  at all costs. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Veeshan</EM></STRONG>: Worshippers and servants of all Dragonkind; doctrine
  calls for sacrifice and dedication. <BR><BR><STRONG>Step 7 - Pick a Starting   City</STRONG> <BR><BR>The world of Norrath is populated with many cities, but not all are friendly
  to all races, occupations and beliefs. Race is the primary factor that
  determines your starting city - you'll always be able to start in at least
  one of the cities listed in Race. However, choosing a certain deity or
  occupation may affect your starting city. <BR><BR>You can start from any city with a yellow or white name. (You may be able to
  choose between two or more cities, or you might only have a single option.)
  The currently selected city's name is yellow; cities you cannot start from
  are faded out.<BR><BR>* Click a city to select it (you may or may not have more than one choice)<BR>* Click <STRONG>Next</STRONG> twice to return to the Character Selection screen <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're planning on playing with your friends in a new city, make sure
  everyone has a compatible race, class and deity.</EM>

			4.8
			Server Selection
		</h2>
	
	<P>Choosing a server is one of the first decisions you must
  make when you enter EverQuest. Though it is true that many people who have
  friends in game will choose the server where their friends are, it is
  generally recommended that unconnected people choose the least populated
  server for play. <BR><BR>There are also special servers with different rules from those of the
  majority of our servers. New players will want to take care before choosing
  to play on these servers, and read the rules for them before starting. Each
  server has a different theme and should you choose to play on one, the
  following information should be considered. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Rallos Zek Server (PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Rallos Zek Server is the oldest PvP server in EverQuest. On this server,
  everyone has the ability to attack each other subject to a 4 level limit. For
  instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41
  through 49. <BR><BR>In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server,
  the loot rules are &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot;. You may loot (or have looted
  from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item. Items in bags, in a melee
  slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be
  looted. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers (PvP Teams, Coin Only)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers is what we call PvP-Teams servers. Only races on
  opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.; The four teams are: <BR><BR>Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls<BR>Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.<BR>Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.<BR>Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians. <BR><BR>Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other
  three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can
  attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they
  are on opposing teams. <BR><BR>The loot rules on these servers differ from Rallos Zek. Only coin may be
  looted from a fallen opponent. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Sullon Zek Server (Deity based team PvP)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this
  server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In
  general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon
  and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character
  worships rather than the race of the character. <BR><BR><STRONG>Sullon Zek rules: </STRONG><BR><BR>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are
  not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack
  and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his
  alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply. <BR><BR>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough
  strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to
  participate in PvP combat, unless they stray from city and newbie zones. As
  soon as a character 'dings' into 6th level he or she will become PvP enabled.
  <BR><BR>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character
  that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be
  the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your
  corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience. <BR><BR>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then
  only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character
  getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse. <BR><BR>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means
  that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new
  one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release
  of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that
  wish to explore these new characters. <BR><BR>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their
  Deity Team. <BR><BR>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is
  not on their Deity Team. <BR><BR>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players
  current level. <BR><BR>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player
  characters. <BR><BR>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player
  characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or
  'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they
  are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels. <BR><BR>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is
  on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally'. <BR><BR>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their
  racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a
  faction loss with the locals. Freeport,
  Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of
  Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves
  (high elves and wood elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both
  starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of
  their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other
  cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a
  certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is
  not a dwarven home town. <BR><BR>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server.
  Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts
  through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other
  characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. <STRONG>HOWEVER:
  All rules regarding general decency still apply</STRONG>. Cursing, threats and
  other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable
  behavior on any PvP server. <BR><BR>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team. <BR><BR>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones. <BR><BR>16. 'Buff' spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than
  the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will
  supercede this rule. <BR><BR>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th
  level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be
  turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined
  at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal
  reward. <BR><BR>18. Naked corpses will disappear when looted by a player character. If you
  are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse <STRONG>will</STRONG> disappear
  when it is looted. <BR><BR><STRONG>The 'Teams':</STRONG> </P>  <P>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr,
  Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <BR>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos
  Zek<BR>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus,
  Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan. <BR><BR>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods,
  those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed.
  Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the
  god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics. <BR>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel
  Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the
  good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good. <BR><BR>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some
  ancient writings that opened up new avenues. <BR><BR>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon
  Corpse or something similar. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Firiona Vie (a roleplayint preferred server)</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Firiona Vie server is a roleplaying preferred server. To motivate players
  to take advantage of the roleplaying atmosphere, the following feature list
  was implemented. <BR><BR>This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player)
  server. In other words, it's a standard &quot;blue&quot; server with the same
  rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. it is
  not one of teh &quot;Zeks&quot;. <BR><BR>* Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the
  caster. <BR><BR>* The Common language will not exist. A Human language will be added and only
  made easily available to certain races. <BR><BR>* Only one character can be created on each account. <BR><BR>* The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. <BR><BR>* Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as
  newbie notes and epic weapons. <BR><BR>* Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where
  melee characters can bind on other servers. <BR><BR><STRONG>* Trivial Loot Code *</STRONG> <BR><BR>Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC
  and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes
  effect. This can happen when either a member of your group is too high in
  level to receive experience from killing the monster, or when a member of
  your group is outside of the level range of the group for receiving
  experience from the kill. If any member of a group does not get experience
  for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code
  prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal
  items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Antonius Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Antonius Bayle is physically located in the United Kingdom. The rules for
  this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The only
  difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Kane Bayle</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>Kane Bayle is physically located in Amsterdam.
  The rules for this server are the standard rules for an EverQuest server. The
  only difference is its location. If you live in Europe  you might want to try playing on this server to see if it can provide you a
  better connection. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>The Test Server</EM></STRONG> <BR><BR>The Test Server is a server maintained for testing new ideas, spells, NPCs,
  zones and many other new concepts. You can access the Test Server by running
  the testeverquest.exe file located in your EverQuest directory. <BR><BR>Because this is a functioning test server, you may find that you are
  downloading patches frequently from this server. If you play on a standard
  server, you may also have to patch files from those servers to play there to
  replace files altered by the Test Server patch process. <BR><BR>If you plan to play on the Test Server, please read the following disclaimer.
  <BR><BR><STRONG>Test Server Disclaimer</STRONG> <BR><BR><EM>Playing on the Test server will give users an opportunity to experience
  changes firsthand before they are made available to the live world servers.
  However, it should be noted that due to frequent changes and revisions,
  enhancements made to the Test server will not necessarily make it to the live
  servers. In addition, the Test server has NO official Game Master support,
  therefore, if an item(s) is lost due to a bug, server outage, or any other
  reason, there will be NO reimbursement for the lost goods. It should also be
  noted that due to the nature of testing, the Test server may be brought down
  at anytime, without notice. Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to
  execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity
  of the test platform.</EM></P>
