<h1>More clarifications about the AA point refund</h1>
	<B>Yax wrote: <BR><BR>RE: "Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose." <BR><BR>Does that mean the "must spend 6 points in General Abilities" limit does not apply anymore to people who already have points in Archetype and Class and are now getting their points for Innate Regeneration refunded? Can those points be spent on Arch or Class abilities? Or do we still have to put 3 more points into General Abilities?</B> <BR><BR><BR>The refund will not remove any prerequisites. So, if after the refund you do not have enough General Ability points to purchase Archetype abilities, you will not be able to purchase those abilities. You'll need to spend enough on General Ability points first. <BR><BR>The same applies to abilities like Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation. If you have these abilities you will need to repurchase Mental Clarity 3 in order to use them. Mental Clarity is only being refunded because it is a requirement for Mana Burn, and those with other abilities that have this as a prerequisite probably should just repurchase Mental Clarity 3. <BR><BR><BR><B>I just noticed that the AA points spent on Innate Regeneration will be refunded because of changes made to the AA skill. <BR><BR>What were these changes that were made? I haven't been able to find any info anywhere. <BR><BR>Thanks, <BR><BR>Brent McCartney</B> <BR><BR><BR>Innate Regeneration is being refunded due to a change we made to that ability a while ago. Innate Regeneration, when it was first introduced, granted two points of regeneration per level in the ability to Trolls and Iksar. We reduced that to one point per level in the ability. We decided to allow those that purchased this ability when it was more powerful for those two races to choose to spend those points elsewhere, if they wish. <BR><BR>To be clear, we are refunding Mana Burn because we are changing the ability as described in the recent <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52118">Development Update</A>. We are refunding Mental Clarity 3 only because it is required to gain Mana Burn. We are refunding Innate Regeneration because of the earlier change made to the way it affects Iksar and Trolls. And we are refunding Quick Summoning because of the changes to the Rods of Mystical Transvergence, also noted in the Development Update. Many mages purchased Quick Summoning exclusively to expedite the use of these Rods, and so we are restoring those points to them to place where they wish. <BR><BR>Again, let me remind you that after the patch on October 16th some people will have more than 30 AA points unspent. It is important that you have no more than 30 unspent points on your characters before the patch on the 21st. <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
