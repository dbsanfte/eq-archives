			Chat Options (Options Window)
		</h2>
	
	The Chat Options are for
  filtering out chat messages altogether (to have them not show up in a
  particular window, use the Chat Windows options). Any Chat Option that you
  choose to filter will not show up in any of your Chat Windows. Additionally,
  these messages will not be sent to your computer from the server. This has
  the advantage of reducing the information sent over the Internet, and can
  improve your performance in some cases. Listed below are the types of
  messages that you can filter out, and any options available on the particular
  filter. <BR><BR>Guild Chat<BR>Socials<BR>Group Chat<BR>Shouts<BR>Auctions<BR>Out of Character<BR>My Misses<BR>Others Misses<BR>Others Hits<BR>Attackers Missing Me<BR>Damage Shields<BR>NPC Spells<BR>PC Spells [All/Group/Off]<BR>Bard Songs [All/Me/Group/Off]<BR>Critical Spells [All/Me/Off]<BR>Critical Melee [All/Me/Off] <BR><BR><EM>Note: Keep in mind that you are choosing which messages you see. So
  choosing All means that you will see all such messages. Choosing None will
  mean that you see none of the messages. If a button is depressed (selected)
  then you will see messages of that type.</EM> <BR><BR>The bottom section of the Chat Options Window is for changing the color of
  your chat text. The long list of items shown are all of the chat text types
  that you can change. To change the color of a type of text, just click on the
  button. That will pop up a color chooser window. Pick the new color and click
  Accept. You will be able to see the color change on the button for that text.
  <BR><BR>If you need to reset the colors to their default, simply click on the Reset
  Colors button.
