	<P>EverQuest now requires that clients have DirectX 9.0b or higher installed.
  </P>  <P>To determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your
  system: </P>  <P>1. Click on start; </P>  <P>2. Go up to the run box. </P>  <P>3. In the Run window, type DXDIAG then hit ok. This will launch the
  DirectX diagnostics tool. </P>  <P>Your version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of System
  Information. DirectX Version 9.0b is listed as &quot;DirectX 9.0b
  (4.09.0000.0902)&quot; </P>  <P>Please do the following prior to playing EverQuest. It is very important
  that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to avoid potential
  problems: </P>  <P>1. Go to <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=141d5f9e-07c1-462a-baef-5eab5c851cf5&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=141d5f9e-07c1-462a-baef-5eab5c851cf5&amp;displaylang=en</A>  and install the latest DirectX drivers for your operating system. </P>  <P>2. Go to the website for your video card manufacturer. There are a number
  of different manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the website
  for the manufacturer of your card. You can, at your option, go to the chipset
  manufacturer site. Most will be able to use either <A HREF="http://www.matrox.com/">www.matrox.com</A> (for Matrox Parhellia
  cards,) <A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/">www.nvidia.com</A> (for TNT/GeForce
  cards,) and <A HREF="http://www.ati.com/">www.ati.com</A> (for ATi Radeon

  you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can right-click on
  &quot;My Computer&quot;, go to properties, click on &quot;Device
  Manager&quot;, and open &quot;Sound, Video, and Game Controllers&quot;. If
  you use a SBLive sound card, you can run &quot;LiveUpdate&quot; from the
  Windows Control Panel off of your start menu. View our Sound FAQ: (<A HREF="../../../../../support/tech_support/ts_audio_trouble.jsp">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_audio_trouble.jsp</A>)

  dxdiag.exe) </P>  <P>2. Click the &quot;Save all Information&quot; button at the bottom of the
  program window. </P>  <P>3. Save the file as dxdiag.txt </P>  <P>Email the dxdiag.txt file you just created along with a complete
  description of your problem, any text from any error messages that are
  presented, and a phone number that you can be reached at if you are willing
  to assist our testing department over the phone to <A HREF="mailto:eqtech@soe.sony.com">eqtech@soe.sony.com</A>. </P>  <P>Also, if you experience a crash to the desktop while running EverQuest,
