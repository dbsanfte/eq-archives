Now, as part of Sony Online Entertainment's continuing commitment to provide EverQuest players with the finest gaming experience on the web, SOE is pleased to announce a new, reasonably priced, character name change service.<P>You simply fill out SOE's form (which you use to request, for each character, a rename to an unused name on your server that complies with all of the terms and conditions of SOE's character naming policy) and SOE will charge you the applicable fee.  SOE may discontinue this service, without notice, at any time.<P>Legends Premium Server character renames will remain free. All other servers are eligible for this paid service.<P>Check out the EverQuest Live site (www.everquestlive.com) for more details.<P>** The EverQuest Guide Program Wants YOU! **<P>Do you enjoy helping your fellow adventurers? Does traveling the world of Norrath and meeting new and interesting people excite you? Do you have some free time to devote in aiding others? If so, then the EverQuest Guide Program may be what you are looking for! If you are 18 years of age or older, have an EverQuest account in good standing, and wish to join the Guide Program, go to <A HREF="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/" TARGET=_blank>https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</A> and fill out an application today!<P><BR>
