<h1>Patch Message for August 22nd</h1>
	August 22nd, 3:00 am  <BR>------------------------------<P><BR>** Crashing Bug Fixes **<P>- Fixed the problem that was causing zones to crash in some instances.<BR>- Corrected a bug that would cause some people to hang up while waiting for a sound event between the splash and character-select screens.<P><BR>** Item Change **<P>- The Green Flower should be working again.<P><BR>** Spell Change **<P>- Fixed a stacking bug that allowed multiple Levitation buffs to stack.<P><BR>** Sullon Zek Changes **<P>-  The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working properly now.  Here is the text about that change:<P>"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek.  Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters.  At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters."<P>- Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.<BR>- Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.<BR>

My question being is what was so important in this patch that it couldn't wait till next week, or have ya'll decided to go back to weekly patches?</B><P>We had some fixes for bugs that were causing clients and zones to crash.  We felt it was important to get those fixes in.  We're still planning to patch every other week for the most part.<P>Alan<BR>
