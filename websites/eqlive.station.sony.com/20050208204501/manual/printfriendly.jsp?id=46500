			Resizing Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	You can change the size of
  some windows with a simple click and drag of the mouse. Other windows can't be
  resized at all. <BR><BR>Look at the borders around the windows. If the border is a simple, solid
  line, that window can't be resized. If the border has a bit of flare around
  the corners it can be resized. <BR><BR>To resize a window, simply point your mouse at the edge of the window that
  you want to change. Your mouse cursor will change into a two-headed arrow (if
  it turns into a four-headed arrow, that window can't be resized, only moved).
  Simply click and hold the left mouse button, then drag the mouse left and right
  or up and down to change the size of the window. <BR><BR>Notice the directions that the arrows point. You can only drag the window in
  the directions of the arrow. If you want to make the window taller or
  shorter, you need to drag it from the top or the bottom. If you want to make
  it wider or thinner, drag it from one of the sides. If you point at the
  corners of the window, the arrows will be diagonal to the window. This allows
  you to drag the window in both directions at once.
