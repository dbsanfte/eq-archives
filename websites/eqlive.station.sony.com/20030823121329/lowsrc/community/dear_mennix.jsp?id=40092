<h2>Letter to the Editor</h2>
<DIV align=center><STRONG>Dear Mennix</STRONG><BR></DIV>
<DIV style="FONT-SIZE: 10px" align=center>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think Mennix can help you? Need a bit of advice? Then just send a letter to him at <A href="mailto:dearmennix@soe.sony.com.">dearmennix@soe.sony.com</A></FONT></P></DIV>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-2>28-MAR-02</FONT><BR><BR>Hello my short furry footed friend, <BR><BR>While most of your letters come to you from people seeking advice from you, I wish to help your Editor in ridding himself of his problem. So, please stop reading this and forward to your Editor. <BR><BR>Thank you. <BR><BR><B>No problem! I'll pass it on to my editor right now. Really! <BR><BR>-Mennix</B> <BR><BR>Dear Editor, <BR><BR>It really is a simple matter, ridding yourself of this troublesome little one. Follow my instructions and you will have peace in no time. Tell him that you need his next column one day early, then send him out to inspect the river in Nektulos Forest, near the Halfling outpost. There, I will be waiting for him. <BR><BR>I have a friend who won't stop drooling all over me as I read this to him weekly (I wish he could learn to read, but you know ogres). He continuously stops me and asks me what I think he looks like (Mennix that is). <BR><BR>So, do a Dark Elf a favor if you would please, promptly have him at the river on the day of your choice and we will be waiting. <BR><BR>And there you have it, no more Mennix. One less halfling. One happy and full Ogre. And maybe I could get some bones for my pet, nah, too small, couldn't use them. <BR><BR>Valarn Graverobber <BR>Dark Elf Necromancer <BR>and my gracious and hungry friend Grimmi <BR>Stormhammer <BR><BR><B>Dear Valarn, <BR><BR>As Mennix's editor, I first want to thank you for your most valuable feedback. In regards to your suggestion in how to rid myself of Mennix, I must confide in you that getting rid of him is the last thing I would ever do. You see, my world revolves around that adorable little halfling. The sun rises and sets just for him. Without Mennix gracing our fair Norrath, sadness would reign supreme. I have no idea why anyone would think I would want to rid myself of him. He is a joy and a wonder to know and to work with. All hail the great and handsome Halfling! It would break my heart, rend my very soul, if his gracious presence were to ever depart my vision. He, above all others, is the best at what he does, and his charm is unmatched. <BR><BR>No. I will not be seeking ways to get rid of Mennix. I will always stand in awe of his supreme supremeness. <BR><BR>-Mennix's Editor. Really! Honest! <BR><BR><I>(Real Editor's note: grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! I'll tell him I'm taking him on a picnic to the river.)</I></B>

<P align=left><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-2>28-MAR-02</FONT><BR><BR>Hedo, <BR><BR>Mes a Fugzug Smashybits, mes gud frend to de wurld of Norrath. Me no bash de gud creetchers, me bash de bad ones. Dey ugly! <BR><BR>Anyhow, mes wunderin if yoos have any speshyal cakes and pies recipees dat me culd have! Me Vury Gud chef! Me cuk lots fud! Me brudder Doggybone Smashybits burfday is commin ups, and me Mumsie dunt like ta cuk. So mes need bak de cakes and pies fer brudder Doggybone! Yoos help dis poor ogie, me need ta kanow how ta bak de cakes and pies! Mes wuld giv yoo great big hug fer de recipes, and mes gud dancer, mes dance fer yoos! <BR><BR>Tanks, me wuv yoo wittle halfling. <BR><BR>Fugzug Smashybits <BR>Basher fer gud and ritchowus tings. <BR>Me bash gud on de Rodcet Nife! <BR><BR><B>Dear Fugzug, <BR><BR>Forgive me as I try to burn my eyes from their sockets to get rid of the vision of you dancing for me. I'm sure you are a great dancer, but the very idea of watching jiggling piles of Ogre wobbling about in dance moves leaves my tummy roiling in discomfort. <BR><BR>I believe I have proven in the past that I am not a good baker. I'm a great eater, but the cooking part is best left up to others. If I had some special recipes to give you, I would. There's no way I am going to just make stuff up. Last time I did that, people started killing every single Bixie they came across. <BR><BR>The only cakes and pie recipes I know of are the same recipes currently out there on the market. I am sure if you asked around amongst the baking community, you would find more assistance than I can give you. <BR><BR>I am sure you will make your brother's birthday a memorable event. Happy Birthday Doggybone!</B></P>
