<h2>Casters Pets Gone Wild!</h2>
<P>Hail Mennix, do not laugh, for I fear you will.</P>
<P>Now I know us Elementals don't speak too often, but we can at least write letters. I wish to ask your advice on a problem us Elementals have - very often - which ruins our day to day life. That problem... is mages.</P>
<P>Why do they have to conjure us up day to day to do their bidding? And its not like we have a choice. It hurts too! I mean fair enough we don't die, but that doesn't mean throwing us at rampaging hands and all sorts doesn't exactly keep us healthy! All my friends, Jober, Gonaner, Jabtik, everybody asked me to voice this issue with you; we are all fed up being summoned from our dinner, party, the tavern, meetings, the lot, to go and hit some giant so that the mages greed can make them some money!</P>
<P>Is there an anti-summon potion we could drink? Is there some way of leaving the never ending torment and actually just dying? Nope. </P>
<P>So Mennix, what this boils down to is, is there any way we can summon the mages to us? I have seen an Ancient Cyclops do it once to one of my masters - I have never laughed so hard in my decades of planar existence! At least before, things followed me back to my masters but not any more. What a shame. I enjoy the look on their faces when I find some new friends.</P>
<P>Please get back to me as soon as possible and let me know how to do some 'conjuration' myself! Mwuahahahahahaha!</P>
<P>Yours faithfully,</P>
<P>Goner</P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Goner,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Although I understand the plight all pets face, I am sorry to inform you that there is no known way for you and your much abused people to summon your masters to you.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I can see the retribution aspect such a skill would provide you, and I'm all for it if it can be done. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As a warrior, I am not much into all that magic stuff. A sharp sword, quick feet, and the ability to bleed is all that is really needed when confronting any beastie. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I have heard there are some instances that a big bad beastie will summon an attacker during the right circumstances. You could try to find such a beast, give it a tickle, and hope it summons your master instead of you. It may, or may not work. I don't really know since magics and me don't really see eye to eye.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Of course, you can always keep leading your new "friends" back to your master. I always get a laugh out of that when I see it happen.</STRONG></P>

<P>Ello littl halfin.</P>
<P>Me jus lernd how ta rite, an me now usin wut me lernd ta rite to yu.</P>

<P>X<BR>Dumduh<BR>Ogre Fishie-catchr</P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Dumduh,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I can't blame you for wanting to relocate to the Jewel of Antonica, my home town of Rivervale. We have an abundance of tasty Rivervale Trout and other such delicacies found swimming about in our picture-perfect lake, enough fish to actually feed an ogre!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>There is a problem though. We halflings don't care too much for ogres. Sure, there have been one or two of your lumbering comrades who have found a bit of grace with us, but they really had to prove themselves first. And I mean, REALLY. If an ogre entered Rivervale and had not previous proved himself or herself first to us, our valiant deputies would be all over that ogre like stink on a troll.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So, if you want to come to the land of all that is right and precious in the world - we even have a nifty tune that many just can seem to shake -&nbsp;then prove yourself to us and we would have no problem with you fishing our lake.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As for your question on how to cook the fish you do catch, I can't answer that. Although I am a very fine chef in my own mind, the last time I gave cooking advice, some people took my jest to heart and went on bixie slaughter rampage. Of course, they were just bixies so not that big of a deal. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>But, just between you and I, I would say an oven would be involved.</STRONG></P>

<P>Dear Mennix, </P>
<P>I know better then to ask you for any worthwhile knowledge... I have no desire to walk into a Dragon's Den or cross the path of some useless Light Elf on some foolish idea of a quest; nor do I have some meaningless infatuation with a member of the opposite sex outside my own species. Instead I have a question of family.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I have concerns about my wayward sister, Shirei. She started as a Loyal member of the Lodge of the Dead, but after an unfortunate accident... she turned from our family's ways and took to the path of a rogue. My mother disowned her, but since my mother's demise I am now head of the Clan. As such I feel it is my duty to bring her back into the fold, but she refuses to listen to reason.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Instead of acting as a proper Teir'Dal should, she instead acts more like some opportunistic Human. She has bribed the Guards of Neriak to overlook many of her actions, but the Indigo Brotherhood has provided me with evidence of her crimes.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>She is known associate of a group of Tunare worshipers, and there is evidence linking her directly to the Kodia'Dal fool; Theris Thex and his Paladins. She is "friendly" with most of the races of Norrath, and seems to be obsessed with getting people to "like" her. There are even rumors of her walking unmolested within the outpost of that witch Fironia Vie.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Upon a recent visit she had to Nektulous I asked her to slay some Halflings for me. Your hides properly cured make for an excellent ensemble, you should be proud. She refused me, saying there was no way she would give up on such a good place to grab an ale and then she began whistling this most annoying tune. <BR>Tell me Mennix, should I give up on my sister ever returning to Innoruuk's ways or is there hope that she will finally see the errors she has committed and once again walk the True Path of Hate? </P>
<P>-Kageshi Hageshii Necromancer of Innorruk</P>
<P><STRONG>Dear Kageshi,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Yes, give up on your sister ever returning to Innoruuk's ways, and also tell her to come see me.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>wink wink, nudge nudge</STRONG></P>
