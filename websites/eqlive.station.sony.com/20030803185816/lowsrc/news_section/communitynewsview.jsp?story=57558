	<h2>The Royal Knights Recruiting 50+ on Lanys T`Vyl</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>
	07/18/2003 9:39 am<br>
	<P>In order to Join TRK on Lanys T'Vyl, you must: </P>
<P>1. Agree to The Royal Knights Code of Honor and Policies. </P>
<P>2. Be level 50+ with the main character you wish to join. </P>
<P>3. Each applicant must obtain a sponsor who is a current guildie and has been in the guild at least one month before applying to the guild (but you may post on the membership forum that you are looking for a sponsor beforehand). That sponsor is willing to stake his "reputation" that you are TRK material, and will be your contact, answer questions for you, help you get into groups and activities with guildies, and keep up with your application status. No guildie may sponsor more than one applicant at once. </P>
<P>4. Once you have a sponsor, post in the membership section of the TRK forums with the name of your sponsor, your character info, your past guild experiences, how you know/know of TRK, why you want to join, and a little about yourself personally. Your sponsor should also post on your thread with his reasons for sponsoring you and why he thinks you are TRK material (and fill in any information you left out in your application post). The thread will be moved to our guild applications section to be discussed by members when all the required information is complete. </P>
<P>5. Join our channel "TRKandfriends", group and interact with members and gain 3 recommendations (in addition to your sponsor)from current members. Feel free to use tells in game or the groups/raids forums on our site to join raids or groups with guildies. You can get a guild listing using /who all "The Royal Knights" or /who all GUILD191, and a channel listing with /list TRKandfriends (if you are in the channel).</P>
<P>6. There is a minimum one week waiting period for all applicants, which begins at the time you get your third recommendation (vouch). Once the week is up and you have 3 recommendations (in addition to your sponsor), you may be invited. Please note that this is the minimum time to get into the guild; usually it takes much longer.</P>
<P>7. If you have questions about the status of your application, ask an officer in game or email Roenae. Officers are listed on our roster. </P>
