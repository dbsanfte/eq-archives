			Sense and Disarm Traps (Scars of Velious)
		</h2>
	
	These skills now have use within Velious. There are traps, and they range from annoying to deadly throughout Velious. They are invisible and can only be detected and disarmed by rogues and bards. <BR><BR>Use "Sense Traps" to see if there are any traps in the vicinity. If so, you can then use "Disarm Traps" to try to disarm the trap. Once disarmed, the trap will remain inactive for a short period of time while your group passes through the area. <BR><BR>If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be directed towards the closest one. <BR><BR>
