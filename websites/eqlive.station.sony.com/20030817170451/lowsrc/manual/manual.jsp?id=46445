			3.6
			Attacking with Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a target, you can simply press <B><I>a</B></I> (or whichever key you've remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to hit it. <BR><BR><B><I>a</I></B> Initiate auto-attack (on current target). <BR><STRONG><EM>Esc</EM></STRONG>ape Remove current target from Target Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><I>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot). </I><BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says "Your target is too far away." Be sure to remain facing your target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow. Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage, you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and weapon skills.&nbsp; Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=16">Health, Damage and Dying</A> for information on how damage affects you. <BR><BR>
