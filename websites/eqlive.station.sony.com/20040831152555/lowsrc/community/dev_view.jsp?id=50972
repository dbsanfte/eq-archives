<h1>Luclin Update 2</h1>
	We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others.  Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list.<P>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of.  We will be keeping you updated as things change.  Also, check the patch messages for more information.<P>Fixed since release (in no particular order, by the way):<P>-  Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)<BR>-  Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die<BR>- Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent<BR>- Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.<BR>- /follow bug that caused folks to crash<BR>- Transparency issues with i810 display adapters<BR>- Crash bug related to root and gate<BR>- Various item and content fixes<BR>- Crash problems in certain zones<P><BR>Stuff in the works, some of these will be fixed with the patch on December 8th (again, in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them):<P>- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones.  Shadowhaven is one of those zones.<BR>- Reducing loading and zoning times<BR>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<BR>- Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor<BR>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<BR>- Slow framerate on some fast computers<BR>- Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users.<BR>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<BR>- A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing<BR>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<BR>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<BR>- Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans<BR>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<BR>- A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game.<BR>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<BR>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<BR>- A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.<P><I>Note:</I>  Those without Velious should be able to access the Alternate Advancement interface by hitting the 'v' key.<P><I>Also note:</I>  The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability.  It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer.<P>Thank you all for your patience.  We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]
