			Working with Windows
		</h2>
	
	The EverQuest interface is, basically,
  a selection of windows that provide information and tools that you'll need to
  play the game. Many of these windows have special purposes and special
  features. But there are some properties that most of these windows have in
  common. So the first thing we'll cover here are the very basic features of
  the windows themselves. We'll move on to describe individual windows later. <BR><BR><STRONG>For all of the descriptions that follow, we'll be assuming that you are
  using the default windows settings.</STRONG> If a window isn't where we describe
  it, it has either been moved or turned off. You'll have to look around to
  find it. <BR><BR><STRONG>What is a Window?</STRONG> <BR><BR>A window is a container that holds a group of items. For example, on the left
  hand side of the EverQuest game screen you will see a tall narrow box with
  eight hexagonal items in a column and a tiny book at the bottom. This is the
  Spells Window. Those eight little hexagons and the spell book icon are held
  within that window. They go where the window goes. <BR><BR>But each window is independent of every other window. You can't move one of
  those hexagonal spell gems away from the other seven, but you can move the
  Spells Window around the screen without affecting the other windows directly.
