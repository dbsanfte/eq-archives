<h2>Setting the Online Gaming Standard</h2>
<P ALIGN="center">Setting the Online Gaming
  Standard</P>  <P><BR>EverQuest&reg;, the extraordinarily popular massively multiplayer online
  roleplaying game produced by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), recently
  celebrated its two-year anniversary. Since its initial release in March of
  1999, the numbers of players adventuring in the world of Norrath have
  continued to climb. At this time, an average of 80,000 people are playing at
  the same time nightly (all time high is 90,000 simultaneous users). With more
  than 370,000 active EverQuest subscribers, this online phenomenon has set the
  standard for online entertainment. It promises to keep pushing the standard
  with the scheduled release of the expansion The Shadows of Luclin&#8482;,
  scheduled for release in December 2001.</P>  <P>SOE isn't resting on the success of EverQuest alone. Massively multiplayer
  games are what SOE is all about, and they have announced several games
  currently in development. As EverQuest dominates the fantasy MMORPG genre,
  the upcoming titles PlanetSide, Sovereign, and Star Wars Galaxies are set to
  take first person shooter, real time strategy, and the science fiction RPG
  genres into the budding online gaming field and make them successes as well.</P>  <P>Last year, Verant Interactive&reg; merged with Sony Online Entertainment.
  The merger joined Verant's massively multiplayer experience with
  Station.com's corral of casual online game offerings, such as JEOPARDY!
  Online and Wheel of Fortune Online, and positioned Sony as a leader in online
  entertainment. To better understand how this company utilizes its talent,
  experience, and market advantage, I spoke to the person who runs it all,
  Kelly Flock, President and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment.</P>  <P><STRONG>Steve Fuller:</STRONG> In your opinion, how do you think SOE has
  set the standard for the future of massively multiplayer online games (MMOLG)
  that all other companies would follow with the creation of EverQuest?</P>  <P><STRONG>Kelly Flock:</STRONG> In several areas. No other game in this
  genre has experienced the level of updating that goes on in EQ. Everything
  from expansion packs to new graphics to new quests. The game stays fresh and
  will continue to be improved. So, any other competitor has to have a plan to
  ensure ongoing maintenance and development. This will be beyond many
  publishers and developers. EQ also pioneered the Player vs. Environment
  model. Before then, Player vs. Player was the rule. It turns out that PvE is
  a lot more fun. Another area we've spent a lot of time on is in developing
  and supporting the community, so EQ becomes much more than just a game, but a
  complete social circle of many players.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> SOE not only set the standard for the massively
  multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), they are expecting to set the
  standard for the first person shooter (FPS), and real time strategy genres
  (RTS) as well. How are these standards being set?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> What is lacking in online FPS and RTS games is the
  execution of persistence in the world, along with an integrated community.
  There's a team-based aspect in both our FPS and RTS that goes beyond anything
  available. There will also be interesting features possible only with
  massively multiplayer games, such as home base areas.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> Do you agree that competitors will capitalize on SOE
  mistakes to make their games better? This would be good business sense
  wouldn't it?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> More than just good business sense, our competitors
  will learn a lot of things that will be useful to them coming into this
  category, just as we've learned from previous MMOLGs. We'll continue to get
  better at a lot of things, too. Many times though we hear about systems or
  game ideas our competitors are planning to implement that we intentionally
  avoided for reasons we'll let them learn the hard way.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> Who did Verant, (now SOE) learn from? Ultima Online? MUDs? (Multi User Dungeons)</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> We learned a lot from UO, and we have a great deal of
  respect for what they accomplished. We didn't alter our technology or design
  much from the UO experience, but we did change some things on the
  client/server side to avoid some of the problems they had. We also went out
  with more servers at launch than UO did because we could now anticipate a
  legitimate market for this type of game.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> Customer support for online games has grown to more
  that just a hint line. Does SOE need in-game customer support? Can support be
  better?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> Of course we need in-game customer support. It is the
  only way to ensure the integrity of the fantasy world, and to minimize the
  opportunities for a small number of miscreants to ruin the experience for
  everyone else. Support could be better, always, but there has to be some
  tradeoff between extensive customer support and an attractive, affordable
  subscription price. Customer support costs a lot, much more than we ever
  planned for. Players don't want to pay the extra amount for ubiquitous
  customer service. We hope we're hitting the right balance between
  subscription fees and level of support.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> There is a slim line between customer service and
  maintaining the game's vision of how it should be played. Will EverQuest
  customer service become a model for future games?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> I think most other publishers are going to be
  reactive rather than proactive in developing strong customer service for
  their games, and if they minimize the importance of customer service, their
  games will suffer enormously.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> What role will the use of broadband technologies play
  in the next phase of MMOLGs?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> The players will certainly have a better experience
  through broadband connections, and in fact over 25% of the EQ subscribers
  play from broadband. From the server side, it will still be in our interest
  to minimize the amount of data we're sending out, for a lot of reasons. Not
  the least being that the cost of bandwidth is still high, and in order to
  keep our subscription costs as low as possible we well need to be prudent
  about that amount of bandwidth we need to support our games. We will be able
  to send bigger and better updates more frequently to our players, so a lot of
  benefit of broadband will be in the ongoing support for the world, and not
  necessarily in the game play itself.</P>  <P><STRONG>SF:</STRONG> Detractors of online gaming often claim that spending
  time in front of a computer is not beneficial to social skills. What are your
  thoughts on the social dynamics of online game communities?</P>  <P><STRONG>KF:</STRONG> Spending time in front of a computer for almost any
  reason is preferable to sitting in front of a television, which is really our
  main competition for consumer's leisure time. Game communities are absolutely
  essential to the success of MMOLGs. Sooner or later, a player will have done
  most of the really interesting things in any game, and will have accomplished
  most of the primary objectives. It's the community that keeps them coming
  back. The social dynamics of virtual communities are very similar to actual
  communities, with the exception of the anonymity online communities offer.
  You can't hide how old you are, your sex, race, appearance, Et. Al. in real
  life, but in a virtual community you become known much more for the person
  you are or are playing as a character. It's a fascinating experience, but
  it's not to be confused with real life.</P>  <P>The online gaming industry is beginning to provide major competition to
  mainstream forms of entertainment like television and films. Setting a new
  standard in this industry marks SOE as the leaders in online gaming and
  forces the industry in whole to create better, more dynamic, games. The
  release of EverQuest two years ago gave promise to an exciting future for
  online gaming.</P>  <P ALIGN="center"><EM>Steve Fuller is a writer for
