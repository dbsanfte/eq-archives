			18.1
			Finding Quests
		</h2>
	
	Once you're fairly familiar
  with the game, you may be ready to take on a quest, or an adventure with a
  specific goal. Most quests offer some sort of reward. <BR><BR><EM>Ready-Made Quests</EM>. Many non-player characters have small quests. The best
  way to find out what they are is to hail various NPCs and ask. Non-player
  characters have certain keywords marked in square brackets - for example,
  &quot;I need some help with my [problem].&quot; If you respond with a
  question that includes that keyword, you'll receive more information. <BR><BR><EM>Player-Created Quests</EM>. Players can create their own quests and
  publicize them via chat or message boards. Keep your eyes and ears open for
  any interesting opportunities. <BR><BR><EM>Miscellaneous Events</EM>. Some of the more creative EverQuest players
  organize public events. These include advertised duels, weddings between
  characters, celebrations, and in some cases, even lotteries and contests.
