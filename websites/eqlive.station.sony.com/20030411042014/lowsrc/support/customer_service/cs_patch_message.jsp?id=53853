<h2>Patch Message, Jan 28, 2003</h2>
<P>** ANNOUNCEMENT **</P>
<P>The response to The Legacy of Ykesha(tm) extension has been overwhelming; we want to thank all of you who have pre-ordered.</P>
<P>In order to better serve ALL of our customers, including those who do not have a credit card, we've decided to make a relatively small number of The Legacy of Ykesha CD-ROMs available at retail as well.&nbsp; Please note, though, that The Legacy of Ykesha CD will likely not be available at retail in the US until as much as a week or more after the "live" date; the delay may be longer for our international customers.</P>
<P>If you have already pre-ordered from us, but you would prefer to wait for the retail CD, you can cancel your pre-order by following these instructions:</P>
<P>1. Go to the Station Store (<A href="https://store.station.sony.com/">https://store.station.sony.com/</A>)<BR>2. Go to Billing Info and sign in.<BR>3. View Current pre-orders.<BR>4. Click Cancel button; you will receive a cancellation email.</P>
<P>You may still pre-order the digital download version of The Legacy of Ykesha from the Station.com Store (the download version only - we will not be selling CDs through pre-order) for the special pre-order price of $17.99.</P>
<P><BR>January 28, 2003&nbsp; 3:00 am<BR>------------------------------</P>
<P>** Gameplay and User Interface **</P>
<P>- Further optimizations to reduce bandwidth and 'lag'.&nbsp; It is difficult to describe the value of this change, but it should show a noticeable improvement for many.&nbsp; We've also resolved many of the hit point update and movement issues that occurred recently.<BR>- Made an improvement to the animation code that may reduce the slight delays that can occur when a new player enters a zone.<BR>- Spells on spell book pages 33 to 50 can now be deleted for those who were having troubles.<BR>- Corrected a bug that could cause a crash if a character tried to purchase an item or close the merchant window just as he was leaving the trading range of that merchant.<BR>- Players should no longer get out of range message when trying to target a player on a horse just because the horse has moved a little (but is still in range).<BR>- Corrected an issue in Fungus Grove that was allowing some ranged attacks to land unnoticed by NPCs.</P>
<P><BR>** Spells **</P>
<P>- Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify, Harmony, Calm Animal, and Rest the Dead should no longer give the: "Your spell did not take hold," message.<BR>- Bard Songs with a "Rune" component should be working properly.<BR>- Sha's Advantage and Savagery are now available on vendors in the Plane of Knowledge.<BR>- Illusion spells used with Luclin models should now show the appropriate hair.<BR>- Infusion of spirit should no longer overwrite Speed of Vallon.<BR>- Sense Summoned will now sense elementals of most types.<BR>- Eye of Zomm and Stalking Probe cast from a horse will now be able to look up and down.<BR>- Call of Rizlona now has casting text for the person that procs this spell.</P>
<P><BR>** Alternate Advancement **</P>
<P>- Monk discipline Resistance should increase resistances properly now.<BR>- The Shaman AA ability Spirit Call should now finish casting if you regain concentration after interruption.<BR>- Corrected a problem where right-clicking on an AA hotkey would highlight the wrong ability on the list in the window.<BR>- There will now be a confirmation window available when spending AA points.&nbsp; There is a new selection in the Options menu called Fast AA Purchase for toggling this confirmation.</P>
<P><BR>** Items **</P>
<P>- Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame will be dropping more frequently now.<BR>- Merchant's Crate of Supplies will now fit into containers that can hold giant-sized items.<BR>- Removed Paladin and Ranger from the list of characters that could use the Hateful Balanced Zweihander.&nbsp; It is only usable by worshippers of Innoruuk, and was never meant to be used by these classes.<BR>- The Resplendent War Maul now has a more appropriate inventory icon.<BR>- Crypt Master's Conjuring Stone is now more valuable to NPC vendors, and they will not sell it as cheaply as they did in the past.</P>
<P><BR>** Quests **</P>
<P>- Killing Kazen Fecae is no longer a viable path to the completion of the Necromancer Epic quest.<BR>- Tibrinn Ember now gives a faction modifier for the completion of his quest.<BR>- Hanns Krieghor will no longer grant faction increases just by talking to him.<BR>- There are now a few Iksar in the Plane of Knowledge that are interested in your Iksar racial armor.</P>
<P><BR>** Bazaar **</P>
<P>- Corrected a bug in the Bazaar that caused price changes made by traders to only affect one stack of the same item.<BR>- Target Group Buff and the AA ability Mass Group Buff can no longer be used with levitate spells to push traders out of their stalls in the Bazaar.</P>
<P><BR>** NPCs **</P>
<P>- The specters and shades in Velketor should no longer be dropping cloth armor.<BR>- Centi Dators should no longer spawn inside walls.<BR>- Oozing Flesh in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should no longer drop Sabretooth hides.&nbsp; It was determined that these creatures are too slow to catch a Sabretooth, and that they do not have the ability to skin them nor the desire to wear (or eat) their hides.<BR>- Elder Spiritualist Grawleh will now respond properly to hails.<BR>- Fittorin Bladespur will now respond properly to hails.<BR>- A Frost Giant Sentry will now respond properly to hails.<BR>- Tanik Greskil will now respond properly to hails.<BR>- Kozyn Gigglephizz will now respond properly to hails.<BR>- Pit Guard Retaj will now respond properly to "What grunts?"<BR>- Lendel Deeppockets now knows how to spell "rogue".<BR>- Corrected text for Arinna Trueblade, she now tells you how to make armbands instead of helmets.<BR>- Prime Patriarch Vuzx should be less likely to leave his usual spot.<BR>- Gindlin Toxfodder should be less likely to be out of his usual spot.<BR>- Deputies Budo and Drebo should no longer get stuck under the floorboards of their tower.<BR>- The River Source in the Warrens can no longer be attacked.<BR>- Moved Mignar Mi`Draskch a little bit so that newly created enchanters would not try to appear on top of him.<BR>- Lorekeeper Zorik is now properly described as a female in text referring to her.<BR>- Peras Glickon will now tell you that he sells food and drink (which he does) instead of spell components (which he does not).<BR>- Fantoal Geabaran should now offer the inventory for sale that he claims to have.<BR>- Old Gourdhead should no longer be disliked by the other natives of Misty Thicket (fixed a faction bug).<BR>- The Muglwump will show up less frequently now.<BR>- Dark Huntress in Mistmoore will now use the correct model and is on the correct faction.<BR>- Corrected the models for elementals in the Plane of Earth.<BR>- NPCs in the "pit" area of Plane of Tactics will now respawn properly.<BR>- Removed Sarnak Slaves from Nurga, since they had no models there to use and looked like the base model human (Doug).</P>
<P><BR>** Character Appearance **</P>
<P>- The bald head can now be selected during character creation by clicking the left arrow button (was only available by clicking the right arrow).<BR>- Beard color selection now works for dark elf male, high elf male, half elf male, and dwarf female during the creation of new characters.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; Dwarf female only has one style of beard.<BR>- The ability to pick a wode is now available at character creation for Barbarians.<BR>- Choosing the "random" button at character creation will now randomly choose a face rather than always using the initial selection.<BR>- Changing from a male to a female character or from a bald character (such as Iksar) to one that should have hair will no longer make the new character appear to be bald.</P>
<P><BR>** Miscellaneous **</P>
<P>- Intelligence and Wisdom should now update properly after character becomes drunk/consumes alcohol.<BR>- Fixed a number of doors in Freeport that were opening incorrectly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
