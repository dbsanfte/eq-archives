		<h2>
			25.1
			Need Help?
		</h2>
	
	There may be times during play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention. During these times, your best bet is to turn to EverQuest's battalion of Game Masters. <BR><BR>GMs are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Game Masters is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience without the hindrance of unforeseen problems. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			25.2
			Contacting a Game Master
		</h2>
	
	To seek help, type /petition [text], where [text] is a concise message explaining what you need help with. <BR><BR>Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, GMs may be swamped responding to other players' calls. Your petition is received and noted as soon as you send it, and a GM will help you as soon as he or she can. This may take a few moments, so please be patient. Do not send repeated petitions, this will actually move you back to the end of the queue. <BR><BR>When you are contacted, explain your situation. The GM will ask for more information if necessary. You can help the GM by conducting yourself in a calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant details. Be patient and your problems will be solved if they fall within the rules of the game. <BR><BR>

			The /report Command
		</h2>
	
	The /report command instructs your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is "/report CharacterName", however the true function of the command sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window. <BR><BR>To properly use this command, use <B><I>Shift-PgUp</I></B> to scroll until the suspect text is in the chat window, then type "/report CharacterName". You should then file a "/petition" (see Contacting a <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=supgm">Game Master</A>), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation of what the /report is meant to show. <BR><BR>
