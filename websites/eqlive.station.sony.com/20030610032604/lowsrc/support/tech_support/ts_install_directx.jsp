	<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>Installing DirectX 8.1</STRONG> </DIV>
<P>To upgrade to DirectX 8.1:</P></B>
<P>1) For simplicity's sake make a new folder on your desktop; name it something easy to remember, "Dxupdate" for instance. </P>
<P>2) Download DirectX 8.1. You can find it on <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Microsoft's site</FONT></A>. Make certain to get the correct version for your operating system. Store it in your new folder so you can find it when you need it in a few minutes, <B>but don't install it yet</B>. </P>
<P>3) Locate the most recent drivers for you video card and download them into the same folder (this makes them easier to find). Don't install these yet either. <B>Do this even if you have the latest drivers installed.</B> If they have a text file with installation instructions, you might want to get that too (or print it out). </P>
<P>4) Locate the most recent drivers for you sound card and download them into the same folder. Again, <B>don't install these yet</B>, and go ahead and download them even if you have the latest drivers installed. You might also want to get any installation instructions for the drivers. You're going to need to reinstall them shortly, so it's best to have them on hand. </P>
<P>5) Set your video adapter to the Standard Display Adapter (VGA)<BR>The steps required to do this will probably vary for each of you a little bit. </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Here are example steps using Win 98:<BR>a) Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<BR>b) Double Click on Display<BR>c) Click on the Settings Tab. Then click on the Advanced Button.<BR>d) Click on the Adapter Tab, then click Change.<BR>e) Click Next.<BR>f) Select the radio button (the little circle) next to the option for <I>Display a list of all drivers</I> and click Next.<BR>g) Select the button next to the option for <I>Show all hardware</I>.<BR>h) Scroll to the top of the list and select <I>(standard display types)</I>. Then from the window on the right choose <I>standard display adapter (VGA)</I> and click Next.<BR>i) It will ask you if you really, really want to use this adapter. Choose yes. </P></DIR></DIR>
<P>6) Now install DirectX 8.1 by finding it in your folder and double clicking it. Follow the instructions for installation. </P>
<P>7) NOW you need to reinstall your video drivers. Use the new ones that you saved in the folder you created. Follow the instructions for installation given by the manufacturer. </P>
<P>8) Install the latest sound drivers for you sound card, also following the instructions given by the manufacturer. </P>
<P>You may want to reboot after this if the last driver installation didn't already force you to do so. </P>
<P>NOTE: It is important to reinstall the latest video <B>and</B> sound drivers <B>after</B> you install DX 8.1&nbsp;</P>
