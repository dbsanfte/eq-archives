	<EM>Dire Charm</EM>: (1 skill
  level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability allows the Enchanter to charm an
  NPC without fear that the NPC will break the charm (charm will end only when
  the Enchanter leaves the zone or logs out) without the memorization of a
  spell or the expenditure of mana. All of the usual restriction for charm
  spells apply to this ability as well, except in regards to duration. The
  Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Gather Mana</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points - Prerequisite: 3
  skill levels of the Caster Archetype ability Mental Clarity) - This ability
  allows the Enchanter to instantly regain all of his lost mana. The Refresh
  Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Jewel Craft Mastery</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
  chance of failure when using the jewel craft skill. The first skill level
  reduces the failure chance by 10%, the second skill level raises the reduction
  to 25% and the third skill level raises the reduction to 50%. <BR><BR><EM>Mass Group Buff</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
  gives the Enchanter the power to make his next group buff spell into an area
  of affect spell. The spell would benefit everyone in the area, not just the
  caster's group. This Ability causes the spell to use up to as much as twice
  as much mana. It will require at least the normal casting cost, and will use
  up to as much as twice the mana if the caster has that much available. The
  Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game time). <BR><BR><EM>Permanent Illusion</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 3 skill points) - This
  ability allows the Enchanter's illusions to stay up when zoning. <BR><BR><EM>Quick Buff</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting
  time for beneficial buff spells with a duration. Some spells may be
  specifically excluded from benefiting by this ability. The first skill level
  reduces casting times on buff spells by 10%, the second skill level makes the
  reduction 25% and the third makes the reduction 50%. <BR><BR><EM>Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery</EM>: (1 skill level - cost 8 skill
  points - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the Caster Archetype ability Spell
  Casting Reinforcement) - This ability raises the increased duration granted
  by Spell Casting Reinforcement to 50%.
