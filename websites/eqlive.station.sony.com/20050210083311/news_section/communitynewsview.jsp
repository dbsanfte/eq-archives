  get just get to be too much. We like the smaller groups that are more friendly

								<td colspan="2"><P>A note from <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">Allakhazam</A>:</P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>It's a milestone day for us
  here. 5 years ago today - March 8, 1999 - I signed up for a free web service
  and fancifully called the page I created Allakhazam's Magical Realm. </P>  <P>That page consisted of a single paged, rather basic guide on how to play
  EverQuest - choosing a class and race, creating a character, and basic
  fighting and grouping tactics. I did it on a whim really, as much to see what
  it was like to do a website as anything, since I had never done anything like
  that before.</P>  <P>I posted a link to the guide on various beta forums and people there
  seemed to like it. I got a lot of feedback on what it was missing and
  suggestions on how to enhance it, so I started to tinker. I beefed up the
  existing information, split the guide into multiple pages and added class
  guides and zone descriptions and links to every decent article I could find
  on the game. More people came by and suggested more improvements.</P>  <P>Then I added quest walk throughs and equipment guides. People started
  submitting information to me to include in the guides. Over time, the site
  got too busy for a free web service, so I moved it to the servers of an
  existing game site that had offered hosting. The site just kept on growing
  and expanding.</P>  <P>I put in more and more of my free time on it and every day I added more
  information to the site. Then, near the end of 1999, I hooked up with Illia,
  who wanted to create a bestiary database for the game. We decided to create
  Allakhazam.com, LLC, buy our own server and move the site to our own domain,
  and see where we could take it from there. Over time, Illia not only created
  the bestiary, but databased most of the other information I had collected.</P>  <P>Even more people began to use the site and Allakhazam started to become a
  well known destination for many EverQuest players. When Dark Age of Camelot
  came out, we decided to create a new site for that game as well. It too
  became very popular. Even though it was now a full time job for us, it got to
  the point where two of us couldn't keep up with everything, so we added
  Darkflame, Railus and Danalog to our staff. We continued to add more games
  and more people and to refine and expand upon the existing information to make
  it even more useful and accurate.</P>  <P>Now, 5 years to the day after throwing up that single page EverQuest
  guide, Allakhazam's Magical Realm covers seven games, has a staff of 12
  people, runs on 10 servers, has over 300,000 registered users who have posted
  almost a million comments, does between 2.5 and 3 million page views a day,
  and is one of the largest and most popular game sites on the entire internet.</P>  <P>All I can say is wow. And we owe it all to you, who have stuck with us
  through various highs and lows, contributed information and feedback, used
  the site and recommended it to friends, and have made the site into what can
  only be described as a true community.</P>  <P>Thank you all.</P>  </BLOCKQUOTE><br>&nbsp;</td>
