<h1>More on the Texture Cache</h1>

There is a very good possibility that this feature could help your load times and zone times dramatically.<P>Alan<BR>

<B>A quick question about removing the cached textures..<P>If someone enables the features, loads a couple of times, and then decides it's not a feature he/she wants to use.<P>Will changing it to FALSE cause EQ to see the existing cache and delete it, or will the user have to track down the files and delete them manually.<P>Also, what is the naming scheme for the files so that we might recognize them?<P>Vilkata Grazioso<BR>Prexus</B><P>It should delete the old files if you turn the cache off.

It seems faster with old-world zones, at any rate; I haven't checked the new Luclin zones with texture caching yet.<P>Kudos to your programming team. I have hard drive space to spare, so choosing this option was a no-brainer for me.<P>The only downside? I don't have enough time to catch the little remarks your team snuck into the load screen.

Saraxi wrote:<P><B>I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but why were/are the textures loaded over the network in the first place?  It seems like a waste of bandwidth to have relatively static data sent over the network every time a client connects, as compared to storing it on client machines and updating it with the patcher.  My guess is that it was done that way to keep disk space requirements down, since we didn't all have hard drives in excess of 20GB back when Everquest was first released.  Am I right?<P>Whatever the answer is, I appreciate the addition of the texture cache.  It's also amazingly cool that I have a way to pose this question to an authoritative source.  Other commercial software shops could learn a few things from you guys.  Maybe you should write a book. :-)</B><P><BR>No textures are loaded over the Internet.  It's all on your hard drive.  They are, however, loaded into RAM, and that's what takes time.  The process is something like this (and I might be wrong on some of the fine points...)<P>The data for the textures is stuffed onto your hard drive when you install the game, but they are installed in a compressed format (it's more complicated than just compression, but that's the basic idea).<BR>When you load the game, these files are decompressed (again, not the right term, but close enough) and put into RAM.<BR>It takes time to decompress these files.  It also takes time to copy them into RAM.<BR>The texture cache just decompresses these files and stores them in a format that can be copied right into RAM.  But putting all that data into RAM still takes time.<P>So you're right, we are trying to use as little hard drive space as we can during installation.  But all the textures on your hard drive, and they are indeed updated with the patcher and stored on your hard drive.<P>Heh, I might be authoritative, but I don't know much.  Just enough to ask the right questions of the right people.<P>And I don't much like reading technical manuals, I sure wouldn't want to write one.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

pyrian wrote:<P><BR><B>Greetings,<P>I'm still a bit confused to your texture cache feature.  Now, in your patch message, it read: <P>"We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache."<P>So if I had 640 megs of RAM in my system, turning this texture cache on won't benefit me one bit?  I would assume that it would.  Can you please clarify this one little detail for me please?  Thanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>The best I can say is that it might help and it might not.  How much this helps any one person is very dependent on their computer and their settings for the game.  The only advice I can give is to try it out and see.  If you find that it doesn't speed things up enough for you, then just delete the .txc files from your EverQuest directory and turn it off.  But there is a good chance that the texture cache will help you out, even if you have 640 megs of RAM.<P><BR><B>Very nice feature (even though I don't use it yet).<P>However, you say that it has to happen while playing the game. Making for longer zoning times at the first time the zone is loaded after the option was turned on.<P>My question: Can't you guys write some little utility that does this while out of the game? I mean, I don't mind sitting back for an hour reading a book or whatever, while my computer is (fully) occupied creating the texture cache on my harddisk so that next time when I log on I will have shorter loading times.<P>Maybe even allow the user to set a cache size, and depending on the cache size some or all textures of a zone are extracted into it.<P>By the way, what would the total size of the texture cache be for the original game, Kunark, Velious and Luclin?<P>- Kaysha Soulsinger<BR>Vicar in the 54th Circle of Erollisi Marr</B><P>The increase in zone or load times when the cache is first built is not very long.  Some people don't even notice the extra time.  Part of the reason that we stressed that it might take a little more time to load or zone the first time was that it's important that people understand that they won't see the speed improvement the first time they log in.  We're not talking about an hour.  You won't have time to read a book or even a newspaper with the extra time required for that first load.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>
