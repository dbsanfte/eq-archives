	<P>The following personal routers/home firewalls have been tested with
  EverQuest and are able to be used under their default configurations*.&nbsp;</P>  <P>If for some reason you experience a problem connecting to your EverQuest
  server or the patcher, we suggest that you set your router back to its
  default settings.&nbsp;</P>  <P>Below you will find information as to how to reset your router to its
  default configuration, as found in each router's manual or their
  manufacturer's website.&nbsp; Also, if you are using another setup aside from
  DHCP or a static IP, such as PPPoE**, or if your ISP requires a login/pw,
  please take note of these settings before performing the steps below.&nbsp;</P>  <P>If you have issues that resetting your router to its
  default configuration does not solve, please contact our Tech Support
  Department at (858)537-0898, or via our <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/en/services/help/premiumGames.jsp">online form</A>.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><A HREF="../../../../../support/tech_support/ts_router.jsp#NetgearFP">Netgear&reg;
