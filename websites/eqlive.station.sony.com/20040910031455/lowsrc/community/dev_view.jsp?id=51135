<h1>Physical Enhancement</h1>
	<BR><B>""This ability adds an additional 2% to the Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability archetypes.<BR>There is no pre-requisite that these archetypes be trained in, however the greatest effectiveness is achieved from doing so. It is believed that you need at least 1 point in an archetype to get the 2% increase in it (i.e. you would get no benefit in Natural Durability if you only had points in Combat Agility and Stability).""<P>Most every melee type has this skill under Archtype, Paladin, Ranger, Shadowknight, even Beastlord. But seems Warrior, Rogue and Monk are missing it, or were left out specifically. What was the reasoning behind this?<P>Renaan Hellfire<BR>Tarew Marr</B><P>This ability came out of beta testing for Luclin.<P>Originally there were just the basic archetype abilities.<P>But there was some discussion among the testers about the usefulness of those abilities for hybrids.  The logic went something like this.<P>Lets assume that a theoretical hybrid was 75% as effective as a warrior in each of those melee aspects (the warrior being the base at 100%).<P>If we boost the warriors ability by 5% (of the 100) he gains 5%.<BR>If we boost the hypothetical hybrid by 5% (of the 75) he gains (gets out a calculator) 3.75%.<P>So the warrior with one level of the skill is 105% and the hybrid is 78.75%.<P>So rather than the hybrid being 25% less than the warrior, hes 26.25% less...<P>As you add the levels of these bonuses up, you end up increasing the gap between the hypothetical hybrids melee skills and those of the warrior.<P>Now there was indeed much discussion about this, because if you look at it the other way, the hybrid is still 75% of the warrior (105 x .75 = 78.75).  But in the end we decided to allow the hybrids to purchase a little more effectiveness.<P>Thats why its only available to the hybrids.<P>And, no, I dont really want to debate the numbers.  My head already hurts.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>
