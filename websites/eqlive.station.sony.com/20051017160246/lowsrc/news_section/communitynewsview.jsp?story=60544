	<h2>Mystical Essence Looking for Members</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> &nbsp;<br>
	4/13/2005 7:16 am<br>
	<P>Hello, I am the proud Guild Leader of &quot;Mystical
  Essence&quot; on the Tunare server and I post here today in search of fun,
  wonderful people wanting to join a guild that's suitable for them. Mystical
  Essence is mostly a family guild that accepts all levels, classes and races
  where we try and help you feel like you belong, like you've found somewhere
  to fit in.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>I know what it's like to have no friends on Everquest and
  it really hurts, and that's why I made this guild. To bring all us misfits
  together in a big group so we won't be so lonely anymore. I introduce myself
  personally to all of our new members or members I haven't met yet, because I
  know alot of Guild Leaders do not care who they do and do not know, or ast
  like they care then forget you exist. I tried quite a few guilds and was
  dissatisfied with most of them because of that very reason.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Aside from being a family guild, we do try to form groups
  for our lower-levels pretty often, and for our higher levels arrange raids.
  We have few high-level members since we are new, but we're making our way up.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>So come try us out, if you are intrigued. We will try our
  hardest not to let you down. We're awaiting you're arrival on the Tunare
  server. See you there! =)</P><br>
