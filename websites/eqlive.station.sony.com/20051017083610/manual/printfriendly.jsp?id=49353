			Options Window

	The Options Window is not
  open by default. You can open it by clicking on the nut icon on the Window
  Selector, or by hitting <STRONG><EM>Alt-O</EM></STRONG>. The Options Window has four
  tabs; General, Display, Mouse and Keyboard. Each of these tabs allows you to
  change some of the basic settings of the game. Where an option is set by a
  button, the option is ON if the button is depressed, OFF if the button is
  out. <BR><BR><EM>Note: There is no 'done' or 'accept' button for the Options Window.
  Changes made to the options take affect as you make them.</EM>
