			Buying/Selling Items
		</h2>
	
	Whether you're new to
  EverQuest or a battle-tested veteran, you'll find that you need to buy and
  sell items on a regular basis. At the very least, you'll need to buy food and
  drink. Selling to merchants is different from selling to players. The
  following steps work with non-player shopkeepers; to sell to another player,
  see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=giving">Giving/Trading
  Items</A>. <BR><BR><EM>To buy/sell an item:</EM> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (<EM>Note: you will have to be relatively
  close to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only
  receive the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the
  merchant window</EM>). <BR><BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR><BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR><BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR>You can sell or purchase single items from a stack by holding down the
  Control key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button. To buy
  or sell an entire stack of items, hold down the Shift key while clicking the <STRONG>Sell</STRONG>  or <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> button.
