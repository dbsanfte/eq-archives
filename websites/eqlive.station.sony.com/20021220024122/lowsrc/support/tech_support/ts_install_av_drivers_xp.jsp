<P>To update your Sound and Video Drivers:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>First you will have to find out which Video Card and Sound Card you have installed. Here are two ways to determine what Sound and Video Cards, and drivers you have.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Click on the Start button on the task bar, and then click on "Run..." In the Open field, type "DXDIAG" and click OK. </P>
<P align=center><IMG height=352 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp1.jpg" width=469></P></LI></UL></LI></OL></FONT>
<P class=header>&nbsp; 
<OL>
<LI>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>This will launch the DirectX Diagnostics Tool. Click on the tab that says Display and make note of what Video Card you are using, as well as the driver version. Click on the tab that says Sound and make note of what Sound Card you are using, as well as the driver version. 
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=352 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp2.jpg" width=469></FONT></P>
<P>For people with two Display tabs, usually one is a Primary Video Card and the other is a 3D Accelerator Card. You will want to make note of and update both.</P>
<LI>
<P>Another way to check for your Sound and Video Card is by right-clicking on the My Computer icon on your desktop, and then click on Properties. When the System properties window comes up, click the Hardware tab, and click the Device Manager button. 
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=457 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp3.jpg" width=469></FONT></P>
<P>In the Device Manager, open the "Display Adapter" section and you can see what video devices you are using. Open the "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers" section and you can see what audio device you are using. You may also find your 3D Accelerator Card located in the "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers" section. Click on any device, click "Properties", and then click on the Driver tab to determine which the driver version you are using. </P>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=637 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp4.jpg" width=469></FONT></P></LI></UL><BR><BR>
<LI>
<P>After you find out what kind of Video and Sound Cards you have, click on the <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_video.jsp">Audio/Video Support</A> section to find our lists of supported devices. The lists also include links to the Manufacturer's web sites, where you can download the latest drivers for your Card. </P><BR><BR>
<LI>
<P>Download the latest driver for your Card, unless it has been recommended to download an older set of drivers. Sometimes, older drivers will be more compatible with your system. If it is recommended to download drivers, you may have to search through the manufacturer's web site until you can locate the correct driver. We provide links to those hard to find drivers, where possible.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>When you begin to download the driver, you will be prompted to either "Save" or "Open" the file being downloaded. You should click "Save", and download to your My Documents folder, or use any folder you can easily find again. After the download finishes, open up the folder you saved to, and find the package you downloaded. </P>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=637 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp5.jpg" width=469></FONT></P>
<LI>
<P>Generally, you will be downloading the drivers in the form of a zip archive. Zip archives are special packages of compressed files. Your computer should have an unzip program already installed, but if you do not have an unzipping program you can download a trial version from <A href="http://www.winzip.com/" target=_blank>www.winzip.com</A>. Open the zip archive by double-clicking it. Choose to EXTRACT all files (in WinZip this can be found under the Actions menu).</P>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=637 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp6.jpg" width=469></FONT></P>
<P>You will be prompted for a location where you wish to extract the archived files. Make sure you know the exact location of the folder. You should create a directory such as: C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\DRIVERNAME, then click the Extract button. Sometimes drivers will come in self-extracting or self-installing packages, which should run when you double-click them.</P>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=637 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp7.jpg" width=469></FONT></P>
<LI>
<P>Carefully read any "Readme.txt" file that is included with your download. Follow the directions listed there, as they are generally the best directions for correctly installing the drivers for your card. It may be helpful to print out the instructions, before the installation, to help guide you through your update.</P>
<LI>
<P>If there is no self-installation or "Readme.txt". follow these generic installation instructions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Right-click on your "My Computer" icon and click the "Properties" selection from the bottom of the drop-down menu. 
<LI>When the "System Properties" window comes up, click on the "Hardware" tab, then click the "Device Manager" button. 
<LI>From the "Device Manager", open the section appropriate for the driver you wish to update (for example, select Display Adapter for Video card), double-click on the device bring up the "Properties" window. 
<LI>From the "Properties" window, select the "Driver" tab and click the "Update Driver..." button. The "Hardware Update Wizard" will appear. 
<LI>Click the option for Windows to "Install from a list or specific location", then click Next. Do not allow Windows to search for a driver, as it will not install the drivers you downloaded. Next, select the "Don't search" option and click "Next". 
<LI>After the Driver Database loads, you should see a list of possible drivers. Instead of choosing one of these, click the "Have Disk..." button, then the Browse button. 
<LI>Locate and select the folder, where you extracted the driver files to. 
<LI>Click OK, then click OK again, and you should now be given a new set of choices for the device. 
<LI>Select the one appropriate for your model and click Next. Click Next one more time, and the installation will take place. 
<LI>You'll be asked if you want to restart your system to have the new settings take effect. You should agree, and when your system restarts, your driver should be updated.</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI>
<P>If you are using Windows2000 or WindowsXP, you may encounter an "unsigned driver" warning screen. An "unsigned driver" means that Microsoft has not approved that driver version yet. You can force the driver to install by selecting the "Continue Anyway" option.</P>
<P align=center><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><IMG height=637 src="/images/tech_support/installing_av_xp8.jpg" width=469></FONT></P></LI></UL></LI></OL><BR><BR>
