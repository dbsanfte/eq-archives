<h1>More information on Gates Re-Tune</h1>
	<P>Hey folks,</P>  <P>Here is some expanded information on the Gates re-tune happening next
  week.&nbsp; The list shows the proposed change and below it, the reason we
  are&nbsp;planning to make&nbsp;the change.&nbsp;</P>  <P>Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and
  beyond.<BR>- To make it more appropriate and rewarding for the intended player level
  ranges.</P>  <P>Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more
  appropriately for their intended level ranges.<BR>- To make the zones more appropriate and rewarding for their intended level
  ranges.</P>  <P>NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular
  should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with.<BR>- Grouping restraints were too tight. This caused groups to require a
  warrior/riposte tank with multiple healers.</P>  <P>Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member of their guild in
  order to complete Ikkinz. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids
  to start Ikkinz 7. At that point, all players who complete Ikkinz 7 will get
  full credit for the zone.<BR>- Based on customer feedback.</P>  <P>NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<BR>- Based on customer feedback and designer logic. The innates that were placed
  on the NPCs were inappropriate and were making encounters too difficult.</P>  <P>Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered (faction
  placed to dubious) and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<BR>- Based on customer feedback. Players needed invisibility all the time and
  were getting swarmed by NPCs. These changes will help reduce these issues.</P>  <P>Spell drops have been increased.<BR>- Based on customer feedback.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Increase the rate of cash drops<BR>- Based upon customer feedback</P>  <P>Please submit feedback using the Dev Corner feedback button to let us know
  what you think!</P>  <P>Brenlo</P>
