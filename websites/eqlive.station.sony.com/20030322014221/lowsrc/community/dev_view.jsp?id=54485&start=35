<h1>Allakhazam visits SOE</h1>
	<B>Hello there! <BR><BR>I read on a recent article on Allakhazam that you were planning a Nurga revamp... <BR><BR>Please DON'T!!! <BR><BR>This was a zone I thoroughly enjoyed in my thirties/low fourties. It was simply great. I don't know how it is on other servers, but on Vazaelle, its popularity is rising ever since PoP release, and not for Chardok faction farming: I actually got into a few pick-up groups there! <BR><BR>If you are to revamp that zone, PLEASE don't take it away from the 30-45 crowd. <BR><BR>Thanks, <BR><BR>Minerios Serredargent<BR>Vazaelle <BR><BR></B><BR><BR><BR>Hi. <BR><BR>Here's what happened... <BR><BR>Friday we invited several folks from various fan sites for EQ and EQOA to visit us. They spent the first half of the day with Alex and the EQOA folks, and the last half with the EQ team. They had time to ask a bunch of questions, and there were a lot of questions and answers to keep track of. <BR><BR><A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail1370.html?story=1370">Here is the article that Allakhazam wrote</A> based on what happened that day, for those wondering what Minerios is asking about. <BR><BR>As to the Nurga revamp, this zone was brought up as one of the zones we could fix without having to do a major revamp. Change a few things here and there and we can bring it from a good zone (nice feel to it, nice layout and all that) to a very good zone that plays well. It's possible that such a change may include a change to the overall level of the zone, but at this point that is not part of the plan. <BR><BR>And, to anticipate the next question, we don't have a schedule for any zone revamps or anything else to announce right now. But things like this are on our list of things we'd like to get to in the near future (though that is a pretty large list). <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
