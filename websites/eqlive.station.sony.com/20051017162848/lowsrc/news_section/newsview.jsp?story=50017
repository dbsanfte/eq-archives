	<P>*
  The following is found on a note of tanned vellum written in black ink in
  small economic handwriting *<BR><BR>High Priest
  Yeolarn of Tunare,<BR><BR>Though unable to defeat Ithiasor, the black dragon of the Swamp, I learned
  that others had faced and defeated this great wyrm.&nbsp; I was correct in my assumptions of
  this Veslin Savok.&nbsp; It appears he was
  an agent or mercenary of the trolls of Grobb.&nbsp; Veslin accepted this chest from the proud
  slayers of Ithiasor and promptly delivered it to the troll instigators of
  Grobb.<BR><BR>Our Felwithian spies are not the only ones in search of information. </P>  <P>Froglok agents of Gukta
  also watch the shadows to protect their new and unstable city.&nbsp; One of these agents sought adventurers
  to recover this chest from the trolls of Neriak; no easy task.<BR><BR>I accepted.<BR><BR>I traveled through the dark forest   of Nektulos to the
  doors of&nbsp; Neriak itself.&nbsp; The Tier'Dal Dragoons have grown weak
  in recent days and I was able to easily dispatch them.&nbsp; I used to question such actions but in
  this age of war, such actions come easy.&nbsp;
  I met with five fellow adventurers, old friends I have hunted with in
  the far lands.&nbsp; Canerit the monk,
  Lord Garmok the Warlord, Yridian the Vah Shir Beastlord, Amril the elven
  warrior, and Kanadrix the mage.&nbsp;
  Amril was critical in learning of the Guktan spies and acquiring the
  layout of the troll stronghold inside Neriak.<BR><BR>We took little time in our small but powerful attack.&nbsp; My companions, experienced in battle
  against the Muramite legions and demons of the lower planes, took little time
  in cutting down the guards of Neriak's foreign quarter.&nbsp; We traveled quickly to the south into
  the slums of the trolls.&nbsp; It was
  there we realized how powerful these troll usurpers had become.<BR><BR>They fought with a fury never seen within the walls of Neriak.&nbsp; They fought with strange weapons, some
  not seen in thousands of years.&nbsp;
  The weapons and magics contained within that ancient chest were
  powerful indeed.&nbsp; The blades of
  the trolls cut deep.&nbsp; Three times
  the trolls sent us running back into the forests of Neriak.<BR><BR>Our fourth attack, however, delivered our victory.&nbsp; Using chaos as our own weapon, we
  managed to separate the overlord of the troll resistance, Warlord Bortar, from
  his advisor and personal guard.&nbsp;
  We battled him at the gates of Neriak.<BR><BR>Even alone the warlord fought like ten men.&nbsp; Bortar smashed Garmok, an ogre of
  nearly five hundred stone, against the ebony walls.&nbsp; He cut deep gashes into the stone floor
  with his enchanted axe.&nbsp; Only with
  our combined strength did the warlord fall.&nbsp; Garmok's runed blade spilled black
  blood from a deep wound in Bortar's side.<BR><BR>We returned the chest to a Froglok conspirator outside of Neriak and received
  little more than a word of thanks for our efforts.&nbsp; The spy network of Guktan keeps its
  lips as sealed as our own.<BR><BR>I do not know if the slaying of Warlord Bortar will prevent the troll
  uprising.&nbsp; A people can only be
  repressed for so long before they grow strong and vindictive.<BR><BR>I will continue my search for information and continue my actions towards the
  safety of Felwithe.&nbsp; Many others
  have joined in our cause.&nbsp; While
  it is my greatest hope that the council of Felwithe will see to the defense
  of our city, I will not depend on it.&nbsp;
  The mercenaries and adventurers of Felwithe have saved us before, once
  again they are our greatest hope.<BR><BR>Loral Ciriclight</P>  <P>Hand and Eye of Tunare</P>  <P>Seventh day of the Month
  of the Harvest Moon, 3202 PD.</P>
