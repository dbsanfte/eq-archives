		<h1>
			22
			Social Scripting
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest supports a total of 120 configurable "socials" in game. Along with these socials, you have the ability to develop custom emotes and sequences of commands.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			22.1
			Custom Animation Text
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has default text for all existing animations. For instance, when typing /point, or /point with a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the "point" animation and "CharacterName points at [target]" will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. <BR><BR>You can use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need to specify the "target" after the command as "say" followed by your custom text. For instance, typing "/point say points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" will cause your character to execute the "point" animation and display "CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" to those nearby. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			22.2
			Emote Codes
		</h2>
	
	When creating custom socials, you can use a series of "%-codes" that expand into various pieces of information when the social is executed. <BR><BR>The %-codes are: <BR><BR><B>%M</B> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet).<BR><B>%T</B> - Returns the current target.<BR><B>%S</B> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<BR><B>%O</B> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<BR><B>%P</B> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<BR><B>%R</B> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters). <BR><BR>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote: <BR><BR>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <BR><BR>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			22.3
			Pauses in Socials
		</h2>
	
	You may enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <BR><BR>For example, a social consisting of: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/cast 1<BR>/pause 100<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <BR><BR>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line. <BR><BR>For example: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/pause 100,/cast 1<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<BR><BR>
