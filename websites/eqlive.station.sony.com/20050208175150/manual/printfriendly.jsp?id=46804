		<h2>
			16.1
			Dying and Resurrecting
		</h2>
	
	If your character takes
  enough damage, his health bar falls to zero and he dies. The character
  doesn't permanently die - he regenerates near your starting city (at your
  'spawn' or 'respawn' point). <BR><BR>Until a character reaches tenth level, he respawns with all of his items. But
  once reaching tenth level it will be necessary for you to recover your items
  off of your corpse.
