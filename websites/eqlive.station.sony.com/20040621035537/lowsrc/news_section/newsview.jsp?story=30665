	<h2>More On Moving To or From Antonius Bayle Server</h2>
	
	We understand that some folks missed the chance to move to the new server or to cancel the move if they changed their mind.  We also might have missed a few people if something went wrong with their attempt to execute the /movelog command.  We want to help everyone get to the right server.  But we can only offer this service until 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  Here's what you should do if you want to undo your move to Antonius Bayle:<br>
<br>
<b>Canceling your move:</b><br>
We will be allowing people to undo their move to the Antonius Bayle server if you <a href="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com?Subject=Cancel Movelog">send an email us here</a> or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a subject line <I>Cancel Movelog</I> before 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  You must provide your Station name and the name of the server that you moved from (please, don't send us your password).  Also, please clearly state that you would like to cancel your move to the server, and make certain that the subject of your email is <I>Cancel Movelog</I>.<br>
<br>
And here's what you should do if you missed your chance to move:<br>
<br>
<b>Missed the move?</b><br>
We will still move folks to the Antonius Bayle server on an individual basis.  To request a move <a href="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com?Subject=Missed Movelog">send an email to us here</a>, or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a subject line <I>Missed Movelog</I> before 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  You must provide your station name and the name of the server that you want to be moved from (please, don't send us your password).  Also, please clearly state in the email that you would like us to move your characters to the Antonius Bayle server.<br>
<br>
Please take advantage of this.  After we're done moving people based on these requests, folks wanting to move their characters will have to use our character transfer service.<br>
