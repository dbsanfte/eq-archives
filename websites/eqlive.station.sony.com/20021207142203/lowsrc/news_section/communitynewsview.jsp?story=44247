	<h2>Confident in a scheme, Caithen chuckles to himself</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Bristlebane<br>
	05/31/2002<br>
	Silently and fully confident, Caithen de Z'Ress leans against the forest wall of Nektulos, smiling and enjoying himself with the attempts made by the other servers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"They have passion and drive," Caithen stated, "but passion and drive are nothing without will."&nbsp; *chuckles* "Their attempts, while valid, just won't cut it"<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Caithen nodded at his sleeve, then touched his nose with his finger.&nbsp; He then smiled and vanished in a cloud of smoke and fire.&nbsp; Shortly after, an evil laugh was heard along with the words "...jal xor naubol..."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The challenge remains standing, as it seems apparent.&nbsp; It seems as though Bristlebane is up to his old tricks, once again.<br>
