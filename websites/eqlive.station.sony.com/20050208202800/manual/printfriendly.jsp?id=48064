	<EM>/chat set
  &lt;channel-list&gt;</EM> - Makes you a member of all of the channels listed.
  You will be joined to those channels in the order listed (see /join below for
  details on what 'joining' a channel means). This will remove you from all
  previously joined channels. If you just want to join a new channel, use the
  /join command.<BR><BR><EM>/join &lt;channel-list&gt;</EM> - Allows you to join the channel or
  channels listed. If the channel does not yet exist it will create the channel
  and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator
  commands). Note: You may use spaces when creating a channel. But when the
  channel is created those spaces will be removed. So if you &quot;/join fluffy
  bunny&quot; the channel created will be &quot;fluffybunny&quot;. <BR><BR><EM>/leave &lt;channel&gt;</EM> - This will remove you from the channel. Note:
  You must specify a channel, either by name or by number, or the command will
  fail. <BR><BR><EM>/leaveall</EM> - Removes you from all channels. <BR><BR><EM>/list [channel]</EM> - Using this command without the [channel] parameter
  will list all of the channels that you are joined to, the channel number, and
  will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel. The
  channel number is specific to individual users, so two people in the same
  channel may not have the same channel number for that channel. Using the
  command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by
  name. <BR><BR><EM>/announce [on | off]</EM> - Toggles on and off the announcements heard when
  people join or leave channels. This is set OFF by default. <BR><BR><EM>/chat #&lt;channel-name&gt; &lt;message&gt;</EM> - Sends the message to the
  channel named. You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint to use a
  number. <BR><BR><EM>/&lt;1..10&gt; &lt;message&gt;</EM> - Sends the message to the chat channel
  number listed. You can discover the number of the channels you are joined to
  by using /list. If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to
  you first chat channel (whichever is your channel number 1).<BR><BR><EM>/chat help</EM> - Displays a list of chat channel commands.
