			Combat Damage
		</h2>
	
	Whenever your opponent hits
  you with either a weapon or spell, you take damage and your health is depleted.
  Keep an eye on your red health bar - if it falls below 1/3, you may want to
  consider retreating until you're healed. <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If your party includes a spell caster, that character can spend his
  or her time casting healing and boosting spells on the others while they
  fight.</EM> <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A>, for additional details on taking damage.
