		<h1>
			16
			Health, Damage and Dying
		</h1>
	
	

	
		<h2>
			16.1
			Dying and Resurrecting
		</h2>
	
	If your character takes enough damage, his health bar falls to zero and he dies. The character doesn't permanently die - he regenerates near your starting city (at your 'spawn' or 'respawn' point). <BR><BR>Until a character reaches tenth level, he respawns with all of his items. But once reaching tenth level it will be necessary for you to recover your items off of your corpse. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			16.2
			Binding
		</h2>
	
	Normally, your respawn point is near your starting city. Binding (through the casting of a Bind Affinity spell) resets your regeneration point to wherever you're standing. Find a magically inclined player to bind you to a new location when you travel. Otherwise, if you die, you'll resurrect back in your original city, no matter how far away you were when you were killed.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			16.3
			What If Your Character Dies?
		</h2>
	
	If you've worked long and hard, don't worry. Dying won't strip you of your possessions or coins - as long as your body is recoverable (for example, don't drown at the bottom of an aqueduct - it may be a difficult task to find that exact spot and resurface without dying again). <BR><BR>If your character dies he will 'respawn' at his 'bind point', which for new characters is just outside their starting city. Characters under level 10 will respawn with all of their items and can continue their adventures right away. But once a character reaches 10th level he will begin to leave a corpse on the ground at the location of his demise. In order to recover the character's items, you will need to find that corpse. <BR><BR>To reclaim what's rightfully yours, locate your body, right-click on it, and put the items into your inventory (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=pickingup">Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items</A>). <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			16.4
			Giving Permission to Drag Corpses
		</h2>
	
	You can give someone permission to drag your corpse. Type in "/consent [player name]". This is useful if you die while adventuring in a group. One of your party can pick up your corpse and drag it to a safer and/or closer spot in the same zone (corpses cannot be dragged across zone lines).<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			16.5
			Corpses Decay
		</h2>
	
	When you die, your corpse is "locked." No one else can take what's in your inventory. The only trick is that you have a limited amount of time in which to find your body and transfer items to your inventory. <BR><BR>Corpses only remain in the world for a short while. Player corpses have a timer on them, and when that timer expires they will disappear. This is the corpse timer for player characters (please note that all times are in real time, not game time): <BR><BR>If they are under level 10, all corpses decay in 3 minutes. <BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above and have no items on them, they decay in 3 hours.<BR><BR>If they are level 10 or above with items, they decay in 7 days.<BR><BR><I>Note: It is advised that you get your corpse right away. Also note that the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</I><BR><BR>
