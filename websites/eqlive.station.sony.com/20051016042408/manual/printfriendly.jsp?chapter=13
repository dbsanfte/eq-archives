		<h1>
			13
			Using Magic
		</h1>
	
	Those who cast magic are
  initially more vulnerable than other types of characters. Physical abilities
  are sacrificed for mental prowess, but eventually most spell casters become feared
  and revered citizens of Norrath. Building a life as a Wizard, Magician,
  Necromancer, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric or Shaman might be more difficult than
  pursuing other occupations at times, but the rewards can be great...

	
		<h2>
			13.1
			Spell Book and Mana
		</h2>
	
	All spell casters carry a spell
  book. You can open the book at any time by clicking the book icon. Once you
  copy a spell from a scroll (scribe it), it is permanently recorded in your
  book. <BR><BR>You can &quot;memorize&quot; eight scribed spells at any one time by placing
  them in a spell gem slot. Casting the spell then becomes as easy as clicking
  on its gem. <BR><BR>Spell casting consumes mana, a mystical source of magical energy. Like hit
  points, mana regenerates over time. Your current level of mana is shown by
  the blue mana bar. The longer the blue line in the bar, the more mana you
  currently possess. As you gain experience levels, you gain additional mana.
  Resting or meditating restores your mana faster than standing.

	
		<h2>
			13.2
			Acquiring Spells
		</h2>
	
	Some classes (such as a
  Paladin's ability to Lay on Hands) have one or more spell-like abilities that
  are very much like skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or
  meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells,
  however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spellbook and
  memorize it before you can cast it. <BR><BR>You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell
  caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some
  special quests can also yield spells.

	
		<h2>
			13.3
			Spell Types
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has literally hundreds
  of spells that you can acquire and cast at various levels of experience.
  They're far too numerous to list here, but for the most part they can be
  classified into four types: <BR><BR><EM>Offensive</EM>: Spells that are, or add punch to, combat attacks. Examples
  are Shock of Frost, Burst of Flame and Enfeeblement. <BR><BR><EM>Defensive</EM>: Spells that boost armor ratings or give added protection or
  advantage during battle - for instance, Courage, Skin Like Wood and
  Invisibility to Undead. <BR><BR><EM>Healing</EM>: Spells that restore health and stamina, like Minor Healing,
  Cure Disease, Endure Poison and Mend Bones. <BR><BR><EM>Utility</EM>: Spells that are neither offensive nor defensive. For example,
  you can cast Calm, Sense Magic, Summon Food and Bind Affinity. None of these
  spells is harmful or helpful in a combat situation, but they each have a
  specific purpose and provide some benefit.

	
		<h2>
			13.4
			Learning a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Before you can cast a
  scroll-based spell you have to copy it into your book and learn it. <BR><BR>To learn a spell from a scroll: <BR><BR>* Click on the spell book icon (the picture of a book at the bottom of your
  Spells Window).<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory (to view a scroll's information,
  right-click on it).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe the spell.<BR><BR>The timer gauge (at the bottom of the spell book) appears, measuring how long
  it takes to scribe the spell. You only need to do this step once for any
  spell. Once it's recorded, it's permanently in your book. <BR><BR>Now, memorize the spell by adding it to a spell gem slot (you must do this
  before you can cast it):<BR><BR>* Click on the picture of the learned spell in your spell book. A
  rock-colored gem appears on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the octagonal spell gems in your Spells Window to the left
  of your spell book.<BR>* The timer gauge measuring how long it takes to memorize the spell. When you
  have memorized it, the gem turns colored.<BR><BR>You can memorize up to eight spells at any one time. To &quot;forget&quot; a
  spell (remove its gem), right-click on its gem slot. You can then memorize a
  different spell in the free slot (if you can't remember which spell gem goes
  with which spell, hold down the alt key).

	
		<h2>
			13.5
			Spell Gem Colors
		</h2>
	
	Once you memorize a spell,
  the spell gem will be outlined or highlighted by a color. That color
  indicates something about the spell that is memorized in the slot. <BR><BR><EM>Yellow</EM>: You can only cast it on yourself.<BR><EM>Red</EM>: You can cast it on your current target.<BR><EM>Green</EM>: The spell affects anyone close to your target.<BR><EM>Blue</EM>: The spell has no range, and will radiate out from you.<BR><EM>Orange</EM>: The spell only summons items and doesn't affect anyone.<BR><EM>Purple</EM>: You can cast it on everyone in your group.

	
		<h2>
			13.6
			Before You Cast a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Prior to casting, make sure
  you're ready (especially in a combat situation): <BR><BR>* Make sure that you have the spells you plan to use memorized (remember the <STRONG><EM>Alt</EM></STRONG>  key pops up the names of the spells).<BR>* Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost
  it.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key (you never know when you'll need to hit
  something).<BR>* Make sure that you have already cast any pre-battle spells (armor or
  strength-boosting spells) that you might need.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <STRONG><EM>F8</EM></STRONG>  to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><EM>Green text</EM>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><EM>Light Blue text</EM>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><EM>Blue text</EM>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it
  won't be easy.<BR><EM>White text</EM>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you
  could win.<BR><EM>Yellow text</EM>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><EM>Red text</EM>: You'll most likely die.<BR><BR><EM>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more
  help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a
  greater challenge.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			13.7
			Casting a Spell
		</h2>
	
	<EM>To cast a spell:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on a target (spells that only affect the caster do not require a
  target).<BR>* Left-click the icon that represents the memorized spell you wish to cast.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to expire and the spell gem to brighten up, then
  cast again if needed.<BR><BR>When you cast a spell, a time gauge shows up indicating how long it's going
  to take to cast that spell. If someone hits you or you take a step, casting
  may be interrupted. Improving your Channeling skill helps you recover from
  these situations. <BR><BR>All spells are linked directly to certain skills - Abjuration, Alteration,
  Conjuration, Divination or Evocation. The better you are at that skill, the
  better the chance your spell has of succeeding. If your casting fails, you'll
  see a message in the text display indicating that your spell
  &quot;fizzled.&quot; Failed spells still consume mana, but don't produce any
  effects. Even if your casting is successful, your opponent may be able to
  resist that spell. Generally, higher-level characters are better at resisting
  spells cast by lower-level characters. <BR><BR><EM>Note: If someone casts a spell on you, a message appears in your text
  display. In some cases, a spell icon displays in your 'buff' box. Right-click
  and hold on the spell icon to find out the name of the spell.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			13.8
			Developing Magical Skills
		</h2>
	
	Some skills relate directly
  to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination,
  Evocation, Meditate and Specialization (see <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=skillsmagic">Magical Skills</A>,
  for a listing and definition of each skill type). You gain some of these
  skills through experience, while you're born with others.

	
		<h2>
			13.9
			Meditating
		</h2>
	
	You can decrease the amount
  of time it takes you to memorize a spell by Meditating. This helps speed up
  the process of scribing and memorizing spells, but it's a skill-based
  ability. If you press the Meditate button but nothing happens, that means
  that you don't yet have the Meditate skill. If you have the skill, it will
  automatically be used whenever you memorize or scribe a spell. <BR><BR>Meditating for long periods of time helps you regain mana faster, and is more
  effective than meditating for short bursts. <BR><BR>To meditate just click on the picture of your spell book in the Spells
  Window.

	
		<h2>
			13.10
			First Level Spells
		</h2>
	
	If you've chosen a magical occupation,
  you can cast certain spells as a beginner. As you gain experience levels, you
  can learn more advanced spells. <BR><BR>Here are a couple of the spells you can learn at Level 1 for each magical
  occupation. <BR><BR><EM>Cleric</EM>: Minor Healing and Courage.<BR><EM>Druid</EM>: Minor Healing and Skin Like Wood.<BR><EM>Enchanter</EM>: Minor Shielding and Shallow Breath.<BR><EM>Magician</EM>: Minor Shielding and Burst of Flame.<BR><EM>Necromancer</EM>: Minor Shielding and Life Tap.<BR><EM>Shaman</EM>: Minor Healing and Inner Fire.<BR><EM>Wizard</EM>: Minor Shielding and Shock of Frost.
