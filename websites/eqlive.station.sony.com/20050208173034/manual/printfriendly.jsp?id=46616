			12.1
			Acquiring Weapons
		</h2>
	
	Nearly all classes get a
  basic weapon at the start of the game. As you earn money doing whatever you do,
  you can visit merchants to buy bigger, better weapons. However, make sure you
  hang onto your original weapon for a while - even a basic sword isn't cheap,
  and it's nice to have a backup in case you lose a better weapon along the
  way. A bank inventory slot is an excellent place to store unused weapons. <BR><BR><EM>Tip: If you're in a real financial bind but you own a pole and some bait,
  you can sometimes pick up a rusty dagger with your Fishing skill. It's not as
  good as a short sword, but it's more effective than your bare hands.</EM>
