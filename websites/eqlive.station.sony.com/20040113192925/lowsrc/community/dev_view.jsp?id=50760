<h1>Critical hits with spells</h1>
	xole wrote:<P><B>Here is a possible way to implement critical hits on evocation spells:<P>base number = X*(Evoc skill/Spell Level) + (research skill/10) + (specialization Evocation/10).<P>Where spell level is the level of the spell being cast.  X is a modifier based on class. 2 for wizards, 1 for other classes (if crit hits are not wizard only).<P>When a spell is cast get a random number 1-100.  If this number is less than the base number a crit hit occurs.  When a crit hit occurs, there is no chance for resist and the spell does (base - rand number) extra damage.<P>This will max out at about 50% chance if the caster is using their most recently obtained spells.<P>Here are a few comments on the idea:<BR>1.  Max base number is 50.  Therefore max crit hit is 150% of norm and max chance for crit is 50%.<P>2.  Creatures 10 levels higher than caster can not be crit hit.<P>3.  Creatures over the 6 lvl limit, but under the 10 lvl crit limit can only be hit if a spell crits.<P>4.  Agro is counted the same as if spell didn't crit.<P>5.  Research is included to represent that a good researcher would have superiour knowledge of both the mob and the spell.<P>6.  Crit hits would show up in battle text, just like warrior crit hits do.<P>7.  Perhaps, the base should be modified for different zones or continents.  This could be a way to help balance the classes in different continents.  The 50% damage bonus could vary from zone to zone, but I wouldn't make it too high.<P>8.  It should be noticibly better for wizards, if not wizard only.  <P>9.  Resistant chance reduction is a critical aspect of this idea.  <P>10. Items which aid this could be introduced, but be careful.<P>Oh, and yes, I'm a wizard.  I enjoy my class very much.  I also play a variety of alts.</B><P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><P>Thanks for the well written suggestion. Critical hits on spells is something we have discussed in the past. I personally think it's an excellent idea, and that it could be balanced to account for the different power scales over our continents. That being said, we don't have the time to allocate adding this type of functionality right now. Critical spell hits would be a big change requiring a lot of play testing. currently there are no plans to add it, but I won't rule it out as a feature that we may decide to add at some point down the road. <P>Thanks for the feedback, and glad you enjoy the game so much<P>- Lawrence Poe<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We get a few suggestions about this every day.  Thanks for the answer, Lawrence.<P>Alan<BR>
