	Within your EverQuest directory is a file called EQCLIENT.INI. Within this file holds quite a few settings that related to the game and how it looks to you. Below is a brief description of each section and what is contained in those sections. 
<P><STRONG>[Defaults]</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sound=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This tells the game whether you want sound to be on in game or not. This can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>WindowedMode=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This dictates whether the game will run in Windowed mode or full screen mode. In order to run in Windowed mode, your desktop resolution needs to be equal or greater than the resolution you are using in game. While playing, Windowed mode can be toggled by pressing ALT+ENTER.</P>
<P><STRONG>ReadOnce=TRUE/FALSE - </STRONG>This denotes whether the preliminary epilepsy warning comes up when you first start the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>VisitedLuclinOptions=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This denotes whether you've been to Luclin or not. It should have no bearing on game play, and there is no need to modify it.</P>
<P><STRONG>UseLuclinHumanMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHumanFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHumanMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHumanFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinBarbarianMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinBarbarianFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinEruditeMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinEruditeFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinWoodElfMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinWoodElfFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHighElfMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHighElfFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinDarkElfMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinDarkElfFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHalfElfMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHalfElfFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinDwarfMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinDwarfFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinTrollMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinTrollFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinOgreMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinOgreFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHalflingMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinHalflingFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinGnomeMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinGnomeFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinIksarMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinIksarFemale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinElementals=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinVahShirMale=TRUE/FALSE<BR>UseLuclinVahShirFemale=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG><BR><BR>These denote whether you will see the newer, improved models that were released with the Shadows of Luclin expansion. TRUE means that you will see the new model, and FALSE means you will see the original models. These options can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>UseD3DTextureCompression=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This option will save memory at the cost of a very slight reduction of texture quality. This is primarily for people with lower memory configurations. This option can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>MipMapping=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- Mip mapping causes the world to blend together better but uses more memory. When scenery contains acutely angled polygons that disappear into the distance, MIP mapping mixes low- and high-resolution versions of the same texture to reduce the jagged effect</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowDynamicLights=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This setting relates to the lighting in game, such as torches and other light sources, and how they will appear visually to the character. This setting can also be adjusted in game by typing /dynamiclights.</P>
<P><STRONG>LoadSocialAnimations=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This setting denotes whether you will see social animations (such as /wave, /bow, /kneel, etc) in game. This option can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>VideoMode=0,1,2,3,4 (0=640x480, 1=800x600, 2=1024x768, 3=1280x1024, 4=1600x1200)</STRONG>&nbsp;- This setting denotes what resolution you run in game (this does not account for the front end, such as the login and server selection screens). This option can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game, as well as in game under the Display tab of your Options menu.</P>
<P><STRONG>TextureQuality=1,2,3 (1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low)</STRONG>&nbsp;- This selects the quality of the textures in game, and should be adjusted accordingly by your CPU speed, Memory, and Video card. This option can also be toggled in the OPTIONS menu located in the first menu as you enter the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>TextureCache=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This is no longer a feature in game.</P>
<P><STRONG>InspectOthers=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This toggles whether you inspect someone else by right clicking on them or not. This can also be toggled in game by typing /inspect off.</P>
<P><STRONG>Log=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This setting allows you to log all items that go through your chat boxes. This can take up a bit of space over time, so be careful with how much you log, or make sure you archive it elsewhere.</P>
<P><STRONG>AttackOnAssist=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This setting controls whether you automatically attack when you assist someone or not. This is useful for melee types (TRUE) as well as caster types (FALSE).</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowInspectMessage=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This setting toggles whether you see the inspect message in your chat box when someone inspects you. This is especially useful for people that are getting inspect spammed or for raid situations.</P>
<P><STRONG>LockWindows=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This setting toggles whether you are able to move the location of your UI windows in game or not.</P>
<P><STRONG>InvWinLabels=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This setting toggles whether the names of your items will show up when you mouse over them in your inventory</P>
<P><STRONG>ChatFontSize=0,1,2,3,4,5 (from smallest to largest)</STRONG>  This changes how big the characters are in your chat box. The smaller the number, the smaller the letters. This can also be changed in game by typing /chatfontsize 0,1,2,3,4,5).</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowNamesLevel=(off,1,2,3,4) (off=off, 1=first names only, 2=first and last names, 3=first name, last name, and guild name, 4=everything)</STRONG>&nbsp;- This allows you to toggle how much information you wish to see on your screen in regards to characters, from no names to all information. This can also be adjusted in game by typing /shownames off,1,2,3,4.</P>
<P><STRONG>MousePointerSpeedMod=0 (this can be any value from 0 and above)</STRONG> - This command speeds up the movement of the mouse cursor by an amount specified by the speed multiplier. This can also be adjusted in game by typing /mousespeed value.</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowSpellEffects=0/1</STRONG> - This toggles whether spell effects are shown in game, whether by PC or NPC. This can be toggled to allow for higher frame rates on lower end systems. This can also be adjusted in game by typing /showspelleffects off/on.</P>
<P><STRONG>CombatMusic=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This will toggle whether there is combat music playing when you are in battle. This can also be toggled in game by typing /combatmusic off/on.</P>
<P><STRONG>TrackPlayers=TRUE/FALSE/GROUP</STRONG>&nbsp;- This setting determines whether PCs show up on your tracking window or not. You can choose from TRUE (they do), FALSE (they don't), or GROUP (only PCs that are in your group will show up, aside from NPCs). This can also be toggled in game by typing /trackplayers on/off/group in game.</P>
<P><STRONG>TrackSortType= NORMAL/DISTANCE/CONSIDER/RDISTANCE/RCONSIDER (Normal=Default, Distance=Track by distance from closest to farthest, Consider=Track by consider from high to low, RDistance=Track in reverse distance from far to near, RConsider=Track in reverse consider from low to high)</STRONG>&nbsp;- This allows you to customize what you wish to see on your tracking window based on the options listed above. This can also be adjusted in game via /tracksort normal/distance/consider/rdistance/rconsider.</P>
<P><STRONG>TrackFilterType=0 (red/yellow/white/blue/lblue/green)</STRONG>&nbsp;- This adjusts what mobs will show up on your tracking filter based on what they consider to you. This should be adjusted in game via the Tracking window, or via the command /trackfilter red/yellow/white/blue/lblue/green.</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowGrass=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This toggles whether or not you will see grass if you have a Texture and Lighting capable card. You can also toggle this feature by typing /showgrass off/on in game.</P>
<P><STRONG>NetStat=FALSE/TRUE</STRONG>&nbsp;- Toggles the netstat bar that shows incoming and outgoing data, as well as packet size. This can also be toggled in game via the F11 key.</P>
<P><STRONG>DoProperTinting=FALSE/TRUE</STRONG> - This toggles proper tinting for items in game. When items on characters don't appear to look proper, such as color, then this will resolve that. This can also be toggled by typing /dopropertinting on/off in game.</P>
<P><STRONG>UISkin=Default</STRONG>&nbsp;- This is for if you happen to have a custom UI Skin. This is where the game reads what UI skin to open when you enter the game. We suggest you use the skin loader in game, that can be found under the Options menu, rather than editing this line.</P>
<P><STRONG>AllLuclinPcModelsOff=FALSE/TRUE</STRONG> - This is an easy way to make sure all Luclin PC models do not show (the new models).</P>
<P><STRONG>LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=FALSE/TRUE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This will load Velious armor if you have Luclin installed, but is not recommended if you have your Luclin models enabled (armor may look very strange, misplaced, and miscolored).</P>
<P><STRONG>ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG>&nbsp;- This toggles whether or not the Alarm UI window will pop up each time you enter the game. If you do not use this, then setting it to FALSE would stop it from popping up.</P>
<P><STRONG>ChannelAutoJoin=serverwide.crucible</STRONG>&nbsp;- This line denotes what channels you will autojoin upon entering the world. These can be adjusted in game by typing /autojoin channelname:password (if any).</P>
<P><STRONG>HardwareTnL=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This will force Hardware Texture and Lighting either on or off.&nbsp; This is a line you would manually input into your eqclient.ini, and only for troubleshooting purposes.</P>
<P><STRONG>VertexShaders=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This will force Vertex shaders on/off for your card.&nbsp; This should not be used in TRUE if your card does not support these features, as adverse reactions in game may occur.&nbsp; This is a line you would manually input into your eqclient.ini, and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes.</P>
<P><STRONG>PixelShaders20=TRUE/FALSE -</STRONG> This allows you to toggle whether the game renders PS2.0 (if your card supports it).&nbsp; This is a manually inputted line, and should only be used for debugging purposes.&nbsp; This should not be set to TRUE if your card does not support it, as adverse reactions may result in game.</P>
<P><STRONG>VSync=0/1 -</STRONG>&nbsp;This either tells EverQuest to wait for the vertical syncing of the monitor before updating the display or no.&nbsp; This can prevent visual tearing (if set to 1).&nbsp; Recommended default is 1.&nbsp; This line is something that would need to be manually inputted into the eqclient.ini, as the game does not provide it by default.</P>
<P><STRONG>AccurateLighting=TRUE/FALSE</STRONG> - This tells EQ to use an alternate rendering path when rendering models (if set to FALSE)&nbsp;(PCs and NPCs) that does less accurate lighting but runs much faster on older CPUs like the Pentium 2. We try to detect the CPU at startup and default this setting, but you can force it with this line. Also, you can set this to TRUE to make it use the accurate lighting code if you wish.</P>
<P><STRONG>[VideoMode]</STRONG></P>
<P>This area is best left untouched, as changes made here can prevent you from getting into game. If you wish to change your resolution or refresh rate, you should do it under the Display Tab in the Options menu within the game.</P>
<P><STRONG>[HitsMode]</STRONG></P>
<P>This is also best modified in game, as all customizations are point and click in the UI for all hitsmode items. Right clicking on a chat window in game will get you started.</P>
<P><STRONG>[TextColors]</STRONG></P>
<P>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in numeric form. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode.</P>
