<h1>Most Memorable EQ Experience</h1>
	<P>We decided to see what a couple of the EQ team members remember as their most memorable experience in EQ.&nbsp; Here is what they had to say...</P>
<P><IMG hspace=5 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/Longdale.jpg" align=left border=0><STRONG>Holly Longdale (Game Designer)</STRONG> </P>
<P>I remember leaving Nektulos Forest for the first time as a level 8 wizard.&nbsp; We zoned into Lavastorm Mountains and rounded the curve where you could see the lava, crags, drakes, and dervishes.&nbsp; I remember being so scared that my hands were shaking.&nbsp; I told the friend I was playing with that there was no way we should be in there; that we would most certainly get incinerated or chewed by something&nbsp;- probably one of the red dragons.&nbsp; I was in complete awe.&nbsp; We stuck it out in Lavastorm and managed to kill a fire drake.&nbsp; It was one of my proudest moments in the game&nbsp;- that and finishing the Ice Comet spell quest much later.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P><IMG hspace=5 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/Michaels.jpg" align=left border=0><STRONG>Terry Michaels (Senior Programmer)</STRONG></P>
<P>I, a half elf bard, was with a group hunting the Live Tower area in Lower Guk, when a very unhelpful gnome decided to train half dozen frogs to us, then gate out just as they got there.&nbsp; Since we were in the middle of a fight when this happened, the additional frogs made it almost guaranteed that we were all going to die.&nbsp; When the cleric and shaman yelled that they could heal no more, I decided to give those with the ability to gate a chance to get out without dying, so I quickly activated my Angstlich's Appalling Screech, in the hopes that I could drive enough away that everyone would have the opportunity to gate out.&nbsp; Luckily I was able to fear all the frogs, and they quickly ran away.&nbsp; Knowing they would be back, and probably with friends, I told everyone to gate.&nbsp; To my surprise they all decided to stay.&nbsp; The rogue began to bandage me, while the shaman and cleric sat down to regenerate their healing power quicker.&nbsp; When the frogs returned, with friends, as expected, they again were affected by my song and turned to run away again.&nbsp; Our ranger quickly snared one, and the tanks proceeded to kill it as it ran away slowly.&nbsp; We continued this process until all of the frogs had died.&nbsp; Afterwards, we counted the corpses of the frogs and determined that we had survived against 14 frogs overall.&nbsp; Talk about an unexpected win against incredible odds. </P>
<P>Thanks for sharing Holly and Terry.&nbsp; Now a discussion topic for those of you reading: What is your most memorable experience in EQ?&nbsp; Find a group of friends and discuss.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks all</P>
<P>Brenlo the Memorable</P>
