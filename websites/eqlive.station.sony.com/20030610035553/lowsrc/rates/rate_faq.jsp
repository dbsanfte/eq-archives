<h1>Rates</h1>


<DIV align=center><STRONG><BR>EverQuest's Price Increase FAQ</STRONG> </DIV>
<P><B>What are the new EverQuest subscription rates?</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>$12.95 per Month 
<LI>$35.85 for 3 Months 
<LI>$65.70 for 6 Months 
<LI>$119.95 for 12 Months (a 23% discount off the monthly rate). 
<LI>$199.95 for 24 Months (a 35% discount off the monthly rate). 
<P></P></LI></UL>
<P><B>When will the subscription rate change?</B><BR>The new subscription rate will take effect April 25, 2002. </P>
<P><B>Why was the subscription rate increased?</B><BR>Because costs increase. We have not raised our rates in three years; over those three years, though, salaries have gone up, rent has gone up, and (needless to say) power costs have exploded. </P>
<P>We hope you will put this in perspective. A month of EverQuest even at $12.95 -- remains a great value. It is less expensive than a first run movie and popcorn, an amusement park ticket and, frankly, most other forms of entertainment that we can think of. </P>
<P><B>What do I have to do now that the subscription rates have changed?</B><BR>You don't have to do a thing. When your current subscription plan expires, you will automatically be migrated to the new subscription structure based on your current subscription plan. The only thing that will change is the rate.</P>
<P><B>Can you explain what "recurring" charges are?</B><BR>All pricing plans&nbsp;are now&nbsp;recurring, meaning you have been and will continue to be billed at the appropriate subscription rate interval, until you cancel your subscription. </P>
<P><B>Ok, how does all this really work? </B><BR>The current subscription rates are in effect for all signups and/or renewals that occur prior to April 25, 2002; the new subscription rates are in effect for all signups and/or renewals that occur on and after April 25, 2002. Some examples: </P>
<P>1. My current 3 month recurring subscription happens to expire/renew on April 20th.</P>
<P>If you do nothing, it will renew at the current rate and your rate will not be increased until the subscription renews again (on July 20). If on April 19th you extend your subscription by 24 months, then your "3 month recurring subscription" rate will not be increased until April 20th, 2004 (because you just extended your subscription by 24 months). If on April 21st you extend your subscription by 24 months, then your "3 month recurring subscription rate" will not be increased until July 20, 2004 (because it renewed on April 20, and then you extended it another 24 months). </P>
<P>2. My current 3 month recurring subscription happens to expire/renew on April 26th.</P>
<P>If you do nothing, it will renew on April 26th at the new rates. If, by April 24th, you extend your subscription by 24 months, then your "3 month recurring subscription" rate will not be increased until April 26th, 2004 (because you just extended your subscription by 24 months). </P>
<P>3. I have a monthly recurring subscription.</P>
<P>If you do nothing, the first renewal that occurs on and after April 25th, 2002 will be at the new monthly rate. </P>
<P>If, by April 24th, you extend your subscription by 24 months, then your monthly rate will not be increased until the applicable billing anniversary date in 2004 (because you just extended your subscription by 24 months). </P>
<P><B>Does this affect the Legends service? </B><BR>No. </P>
<P><B>Will I still receive my free month of service if I purchase and register a New Game? </B><BR>Purchasers of the full version of EverQuest will receive their free month of game play after supplying valid billing information. If you cancel your subscription during the free month, no charges will be made to your credit card. </P>
<P><B>Will I be charged sales tax on your subscription rates?</B><BR>Currently only New York and Texas residents will be charged sales tax. </P>
<P><B>How will my charge appear on my credit card statement?</B><BR>All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under the heading "SOE*EverQuest". </P>
<P><B>Is there a website with more information about the EverQuest pricing changes?</B><BR>For more information, please visit <A href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/rates/">www.everquest.com/rates</A><BR></P>
