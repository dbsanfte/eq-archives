<h1>Interface and Bazaar information update</h1>
	<BR>There are some new(ish) things to report about the interface, bazaar and other odd things.  Some of this you may already know, but some of it you may not.  Im just going to give you a list of stuff.<P>---<P>We recently changed the way the UI looks for its files.  If you load a skin that is missing pieces it will find and use those missing pieces in your default folder.  What this means is that if you forget to copy a file into the folder for your new skin, the game will use the default file.  It also means that if we update the interface and add new files, your existing skins should continue to work, since the UI will look for those files in the default directory.<P>---<P>/loadskin used without any parameters will give you a usage statement.  But now it also gives you a list of all of the folder names it finds in your UI directory.  Thats basically a list of your available skins.<P>---<P>Were adding three new labels:<P>Current Alternate Advancement points available to spend = 71<BR>Current experience percentage assigned to Alternate Advancement = 72<BR>Character Last Name = 73<P>---<P>The issue that was causing folks to target and inspect people, open doors and all sorts of other things when using the mouse to move has been fixed.<P>---<P>Ive had several emails asking for the ability to search for hand-to-hand weapons in the Bazaar.  That ability already exists.  Use martial on the dropdown list to find them.<P>---<P>Yes, were aware of the issue with tracking.  Items leaving the list (like NPCs dying) causes the list to resort and the focus to jump to the top, making it very hard to use.  This is fixed on Test.<P>---<P>/camp is ignoring optional parameters (like Desktop).  We know about this, but its not a real priority item.  Well get it when we can.<P><BR>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>"Were adding three new labels:<P>Current Alternate Advancement points available to spend = 71<BR>Current experience percentage assigned to Alternate Advancement = 72<BR>Character Last Name = 73"<P>You didn't mention when we're going to see this, or if it's on Test. We need to know when so we can start making UI modifications.</B><P>It should be on Test now.  If not... soon.  So you <I>should</I> see it on Live with the next patch.<P>Alan<P>
