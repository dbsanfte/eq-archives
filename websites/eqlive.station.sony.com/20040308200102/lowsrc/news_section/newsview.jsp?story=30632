	<h2>UK Server Now Open For Testing</h2>
	
	The EverQuest Live Team has introduced a new server which will be physically located in the United Kingdom.  This server is in its testing phase, so please read the following details:<blockquote>The new server is called Antonious Bayle (Beta UK) and is located in the United Kingdom.  Because this is our first server to open up over seas, we want to test it out before we open it as a Live server.</blockquote><blockquote>The focus of testing for this server is the network connection, so we need to have a lot of people testing it out.  Therefore we are opening up this Test server on our Live patcher.  This means that you will be able to play on the new server as if it were a regular Live server; log in as you normally do and it will appear on the server list.  But this is still a Test server.  This means that all of the Test server rules apply to Antonious Bayle.  We will be wiping characters when we take the server Live (which we hope to do in a few weeks).  Let's repeat that for emphasis:</blockquote><blockquote><b>We will be wiping characters when we take the server Live (which we hope to do in a few weeks)</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Keeping that in mind, we want to encourage you to log into the server and play for a while.  We really want to see how it holds up under a full server load, and for that we need players logged in and playing.  So please give it a try.</blockquote><blockquote>We're excited about this new server and the possibilities that it represents.</blockquote><blockquote>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote>
