<h1>Some Necromancer Questions</h1>
	<B>Insidious Retrogression - our 49th lvl DD/Snare/Debuff appears to be allowing mobs to attempt a resist each tic.</B><P>That's how snare components work.  Nothing new about the way this spell works.  Multi-effect spells do tend to break earlier.<P><B>Chill/Ignite Bones - the illusion effect of these two spells are blocking the Dragon/Gaint Bane line of the Wizard class.</B><P>That makes sense, considering that they change bodies when you use those spells.  Giant and Dragon bane spells won't work on creatures that are not Giants or Dragons at the time.  Not much to do about that except get the other spells, which you mention below.<P><B>Incinerate Bones - is our 44th lvl non illusion verison of Ignite Bones.  This spell drops off a named mob deep in Chardok, a 50th+ lvl zone.  Is it me or does a 44th lvl spell dropping in a 50th+ lvl zone seem wrong?<P>Conglaciation of Bone - is our 55th lvl non illusion verison of Chill Bones.  This spell drops off the Royals and some Dragons in NToV, all of which are 60th+ lvl.  Why is a 55th lvl spell dropping off mobs 5+ lvls above the spell?</B><P>These are reward spells, variants of old spells created for those that want the variety.  Making them harder to get is part of the plan.  And soon enough these spells will saturate the higher levels and become available for purchase by those unable or unwilling to gain them personally.<P><B>Boht of those spells where meant to deal with the raiding problems of Ignite/Chill Bones but they where implemented in a terrible way to keep them out of our hands.</B><P>Actually, they were meant to be special variant spells that a character could earn.  The fact that they are considered 'better' spells should also explain why they are harder to earn.<P><B>Quivering Veil of Xarn - please remove the illusion effect of this spell, then it would stack with our lich line and not conflict with illusion effects we might have up.  It is not much of an emergency spell if I have to check to see if anything is going to block it.  Until the illusion is removed it will never be as usefull as our 20th lvl Harm Shield.</B><P>Illusion spells cannot be overwritten, which is why Veil of Xarn will not overwrite Lich form spells.  While I understand the desire to make it simple to use this spell, in the long run it's those that can use their spells the best that make the best casters.<P><B>Defoliation - Why is it that the Shroom mobs in the lower levels of Old Sebilis and The Deep are considered Plants but the ones in Fungus Grove and pretty much every other zone are not? Can we please finally have this spell work upon plant mobs.</B><P>I'll mention this to the team.<P><B>Horses - it appears that their are several stacking issues with horses.  We can no use any of our Lich line spells that have an illusion effect nor can we cast Ignite/Chill Bones while upon a horse. </B><P>You can only change into one of the given PC forms on a horse.  You can't turn into a spectre or any other undead on a horse.  This is due to the way horses work.  You'll just have to get off the horse to cast those spells.<P><B>Shissar Deathspeaker Staff - This staff come from Veeshan's Peak and has the right click effect of Soul Well.  Soul Well is an HP drain over time but unlike our other HP drain over time spells it does not stack with any Lich line spell nor Envenomed Bolt.</B><P>That is probably as intended, but I'll mention it to the team.<P><B>Pet Life Tap procs - have been broken for months now and really needs to be fixed.  When you consider how few HPs our expansion pets have these are often needed to keep our pets alive during fights.</B><P>Looking into this one again right now.<P><B>Please have someone look into these problems.<P>Bril</B><P>Alan<BR>

<B>Absor said "That's how snare components work. Nothing new about the way this spell works. Multi-effect spells do tend to break earlier."<P>Just a correction, that's not how snare components work.  Snare spells have a set duration, they don't have a resist check each tick like root lines.  The druid and wizard snare lines both work this way, as does the necro darkness line and druid and necro epics.  <P>The only one that checks each tick is Tangling Weeds, and that is to balance the near instant cast.  (Of course it's worthless now with the 7 second recast due to how often it is resisted, but that is another subject).<P>Elindel<BR>60 Ranger<BR>Bristlebane</B><P>Sorry about the confusion.  Here's how it works.<P>Multi-component spells (even Snare spells) check to see if they break at regular intervals.  Most spells with a Snare component have been specially coded to bypass that check.  Some have noted that, for example, the Necromancer epic weapon effect worked the same way until it was given special coding to change that.<P>Whether or not Insidious Retrogression should be changed, I don't know.  I've certainly passed your concerns to the team.<P><BR><B>Chill/Ignite Bones - the illusion effect of these two spells are blocking the Dragon/Gaint Bane line of the Wizard class.<P>That makes sense, considering that they change bodies when you use those spells. Giant and Dragon bane spells won't work on creatures that are not Giants or Dragons at the time. Not much to do about that except get the other spells, which you mention below.<P>*********<P>Since the mobs are now in skeletal form, why dont our undead nukes work?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> <P>If they are dragons why not use the undead dragon model. That way both skills work (not that IB is ever allowed while riading)   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> <P>Also mayny times when IB is cast the skeleton is teribly small and jumps around making it hard for people to target. Would there be anyway to make the skeleton scale to the size of the mob.<P>Just a few more IB issues. <P>Thanks,<BR>-Betagen lvl 60 necro <BR> Nightbane  Karana</B><P>I'm trying to figure that one out myself.  Right now I can only guess.  I'll try to have a more solid answer for you later (later would be after Fan Faire).  But I can see why it would be a bad idea to allow Necromancers to turn any creature into an undead, an undead that would be affected by all of the Necromancer specialty undead spells.<P>As for turning the target into an undead dragon, there are two reasons not to.  First, that undead dragon model isn't available globally.  Secondly, and more importantly, you won't only be targeting dragons with those spells.  So having the spell always turn the target into an undead dragon wouldn't work.  And having it change the target based on body type and all of that... maybe it could be done, at the expense of a lot of resources.  And anything that this spell could turn something into would have to be made available globally.  We've talked about this a few times and there are no reasonable solutions that work to make the spell work the way you want it to.<P>Alan<BR>
