	<h2>&lt;Sanctus Solum&gt; of Saryrn!</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Saryrn<br>
	7/25/2005 3:36 pm<br>
	Hail and well met!&nbsp;
  Does your social calendar consist of &#8220;EQ 5pst-10pst&#8221; 7
  nights a week?? Is your chair &#8220;form fitting&#8221; even though it
  wasn&#8217;t intended to be?? When someone says &#8220;what do you do in your
  spare time?&#8221; do you just reply with &#8220;ummm&#8221;??<BR><BR>We&#8217;re Sanctus Solum, a brand new Anguish level guild with a whole new
  philosophy.&nbsp; We feel that raiding
  7 nights a week is pass&eacute;.&nbsp;
  We can kill the same Anguish/Tacvi/DoN/MPG trial targets in 3 nights
  time.&nbsp; All we ask for is your
  undivided attention for 12 hours a week:&nbsp;
  Mon, Tue, Th, 6pm &#8211; 10pm PST.&nbsp; As a Sanctus Solum member, you
  won&#8217;t need to turn on the TV or surf the web during our raids, we move
  quickly and efficiently, keeping our members well occupied.&nbsp; You may wonder what we do the other 4
  nights a week.&nbsp; Some of us go out
  and worship the glowing orange orb in the sky, but we still have a few enthusiasts
  who enjoy off night raiding.&nbsp;
  That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve developed a dkp system for both off night
  raids and our 3 night a week mandatory raids.&nbsp; You get the best of both worlds,
  regardless of how much time you can spend in game.<BR><BR>Yes, we&#8217;re recruiting.&nbsp; But
  we&#8217;re not just looking for anyone.&nbsp;
  We want folks that love our raid times as much as we do, who&#8217;ve
  had their fair share of grueling raid schedules, but above all we want
  talent!&nbsp; If you&#8217;re level 70
  with several hundred aa and your struggling to find a balance between EQ and
  the real world.&nbsp; Send
  saryrn.Swabby, Gordas, Freja, Exdio, or Aonodorus a tell to find out more.
