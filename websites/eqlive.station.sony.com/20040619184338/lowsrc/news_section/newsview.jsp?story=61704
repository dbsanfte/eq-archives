	<h2>Shadowrest Now Live</h2>
	
	<IMG hspace=5 src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/news_images/summoner.jpg" align=left vspace=5 border=0><EM>Terror washed across Srethix's face as he stepped through the portal into the council's chambers atop the Great Library of Myrist.&nbsp; </EM>
<P><EM>"The deal has been sealed," he said. "The Keeper has agreed to grant us access to the Shadowrest." </EM>
<P><EM>"We have access to all that he brings there?" asked Eino, who was standing nearby, reading a long, lost tome. &nbsp; </EM>
<P><EM>"No, he only granted us access to a small corner of his realm.&nbsp; He will allow us to recover the soulless flesh that he finds and brings there, but nothing else," Srethix responded. &nbsp; </EM>
<P><EM>Fimli gasped, "He took the full price for so little. That wasn't even a quarter of what we were asking." &nbsp; </EM>
<P><EM>Srethix glared at Fimli with terror behind his eyes. "We should be thankful that we walked away with so much." &nbsp; </EM>
<P><EM>Maelin held up his hand, silencing Fimli from further questions. </EM>
<P><EM>"Yes. The price was high, but the prize was worth the cost," Maelin said. "This issue is closed, there will be no further discussion.&nbsp; Our emissaries will be sent out -- all that ask will be granted access to Shadowrest."</EM> 
<P>We have introduced the new graveyard zone, Shadowrest, to the live servers.&nbsp; The zone will allow adventurers whose corpses have decayed, after 7 days, to retrieve it.&nbsp; They will merely have to greet the appropriate NPC in one of the following zones to activate their transport to Shadowrest;</P>
<P>East Commonlands<BR>The Plane of Knowledge<BR>Toxxulia Forest<BR>Qeynos Hills<BR>The Feerrott<BR>Butcherblock Mountains<BR>The Field of Bone<BR>Shadeweavers Thicket<BR>Misty Thicket</P>
<P>If you do not have an expired corpse, you will not be able to travel to Shadowrest.&nbsp; If you have multiple expired corpses, you will need to make multiple visits to the zone.&nbsp; We hope you enjoy this new addition to EverQuest!</P>
