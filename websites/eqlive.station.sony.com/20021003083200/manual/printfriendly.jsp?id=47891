			Appendix D - Archetype Abilities
		</h2>
	
	The Archetype abilities are available only characters level 55 and above that have spent six skill points on General Abilities. There are three Archetypes&nbsp;- Caster, Melee and Priest. <BR><BR>Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards can choose abilities from the Caster Archetype.<BR>Monks, Rogues and Warriors can choose abilities from the Melee Archetype.<BR>Clerics, Druids and Shaman can choose abilities from the Priest Archetype. <BR><BR>Hybrids can choose their abilities from the Archetypes of both of their parent classes (with a few abilities excepted). <BR><BR>Paladins, Rangers and Beastlords receive both Priest and Melee Archetypes.<BR>Bards and Shadowknights receive both Melee and Caster Archetypes. <BR><BR><I>Important Note: Some Archetype abilities are restricted and can only be acquired by certain classes. For example, Spell Casting Mastery improves the use of specialization skills. Hybrids don't get specialization, therefore they can not gain the Archetype Ability to enhance specialization. Other restrictions will be listed in the skill description.</I><BR><BR>
