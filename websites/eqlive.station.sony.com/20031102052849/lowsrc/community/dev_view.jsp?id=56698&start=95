<h1>Trouble with the Prexus server - 6-10-03</h1>
	<BR>Last night at about 1:00 in the morning Prexus had a severe breakdown. Our Operations team has been working to get it restored and back into service. Our hope is that we'll have it back up and running some time this evening. <BR><BR>That's the bad news. The worse news is that we will have to recreate all of the characters on the server from backups that are perhaps more than 24 hours old. Anything those characters have earned in the last day or so will be lost. Unfortunately, we will not be able to restore items or experience lost to the roll back. <BR><BR>There is some potential good news, though. If you have deleted a character in the last year or so, that character may return. So if you see a character that you deleted a few months ago on your character select screen, that's why. <BR><BR><B>Important Note:</B> The restoration of these characters may leave you with more than eight characters on Prexus. In cases like this, the character select screen will list your characters in alphabetical order, and only show you the first eight of those characters. This may make some of your characters appear to be missing. <I>They are not missing.</I> All you need to do is delete one or more of the visible characters in order to see the ones that are not shown. <BR><BR>We are extremely sorry that this has happened. We are doing everything we can to restore the server. <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
