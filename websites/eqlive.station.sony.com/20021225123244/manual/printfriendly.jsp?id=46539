	You've only got eight general inventory slots, several of which are nearly always occupied by food and drink. Some items can be stacked on top of one another in a single slot, such as fish, bread and arrows. Other items take up an entire slot. All add weight to your character. If you don't want to continually sacrifice one item for another, try purchasing a container or finding a bank. <BR><BR><B>Containers</B> <BR><BR>Purchase backpacks, bags and other containers to increase your carrying capacity. By placing items inside a container, you can fit multiple possessions into a single slot. To open a container, right-click on it. <BR><BR>Certain containers also serve as catalysts for creating items - for instance, you need a bowl to make bread, and a sewing kit to stitch things together. <BR><BR><B>Banks</B> <BR><BR>Banks will gladly store coins for you, and they're also a great way to store inventory items. Banks in Norrath are well connected - even if you travel abroad, any banker can instantly conjure up your items. You've got eight bank inventory slots at your disposal. If you go to another bank, you don't get additional slots. <BR><BR><I>To put an item in the bank:</I> <BR><BR>* Find a bank and right-click on the banker. Eight bank inventory slots appear for you to use.<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory (it "floats" on your cursor).<BR>* Click on a bank inventory slot. <BR><BR>To withdraw an item from a bank, reverse the steps above. <BR><BR><I>Note: Bank inventory slots work the same way as your character's general inventory slots. This means that you can use containers in the bank to increase your storage capacity.</I> <BR><BR>
