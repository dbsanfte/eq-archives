		<h2>
			22.3
			Pauses in Socials
		</h2>
	
	You may enter pauses in
  social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to
  600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of
  seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <BR><BR>For example, a social consisting of: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/cast 1<BR>/pause 100<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds
  after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <BR><BR>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another
  social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command
  is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line. <BR><BR>For example: <BR><BR>/sit off<BR>/pause 100,/cast 1<BR>/sit on <BR><BR>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that
  the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and
  MUST be specified first on the line.
