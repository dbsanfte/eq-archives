			Opening and Closing Windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	All windows in the interface can be closed, with the exception of the Window Selector which is always open. <BR><BR>There are several ways to close windows. Most windows can be toggled on and off by clicking the corresponding button on the Window Selector. Any window that is not represented on the Window Selector can be closed by clicking the X on the right side of the title bar. Also, most windows can be closed using the right-click menus, which we'll explain later. <BR><BR>The <B><I>Escape</I></B> key will also close most windows (will close the window that is active). <BR><BR>A few windows, such as the Target Window, can only be turned on and off using keystrokes. Here is a list of the keystrokes for all windows. <BR><BR><B>ALT - B</B>: Buff/Spell Effects Window<BR><B>ALT - P</B>: Party (Group) Window<BR><B>ALT - S</B>: Spells Window<BR><B>ALT - H</B>: Hotbox Window<BR><B>ALT - T</B>: Target Window<BR><B>ALT - Y</B>: Self-Status Window<BR><B>ALT - M</B>: Menu (Actions) Window <BR><BR>
