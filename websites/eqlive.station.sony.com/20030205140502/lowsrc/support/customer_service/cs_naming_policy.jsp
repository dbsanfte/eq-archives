<STRONG>
<DIV align=center><BR>Character Naming Policy</DIV>
<DIV align=center></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<P>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and surname.</P>
<P>The following types of names are inappropriate:.</P>
<OL></B>
<LI>Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words. </LI>
<LI>Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, Tug Mcgroin).<B> </LI></B>
<LI>Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon). </LI>
<LI>Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts (e.g. , Marlboro, Sony, Band-Aid). </LI>
<LI>Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan). </LI>
<LI>Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Sloegin, Anyone). <U>This includes references to drug substances or drug related paraphernalia.</U> (e.g. Ecstacy, Cannibis)</LI>
<LI>Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn). </LI>
<LI>Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of or used to impersonate a Customer or representative of Sony Online Entertainment. </LI>
<LI>Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). </LI>
<LI>Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt, Tanis). </LI>
<LI>Names where the combination of the first and last name violate a previous rule. </LI></OL>
<P>For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or words are also unacceptable.</P>
<P>If a name is found to be in violation of any of the above polices, a member of the Customer Service Team will then use the following process:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For category 1 or 2 offenses, a member of the Customer Service Team will change the name of the character as soon as it is discovered. You may be notified of this name change either in-game or by email. Depending on the nature of the offensive name, the account may also be subject to disciplinary action including suspension or banning. A GM will contact you to inform you if disciplinary action is taken. </LI>
<LI>For categories 3 through 11, the member of the Customer Service Team will contact you either in game or via email to notify you of the character's name change. After your name is changed, any corpses currently in the world will no longer be accessible. Please inform a Customer Service Team member if you have a current corpse prior to the name change.</LI></UL><B>
<P>Conditions for Name Changes:</P></B>
<P>First names are generally not changed unless they violate the Naming Policy.&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>Surname Policy:</P>
<UL></B>
<LI>Surnames may not contain spaces </LI>
<LI>Surnames may contain double capitals provided that the capital letters do not violate any of the prior policies. </LI>
<LI>Surnames may contain an accent ( ` ) provided that the division created does not violate any of the prior policies. This accent is the only non-alpha character that is allowed in surnames. </LI>
<LI>Any number of Customers may have the same surname. Customers wishing to use a surname that's rejected by the name filter need only request in-game assistance using the /petition command.</LI></UL><B>
<P>Conditions for Surname Changes:</P></B>
<P>Customer Service will change a Character's last name at his or her request, provided that the Character is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and surname do not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the Customer receiving a new surname or the removal of the surname altogether. </P>
