	* The following is found on a note of
  tanned vellum written in black ink in small economic handwriting *<BR><BR>High Priest Yeolarn Bronzeleaf of Tunare,<BR><BR>War is upon us.&nbsp; Six months ago we
  lost the port   of Firiona Vie to the
  forces of Lanys T'Vyl.&nbsp; Two weeks
  ago, our own city of Felwithe  came under attack by Tier'Dal terror troops.&nbsp; I watched our shop owners bleed to
  death on the cobblestone streets of my home.<BR><BR>Never more than now has Felwithe faced imminent danger.&nbsp; It is all around us.&nbsp; Rifts tear open between worlds.&nbsp; Holes break open to the lost lairs of
  beasts from the old ages.&nbsp; Yet for
  centuries the council of Felwithe chose to remain passive.<BR><BR>It is clear that we must move on our own.&nbsp; I begin to gather information and I
  begin to plant the seeds within those who will act on Felwithe's behalf.&nbsp; I have sent my spies to the far
  reaches of Norrath in search of information.&nbsp; They already begin to return with dark
  and sinister plots.&nbsp; It is these
  plots that I will report to you over the following weeks.<BR><BR>Last week one of my troll spies traveled to Neriak and listened to the trolls
  who reside there after the fall of Grobb.&nbsp; The trolls speak of battle.&nbsp; They speak of murder.&nbsp; It is clear that they no longer
  consider Neriak their home, if they ever did.&nbsp; They speak of a lord, one Bortar, who
  may lead them in battle against Gukta.<BR><BR>A rift opens between the Tier'Dal and the trolls.&nbsp; We can exploit this rift and perhaps
  aggravate a conflict between our two enemies.&nbsp; I will seek to learn more and if an
  opportunity reveals itself, I will act upon it.<BR><BR>Many of my agents travel through the city of New Tanaan, the new hub of travel for the
  adventurers of Norrath.&nbsp; One of my
  agents discovered a human named Veslin Savok who sought adventurers to
  recover a chest for him from a dragon named Ithiasor the Black in the Swamp of No Hope.<BR><BR>I spoke to this Veslin, an untrustworthy fellow if I ever saw one, and I
  accepted his task.&nbsp; I do not know
  if he is an agent of Rasp's Wayfarers or perhaps of the Ebon Hand.&nbsp; After a failed attempt to learn more
  of this black horrid beast, I enlisted the power of Vinceremo.&nbsp; This powerful band of mercenaries and
  hunters traveled to the Swamp and faced the great wyrm, Ithiasor.&nbsp; The battle did not go well.<BR><BR>I have yet to learn more from this source but I fear the great wyrm will
  return unscathed to whatever dark hole it crawled from.<BR><BR>Lord Yeolarn, I will continue to send these reports to keep you
  informed.&nbsp; It is my hope that you
  will succeed in stirring the council of Felwithe into action.&nbsp; I saw your actions on the bridges of
  Felwithe.&nbsp; I saw you wield your
  staff like the warrior elves of Takish Hiz.&nbsp; I know fire burns in you as it burns
  in me.<BR><BR>Should you be unable to stir the unmoving rock of Felwithe's council, I will
  do what I can to enlist the aid of the hunters, adventurers, and mercenaries
  of Norrath.&nbsp; They do not fight for
  the protection of Felwithe or for the word of Tunare, but with the right
  motivation they can serve our purposes.<BR><BR>May the Mother watch on us all,<BR><BR>Loral Ciriclight<BR>High Priest of Tunare<BR>Hand and Eye of the Church   of Felwithe<BR>Nineteenth Day of the Month of the Amber Leaf,
  3201 PD
