			29.8
			Appendix D - Melee Archetype Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<B>Melee Archetype Abilities</B> <BR><BR>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Monks, Rogues and Warriors, as well as Bards, Beastlords, Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive. <BR><BR><BR><I>Combat Agility</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character an increased chance to avoid being hit in combat (damage avoidance). The first skill level increases the character's ability to avoid being hit by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage avoidance increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><I>Combat Fury</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's chance for a critical hit (or grants a percentage where none exists). With all three skill levels, non-warriors will approach the basic ability to critical that warriors have. But a warrior with three levels of this skill will retain his a significantly greater chance to critical than any other class. <BR><BR><I>Combat Stability</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character an increased ability to reduce the damage he takes in combat (damage mitigation). The first skill level increases the character's damage mitigation by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage mitigation increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><I>Fear Resistance</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's resistance to fear affects. The first skill level increases the character's resistance to fear by 5%, the second skill level raises the character's added resistance to 10% and the third raises the increase to 25%. This ability also increases the character's chance to break out of fear once it has taken hold. <BR><BR><I>Finishing Blow</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character a chance to kill an opponent with a single blow. The opponent must be fleeing and must have less than 10% of their hit points remaining. The first skill level grants a 1% chance for a finishing blow, the second skill level raises the chance for a killing blow to 2% and the third raises the chance to 5%. Note: classes without a natural chance to critical - which is all classes but warriors - will need to gain at least one skill level of Combat Fury for this ability to work. <BR><BR><I>Improved Natural Durability</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the character's natural hit points (hit point total without any buffs or magic items). The first skill level increases the character's hit points by 2%, the second skill level raises the hit point increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><I>Natural Healing</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to heal. Each skill level increases the character's base regeneration by one point every six seconds. This healing is in addition to the increase gained from Improved Natural Regeneration and any natural bonuses to regeneration due to race. <BR><BR>
