			Acquiring, Selling and Buying Items
		</h2>
	
	The most common method of acquiring
  items is to defeat monsters in battle and take their stuff. It is important
  to note that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage you and/or your
  group did to that NPC was greater than anyone else or their group. It is
  considered good etiquette not to interfere in a combat unless asked (or you
  ask if the person needs aid and they say yes). <BR><BR><STRONG>To loot the corpse of an NPC (monster) or player you've killed:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It &quot;floats&quot; on your
  cursor.<BR>* Click on a free slot in your inventory.<BR><BR><STRONG>or you can use the shortcut method:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Right-click on an item in that inventory and the game will 'auto-equip' it
  by trying to place it in the most appropriate spot in your inventory (if
  there is room).<BR><BR><STRONG>To buy/sell an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (Note: you will have to be relatively close
  to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only receive
  the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the merchant
  window).<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click Trade to give them the item (the person receiving
  your gift will also have to click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>. <BR><BR><STRONG>If you accidentally drop an item, you can pick it up:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or
  as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot.
