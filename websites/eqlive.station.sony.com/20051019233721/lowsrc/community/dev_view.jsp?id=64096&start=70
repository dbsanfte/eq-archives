  up?</EM> Are you kidding?!&nbsp;

  be Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits.&nbsp;
  &quot;School's Out&quot; is the perfect Friday afternoon song.&nbsp; Of course, I don't tell anyone that's
  what's playing.&nbsp; I let 'em think
  it's Green Day or Coldplay or something.&nbsp;
  If they only knew what was goin' on in my headphones.&nbsp; </P>  <P><EM>What class in high school do you think was totally

  be tempted to say Math.&nbsp; But I did
  some of my best drawings in those classes!</P>  <P><EM>What is the most horrible gift you ever received?</EM>  Can't say that I ever received a horrible gift.&nbsp; I do remember getting the
  &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot; book many years ago.&nbsp; Still not sure where that one came
  from.&nbsp; Maybe it had something to
  do with the torrid crush I had on Marsha... When I was 10!</P>  <P><EM>Have you ever cried to get out of trouble?</EM>  Have I ever cried to get out of trouble?!&nbsp; I do it all the time!&nbsp; Swing by my office one of these days
  during crunch.</P>  <P><EM>If you had to eat one thing for the rest of your life what
  would it be?</EM> Picking just one thing to eat the
