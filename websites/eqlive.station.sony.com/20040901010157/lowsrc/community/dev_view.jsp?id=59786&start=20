<h1>Cheaters and the recent up swell of concern (12-8-03)</h1>
	<P>Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.&nbsp; Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.</P>
<P>First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.&nbsp; The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.&nbsp; I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.&nbsp; That information has been very helpful.</P>
<P>With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.&nbsp; Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.&nbsp; I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.&nbsp; Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.&nbsp; The few that remain will be fixed shortly.&nbsp; We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.</P>
<P>At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.&nbsp; We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.&nbsp; It's never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was possible.&nbsp; We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.</P>
<P>Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.&nbsp; The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).&nbsp; We need your help to locate these issues.&nbsp; The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.&nbsp; If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug.&nbsp; Please don't assume we have heard the information already.&nbsp; We'd rather have ten reports about something like this than none.</P>
<P>I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.&nbsp; There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the "inside".</P>
<P>We take such possibilities very seriously.&nbsp; And we have investigated this very thoroughly.&nbsp; We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.&nbsp; We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.&nbsp; Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.&nbsp; I can't describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.&nbsp; This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.&nbsp; Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.</P>
<P>Thank you for playing EverQuest.&nbsp; And thank you for you help making the game fun.</P>
<P>Have a great holiday season.</P>
<P><BR>Alan</P>
