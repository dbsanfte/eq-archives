<h1>NPC Slow Mitigation</h1>
	Generally speaking we don't announce new NPC functionality, tricks, spell effects or other things that we think are part of the discovery of a new expansion or zone. However, this functionality isn't working properly right now and in doing so it is causing a bit of confusion. <BR><BR>With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause slows to be less than 100% effective. This is not a "slow cap", when it is working properly. The best slow will have the best effect. <BR><BR>This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not have to decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full effect or just turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged, and making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option when tuning an encounter. There are some encounters where we would like to see slowing considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to the point where the NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed. <BR><BR>In theory this is a great thing. <BR><BR>However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in emails and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem. <BR><BR>We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed. <BR><BR>Alan <BR><BR>
