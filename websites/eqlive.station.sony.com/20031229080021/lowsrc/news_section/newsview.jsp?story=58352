	<h2>Live Chat Follow Up</h2>
	
	<P><EM>These are some of the questions that we just didn't have time to answer during the Lost Dungeons of Norrath chat on Friday, September 5th, 2003.&nbsp; We wanted to thank everyone that showed up, the turnout was great.&nbsp; We appreciate the time you all took to be there.&nbsp; Thank you, and we hope you enjoy the Lost Dungeons!</EM></P>
<P><BR><U>Dubyah</U> what event that will change the face of norrath does ldon fortell?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord </STRONG>As much as I'd like to spill the beans, I can't answer that question at this time.&nbsp; Keep an eye on Morden and company, and look for changes and small pieces of story to pop up in the coming months.</P>
<P><U>Kodylan</U> One of the things I've noticed over the weeks leading up to the release are the "storyline" updates that speak of calliav and hinting to him learning of zebukoruk's knowledge that I'm sure most have heard about now with the recent completion of the plane of time by several guilds - is there any plan to delve into the tie-in more throughout the expansion?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord </STRONG>We've been working hard to make sure that all of the expansions work with the live game to create one contiguous storyline.&nbsp; As you play through LDoN, gather any information you may find and see how it relates to what you've learned in past expansions and what you see developing in the Live game.&nbsp; In the past couple of years, we've watched as mortals have basically declared war on the gods.&nbsp; This has implications beyond anything we've seen to date.</P>
<P>The question of, "What do you have to fear, once you've killed the gods and conquered Time?", has come up more than a few times now.&nbsp; While we can't answer at this time, we can barely wait to show you.&nbsp; We've got some really exciting plans for the next couple of years.</P>
<P><U>PierceWeaver</U> I am a 56k dial-up user (at home that is) with absolutely no ability to get a faster connection in the near future.&nbsp; During the day, I have access to high-speed networks and was wondering, will LDoN and it's subsequent major patches be made available via an FTP site so dial-up users can download during the day, burn on CD and take home for the night?</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> You can do that now, assuming you have a CD burner on your machine at work.&nbsp; Just install the game and patch it up.&nbsp; Then copy the files you need to CD.</P>
<P><U>Rhoas</U> How will people without LDON interact with LDON modified items (ie will they be able to see the augmentations at all)</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG>&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Everyone will be able to inspect the details of Augmented items, via improvements to the item inspection window that everyone receives.</P>
<P><U>Vardie</U> so bards can open boxes in dungeons... will their Pick Locks skill limit be raised or will 100 be enough for all of it ? </P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> The Picklock, sense trap, and disarm trap skill progressions has been revamped.&nbsp; The required level has been significantly lowered for Bards and Rogues to allow them to access to the abilities they'll need in order to interact with these objects.&nbsp; The skill progression will also be more gradual for bards to allow them to advance their skill at a steady rate and maintain an advantage for rogues at all levels.</P>
<P><U>BadHandle</U>&nbsp; The minimum group size is four.&nbsp; What happens if you fall below that minimum due to LD or sudden camping of a party member?<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>PCarrico</STRONG> The adventure will remain active and give the fourth person a chance to log back in as long as the adventure timer has not expired.</P>
<P><U>Marionette</U> if only one group can enter an instanced dungeon then how can guides or GMs enter them to help people in trouble?</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> They have their ways...&nbsp; GMs and Guides will have methods for entering these zones so that they can help out where needed.</P>
<P><U>TunareSK</U>&nbsp; Is an instanced zone truly private? IE: You cannot see /ooc or /shout from any group other then your own?<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>OSmith</STRONG> Instanced zones are truly private. No other groups/raids will be allowed in your adventure while you're playing. The only people that'll be allowed into the instanced zone are people in your group or raid. This will allow you, and your group, to focus on the task at hand and not have to worry about factoring in other groups into the equation.</P>
<P><U>warwon</U>&nbsp; will there be future addons onto LDON for free like new dungeon layouts?</P>
<P><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> We hope to have the live team create new zones using the LDON system.&nbsp; I'm not sure how often that will be or how frequently, but it does seem like an excellent area to add future content for all subscribers.</P>
<P><U>Tils&nbsp;</U> Regarding the augmentations. If you have an item with a Focus Effect and get an augmentation which has a focus effect will this add to your existing item or not? Also will there be augmentations with multiple stats or are they just single?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy </STRONG>The resulting item will have both focus effects on it.&nbsp; Spells still use only the highest focus you have, however.&nbsp; If you add a +25% damage focus to an item that has a +20% damage focus, the +20% one will never get used.&nbsp; There are augmentations with multiple stats.</P>
<P><U>Oneiros</U>&nbsp; What will happen if you are the 11,001 group? Will you have to keep trying, like trader mode, or will it queue up?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG> You would have to keep trying.&nbsp; However, it's our goal to ensure that this limit is never reached.&nbsp; The entire adventure system is designed around the idea of us needing to be able to add or remove capacity from the dynamic zone pool, as determined by people's interest in adventures.</P>
<P><U>xandelwyn</U>&nbsp; If opening day all 11,000 instances end up full at prime time, how long will it take to up that?&nbsp; Are we looking at an hour?&nbsp; a day?&nbsp; a week?<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG>&nbsp; It depends largely on how far the target gets overshot.&nbsp; The systems design for LDoN is extremely flexible.&nbsp; If we have spare capacity on additional machines, we can easily offload even more adventure zones onto that hardware.&nbsp; If we overshoot it by 100 zones?&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 zones?&nbsp; Still probably not a problem.&nbsp; That can be fixed in minutes.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>1,000 zones?&nbsp; Probably still not too much of a problem, but on the order of "hours."&nbsp; After all, if those people are trying to play in Adventure zones, the hardware housing the traditional zones they're not using can likely be added to the pool to compensate.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If everyone who's ever played EQ all logged in at once and tried to play an adventure?&nbsp; Now that would be a different matter entirely. At that point we're talking about days as new hardware can be put into place. :)</P>
<P><U>Velorik</U> I just wanted to say you guys rock. Keep up the good work.&nbsp; Will the spell: Spirit of Shrew be able to be brewed into a potion?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> Definitely a possibility.&nbsp; Keep an eye out for it.</P>
<P><U>Dubyah</U> will characters of ALL XP levels be able to assemble warp charms? anuy new modes of transport available?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>O<STRONG>Smith</STRONG> You'll be able to travel from adventure camp to adventure camp in a quick and easy manner. You'll need to speak to one of the adventure NPCs in order to learn more about this. </P>
<P><U>Xzarkon</U> so every member of a group gets so many adventure points per adventure? A solid amount split between the group?</P>
<P><STRONG>slord</STRONG> Each member gets points for their participation in the group.&nbsp; It's not one number divided between the members of the group.</P>
<P><U>Loken</U> Will you have a limit on the number of&nbsp; LDoN raids that you can do in one day?<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>rwaters</STRONG> Each raid has a set recycle period so that a player can't do the same raid again until that time has passed.&nbsp; If you want to do three different raids in the same day though, that's fine.</P>
<P><U>waldina</U>&nbsp; Are adventure points meant to be collected until you have hundreds before you can spend them or are there some relatively cheap items (less than 10 points)?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy </STRONG>You will be able to purchase minor upgrades and limited-charge items for fewer points, but the better upgrades will require you to save up.</P>
<P><U>Caldiien</U>&nbsp; With the different types of traps/locks in LDoN, caster classes have been given spells to find and disable all of the different types of traps.&nbsp; Will rogue sense/disable traps be able to find all of the types of traps and remove them, or only certain types?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> The basic objects in the adventure zones are broken down into 3 different types, Mechanical, Magical, and Hexed.&nbsp; Each of these types will require the appropriate spell/ability to open.&nbsp; Normal spells won't function on objects, you'll only be able to use specific spells to sense/disarm/unlock them.&nbsp; Bards and rogues have an advantage in that the majority of traps on the objects will be mechanical, while a smaller percentage will be reserved for the magical and hexed objects.&nbsp; In most situations a group should have at least one player that has the ability to interact with all of the objects you'll find in the adventures.</P>
<P><U>Etrigan</U> Will we be able to use the map feature with the LDoN dungeon instances?</P>
<P><STRONG>hartsman</STRONG>&nbsp; At the moment, we don't have any plans of disabling mapping in LDoN dungeons.&nbsp; However, LDoN will not come with pre-mapped dungeons by default.<BR><U><BR>waldina</U>&nbsp; Will there be a way to trade or share adventuring points?</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering</STRONG> Each character will have to earn their own points by working with the Wayfarers.&nbsp; You can't just sell off your good standing to someone else...&nbsp; :) </P>
<P><U>Balderk</U> so will there be droppable augmentations?</P>
<P><STRONG>jtroy </STRONG>There may be in the future, but not in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&nbsp; We want augmenations to carry a sense of personal accomplishment for now.&nbsp; We'd also like to fix some issues with the economy before adding more complications to it.</P>
<P><U>Frater</U> there are going to be 3 types are you giving spells/abilities to ID the type of trap?</P>
<P><STRONG>RBarker</STRONG> There won't any abilities that will specifically tell you which type of trap/lock that's on the object.&nbsp; But inspecting the object will provide clues as to which type will be appropriate.</P>
<P><U>waldina</U>&nbsp; LDoN is very exciting, when is the release date?</P>
<P><STRONG>avancouvering </STRONG>Thanks!&nbsp; LDoN launches on September 9th, 2003.</P>
