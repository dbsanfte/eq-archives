							<P>Five years and still going strong...and getting even
  better! On March 16, 1999 the first generation of massively multiplayer
  online games burst onto the scene. The launch of EverQuest, a rich and
  dynamic fantasy world capturing the imaginations of thousands of people
  throughout the world, raised the bar of game design and content to
  unparalleled heights and set a new and challenging standard for the computer
  gaming industry. </P>  <P>To help celebrate EverQuest's 5th year anniversary, we remember the past,
  visit the present and take peak at the future in this three-part series of
  mini Q&amp;A's by speaking with key individuals whose influence and guidance
  continue to see the world of Norrath grow.</P>  <P><STRONG>The Past - A Strong Foundation</STRONG> </P>  <P>For EverQuest to have grown and become what it is today, a strong and

    / Artist<BR><BR>Current Position at SOE: Lead Designer on
    Triple-Top-Secret-Project</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on the original EQ
  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>I was the co-creator and lead designer of EverQuest. This work consisted
  mostly of training and managing the other designers and working closely with
  management, coders, and artists to make sure the game came together. I also
  built zones, painted textures, and populated areas.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>It has been just plain wild. We got started on ROK (Ruins of Kunark) almost
  immediately after we launched EQ. Our beta had gone very well and lots of
  people were playing and having fun. ROK development was a blast. EverQuest
  just kept getting more and more popular. Once SOV (The Scars of Velious) was
  underway, I actually moved off of EQ to concentrate on the plan for EQII. Of
  course, throughout that time we saw the EverQuest community take off in
  hundreds of different directions, and I had many opportunities, through the
  Fan Faires, to meet face to face with thousands of cool folks who play EQ.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>Getting everyone to believe it was possible. We were biting off quite a lot:
  tons of handcrafted content, cutting edge 3D technology, cooperative play.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>Early on in testing. While testing with one of our programmers, we had an
  encounter with an angry bear in Surefall Glade. It didn't go so well. I
  literally ran over to his office and we spent the next half-hour talking
  about it. That is what the game is about for me. Giving people experiences
  that they remember and want to talk about.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>EQ was my first professional game gig. I had always been into pen and paper
  gaming, computers, and art. I had made several games on my own just for fun.
  But, it was the relationship I formed with a talented group of guys off a
  college bulletin board and the game demo the group of us made that got us
  noticed by John Smedley, who had this crazy idea for a 3D graphical MUD.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>Nope. We thought we would be lucky to get a fraction of the people playing
  our name brand competitor. I remember meetings shortly after launch, with
  people predicting a drop-off after the first few months. It never happened. I
  knew that we had made something special, but I had no idea how many other
  people would feel the same.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>It has evolved in response to the needs of the game and our players, as
  online games must. So, I think it captures its original idea perfectly; an
  online 3D graphical MUD focused on group play and interesting handcrafted
  content. The strength of online gaming is that the design is liquid. It needs
  to be. Evolve or die.</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>I do. But I am a perennial lowbie. I play very casually with friends who do
  not typically play video games, but who I used to paper-game with. So for me,
  it has never been a race or competition, but a vehicle to spend some time
  with old friends.</P>  <P>We've heard that much of EQ sprang from your
  own pen-and-paper fantasy gameworld. Is this true? If so, how much of the
  initial world was based on your own creation?<BR>Many aspects of Norrath did come from the various pen-and-paper games I ran
  as a teenager. This is mostly seen in the names of characters and locations
  as well as the diversity of the environment. I had lots and lots of notes
  from my various campaigns, and when I would need a name or situation, I would
  use them as reference. It really helped that Tony Garcia used to be a player
  in those games so he and I were able to have a common vision for the type of
  place Norrath was going to be.</P>  <P>EQ quickly became a world built by many
  different imaginative people. How difficult was it for you and the team to
  pull together and synthesize all the ideas into a world with a consistent
  story and background?<BR>It depends on how you look at it. From the beginning Norrath was designed to
  be a setting where any type of story you might want to tell could take place.
  Norrath is light and dark. Funny and serious. We try not to&nbsp;hit any one
  note too often. I think that initial decision has made all that has come
  after that much easier to integrate. I am also always pushing for us to tell
  alternate versions of events from differing points of view. A certain amount
  of conflict and inconsistency is actually good and gives the community
  something to discuss and debate. We have been very fortunate to have had so
  many talented people, both players and designers, contributing to the lore of
  Norrath over the years.</P>  <P>How did the faction system develop? What made
  you take this route for NPC interaction as opposed to a more simplified
  alignment kind of approach?<BR>The faction system came from our desire to make Norrath a richer place with
  many different groups, each with their own agenda. We wanted the players to
  be able to make friends and enemies based on their actions. Roger Uzun and I
  had a shared vision for what was possible with a system like this and lobbied
  hard to get it into the game.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>A wheelchair-bound EverQuest player came up to me at a Fan Faire and thanked
  me for creating a place where she could run like everyone else.</P>

    Director, EverQuest II&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on the original EQ
  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>In the beginning I was put temporarily on EQ to work on the product demo. We
  made a room with some hallways. Bill did the geometry and I made the
  textures. We worked really hard on this P90 that was just painfully slow. I
  remember sitting there waiting for the machine to catch up as Bill tried to
  work. After we made it, we ran around killing each other for a few weeks,
  having a great time. It was so silly; there wasn't really even&nbsp;anywhere
  to go, and there was nothing to do but kill each other. I thought it was
  really fun, and I thought the project sounded amazingly cool. I'd wanted to
  do an online game for a long time. So one day I asked Smed if I could work on
  it full time and he said OK. I became a lead artist, and, later, the art
  director.</P>  <P>Nowadays I am the &quot;Lighting Director&quot; on EQII. It's really a fun
  job. My whole purpose is to make stuff look cool with light, shadow and
  color. It's easy to make zones look good with light when they are so well
  done in the first place; it's like putting decorations on a delicious cake.
  There is a huge sense of accomplishment there. And this team is made up of the
  most talented, crazy people, it's fun just hanging out with them. It's also
  an incredibly rich environment for learning and growth.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>Well, I have an interesting history with SOE. Like most adventurous spirits
  in our industry, I wanted to do a startup. It seemed like a natural
  progression: Step 1) Lead EQ,&nbsp;Step 2) Direct EQ, Step 3) Own a company,
  Step 4) Retire with millions and rule the world! So, a couple of years ago I
  chucked it all to do a startup company with the EQ II&nbsp;lead programmer.
  It was all a very dramatic whirlwind, but, as startups tend to do, it
  eventually failed- landing me back in my seat at SOE. It all gave me a new
  perspective on the true beauty of a steady paycheck!</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>I'd never been a manager and I really wanted to do a good job, but being a
  good manager is maybe the hardest thing you can do, second only to being a
  good parent. Oh, speaking of that I also had TWO babies during my stint as
  art director, and one more after. So I was grumpy and fat and the bathroom
  was really far away from my office...I had my first baby a month before EQ
  shipped, so he just turned 5 too!</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>From the moment I first heard a description of it.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>It was bigger and took heck of a lot longer. I worked harder on it than I
  ever worked on anything in my life.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>NO. I was blown away. They are working on the 8th expansion! It's amazing.</P>  <P>What challenges did you face as the lead artist
  on EQ?<BR>I had never been a manager, and had to get up my nerve and dive into telling
  this group of guys what to do. I was just flying by the seat of my pants.
  But, I knew two things for sure: I knew exactly what I wanted, and I knew
  without a doubt that if we worked hard enough it was going to be awesome. We
  had to hire mostly temporary workers as level designers since we didn't have
  a huge budget. Fortunately we got some really talented, fun people that way!
  People I have really enjoyed working with all these years. Rick Johnson, of
  course, was the master craftsman that started as a temp. Not that he ever
  complained.</P>  <P>Did you help guide the overall look and feel of
  EQ?<BR>EQ art had a particular quality that I was always striving for. Since look
  and feel is purely visual, it's next to impossible to explain it with words.
  That's why a team needs an art director in the first place, to look at the
  art constantly and say, &quot;that's got too much contrast,&quot;
  &quot;that's too blue,&quot; etc., etc., until individual artists get the
  feel themselves.</P>  <P>Typical RPGs at the time relied heavily on the use of grey and brown
  colors, so I banned that from the start. I find those colors to be dreary and
  dry. I believe artists can always find better colors - purple rock, red wood,
  etc. -&nbsp;that work better and give the world flavor. I wanted the overall
  color and contrast to appeal to people in a way that made the EQ world a
  fully immersive sensual experience.</P>  <P>For the characters, my philosophy is that in boring old real life we have
  to accept looking average and&nbsp;being average, but the whole point of
  fantasy is to be MORE of whatever you secretly wish you were. So, I wanted
  the middle-sized characters to have maximum sex appeal. The small and large
  characters were meant to be charming and have character. I was especially
  keen on their eyes, which I think are the visual focus of human interaction.
  I wanted them to look as expressive and alive as possible. They were always
  large and defined with a highlight. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to have a
  team of supremely talented people that could take these crazy notions and
  pull it all off.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>SHIPPING, definitely shipping! It's like having a baby, only the labor pain
  lasts like 2 years. I think we were extra nutty since we were under major
  stress. Once in a while people cracked, and would almost come to blows over
  things like who ate the last piece of jalapeno pizza. Actually coming to
  blows would have been too much exertion. I had this enormous office for some
  reason in what we called &quot;the pit&quot; since it was in the back without
  windows. The team would hang out in there at dinner and draw on the giant
  whiteboard. Maybe I have selective memory, but I still laugh when I think
  back on those crazy days. I feel lucky to have worked with those crazy nuts.</P>

  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>I was a lead programmer on the original EQ. I wrote the zone server, world
  server and parts of the client program. I am currently a designer working on EverQuest
  II, specifically in the game mechanics area.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>I am constantly amazed at how innovative the players are at interacting with
  the world and one another. They brought out aspects of the game that remain
  unique to EverQuest and have added immensely to what's in the game today.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>Creating gameplay that was both fun and challenging to our players. We were
  able to learn from them, and incorporate changes in game mechanics and tools
  to provide an immersive experience that is capable of evolving on a weekly,
  or sometimes daily, basis.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>For me it was about a year after its release, looking at the numbers and
  realizing the phenomenon was growing, rather than staying the same or
  shrinking. Then seeing EverQuest mentioned in various television shows, the
  TV Guide covers and even feature films.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>EQ is significantly different in that it's a living system. You must
  constantly evolve content and gameplay while keeping the challenge fresh and
  alive in players' minds. Other games are essentially released as is, there
  may be bug fixes and minor content additions, but it's not a 24/7 thing the
  way EQ is.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>No, I thought it would be very popular among a core following, but I had no
  idea the numbers would be so high, or so consistent over the years.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>It's much the same in spirit and gameplay, but it's evolved through player
  feedback to a finer edge. The creative input of the live team means that it's
  a more refined and better game now than it's ever been.</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>Yes I still play- not as regularly as I once did, but I still have a level 65
  character I adventure with from time to time, as well as several in their mid
  30s.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>As far as in-game goes, I'm goal oriented. Which means I like large raids
  probably more than any other single aspect of the game. I also enjoy earning
  levels and AAs in between raids.</P>

  have such a huge fan base&nbsp;five years later...what can you say about
  that? It's awesome and a dream come true.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>From an art standpoint, our biggest challenges were always the balance of
  manpower and time, and the technical limitations with current PCs. There was
  no limit to the imaginations of our designers, and we always did our best to
  bring their ideas to life in EQ.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>Way before the first public beta... the first time our team jumped into a
  little demo zone we had created. It was before we even had quests or NPCs in
  the game. Within minutes it turned from friendly chatting and trading to
  chasing each other around, trying to loot the cool item that someone had. We
  realized that if we could have this much fun with the game at this simplistic
  level, we had to be on to something great.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>Scale. EQ was MASSIVE. The project was huge and the game environment was even
  larger.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>Nope. We all hoped it would be a big success, and it turned out to be bigger
  than we imagined.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>I think EQ has grown in so many ways over the years, but has also been able
  to stay the same in some very important ways too. The expansions, updates and
  upgraded graphics have all helped continue to improve the EQ experience. But
  the most important part of the game has remained intact, and that's the EQ
  community.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>So many good times, both in-game and in the game's development. Off the top
  of my head, this is a good one... While questing in Befallen with some
  friends, I fell through a pit trap/false floor and immediately got pounded by
  some unfriendly undead. It's funny because I built the zone, and I fell right
  into my own pit trap. Maybe it worked a little too well.</P>  <P>What aspects of art development in EQ did you
  work on most? Do you have a favorite piece you did in EQ?<BR>In the original EQ, I created zones, textures and a few quests, items and
  NPCs. I created Highpass Hold, Freeport, Befallen and the city of Erudin. In
  Highpass, I made those poor Mucktails that always charge the keep... they're
  so much fun. Freeport was the biggest zone that I had made, which was
  actually 3 zones in one. I love how Freeport is this wild mix of cultures,
  with paladins on the north side of town and the rogues in southside slums,
  and how did that floating mage's temple wind up in the center of all that
  chaos? Of course, my favorite thing I did for EQ was the dreaded cat room!</P>

    Unannounced Project</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on the original EQ
  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>I was a programmer on the original team - graphics, 3D. I was lead programmer
  on EQOA.&nbsp;Now I&nbsp;am lead programmer on an unannounced project.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>The company has experienced a lot of growth. So, to me, it is weird seeing a
  development team like EverQuest II, which is several times larger than the
  entire company used to be.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>I think the biggest challenge was the fact that we were going into largely
  uncharted waters. A lot of long work days were required to overcome the
  mistakes we were making every day.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>While debugging a problem during Beta, I caught myself following people
  around the world and watching them interact with the game world. I quickly
  became caught up in watching other people play the game, and seeing the drama
  of their virtual lives unfold. It was then that I realized how social the
  game was going to be.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>The design walked a fine line between a game and a social experiment. So, it
  was often difficult to leverage one's previous game development experience
  and apply it to the product. It was not always obvious to me what influence a
  piece of technology would have on a player's overall enjoyment of the title.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>I could not have imagined the game's success in my wildest dreams.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>Today, the game has so many features, so much landmass and so many areas to
  explore that it is nearly incomprehensible in its sheer immensity.</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>No, I had to force myself to stop playing EverQuest at a certain point. I
  found myself playing EverQuest and only EverQuest, and that is not a good
  thing for a game developer to do. I had to force myself to stop playing the
  game and take a look at the achievements of other teams, so that I could stay
  in touch with what was going on in the rest of the industry.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>&quot;Fippy&quot; is a classic. Watching someone encounter one of the Darkpaws
  for the first time was a defining moment. It is their first clue that this
  game is very different from any other game that they have every played. It is
  just funny to watch a new player at that moment, see the puzzlement and
  imagine what emotions they are going through.</P>

  to life?<BR>Getting the design, art and technology together at the same moment in time to
  get everything to work and export with what we had at our disposal.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>EQ was my first professional project.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>I think today it may be more geared towards the mainstream gaming market, and
  back then it was designed more for the hardcore gamer.</P>

  team. What are you doing now?<BR>I was brought onto the EverQuest team as an assistant producer, approximately
  one year before we released. After EQ launched, I proceeded to co-produce the
  first expansion, Ruins of Kunark, and then moved onto the EverQuest II
  project where I reside today as a producer.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>The EverQuest team and Sony Online Entertainment&nbsp;have gained
  considerable ground over the past five years. At the point when EQ launched,
  the team consisted of approximately 25 people, which made up almost half of
  Verant's overall staff of about 60. Everything was very
  &quot;grassroots,&quot; such that if you wanted something done, you would
  often have to do it yourself. We had no dedicated Marketing, Operations, HR
  or Shipping and Receiving departments - you gain a newfound respect for the
  postal service after manually packaging and sending thousands of beta discs.<BR><BR>Today, as a dedicated developer/publisher of online games,&nbsp;we employ a
  Marketing/PR department that is second to none in the game industry, a round
  the clock operations staff, and every other amenity that we could only dream
  of during our early days. What this does is allow the development teams to stick
  to doing what they do best: making great games.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>At the time, online games of this caliber were in their infancy. The team
  consisted of an incredibly talented group of people that were passionate
  about making a game that WE wanted to play. Many of us played endless hours
  of UO, Meridian 59 and Subspace. So we were able to see, at least on the
  surface, what did and did not work in the MMO game space. What we did not see
  was&nbsp;what was below the surface, and that was by far the greatest
  challenge. Issues that single-player games need not worry about such as
  packet encryption, game servers that could handle thousands of simultaneous
  users, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), etc., left us sleepless for many
  months throughout development and on into launch.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>The point which I felt players were going to really like EQ was about midway
  through beta. Our simultaneous usage numbers were higher than those of retail
  MMO games, and I was beginning to get direct phone calls from people pleading
  for beta accounts&nbsp;- which I would always provide. However, I reached a
  point where I would have to stop answering the phone in order to get work done.</P>  <P>What was it like managing the first beta phases
  of EverQuest, given the number of players you needed to accomplish stress
  tests, for example?<BR>Our initial thinking during beta was to throw many testers at the game, so
  that we could yield as much play-test feedback as possible. While this worked
  for stress testing, we quickly realized that smaller scale group testing was
  much better for tuning the game mechanics or specific content. Team members
  would often login as a silent third party to watch how a recent change to a
  combat mechanic or the population in a dungeon would pan out.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>I had spent a little over a year in our Quality Assurance department
  (otherwise known as &quot;the trenches&quot; by those of us who live through
  it) as a lead on numerous PlayStation and PC games, single and multiplayer.
  So initially, when I moved into game development, I felt like I had a good
  idea about what it takes to develop a game. That honeymoon ended before I
  even moved over to the development studio. I quickly gained a newfound
  respect for the processes that a game goes through before it even makes its
  way outside of the core team.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>I often say to people that if they were to tell me I would be here five years
  after EverQuest's launch, working on the sequel to the most successful MMO to
  come out of North America, I would have told them that they were insane. Even
  while we worked&nbsp;fourteen-plus hours a day,&nbsp;six-to-seven days a
  week, for months on end, I don't think anyone honestly believed that EQ would
  have blossomed into what it is today.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>While at its core EverQuest is very similar to what it was five years ago, I
  like to think that we built a &quot;functional&quot; foundation for the
  current EQ Live team, which over the past five years has transformed it into
  the true masterpiece that it is today. EQ would not be in its current state
  if it were not for the talent, passion and desire for constant innovation by
  the EQ Live team.</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>Yes, from time to time, usually when new functionality has been implemented,
  or during expansion beta testing. However, it has been difficult over the
  past few months as we get closer to the EverQuest II beta.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>So many to name, so little time. Falling through the base of the tree in BB,
  swan-diving into lakes of lava in Lavastorm because my ISP hiccupped, being
  resurrected by a courageous little dwarf cleric by the name of &quot;Healimus
  Pimptastic&quot; while I was showing the game off to some relatives... the
  list goes on and on. What I have found to be great about MMOGs is that,
  unlike single-player games where there is a linear course of progression, in
  massively multiplayer games the players often dictate the outcome of a
  situation. There is always a surprise around every corner and you never know
  who or what you will run into, no matter how well you think you know an area.</P>  <P>You were an assistant producer on EQ, and are
  now a producer on EQ II. How would you contrast the scope of each of these
  games?<BR>Polar opposites. While the original EverQuest team consisted of 24 members,
  the EQ2 team has 73 of the most talented and creative people in the game
  industry today. By comparison, it is simply mind-blowing how much code, art
  and game content is created each and every day. In addition, we as a company
  now have&nbsp;five-plus years of experience running one of&nbsp;the largest and&nbsp;most
  successful online gaming services in the world... a knowledge-base we did not
  have in 1999.</P>  <P>How did the launch of EverQuest proceed? What
  did you learn from it that made future game launches of this type easier?<BR>For the first&nbsp;six hours, fantastic! I was getting phone calls from
  friends of mine throughout the US telling me about standing in line for an
  hour to buy a copy of EQ. Subscriptions were rising at the rate of over a
  thousand an hour, and we were genuinely stunned- many actually thought that there
  had to be an error with the billing system. Then, sometime in the late
  afternoon, the honeymoon abruptly ended. The thousands of simultaneous users
  that were logged into the servers suddenly disappeared. We had maxed out our
  primary ISP's bandwidth in and out of San Diego, resulting in the immediate
  loss of connection by every EQ player and anyone in the San Diego area that
  used the ISP. In the following weeks, we fought tooth and nail with scores of
  issues that - in many cases - were beyond our control. Through this
  experience, in addition to the&nbsp;five years that have elapsed since
  launch, we have gained a considerable amount of information that we draw from
  on the release of each and every Sony Online Entertainment&nbsp;title.</P>

  creation, quest creation and NPC movement.</P>  <P>What is it like working on a game that never
  ends?<BR>Before I worked on EverQuest I built&nbsp;console games. Before the game
  shipped, the project's priorities were to make sure we had a solid game that
  would work.</P>  <P>Massively Multiplayer games are an interesting breed. Each world is meant
  to hold thousands of players simultaneously. When a new game world is
  started, it takes time for enough players to form their own strategies and
  become familiar with the game. When more players are added you can see a
  larger variety of strategies. The way the world is interacted with doesn't
  become stable for a long while. You need to give the world time to stabilize,
  and to listen carefully to player feedback after every change.</P>  <P>What do you do to keep players excited and
  interested in the game?<BR>During the four years I worked on EverQuest, I strove to give players new
  ways to express themselves, as well as finding new ways to make the world
  live and breathe. At one Fan Faire I attended I met a gentleman who was in a
  wheelchair. We talked for a little while and he thanked the team and myself
  for giving him a place to adventure, be a knight in shining armor, and have
  friends without any preset judgments. The world of EverQuest belongs to the
  players, and it was my job to ensure that world was filled with
  possibilities.</P>  <P>Are there still elements of the game that
  people have not discovered?<BR>EverQuest is a massive world rich in culture and variety. Players have found
  endless ways to utilize the world for more than just leveling. Social
  structures through guilds have helped organization and generation of
  meaningful activities not built directly into the game. There have been countless
  marriages, poetry readings, drinking contests, fishing contests, races and
  more. The game is merely a sandbox for you to explore and utilize in whatever
  fashion you desire. There are many elements just waiting for the right player
  to grab hold of and make their own.</P>  <P>Why do you think EQ has been so amazingly
  successful?<BR>To be honest, when we shipped EverQuest we had hoped it would get a small but
  growing following. When it became the success it has, starting from the first
  day it went live, I was taken by surprise. EverQuest was and is a good game.
  If anyone considers the game more than that, the players are to thank.
  EverQuest is a world the players have molded through their continued
  commitment, interaction, ingenuity and feedback.</P>

  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>Network programmer - I wrote the network library that EverQuest uses to send
  data over the Internet. Existing Internet protocols were originally designed
  with file transfer and email in mind. They don't care how fast data gets
  there, just that the data gets there. I wrote a new protocol designed
  specifically for games and integrated it into EverQuest. I'm also responsible
  for some basic architecture decisions that affect the way computers in an
  EverQuest world communicate with each other.</P>  <P>Currently I'm working on technology for an unannounced project.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>When I started hearing the name EverQuest creep into non-EverQuest pop
  culture.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had done
  before?<BR>Before EverQuest, I integrated my network library into Tanarus, a tank combat
  game. Before that, I was finishing up my Computer Science degree at UCSD.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>I remember I was crossing my fingers before launch. I was praying we would
  get enough revenue to cover the enormous development costs of the game. I was
  praying we'd cover the minimum number of copies to break even and hoping
  people would stick around for at least three months.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>The first week of launch, when the sales hugely outpaced expectation and we
  scrambled to setup new servers.</P>

  development team. What are you doing now?<BR>In the beginning, I created the quests and the city population of Norrath's Old
  World. I was also charged with the duty of expanding the lore of EverQuest.
  My involvement with the lore of EverQuest has led me to be somewhat of a
  'Lore Keeper' for our company, and I assist in any project's lore questions.
  I have been focusing my talents on creating the future of the world of
  EverQuest while working on EverQuest II.</P>  <P>Could you describe your experiences with SOE
  over the past five years as EverQuest has grown?<BR>It has been an awesome and unexpected ride. Who would have known that little
  Norrath would grow up to be so large and successful? I am awe-stricken at the
  great fans that I have met and seen at our&nbsp;Fan Faires. It is definitely
  a rewarding feeling to see fans really take a liking to the world you have
  built for them, and EQ fans are some of the greatest. That makes it all worth
  it.</P>  <P>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ
  to life?<BR>A huge challenge has always been adding enough content for the player base.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>I realized it was something special when I started to play it myself as it
  was being built. When I adventured from Qeynos to the edges of the Plains of
  Karana, I knew that it was something special.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>I was actually in the golf industry. I kept writing and designing fantasy
  stories on my own, many of which have been assimilated into the EQ universe.</P>  <P>Did you think that EQ would ever become this
  popular or continue this long?<BR>Never. I believed it would be popular among a select crowd of gamers, but to
  truly see how large the EQ universe has come is amazing. It now transcends
  the MMORPG and has turned into a franchise. Unbelievable.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was
  originally designed/conceived?<BR>EQ still builds upon the core elements it was intended to harbor. New talent
  and fresh ideas have been added as time goes by, making EQ stronger than
  ever.</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>Every now and again I still manage to get online.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>Befallen has been a place of many early memorable moments for the Dwarven
  Irontoe Brigade. The lighthearted antics of the brigade were always enjoyable
  to be a part of as one of them always managed to slip down that darn well.
  Other than all those early Befallen Expeditions, I think the other single
  memorable moment was meeting my old character from my pen-and-paper days. Who
  would have guessed that Sir Lucan would someday become ruler of one of
  Norrath's superpowers?</P>

  of the game that are outside the world of Norrath, like the front end and loading
  screens. I also redesigned the EverQuest.com web site as it moved from Beta
  to launch. I incorporated elements from the fabulous box art paintings to use
  on the site, and other media to promote the game and its expansions.</P>  <P>What is it like working on a game that never
  ends?<BR>A MMO requires so much support that the entire Platform department sprang up
  specifically to handle things like patchers, installers, websites,
  registration, databases, subscription billing, etc. In the beginning there
  were about a half dozen of us. Now there are dozens of people that deal with
  all this and more: message boards, localization, email newsletters, Station
  Store, Web ads, administration tools, etc. There is always something new in
  the works with expansions and spin-off titles. It's great to be able to
  contribute to the ongoing EverQuest adventure.</P>  <P>What do you do to keep players excited and
  interested in the game?<BR>We are always working to find fun ways to announce new expansions and
  features. There have been Flash-animated graphics sent out in emails that
  lead to puzzles online. We try to get the community to work together to solve
  these, much like they would do in an in-game quest. I made the interactive
  Legends map that allows the players to track the movements of their character
  and their guild mates.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>Hearing the stories of distant family members who regularly meet up in EQ to
  adventure together, and disabled people who can travel though the vast world
  of Norrath.</P>

  decided to spin us off into our own independent studio.&nbsp;Smed [John
  Smedley]&nbsp;called a meeting, everybody came up with suggestions for the
  new company name, voted and we became Verant Interactive. A few years later,
  we merged with a company that made a mean web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game and some
  kind of spinning seashell thing that I could never really figure out and
  that's when we became SOE.<BR><BR>What was the biggest challenge in bringing EQ to
  life?&nbsp;<BR>Twelve to sixteen-hour days, seven days a week.</P>  <P>At what point did you realize that EverQuest
  was going to be something special?<BR>The first time I finished a sixteen-hour shift testing EQ, went home, logged
  on and played for four more hours.</P>  <P>How did work on EQ differ from what you had
  done before?<BR>I came to EQ after testing sports games. It was a challenge going from games
  that you test, ship and forget, to games that you test, ship, patch, test,
  patch, test, patch, test,&nbsp;patch and test some more. The cycle never
  ends.</P>  <P>How is EQ different today than it was

  a&nbsp;Frog-man&nbsp;now. :)</P>  <P>Do you still play?<BR>Nope.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>I think it would have to be at the end of beta, when the entire company
  logged in for one last free-for-for all&nbsp;PVP battle. We all had GM powers
  of course, and within about a minute it degenerated into a huge /kill-fest,
  but it was fun while it lasted.</P>

    EverQuest</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQ.<BR>I am the Senior Producer on EQ. My primary job function is to coordinate with
  SOE management, take the established goals for EQ, and work with the team to meet
  them. Sounds sort of boring, but when the established goals are &quot;make a
  cool game&quot; or &quot;do something the players love,&quot; it&nbsp;can be
  pretty fun.</P>  <P>What is it like working on a game that never
  ends?<BR>Neverending.</P>  <P>What do you do to keep players excited and interested
  in the game?<BR>Since many of the game designers are players themselves, there's a lot of
  first-hand evidence as to what people enjoy and what they want more of. Also,
  we use polls and read player feedback to get a feeling of what's going on.
  All of that helps us know more about what people want (and need).</P>  <P>People are worried that EQ will be shut down
  when EQII goes live. What does the future hold for EQ?<BR>EQ and EQII are two distinctly different games. EQII will bring more people
  into online gaming and broaden the field for all of us.</P>  <P>What are some future &quot;dream goals&quot;
  you have for EQ?<BR>Redoing all of the art would be nice. Tying some of the expansions into other
  media would be cool (&quot;see the end to the next expansion in the upcoming
  EverQuest movie,&quot; etc.)</P>  <P>Are there still elements of the game that
  people have not discovered?<BR>Lots. EverQuest is so huge,&nbsp;there's areas that haven't been conquered,
  items that haven't been found, quests that haven't been done.</P>  <P>Why do you think EQ has been so amazingly successful?<BR>Its initial success is no doubt the result of being the first in its field.
  EQ is the OG of first person 3D MMO gaming. Now with a great team, we
  integrate past, present and future lore into game designs, build great
  features, and present some pretty amazing art. I think it's evident that we
  care as much about making EQ now as they do about playing it.</P>  <P>What do you think is the best change that has
  been brought to EQ in the past few years?<BR>200 Sense heading.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>A bunch of us play every morning. There's nothing like being on an LDoN
  encounter getting into a situation where you're being worked in a dungeon, it
  looks like you're not going to make it, and somehow, you pull it off. The
  gods of Norrath smile upon you and you get that one small opening, and it
  makes all the difference. That's a great way to start a work day!</P>

    EverQuest</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQ.<BR>I am the lead designer for EverQuest Live and expansions. My role within the
  development team revolves around steering the direction of both live content
  and expansion content.</P>  <P>What is it like working on a game that never
  ends?<BR>Working on a game that never ends is definitely an interesting experience.
  Working with a group of designers, artists, and programmers who are all so
  passionate about creating high-quality games makes this experience even
  better than one could imagine.</P>  <P>Additionally, it's great to know that our development team is receiving
  constant feedback from our player base. If someone happens to post a problem,
  send us an email, message us in game, etc., we take all that information to
  heart. Our team wants to make EQ the best it can possibly be.</P>  <P>What do you do to keep players excited and
  interested in the game?<BR>I believe that there are&nbsp;a number of things we do in order to keep
  everyone excited and interested in EQ. Over the next year our team plans on
  reintroducing several large live events, addressing various outstanding
  player concerns, continuing EQ's storyline with the Wayfarers Brotherhood,
  and releasing all-new expansions for everyone to take part in. This coming
  year will be an exciting one for everyone who plays EQ.</P>  <P>People are worried that EQ will be shut down
  when EQII goes live. What does the future hold for EQ?<BR>This question comes up every now and then, and everyone's answer from the
  development team is the same: EQ isn't going anywhere. We have several plans
  that are in place that'll keep EQ around for many many years. You can expect
  to see some exciting new additions to EQ over the next several months.</P>  <P>What are some future &quot;dream goals&quot;
  you have for EQ?<BR>There are several &quot;dream goals&quot; I'd love to see merged into EQ. I
  believe the scripting engine that was introduced into The Planes of Power
  helped create all-new encounters that weren't possible before. Adding a new
  layer onto this system will allow the designers to create even more
  interactive encounters that just aren't possible at this time.</P>  <P>Additionally, with the introduction of the new graphics engine players can
  expect to play in a world that looks even more amazing than what's currently
  available. It's our hope to be able to add another dimension to the zones
  that are created. It'd be great to incorporate a console style of play that
  involves players flying, jumping down pits, and requiring other styles of
  game play that just aren't possible at this time.</P>  <P>Are there still elements of the game that
  people have not discovered?<BR>With the introduction of EverQuest: Gates of Discord, there are a number of
  undiscovered events, weapons, and quests that are still out there. With
  regards to past expansions... of course there are many undiscovered elements
  of EQ, but you'll have to find out about those on your own. :)</P>  <P>Why do you think EQ has been so amazingly
  successful?<BR>EQ has been successful for a number of reasons. I believe the hard work that
  the development team, operations team, customer service group, quality
  assurance team, and countless others have put into creating a great game
  can't go unnoticed.</P>  <P>I also believe that EQ has been amazingly successful due to the support of
  its community and players. Without you, EQ would cease to exist. You all tell
  us what's right, what's wrong, and what you don't agree with. Our development
  team loves receiving the feedback that you all provide.</P>  <P>Your contributions shape the world of EQ. What
  do you think is the best change that has been brought to EQ in the past few
  years?<BR>It's my personal opinion that one of the best changes that has been
  introduced into EQ is scripting. Scripting has allowed the design team to
  create all-new encounters that weren't really possible before The Planes of
  Power. This opened a whole new realm of possibilities for the design team to
  work with.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>One of my most memorable EQ moments is from original EQ shortly after its
  launch. Stepping out into Butcherblock Mountains for the first time was an
  amazing experience. Seeing dozens and dozens of other newbies running around
  the zone killing snakes, bats and skeletons wasn't something I've ever seen
  in any other games that I've played. It was even more amazing when I realized
  that I could take a boat from one continent to another and find hundreds and
  hundreds of other people fighting, adventuring, buying, selling, and
  socializing all over Norrath.</P>  <P>Knowing that this game had the potential of allowing me to play with
  thousands of people from all over the world made it a sight to see.</P>

  content, storyline, features, areas to explore, and creatures to meet and/or
  kill.</P>  <P>People are worried that EQ will be shut down

  you have for EQ?<BR>My personal dream goal for EQ is to redo all player character art.</P>  <P>Are there still elements of the game that
  people have not discovered?<BR>EverQuest is very vast, but I don't doubt the resourcefulness of our players.
  I wonder if there is any one player that has seen and experienced all of
  EQ....</P>  <P>Why do you think EQ has been so amazingly
  successful?<BR>Community, depth of gameplay, and content.</P>  <P>What do you think is the best change that has
  been brought to EQ in the past few years?<BR>I'm a graphics guy, so what can I say? I really dug the introduction of the
  Froglok as a playable character in LoY ;-)</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>The Fall of Grobb event. It was a blast!</P>

    Nevala&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR>Current Position at SOE: Lead Environment
    Artist, EverQuest</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQ.<BR>As Lead Environmental Artist, I manage the team that creates zones for
  EverQuest. I have been with the EverQuest development team since May of 2000,
  and have created a number of zones for both EverQuest Live and the released
  expansions. My day-to-day duties include training, creation and maintenance
  of Environmental Art schedules, technical evaluation, and endless meetings.</P>  <P>What is it like working on a game that never
  ends?<BR>It's very exciting and challenging to work on EverQuest. Since the game
  appeals to many people for differing reasons, it's fun to come up with new
  ideas that will cause the player to have a good experience, whether it be
  fun, whimsy, or abject terror.</P>  <P>What do you do to keep players excited and
  interested in the game?<BR>I try my best to make sure that each new zone that enters the game is
  something that hasn't been seen before in EverQuest. With the large volume of
  EverQuest screenshots that I've seen that include views and vistas that we've
  made, I think that people appreciate the effort that we put forth. That said,
  we'll continue to raise the bar for art quality in each expansion. What does
  the future hold for EQ? We've got a lot of surprises in store for the
  EverQuest player, especially in the realm of environments and characters.
  Besides improving the visuals that we're going to bring to you in zones,
  we've made a lot of advances in the art production technology, and I think
  what we release next will be the proverbial tip of the iceberg in regards to
  what we'll be able to do. You'll just have to wait and see. =)</P>  <P>What are some future &quot;dream goals&quot;
  that you have for EQ? I'm a level 63 bard, and I still don't have my
  epic weapon. Does that count as one? In all honesty, I'd like to see the
  EverQuest world become way more dynamic than it currently is, in terms of
  changing environments.</P>  <P>Are there still elements of the game that
  people have not discovered?<BR>Yes. Will I tell you where they are? Absolutely not.</P>  <P>Why do you think EverQuest has been so
  amazingly successful?<BR>I personally believe that the community is the biggest part. That goes beyond
  the game, though, as our Fan Faire attendances can attest to. I've personally
  made a ton of friends in EverQuest, and I've even met my fiancee because of
  the game.</P>  <P>What do you think is the best change that has
  been brought to EQ in the past few years?<BR>I may be biased, but I really like the technology that was brought about in
  Lost Dungeons of Norrath. It allows for people to jump into the action right
  away after logging in. Plus it was a lot of zones.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EverQuest moment?<BR>There are so many of them, it's hard to say. Basically, any time that I
  manage to finish an encounter by the skin of my teeth is my favorite. My
  first trip down the green mile in Plane of Justice was one of those.</P>

  to?<BR>Depth and immersion. From day 1, EverQuest grabbed me and drew me into the
  most immersive world I had ever seen created.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>By making EQII even MORE immersive. I play EQII every day, and it's no
  exaggeration to say that every day I sit back and look at the monitor in awe.
  I find myself checking my watch during meetings so I can get back to playing
  EQII. There is simply so much to do in EQII...I feel it's truly a living
  fantasy world. I hope our customers feel the same way.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>Play mechanics. Making the game challenging but less frustrating. It's a hard
  line to make, but we are trying.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>When I took over Studio 1, EQII was part of the Studio along with EQ and
  EQoA. I was and still am a casual EQ player and have been since day 1. I love
  playing a character up to about level 20 then starting all over again.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>Walking through the cities. You have to see it to believe it.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>Sitting in Butcherblock and having a Dwarven warrior come up and sit next to
  me, then regale me with tales of his adventures, and then me doing the same.
  All in character, none of it felt awkward at all. Must have lasted 45
  minutes. Certainly a peak gaming moment for me.</P>

    EverQuest II</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQII.<BR>My role to support the talent we have on the EQII team and focus them towards
  the common goal of producing a AAA title that will live up to the
  expectations that come with the name EverQuest.</P>  <P>To what do you attribute the success of
  EverQuest?<BR>The content as a backdrop for the community. There is a very deep and rich
  world that has been built into EQ. There is always something to look forward
  to, some new danger or adventure waiting just around the next corner, and
  there is always a place to go or something to do that you have not done
  before. This vastness encourages players to come together to share their
  stories and tactics, forging relationships based on a set of shared
  experiences and making the player feel that they belong to something bigger
  than each individual that makes up the world.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>I am working hard to make sure we carry over what has worked in EQ while
  allowing enough room for innovation to bring a complementary experience to
  the best MMORPG on the market. EQ will always hold a special place in every
  player's heart. With EQII it is our intent not to replace EQ, but to appeal
  to what made that experience special for players, and carve out a spot of our
  own.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>EQ is a great game to get a raid force together and dominate a
  larger-than-life encounter, to feel that you are part of something bigger
  than yourself. In EQII we are trying to complement that experience with one
  that focuses on the core fundamentals of EQ, the group. We want you to feel
  like a hero in the world and have access to those types of encounters, but
  approach them from a more group/player-focused perspective.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>I made my first character the week EQ was released, and stayed patient
  through the technology burps as the game grew larger than anyone expected. I
  am very passionate about EQ and I have over 100 days played on my characters,
  my main being 62 at the moment (I had to stop playing shortly after PoP to
  make sure I could focus on EQII =( ). I got involved in EQII when a
  professional colleague of mine who I had worked with before - Rich Vogel -
  called me and said that he wanted to talk about opportunities at SOE. I flew
  out to San Diego and spoke with John Smedley and Rod Humble, and shortly
  after that I got an offer to be the Senior Producer on EQII. I could not
  believe that I was going to be part of the rich EverQuest legacy - it is a
  dream job for me to work with such a talented team on a product line that I
  am so passionate about.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>The level of immersion. Our team has amazing talent in all areas of
  production. I find myself getting lost in the world and believing that I am
  there. The details in design, art, and engineering that have been accounted
  for in this product are unprecedented in this industry. EQII will be setting
  the bar that future MMP games are going to be judged by. You will quickly see
  what I mean when you log in for the first time and get swept away into the
  world of Norrath.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>There are so many! My first fall off Kelethin, finally discovering what a
  mino axe was, getting a manastone, my first right-click on my shiny new pair
  of jboots, finishing my cleric epic... but my favorite EQ moment was
  participating in my first large scale raid - in Sol B. I was finally tough
  enough to tag along for a Nagafen raid. I had no idea how many people or what
  level of organization it took to down the venerable dragon. I can remember
  plowing through the fire giants, getting to the buff spot, buffing up and
  charging in! Then seeing the mass destruction of the raid force at the hands
  of Lord Nagafen, but we managed to bring him down (it took us 2 tries). Ahh,
  great times! I can assure you we are all working very hard on the EQII team
  to present a new world filled with adventures that you will remember fondly
  for years to come.</P>

    EverQuest II</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQII.<BR>As a producer on the EverQuest II project, outside of working closely with the
  leads on new features, fiscal budgets, and external development relations, I
  spend most a lot of my time planning for the future of the game - we are
  always thinking years down the road with EQII. With a team of 70+ people, it
  is absolutely necessary to stay focused on the &quot;big picture.&quot;
  Otherwise, you'll end up with a team of individuals that are striving to
  achieve goals that may not necessarily be best for the project. Fortunately,
  we have arguably one of the most talented development teams in the industry,
  which happens to make my job that much easier.</P>  <P>What do you attribute the success of EverQuest
  to?<BR>There are many individual aspects to EverQuest that can be attributed to its
  success. However, I feel that the key is within the basic formula. EverQuest
  was created to allow users to escape into fantasy where they could explore
  fantastic worlds, establishing new friendships and performing valiant acts
  that could otherwise not be attainable in &quot;real life&quot;, all within a
  deeply intertwined backdrop of lore.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>Building upon the proven success of EverQuest and introducing features
  devised through the years of experience and knowledge gained since the launch
  of EQ. There is an unparalleled level of respect for our predecessor.
  Therefore, our goal with EQII is to positively evolve the game rather than
  throwing everything out and reworking for the sake of rework.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>I would say that the primary differences between the two are the
  unprecedented level of player immersion through character customization,
  world interaction and overall stunning beauty of the new Norrath, and the
  ability for both casual and hardcore players to play the game, at their own
  pace, while always feeling a sense of accomplishment.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>Shortly after the launch of Ruins of Kunark, I moved onto the original EQII
  team consisting of a small group of leads with the goal of laying out the
  design and engine infrastructure. Since then, the engine has been rewritten,
  the design goals have changed significantly, and the team itself has grown
  not only in size but in talent. All of these changes have not only
  dramatically improved development, but the quality of the end product.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>Too many to mention, though I really enjoy the initial reaction that people
  have the first time they see and play the game. It is always gratifying to
  see these visceral reactions on a product you have spent almost half of your
  professional career working on.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>So many to name, so little time. Falling through the base of the tree in BB,
  swan diving into lakes of lava in Lavastorm because my ISP hiccupped, being
  resurrected by a courageous little dwarf cleric by the name of &quot;Healimus
  Pimptastic&quot; while I was showing the game off to some relatives - the
  list goes on and on. What I have found to be great about MMOGs is that unlike
  single player games where there is a linear course of progression, in
  massively multiplayer games the players often dictate the outcome of a
  situation. There is always a surprise around every corner, and you never know
  who or what you will run into, no matter how well you think you know an area.</P>

  and responding on message boards so that I can act as a go-between for the community
  and the dev team. I answer many Q&amp;As for various websites, take tons of
  screenshots, give demos of the game, and attend occasional media functions. I
  also get to lend a hand to the designers on some of the background lore and
  writing, which is one of my favorite things to do. Plus there are meetings...
  lots and lots of meetings.</P>  <P>To what do you attribute the success of
  EverQuest?<BR>As a player, the thing that has kept me enthralled with the game is content.
  From when I was just a little monk back in Freeport until I was in a high-end
  guild raiding the homes of the gods, there have always been an amazing number
  of things to see and do. Some new monster to kill, some new piece of loot to
  drool over, some new zone to see... these are the things that kept me coming
  back for more.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>Having been a part of the EQ fansite community for so long, I brought that
  perspective to the dev team. It's very important to me that, no matter how
  many innovations we come up with, we maintain the magical feel of EQ. I'm
  extremely happy to report that the sense of newness and discovery from the
  early days of EQ is very much alive and well in the Norrath of the future.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>We've really tried to emphasize the importance of the individual. Even though
  the world is a big, scary place, we've made it more personal in many ways.
  The archetype class tree lets players have a clear role in the group while
  still being able to individualize the way they do their job. And the tactical
  nature of our combat system rewards smart decisions, making every player's
  contribution important to the success of the group or raid.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>I've been on the team for about seven months now. There I was, writing for my
  little fansite called Mobhunter, when some fella named Andy Sites sends me an
  email asking if I'd like to come out and talk to them about a job
  opportunity. At first I assumed it was all some cruel joke to pay me back for
  ranting about armor dyes, but it turned out they were serious. The rest is
  history.</P>  <P>And yes, I have been a hardcore EQ player since June of 1999. My guild is
  still going strong, working its way through Gates of Discord. I only wish I
  had more time to play with them.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>I am constantly stunned by how real and alive the world feels. I don't just
  mean the graphics and sound; I'm talking about the way NPCs interact with one
  another, the way the sunlight breaks through the trees, the way the tide
  rolls onto the shore. It's like every time I go into a zone, something new
  and unexpected jumps out at me. I'm consistently blown away by the magic
  being woven together by our designers, artists, and coders. Their passion for
  this game really shines through.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>I still remember my first Nagafen raid as if it were yesterday. I'd never
  seen fire giants before, and there we were charging into their castle! Trying
  to pull King Tranix out of his room the first time was unbelievably scary,
  not to mention hazardous to my health. When we finally got to Nagafen's lair
  and opened the door to his chamber, I was totally in awe.</P>  <P>There are other memorable moments I can recall, but for me that Nagafen
  raid was the just the perfect gaming experience. Of course, it helped that we
  won. ;-)</P>

    EverQuest II</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQII.<BR>I joined the EQII team as design director about six months ago, after leading
  the EverQuest design team for a few years.&nbsp; I spend most of my time
  working with the team to refine our game content and systems as we polish
  everything up for our beta release.&nbsp;</P>  <P>What do you attribute the success of EverQuest
  to?<BR>EverQuest has a lot going for it.&nbsp; There's an unequalled amount of
  things to do and places to explore, thousands of interesting players to meet
  and hang out with, a deep character advancement system, and a steady infusion
  of new content from a top-notch development team.&nbsp; I can't believe how
  giant the game has become, but it's an amazing piece of work.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>For EQII, we're taking the best parts of EverQuest and building upon
  them.&nbsp; The exotic locations, unique items, and compelling game world are
  all things we're focused on with EQII.&nbsp; We're also sticking with the
  tradition of hand-crafted content, meaning that someone creates every aspect
  of our world personally, instead of letting the computer randomly generate
  some fun for you.&nbsp; This worked very well for EverQuest and it's looking
  great for EQII.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>With EQII, we're working to bring the EverQuest experience to a wider
  audience, while still entertaining the hardcore players.&nbsp; We're making
  the game easy to get into, playable in shorter sessions, and emphasizing fun
  gameplay over complexity.&nbsp;</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>I got into EverQuest as a player, starting on the day it launched five years
  ago.&nbsp; I'd been developing games for several years, but after playing EQ
  I knew I wanted to be a part of it.&nbsp; Eventually, I got an opportunity
  and joined the design team towards the end of the Shadows of Luclin expansion.&nbsp;
  I moved up to the Lead Designer position for Planes of Power, and was lucky
  enough to work on several expansions there before moving on to EQII after
  Lost Dungeons launched.&nbsp;</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>I'm most excited about the cities we're working on; we're putting a lot of
  work into making the cities interesting, full of life, and compelling to play
  in.&nbsp; We've come up with some ideas for cities that I haven't seen in any
  other game, and make it plenty of fun to spend all your time playing around
  in the cities.</P>

    Director, EverQuest II</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>Describe your role on EQII.<BR>I've only been on the EverQuest II team for about five months, and my responsibilities
  here are similar to those that I had on EverQuest.</P>  <P>I'm in charge of the Engineering team, which is to say all of the
  engineers, code and systems that make up EverQuest II, as well as the User
  Interface team - which would be the artists, designers and engineers who work
  on the part of the game that needs to be attractive, friendly and
  useful&nbsp;without distracting from gameplay.</P>  <P>I work closely with my leads and the other directors and producers on the
  team to ensure that we're able to do all of the things that we need to do
  when we need to have them done. I review potential systems, pipelines,
  pathways and plans, make sure others get to contribute, and occasionally
  contribute or comment myself.</P>  <P>Of all of it, I think that the most important thing I do once that's all
  happened is make sure that the people who do the real work are all talking to
  each other. Then I try to get out of their way and let them be brilliant,
  which they are with alarming regularity.</P>  <P>Additionally, I work with other groups in the company on topics ranging
  from our beta testing plans and QA capacity to our plans for having EverQuest
  II work in different languages. There are a ton of people across every
  department at SOE who are contributing in some way or another to making sure
  that this massive project called EverQuest II is everything that it needs to
  be.</P>  <P>What do you attribute the success of EverQuest
  to?<BR>The opportunities&nbsp;to meet&nbsp;other people that every part of the game
  reinforces, even when you sometimes might not want it to. Those opportunities
  take place in a world ripe for discovery and heroism, where a person is
  really able to feel like they are in another world.</P>  <P>In the more innocent time of 1999, before a majority of players had even
  tried any game such as this, when many of the people online were interested
  in fantasy and many others were interested in meeting other people, it could
  be described as a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of brilliance and serendipity.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>EverQuest is the quintessential example of the fact that handcrafted content
  in an interesting world is what people want to see. Content comes in many
  forms, be it &quot;hard assets&quot; such as art, sound effects and music, or
  &quot;soft content&quot; such as data and scripts that define the creatures,
  items, quests and behaviors in the game world.</P>  <P>So far, we're living up to that legacy by doing whatever we can to make
  sure that those who fill the game with content have more power to implement
  more interesting things than ever before.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>The big&nbsp;&quot;II&quot; on the end, of course! Hmm. You probably want a
  serious answer...</P>  <P>I'm generally not one for colorful adjectives, but in this case I have to
  use a word that's well on its way to being trite. &quot;Breathtaking.&quot;</P>  <P>Aside from the breathtaking visuals? I'd have to say its potential for
  innovative and interesting gameplay. The world of EverQuest II can remember
  you, and things that you've done, in a way that I'd only have dreamed about
  during my time in EverQuest.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>Yes. You could say I played EverQuest...just a little... if you had a broken
  dictionary where &quot;just a little&quot; meant &quot;fanatically.&quot;</P>  <P>In the time before I was at SOE, a group of friends and I had founded a
  guild (that no longer exists, so I don't mind mentioning it) called The
  Pantheon on Innoruuk, where I made many friends that I still have today, and
  became thoroughly engrossed with Norrath and its population.</P>  <P>I was originally hired to help out on a previous title. After being at SOE
  for barely a month, I was asked to lend a hand on EverQuest in the months
  before Shadows of Luclin was to ship. I was the technical director on
  EverQuest until last October, when I was asked to take on the same role on
  EverQuest II.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>As an EverQuest fan first and foremost, it would be getting more people into
  this vibrant new world so they can see, hear and play it for themselves.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>Any time you can take a close-knit band of friends and attempt to do
  something that's generally considered to be &quot;far too difficult&quot; for
  either the size or makeup of the group that you have with you, facing the
  prospect of a painful failure...and you win.</P>  <P>That&nbsp;one in a million victory as the underdog, when all you have are
  your own wits and skills, and those of your friends...to&nbsp;me, that's what
  the best moments in EverQuest are all about.</P>

    EverQuest II</TD></TR></TABLE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Describe your role on EQII.<BR>As a producer on the product, my role is to facilitate all the folks who are
  doing the real work. From interfacing with other teams on server issues to
  arranging office supplies, a producer has to be a master of all things. Over
  the last year, most of my in-team dealings has been with the design folks,
  and I have to say it has been an honor to work with such a dedicated bunch.
  We've got a group that ranges from the grizzled veteran to the freshest
  designer, and they all share the same over-arching vision of a quality game
  experience. This is going to be one exciting game, there is no doubt.</P>  <P>What do you attribute the success of EverQuest
  to?<BR>While it was the first - to my knowledge -&nbsp;massively multiplayer 3D
  first person adventure style game, I truly believe that the success is due to
  the depth of the original vision, and the quality of the teams that not only
  brought that vision to life, but the outstanding folks who continued to make
  an already deep and engaging world even more so, through both expansions and
  every day additions to the game.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>EverQuest set the standard for an engaging and fun game, and we've got the
  responsibility to take what they did, and see how we can apply a fresh
  approach to the concept of MMORPGs that will compliment EQ1. We're certainly
  not out to compete with them, we just want to provide a fun alternative for
  those who prefer other types of games.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
  between EQ1 and EQII?<BR>This is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I'd have to say that
  we're shooting for a game that is more &quot;approachable&quot; without being
  simplistic.</P>  <P>How did you get involved in development of
  EQII? Were you a player before you came to the company?<BR>I was working as a project manager in another area here at SOE, and as the
  EQII team grew,&nbsp; I was drafted in to the team. Most exciting days of my
  life, to be sure. And yes, I've played EverQuest since it was originally
  released.</P>  <P>What single thing really excites you about
  EQII?<BR>The opportunity to provide a deep, intimate, meaningful and entertaining game
  at the cutting edge of technology. Sure, it sounds scripted, but I truly feel
  that way. The opportunity to share the creative talents of the entire
  EverQuest II team is a dream come true.</P>  <P>What is your favorite EQ moment?<BR>I'd have to say the first time I loaded up the game when it was
  released&nbsp;five years ago. I'd been playing text based adventure games for
  almost&nbsp;ten years before that, and the opportunity to see what had been
  in my mind's eye for so long was just thrilling.</P>

  effects, music and voiceover.</P>  <P>What do you attribute the success of EverQuest
  to?<BR>I think EverQuest is extraordinary because it was the first online game that
  was able to successfully unite interesting gameplay with social interaction.</P>  <P>How are you working to live up to the legacy of
  EQ1?<BR>I think we are all trying to live up to the legacy of EQ1 by respecting what
  a great foundation that game has built for us, and concentrating on adding
  new and interesting elements that will keep the player engaged.</P>  <P>In your opinion, what is the primary difference
