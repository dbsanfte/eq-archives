	<h2>Triumvirate of Legions Recruiting on Maelin Starpyre</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> <br>

	<P>Triumvirate of Legions Opens Its Doors to Hopeful Recruits (Maelin Starpyre)</P>
<P><EM>Called to arms, the legionnaires fall into their ranks. Side by side, the three legions form. Each general standing proudly before them. A crowd of somber spectators surrounding them. </EM></P>
<P><EM>The trumpet sounds. It is time to march! The mighty Iron Legion moves forward to lead the way. The powerful Phoenix Legion follows closely behind while the stoic Hellfire Legion keeps the rear ranks secure. Legion banners are held high. Flowers are laid in their paths by tearful relatives and friends. Well wishes and prayers follow the brave souls. </EM></P>
<P><EM>Amongst the crowd, a figure pushes its way towards the front of the procession. Successful at breaking through the masses, the Consul yells out to her general, "Hail, Iron General!" </EM></P>
<P><EM>"Consul, come, march next to me." Doing as her general bids, she falls into step with the Iron General. "I apologize that I am unable to join you on the battlefields, dear general. I wish I could fight by your side, but -" </EM></P>
<P><EM>The general interrupts, "Do not apologize for situations beyond your control, friend. Please take care of what you must. If you do not, you will never be at your peak performance on ANY battlefield." </EM></P>
<P><EM>"Thank you again for understanding, general." With this, the Consul bows to her general as he continues to lead the march. Waving a fond farewell to her brethren-in-battle, the Consul stands by the fortress gates. She watches each legionnaire march out the gates of the Triumvirate Fortress and onward to battle. </EM></P>
<P align=center>****************************** </P>
<P>Led by 3 generals and supported by a Senate, the Triumvirate of Legions is a family type guild, consisting of casual players which raid once or twice a week. Our main goal is each other, valuing and understanding each others real life. </P>
<P>We are continuously in search of good souls to join our family. If you are at least lvl 25, <A href="http://tol.myforums.net/">come visit the us</A> and see if the Triumvirate Fortress is the home you have been searching for. </P><br>
