  here to set up the account <BR><BR>* Choose a password that NO ONE will know. Account security is the
  responsibility of the account holder. Please note EverQuest accounts are not
  to be shared. Each family member should have their own account. The exception
  to this that parents may purchase an account for a child. Please refer to the
  End User License Agreement, which you click <STRONG>I Accept</STRONG> to every time you
  play EverQuest, for a detailed description of policies regarding account
  sharing. Please be sure to let us know if your email address changes in the
  future by changing your account information from www.station.sony.com if it
  happens to change due to switching ISPs, etc. Keeping your email address up
  to date is important, as it is our primary method of contact with you. <BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Change Account</STRONG> to set up a billing option. You will need a
  credit card to do this.<BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Connect</STRONG> to start the game.<BR><BR>* Select a server on the list, then click <STRONG>Play EverQuest</STRONG>.<BR><BR>* Click on <STRONG>Create New Character</STRONG>. At this point, you will be
  required to choose a race, class and deity. You will also need to invest your
  ability points into your attributes. The recommended attributes to add to are
  colored green.<BR><BR>* Before your character is done, you need to choose a name. It is strongly
  suggest you read the EverQuest naming policy before choosing a name. In order
  to protect our role playing environment, the naming policy is necessary.
  Please refer to the naming policy at www.EverQuest.com before selecting a
  name for your character. Also, you can choose to click on <STRONG>Get Name</STRONG> for
  our random name generator to suggest some names you might like. Be aware that
  some of these names have been taken by other players, so you may not get a
  random name approved every time. <BR><BR>* Once you have chosen a name, you may or may not be able to change your
  starting city (most races only have one starting city, though some have two).
  After a deity and starting city has been determined, click <STRONG>Enter World</STRONG>  to start the game.

	
		<h2>
			3.3
			Arriving in Norrath
		</h2>
	
	You begin the game in your
  starting city with these items (press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to view them): <BR><BR>* 20 Bread cakes and 20 skins of milk<BR>* Spells (for some classes)<BR>* Standard weapon (dagger, sword, or club)<BR>* Scroll with instructions (a tattered note: right click on the scroll to
  read it)<BR>Next, read the scroll (right-click on it) and follow the instructions.
  Usually it will ask you to give your message scroll to your Guild Master. He
  or she will then give you a basic item of clothing and more information about
  what to do next. <BR><BR>To equip the new item: <BR><BR>* Press&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>i</STRONG></EM> to open your inventory<BR>* Click on the clothing item to pick it up<BR>* Click on the central area of the inventory screen in order to wear it <BR><BR>The central area of your inventory screen is an auto-equip area. Dropping an
  item into the auto equip area will equip the item, provided there is nothing
  in the slot the item goes in and your class, race, and deity can wear or use
  it. If the item cannot be worn it will automatically go to one of the main
  inventory slots. If those are full, the item will go into the first container,
  starting in the upper left most portion of your inventory. If all main
  inventory slots and containers are full, the item will drop to the ground. Be
  aware that some merchants and NPCs are greedy and might pick up items they
  see lying on the ground. This also can be said about other players as well.

	
		<h2>
			3.4
			Moving Around
		</h2>
	
	The keyboard is your main
  control for movement in EverQuest, while the mouse controls the cursor and
  your current point of view. <BR><BR><STRONG>Running and Walking</STRONG> <BR><BR>To walk forward and backward, press the arrow keys on the keyboard or the
  Numpad keys. <BR>Other helpful movement keys: <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Control-r</EM></STRONG> to toggle Run and Walk mode.<BR><BR><STRONG>Number Lock</STRONG> to toggle AutoRun.<BR><EM>Note: hitting forward or backward movement keys (arrows) will also end
  AutoRun.</EM><BR><BR><EM><STRONG>Control-Right </STRONG></EM>or<EM><STRONG> Left Arrow</STRONG></EM> to step sideways.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>Spacebar</EM></STRONG> to jump.<BR><BR><STRONG><EM>d</EM></STRONG> to duck down.<BR><BR>Looking around using the mouse or numpad keys to change your current point of
  view: <BR><BR>Right-click-and-drag mouse to look around.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 9, 3</EM></STRONG> Pan view up, down.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 5</EM></STRONG> Re-center view.<BR><STRONG><EM>Numpad 7, 1</EM></STRONG> Zoom view in, out.<BR><BR><STRONG>Swimming</STRONG> <BR><BR>Most cities in Norrath are conveniently located near ponds or large bodies of
  water, and some even have fountains and underwater aqueduct systems. You can
  swim in water for a short period of time. The better you are at swimming, the
  longer you can hold your breath. <BR><BR>To swim: <BR><BR>* Walk into the water.<BR><EM>Notice that a new gauge appears. This is an important gauge; it indicates
  how much air you have left. When it runs out your character will begin to
  suffocate.</EM> <BR>* Pan your view down and move forward to swim down.<BR>* Watch your air gauge. When it gets low, emerge for air.<BR>* Pan your view up and move forward to swim up to take a breath.<BR><EM>Note: You can swim with your head above water by panning the view up
  slightly.</EM>

	
		<h2>
			3.5
			Communicating
		</h2>
	
	<P>EverQuest provides an ongoing source of social interaction. You can chat with
  fellow players on message boards, or talk to NPCs and other players within
  the game. <BR><BR>In general, whenever you send a message all players in the immediate vicinity
  &quot;hear&quot; you, and whatever you typed appears in the scrolling text
  portion of their screens (their Chat Window). However, you can also send
  private messages. <BR><BR>You send messages using the Chat Bar (at the bottom of the Chat Window), and
  all communications from all characters show up as text in the Chat Window. <BR><BR><EM>To send messages to characters near&nbsp;you&nbsp;in the game:</EM> <BR><BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to activate the text
  cursor.<BR>* Type your message.<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message.<BR><EM>Note: This assumes that your chat is set to use /say as the default mode,
  which is the default setting.</EM></P>  <P><EM>To send messages only to a specific character:</EM></P>  <P>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> or click in the Chat Bar to
  activate the text cursor.<BR>* Type /tell [charactername] [your message].<BR>* Press <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to send the message. </P>  <P>Use the <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> key to reply to the last person that sent you a
  /tell. <STRONG><EM>r</EM></STRONG> puts /tell [charactername] into your chat bar for you.
  All you have to do then is type the message and hit <EM><STRONG>Enter</STRONG></EM>.</P>  <P><EM>To talk to a non-player character (such as
  a shopkeeper NPC):</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on the non-player character (the NPC's name should appear in the Target
  Window), then press <EM><STRONG>h</STRONG></EM>.<BR><EM>Note: You should see your character hail the NPC in your Chat Window.</EM><BR>* The NPC will often respond to your hail. Words in [brackets] indicate
  keywords - when you see these, try asking an NPC additional questions using
  those words. You may get some useful information, or even a quest. <BR><BR><EM>Note: However you choose to communicate, please refrain from using
  inappropriate language.</EM> </P>

	
		<h2>
			3.6
			Attacking with Weapons
		</h2>
	
	You can fight manually in
  EverQuest by using weapon skills you've learned, but combat is generally
  easiest if you use the auto-attack function instead. Once you've got a
  target, you can simply press <STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> (or whichever key you've
  remapped this function to), and your character will automatically make the
  attack. Your only task at that point is to stay close enough to the target to
  hit it. <BR><BR><STRONG><EM>q</EM></STRONG> Initiate auto-attack (on current target). <BR><EM><STRONG>Esc</STRONG></EM>ape Remove current target from Target Window. <BR><BR>If you prefer to take your swings or shots manually, you can do so - as long
  as you have a weapon skill, and have programmed it onto a Hot button. <BR><BR><EM>Note: Once pressed, the button remains gray until you can take another
  swing (or, for ranged attacks, another shot). </EM><BR><BR>During melee combat, you must be standing fairly close to your opponent. If
  you're not near enough, you'll see a message in your Chat Window that says
  &quot;Your target is too far away.&quot; Be sure to remain facing your
  target. Ranged attacks can be made from as far away as the weapon will allow.
  Creatures usually rush toward you, however, once you hit them. <BR><BR>The text display also shows you whether your blow landed or missed, and
  whether or not your opponent has hit you. If you've taken or applied damage,
  you can see that as well. The amount of damage you can deliver to an opponent
  is an automatic function of your physical strength, the weapon you use and
  weapon skills. Your ability to evade blows or withstand blows is based on
  your combat skills and your armor. <BR><BR>See <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fchapter=16">Health, Damage
  and Dying</A> for information on how damage affects you.

	
		<h2>
			3.7
			Using Magic
		</h2>
	
	Some classes start out with
  one or more spells. To learn (scribe and memorize) a spell: <BR><BR>* Click the spell book icon at the bottom of your Spells Windows to open your
  spell book.<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory to place the scroll on your cursor
  (you can right-click and hold&nbsp;on a scroll first to view its contents).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe (write) the spell.<BR><BR>Scribed spells are permanently recorded in your spell book. But you can't
  cast every spell in your book. You must first choose to memorize those
  spells. Characters can only memorize eight spells, so at higher levels it
  becomes a tactical decision as to which spells to keep 'in-mind'. <BR><BR>* Once it's scribed, click on the spell icon in your spell book.<BR>* A &quot;spell gem&quot; will appear on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the spell gems (the octagonal slots in your Spells Window)
  to memorize the spell.<BR><BR>To cast a spell: <BR><BR>* Click on a target. The target's name should appear in the target window
  (spells that affect only you don't require a target).<BR>* Click on a spell gem that is holding a memorized spell.<BR>* A casting timer will appear. This indicates the time your character needs
  to finish casting the spell.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to disappear, then cast again if you'd like.

	
		<h2>
			3.8
			Quick Cash
		</h2>
	
	When you start, you've got enough
  food and drink to last for a while. But eventually you will need more, and
  you might want to purchase better armor and equipment from a merchant. To do
  this, you'll need money. <BR><BR>By far the best way to gain that money is by defeating enemies. In the areas
  just outside of the city that you start in you will be able to find small
  creatures, often in plague proportions. You can aid your fellow citizens and
  earn cash in the process by defeating these pests and looting their corpses.
  Merchants will buy most of these items for a few copper pieces. It's not
  much, but it's a start. And at the same time you will be earning some
  experience, practice for much greater deeds to come. Just don't wander too
  far from your friendly guards until you've gained a few levels, or if you're
  feeling very brave. <BR><BR>FYI: 1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 silver = 1000 copper

	
		<h2>
			3.9
			Skills
		</h2>
	
	Your character possesses a
  few basic skills at the start of the game. Everyone can Beg, Fish, use Sense
  Heading and Bind Wounds. Some skills (like Elvish or Pick Lock) are only originally
  known to those of a specific race or class, while others that you don't
  originally know can be learned over time (such as Meditation if you are a
  spell caster). <BR><BR>In order to use a skill you'll want to place it on an easily accessed hot key
  button. <BR><BR>To do this: <BR><BR>* Click on the Skills Tab (the hand) of the Actions Window.<BR>* Right-click on an empty hot button slot.<BR>* Click on a skill to assign it to that slot.<BR>* Click that Hot Button to use the skill.<BR><BR>Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>) and click <STRONG>Skills</STRONG> to see how
  proficient you are in any given skill. The more you use a skill, the better
  you become at it. When your skills improve messages appear in your Chat
  Window.

	
		<h2>
			3.10
			Experience
		</h2>
	
	You start out at Experience
  Level 1 in whichever class you choose. As you gain experience through combat,
  you progress to the next level. <BR><BR>Open your inventory to view your current level and how much experience you
  need to advance to the next level. To gain experience; find your guild, kill
  creatures and complete quests. <BR><BR>You can learn more by reading <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=experiencelevels">Experience
  Levels</A>.

	
		<h2>
			3.11
			Acquiring, Selling and Buying Items
		</h2>
	
	The most common method of
  acquiring items is to defeat monsters in battle and take their stuff. It is
  important to note that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage you
  and/or your group did to that NPC was greater than anyone else or their
  group. It is considered good etiquette not to interfere in a combat unless
  asked (or you ask if the person needs aid and they say yes). <BR><BR><STRONG>To loot the corpse of an NPC (monster) or player you've killed:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Click on an item in the corpse's inventory. It &quot;floats&quot; on your
  cursor.<BR>* Click on a free slot in your inventory.<BR><BR><STRONG>or you can use the shortcut method:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on the corpse to open its inventory.<BR>* Right-click on an item in that inventory and the game will 'auto-equip' it
  by trying to place it in the most appropriate spot in your inventory (if
  there is room).<BR><BR><STRONG>To buy/sell an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Right-click on a merchant NPC (Note: you will have to be relatively close
  to the merchant for this to work. If you are too far away you will only
  receive the &quot;consider&quot; information for the merchant, not the
  merchant window).<BR>* Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it or click on an item
  in the merchant's inventory to purchase it.<BR>* Click on the arrows to adjust the quantity if you're buying or selling
  multiple items.<BR>* Click <STRONG>Purchase</STRONG> or <STRONG>Sell</STRONG> to purchase or sell the quantity of
  items you've selected.<BR><BR><EM>Note that the merchant will tell you if you don't have enough money to buy
  an item or if he is not interested in purchasing something you wish to sell
  after you click the Purchase or Sell button.</EM> <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click Trade to give them the item (the person receiving
  your gift will also have to click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>. <BR><BR><STRONG>If you accidentally drop an item, you can pick it up:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Double-click on the item (it might appear as a small bag on the ground or
  as a representation of the item).<BR>* Click in an open inventory slot.

	
		<h2>
			3.12
			Exiting the Game
		</h2>
	
	Your character does not
  require food, drink or rest whenever you're not playing. The next time you start
  the game, your character's previous condition is restored. (For example, if
  you were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when you resume
  playing.) <BR><BR>To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Click <STRONG>Sit</STRONG>  on the Main Tab in the Actions Window, then <STRONG>Camp</STRONG> (this takes
  approximately 30 seconds). Then, click <STRONG>Exit</STRONG>. <BR><BR>Or: <BR><BR>* Type /sit and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to make your character sit down<BR>* Type /camp and then hit <STRONG><EM>Enter</EM></STRONG> to start the 30 second camp
  timer <BR><BR>When you return to the game later your character will be where you left him.
  Keep that in mind when choosing your campsite.
