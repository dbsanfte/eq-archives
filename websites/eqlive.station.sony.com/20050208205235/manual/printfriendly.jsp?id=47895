			Appendix D - Melee Archetype Abilities
		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Melee Archetype Abilities</STRONG>  <BR><BR>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Monks, Rogues and Warriors, as
  well as Bards, Beastlords, Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights. The first skill
  level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill
  level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill
  level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype
  abilities are passive. <BR><BR><BR><EM>Combat Agility</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the
  character an increased chance to avoid being hit in combat (damage
  avoidance). The first skill level increases the character's ability to avoid
  being hit by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage avoidance increase
  to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><EM>Combat Fury</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the
  character's chance for a critical hit (or grants a percentage where none
  exists). With all three skill levels, non-warriors will approach the basic
  ability to critical that warriors have. But a warrior with three levels of
  this skill will retain his a significantly greater chance to critical than
  any other class. <BR><BR><EM>Combat Stability</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the character
  an increased ability to reduce the damage he takes in combat (damage
  mitigation). The first skill level increases the character's damage
  mitigation by 2%, the second skill level raises the damage mitigation
  increase to 5% and the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><EM>Fear Resistance</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the
  character's resistance to fear affects. The first skill level increases the
  character's resistance to fear by 5%, the second skill level raises the
  character's added resistance to 10% and the third raises the increase to 25%.
  This ability also increases the character's chance to break out of fear once
  it has taken hold. <BR><BR><EM>Finishing Blow</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level gives the
  character a chance to kill an opponent with a single blow. The opponent must
  be fleeing and must have less than 10% of their hit points remaining. The
  first skill level grants a 1% chance for a finishing blow, the second skill
  level raises the chance for a killing blow to 2% and the third raises the
  chance to 5%. Note: classes without a natural chance to critical - which is
  all classes but warriors - will need to gain at least one skill level of
  Combat Fury for this ability to work. <BR><BR><EM>Improved Natural Durability</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level
  increases the character's natural hit points (hit point total without any
  buffs or magic items). The first skill level increases the character's hit
  points by 2%, the second skill level raises the hit point increase to 5% and
  the third raises the increase to 10%. <BR><BR><EM>Natural Healing</EM>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the
  character's ability to heal. Each skill level increases the character's base
  regeneration by one point every six seconds. This healing is in addition to
  the increase gained from Improved Natural Regeneration and any natural
  bonuses to regeneration due to race.
