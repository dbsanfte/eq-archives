	<P>An article Submitted to the Felwithian Sub-council of Knowledge
  for approval.<BR><BR>The War of Antonica<BR><BR>Steel boots tear into the earth of the Karanas.&nbsp; A blood-red cloud of dust rises over
  the desert of Ro.&nbsp; From as far away as Qeynos and the
  High Keep, we can feel the stomping march of Ykesha's army.<BR><BR>Scouts and spies watch the armies as they progress across the lands; one army
  to the east and one to the west.&nbsp;
  They see sharp blades in the leather gauntlets of grim and fierce
  trolls, dark elves, and ogres.&nbsp;
  They see a shadow on the rocks silhouetted against a burning sky
  holding a curved blade high.&nbsp; The
  warlord, Ykesha, shouts orders as he did two thousand years ago.&nbsp; He shouts of blood and vengeance.<BR><BR>Militias mobilize while citizens flee into the walls of their cities. <BR><BR>One by one the cities of Freeport and
  Rivervale and High   Pass sigh in relief as
  the dark armies cross their doorstep but turn south to the wetlands of
  Antonica.&nbsp; They turn to Gukta.<BR><BR>An old farmhand of Antonica, separated from the news of the lands, watched in
  horror as the army marched across his farms.&nbsp; While he and his family hid in a moldy
  cellar, the armies tore up his crops with their barbed boots.&nbsp; He saw their gauntleted hands gripping
  the thick handles of wide double-bladed axes.&nbsp; He saw their sharpened teeth gritting
  in anticipation of war.&nbsp; He knew
  what would happen to his family if they saw him.&nbsp; He sighed with relief when they had
  crossed the river to South Karana.<BR><BR>Many Norrathians build up a vision of the troll armies in their heads.<BR><BR>They see large masses of tall and powerful trolls fighting in lines against
  steel-armored warriors and paladins of the cities of light.<BR><BR>They do not see the details.&nbsp; They
  don't see those wide-bladed axes cleaving through plates of steel and into
  flesh and bone.&nbsp; They don't see
  young men dying of infected wounds under the burning heat of Ro.<BR><BR>They don't see the starvation, looting, and disease of the cities left to die
  in the wake of such an army.<BR><BR>Felwithe does not see this.&nbsp; We
  saw our own men dying in Greater Faydark under the rusted blades and axes of
  Crushbone.&nbsp; Now we read of the
  wars to the west in the comfort of our homes.&nbsp; Outside, legions of our guards stand
  watch in shining steel.&nbsp; We wish
  there were something we could do to help, but we will not send our troops
  across the Ocean   of Tears to help defend
  those who need it.<BR><BR>Gukta may soon be stomped into the ground with every living Guktan murdered
  in their streets.&nbsp; The brothers of
  Marr will fall under the iron gauntlet of Ykesha.&nbsp; Armies of barbarian mercenaries will
  be cut down defending a people they do not know while we discuss the war with
  our friends and drink our sweet wine.<BR><BR>We must mobilize.&nbsp; We must call
  upon our generals to mobilize and travel across the seas.&nbsp; We must defend our allies and
  ourselves from the armies of Ykesha.&nbsp;
  We must not sit back and read of Ykesha's victory over Antonica while
  we sit behind our walls and hope it will go away.<BR><BR>It is time for the colors of Tunare to once again march across Antonica.<BR><BR>- Aluvin Windwhisperer, The Royal Herald<BR><BR>Minister's Note:&nbsp; The preceding
  article is marked as deceptive, hostile, non-compliant, disruptive,
  aggravating, and contrary to the words of our king and the council of
  Felwithe.&nbsp; It has been disapproved
  for dissemination.&nbsp; Any release,
  display, discussion, or transfer of this record will be met with the
  strongest of penalties.<BR><BR>Dalavin Willowleaf - Chief Knowledge Minister of Felwithe</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50016">Report from the Wilds #1</A><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50017">Report from the Wilds #2</A><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50020">Report from the Wilds #3</A><BR><A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50021">Report from the Wilds #4</A><BR><A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=50022">Report
