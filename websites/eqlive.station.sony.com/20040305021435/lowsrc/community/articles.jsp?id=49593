<h2>Community Leaders - Niami of EQ Traders Corner</h2>
<P>One of the greatest resources for anyone interested in EverQuest tradeskills is <A href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQ Traders Corner</A>. In the first of our Community Leader interviews, Niami tells us a bit about herself and why she launched EQ Traders Corner.</P><B><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/mischievous_small.jpg" width=200 align=left vspace=4 border=0> 
<P>To start, can you tell us a little about just who you are?</P></B>
<P>I'm a longtime gamer and computer geek. Currently, I live in Southern California with my husband (aka "The House Ogre") and three cats. I'm a "retired" computer professional, though some would say my site is a fulltime job in and of itself, and a (very minorly) published writer.</P><B>
<P>Yoda would probably say something along the lines of, "Publish, or publish not. There is no minorly published." What did you have published, and is it available online?</P></B>
<P>{laughs} You asked for it!</P>
<P>The book in which one of my pieces was published likely went out of print several years ago, thank Bristlebane! It definitely wasn't one of my favorite pieces, but it was one of those "20 lines or less" anthologies. I also had a showcase of my stories and poems in AOL's Family Computing Forum scrapbooks, which, well, were scrapped when the area was redesigned a few years back. A quick check on the 'Net shows that Seeker Magazine, an online literary magazine, has an index of their past issues, including a favorite piece of mine in their first issue. I was also featured in one of their other issues. Other than that, I have a ton of rp storylines, poems, and songs squirreled away in several private webspaces, but I'd definitely want to move them elsewhere before inviting much traffic to them. ;)</P><B>
<P>Why the fascination with the EQ Tradeskills?</P></B>
<P>I'm a person who has always enjoyed the feeling of creation. I've been actively making handicrafts for most of my life, and have been writing short stories and poems since I discovered RPGs in high school. I was overjoyed when a friend introduced me to EQ during Phase 4 beta to discover a game that allowed me a chance to create instead of "just kill things." I've been tradeskilling ever since.</P><B>
<P>How long has EQ Traders been in existence?</P></B>
<P>If memory serves, I launched the first site off my AOL webspace within two weeks of game launch. At the time, it mainly listed personally-verified tradeskill vendor information, as publishing recipes was still considered a "cheat" by many. Eventually, recipes and other features were added, and I finally gave up personally verifying every individual recipe when cultural smithing was introduced to the game. </P>
<P>It's grown and changed a LOT since then, and my current "best guess" is that it's now getting about 4 million hits per month when hits for the main site and the message boards are combined.</P><B>
<P>What is the main purpose of EQ Traders?</P></B>
<P>The purpose of EQTC is to provide as complete a resource as possible for the EQ tradeskilling community. This includes recipes, trade supply locations, tradeskill guides, as well as a very active message board community.</P>
<P>Sometime in the next couple of months, we hope to take the "next step" and launch a massive searchable database that will allow folks to search for supplies, recipes, drop and trivial information, etc. It's a rather large undertaking, but we've got some wonderful volunteers helping, not only with the data entry, but also with brainstorming the database design, edit and query functions, etc.</P><B>
<P>How does your EQ Traders community compare to other communities?</P></B>
<P>That's a hard one to answer, as it's a lot like comparing apples to oranges. Certainly we're the most active tradeskill community out there, but with the fact that tradeskills have hit the mainstream with many lovely new tradeskill-only items, we've had several large growth spurts. We've basically gone from a tiny "niche" community into a very large cross-section of EQ'ers. It's caused some growing pains, as new visitors don't always understand (despite posted rules) that we DO actively moderate the forums, and require a certain level of manners, etc. However, we've found that part of the reason many of our regulars frequent the forum is because of those selfsame rules, which allow them a more productive and supportive environment as they struggle to grandmaster their chosen skill(s).</P>
<P><B>So, you have no problem scolding some members of your community for posting violations in your own Den Motherly way?</P></B>
<P>I wouldn't say "no" problem, but I wield a pretty mean Rolling Pin of Doom when folks make a mess and disrupt the community. Folks have learned that it's best to not rile the redhead {grins}</P>
<P><B>Can you sum up your overall EQ impression in a couple of sentences?</P></B>
<P>In the end, it's all about the people for me, so any impressions I have of EQ are intertwined with the interpersonal aspect. The lovely graphics, the quests, the tradeskills, the fights of epic proportions, and other content mean little to me without folks with whom to share my successes and failures. They're what make all of it worthwhile for me.</P>
<P>(All right, so "a couple" equals three, but only for followers of Bristlebane!)</P>
<P><B>Thanks Niami!</P></B>
