			19.3
			Joining/Leaving a Guild
		</h2>
	
	Before you join a player-created
  guild, find out whether the guild's plans are similar to those of your
  character. Most guilds have a web site that lists their charter, goals and
  requirements. To join a non-player character guild specific to your
  occupation, give the correct scroll to the guild master. To join a player
  guild, find the Guild Leader and ask to join. You're not obligated to accept
  a guild invitation, and player guilds aren't obligated to invite you. <BR><BR>Once you join a guild you assume the guild name. This name appears in
  &lt;brackets&gt; after your character's name onscreen. Your guild affiliation
  is also revealed when someone uses the &quot;/who&quot; command. <BR><BR>You can leave a guild at any time by typing the following: <BR><BR>/guildremove [your character's name]
