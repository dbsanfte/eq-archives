<h1>More about moving to or from Antonius Bayle</h1>
	We understand that some folks missed the chance to move to the new server or to cancel the move if they changed their mind.  We also might have missed a few people if something went wrong with their attempt to execute the /movelog command.  We want to help everyone get to the right server.  But we can only offer this service until 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  Here's what you should do if you want to undo your move to Antonius Bayle:<P><BR><B>Canceling your move:</B><P>We will be allowing people to undo their move to the Antonius Bayle server if you send an email us <a href="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com?Subject=Cancel Movelog">here</a> or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a subject line <I>Cancel Movelog</I> before 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  You must provide your station name and the name of the server that you moved from (no, don't send us your password).  Please also clearly state that you would like to cancel your move to the server and make certain that the subject of your email is <I>Cancel Movelog</I>.<P><BR>And here's what you should do if you missed your chance to move:<P><B>Missed the move?</B><P>We will still move folks to the Antonius Bayle server on an individual basis.  To request a move send an email to us <a href="mailto:eqmail@soe.sony.com?Subject=Missed Movelog">here</a>, or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a subject line <I>Missed Movelog</I> before 11:59 PM PT on Sunday, November 18th.  You must provide your station name and the name of the server that you want to be moved from (don't send us your password).  Please also clearly state in the email that you would like us to move your characters to the Antonius Bayle server.<P><BR>Please take advantage of this.  After we're done moving people based on these requests folks wanting to move their characters will have to use our character transfer service.<P>Alan<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

Also, will the people that asked for the move to be cancelled have their account returned to the way it was before the move, or will they retain any xp and items they accumulated during the time on Antonius Bayle?<P>PS: When I was posting this comment. I tried selecting the Category as "Server Related Issues", but the "Pick a Server" drop-down doesnt have Antonius Bayle as a choice.</B><P>We plan to make the final moves during the next patch.  We don't have a time set for the next patch yet, however.<P>As soon as we have a time for the next patch, we'll let you all know.  In the meantime, just keep playing on whichever server you're on and have some fun.<P>Alan<BR>
