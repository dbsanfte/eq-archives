<h1>NPCs!</h1>
	<BR><B>I've been pondering what these NPC's are for. My curiosity has only been growing since I've seen more of them in the game. NPC's with the "!" in front of their name or just their entire name, have been spawning across all of Norrath. The ones in Kedge Keep and EK come into my mind immediatly but I remember more as well, just not where they are.<P>There have been recent theories which hypothesize what they are for. PH's for future quest NPC's, a bug, and even the "Vah Shirr beamed elvis back down to us but he forget his name and how to speak" theory, but no one seems to know that these level 0 creatures are for. Could someone enlighten me, or the rest of the gaming world, as to what these NPC's are for or will be for, so we can stop swinging our hips near them in hopes Elvis remembers who he is? <P>Thanks!<BR>Baron Hobie Wan<BR>Terris-Thule</B><P>Those are, for lack of a better word, broken.<P>And, though you describe it as if it were a plague (Run for your lives, the ! are attacking!), they should be rare.  Heck, there shouldn't be any of them if things are going properly in Norrath.<P>They show up when an NPC appears in the world with some sort of problem.  It's best to just ignore them and move along in an orderly fashion...<P>These are not the !s you are looking for.<P>Alan<BR>
