<h1>UseUmbra</h1>
	<B>Please post about UseUmbra=False!<P>It's on the tech board getting rave reviews. It's in alt.games.everquest getting great reviews.<P>Please mention it here because lots of people read this forum religiously and not the tech board.<P>Some official explanation about who/when WOULDN'T want to use it would be great...details such as those are lacking.  If you could also include when/how this would affect the UseTnL line would be great as well.</B> <P>I'm sorry, I lost the name of the person that sent this in...<P>Here's the deal with this UseUmbra thing.  It will indeed affect the game if you add this line to your eqclient.ini file (under the [Defaults] section).  It, basically, disables Umbra functionality.<P>Let me try to explain when it might be useful to set add this line to your eqclient.ini file.<P>Turning off Umbra can have a big impact on the performance you see indoor Luclin zones.  If you frequent such zones, adding this line and setting it False will probably be a bad thing.<P>If you don't have Luclin installed, then adding the line and setting it to false might be of some use to you, at least for a while (*I'll explain that later).<P>But for most situations it's not really possible for me to guess how it will affect you, since so much of performance is based on hardware and drivers.  But you can certainly experiment with this switch if you'd like.  For most people you will be better off not messing with it at all.<P>*(This is later)  We currently have some .dlls on the Test server that enhance the functionality of Umbra.  For the most part setting this to False disables tools that improve your performance.  With the fix we have on Test many of the issues that people are seeing seem to be corrected (hitches when people zone in and poor framerates).  It is also very likely that some day soon we will be setting that UseUmbra switch programmatically and ignoring any setting in the eqclient.ini file so that you can get the best performance based on the zone you are in.<P>So please feel free to use this setting if you think it helps your system.  But be aware that setting it False will probably harm your performance with indoor Luclin zones.<P>Alan<BR>
