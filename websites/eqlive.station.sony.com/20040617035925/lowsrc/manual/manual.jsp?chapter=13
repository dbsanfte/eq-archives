<h1>Manual</h1>




	
		<h1>
			13
			Using Magic
		</h1>
	
	Those who cast magic are initially more vulnerable than other types of characters. Physical abilities are sacrificed for mental prowess, but eventually most spell casters become feared and revered citizens of Norrath. Building a life as a Wizard, Magician, Necromancer, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric or Shaman might be more difficult than pursuing other occupations at times, but the rewards can be great...<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.1
			Spell Book and Mana
		</h2>
	
	All spell casters carry a spell book. You can open the book at any time by clicking the book icon. Once you copy a spell from a scroll (scribe it), it is permanently recorded in your book. <BR><BR>You can "memorize" eight scribed spells at any one time by placing them in a spell gem slot. Casting the spell then becomes as easy as clicking on its gem. <BR><BR>Spell casting consumes mana, a mystical source of magical energy. Like hit points, mana regenerates over time. Your current level of mana is shown by the blue mana bar. The longer the blue line in the bar, the more mana you currently possess. As you gain experience levels, you gain additional mana. Resting or meditating restores your mana faster than standing.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.2
			Acquiring Spells
		</h2>
	
	Some classes (such as a Paladin's ability to Lay on Hands) have one or more spell-like abilities that are very much like skills and don't involve spell scrolls, scribing or meditating. You can use them as often as your level permits. For most spells, however, you must obtain a spell scroll, record it in your spellbook and memorize it before you can cast it. <BR><BR>You can buy spell scrolls from magic vendors, and if you're an aspiring spell caster, you'll probably have one or two at the start of the game. Some special quests can also yield spells. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.3
			Spell Types
		</h2>
	
	EverQuest has literally hundreds of spells that you can acquire and cast at various levels of experience. They're far too numerous to list here, but for the most part they can be classified into four types: <BR><BR><I>Offensive</I>: Spells that are, or add punch to, combat attacks. Examples are Shock of Frost, Burst of Flame and Enfeeblement. <BR><BR><I>Defensive</I>: Spells that boost armor ratings or give added protection or advantage during battle - for instance, Courage, Skin Like Wood and Invisibility to Undead. <BR><BR><I>Healing</I>: Spells that restore health and stamina, like Minor Healing, Cure Disease, Endure Poison and Mend Bones. <BR><BR><I>Utility</I>: Spells that are neither offensive nor defensive. For example, you can cast Calm, Sense Magic, Summon Food and Bind Affinity. None of these spells is harmful or helpful in a combat situation, but they each have a specific purpose and provide some benefit. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.4
			Learning a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Before you can cast a scroll-based spell you have to copy it into your book and learn it. <BR><BR>To learn a spell from a scroll: <BR><BR>* Click on the spell book icon (the picture of a book at the bottom of your Spells Window).<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory (to view a scroll's information, right-click on it).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe the spell.<BR><BR>The timer gauge (at the bottom of the spell book) appears, measuring how long it takes to scribe the spell. You only need to do this step once for any spell. Once it's recorded, it's permanently in your book. <BR><BR>Now, memorize the spell by adding it to a spell gem slot (you must do this before you can cast it):<BR><BR>* Click on the picture of the learned spell in your spell book. A rock-colored gem appears on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the octagonal spell gems in your Spells Window to the left of your spell book.<BR>* The timer gauge measuring how long it takes to memorize the spell. When you have memorized it, the gem turns colored.<BR><BR>You can memorize up to eight spells at any one time. To "forget" a spell (remove its gem), right-click on its gem slot. You can then memorize a different spell in the free slot (if you can't remember which spell gem goes with which spell, hold down the alt key). <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.5
			Spell Gem Colors
		</h2>
	
	Once you memorize a spell, the spell gem will be outlined or highlighted by a color. That color indicates something about the spell that is memorized in the slot. <BR><BR><I>Yellow</I>: You can only cast it on yourself.<BR><I>Red</I>: You can cast it on your current target.<BR><I>Green</I>: The spell affects anyone close to your target.<BR><I>Blue</I>: The spell has no range, and will radiate out from you.<BR><I>Orange</I>: The spell only summons items and doesn't affect anyone.<BR><I>Purple</I>: You can cast it on everyone in your group.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.6
			Before You Cast a Spell
		</h2>
	
	Prior to casting, make sure you're ready (especially in a combat situation): <BR><BR>* Make sure that you have the spells you plan to use memorized (remember the <B><I>Alt</I></B> key pops up the names of the spells).<BR>* Check your mana supply. If it's low, wait to attack or find a way to boost it.<BR>* Identify your auto-attack hot key (you never know when you'll need to hit something).<BR>* Make sure that you have already cast any pre-battle spells (armor or strength-boosting spells) that you might need.<BR>* Target an NPC, either by left-clicking on one or by pressing <B><I>F8</I></B> to target the nearest non-player character.<BR>* Check your chances in combat (right-click to Consider your target).<BR><BR><I>Green text</I>: You are likely to defeat this opponent.<BR><I>Light Blue text</I>: A bit of a challenge, at most.<BR><I>Blue text</I>: You have a good chance to defeat this opponent, but it won't be easy.<BR><I>White text</I>: This opponent is at least your equal. A gamble, but you could win.<BR><I>Yellow text</I>: You should probably leave this opponent alone.<BR><I>Red text</I>: You'll most likely die.<BR><BR><I>Note: These Considerations assume that the higher level you are the more help you have. So as you level easy Light Blue opponents might become a greater challenge.</I><BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.7
			Casting a Spell
		</h2>
	
	<I>To cast a spell:</I> <BR><BR>* Click on a target (spells that only affect the caster do not require a target).<BR>* Left-click the icon that represents the memorized spell you wish to cast.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to expire and the spell gem to brighten up, then cast again if needed.<BR><BR>When you cast a spell, a time gauge shows up indicating how long it's going to take to cast that spell. If someone hits you or you take a step, casting may be interrupted. Improving your Channeling skill helps you recover from these situations. <BR><BR>All spells are linked directly to certain skills - Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination or Evocation. The better you are at that skill, the better the chance your spell has of succeeding. If your casting fails, you'll see a message in the text display indicating that your spell "fizzled." Failed spells still consume mana, but don't produce any effects. Even if your casting is successful, your opponent may be able to resist that spell. Generally, higher-level characters are better at resisting spells cast by lower-level characters. <BR><BR><I>Note: If someone casts a spell on you, a message appears in your text display. In some cases, a spell icon displays in your 'buff' box. Right-click and hold on the spell icon to find out the name of the spell.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.8
			Developing Magical Skills
		</h2>
	
	Some skills relate directly to magic - Abjuration, Alteration, Channeling, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, Meditate and Specialization (see <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=skillsmagic">Magical Skills</A>, for a listing and definition of each skill type). You gain some of these skills through experience, while you're born with others.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.9
			Meditating
		</h2>
	
	You can decrease the amount of time it takes you to memorize a spell by Meditating. This helps speed up the process of scribing and memorizing spells, but it's a skill-based ability. If you press the Meditate button but nothing happens, that means that you don't yet have the Meditate skill. If you have the skill, it will automatically be used whenever you memorize or scribe a spell. <BR><BR>Meditating for long periods of time helps you regain mana faster, and is more effective than meditating for short bursts. <BR><BR>To meditate just click on the picture of your spell book in the Spells Window.<BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			13.10
			First Level Spells
		</h2>
	
	If you've chosen a magical occupation, you can cast certain spells as a beginner. As you gain experience levels, you can learn more advanced spells. <BR><BR>Here are a couple of the spells you can learn at Level 1 for each magical occupation. <BR><BR><I>Cleric</I>: Minor Healing and Courage.<BR><I>Druid</I>: Minor Healing and Skin Like Wood.<BR><I>Enchanter</I>: Minor Shielding and Shallow Breath.<BR><I>Magician</I>: Minor Shielding and Burst of Flame.<BR><I>Necromancer</I>: Minor Shielding and Life Tap.<BR><I>Shaman</I>: Minor Healing and Inner Fire.<BR><I>Wizard</I>: Minor Shielding and Shock of Frost.<BR><BR>
