			5.32
			Trade Window
		</h2>
	
	To open a Trade Window pick up an item and left-click on another player character. The trade window can only be opened between player characters, NPCs use the Give Window. <BR><BR>It is important to know that no transaction is final until both players agree to it by hitting the Trade button. <BR><BR>The Trade Window consists mostly of two sets of boxes. The left-hand set of boxes will be where you will see items that you are trading to gain, along with any coins offered. The name of the character you are trading with appears above the left-hand set of boxes. The right-hand side will be where you place items that you wish to trade out. <BR><BR>You may add or remove items from the Trade Window at any time up until both characters have clicked the Trade button. Any time either participant changes the contents of the Trade Window, the Trade button pops back up. Any change in the items in the Trade Window will require that both parties click Trade again before the trade can be completed. <BR><BR><I>Note: It is important that you are certain all items in the Trade Window are as you want them to be. Right-click any items in the window to inspect them before clicking Trade. Once you click Trade you are accepting the deal as it is.</I> <BR><BR><I>Also Note: Make sure that you have enough room in your inventory for the incoming items! If you're taking more items than your inventory can hold, extra items fall to the ground. You'll need to drop other items to pick them up, or obtain a container (such as a backpack). NPCs and other characters might pick up items that fall to the ground, so it is important to make sure your items have a place in your inventory after any trade.</I> <BR><BR>
