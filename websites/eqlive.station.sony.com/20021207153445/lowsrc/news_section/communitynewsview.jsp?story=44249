	<h2>Neriak Intercene Warfare Update - Xegony</h2>
	<b>Server:</b> Xegony<br>
	05/20/2002<br>
	Tier'Dal scouting forces have been spotted roving the Commonlands.&nbsp; A number of locations throughout the Commonlands have reported minor skirmishes and altercations with the scouting forces mostly around inns, passes, and other favorable terrain features.&nbsp; It seems these scouts are an advance force for a larger raiding party and it would seem likely an entire army.&nbsp; A small force of the scouts was overcome by members of the guild known as Ring of Fire and it was found that the scouts were wearing military badges that identify them as part of the Q'Enli house of the Tier'Dal presently led by one Lord Ralzq who also sits on the Neriak City Council.&nbsp; It is common knowledge that following the death of Lord Aniz Tan'il that Lord Tarhik Ka'Tariz has accused Lord Ralzq Q'Enli of the theft of items under his protection.&nbsp; This claim by Lord Tarhik has incensed Lord Ralzq and both council members are girding for all out war.&nbsp; Travelers in the Commonlands area are advised to pass through swiftly or travel in groups.<br>
