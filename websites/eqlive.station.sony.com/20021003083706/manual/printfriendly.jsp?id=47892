	<B>Caster Archetype Abilities</B> <BR><BR>Abilities from this Archetype are available to Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards, as well as Bards and Shadowknights. The first skill level of each Archetype ability costs two skill points. The second skill level of each Archetype ability costs four skill points. The third skill level of each Archetype ability costs six skill points. All Archetype abilities are passive. <BR><BR><BR><I>Channeling Focus</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. The first skill level reduces the chance of interruption but 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 10% and the third brings the reduction to 15%. <BR><BR><I>Mental Clarity</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Deftness</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the casting time for beneficial spells with a casting time greater than four seconds. The first skill level reduces the casting time of these beneficial spells by 5%, the second skill level increases the reduction to 15% and the third brings the decrease to 25%. Bards can not gain this Archetype Ability because they do not have 'casting times' over four seconds. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Expertise</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level negates any chance of spell failure (fizzle) for spells of a certain level. The first skill level prevents failure of spells under 20th level, the second skill level prevents failure of spells under 35th level and the third prevents failure of spells under 52nd level. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Fury</I>: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level increases the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. The first skill level gives a 2% chance for critical damage, the second increases the chance to 4% and the third increases the change to 7%. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Mastery</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell he is casting. This works for all spell types. The result is a reduced chance of spell failure (fizzle) and a greater chance of a reduction of the mana cost for the spell. The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill level and 30% for the third skill level. Hybrids can not gain this ability because they do not have the specialization skill. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Reinforcement</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the duration of caster's "buff" spells. The first skill level increases the duration of buffs by 5%, the second raises the increase to 15% and the third raises the increase to 30%. The only Caster that can gain this ability are Enchanters. <BR><BR><I>Spell Casting Subtlety</I>: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the amount of attention casting spells generates for the caster. The first skill level reduces the amount of 'hate' generated by spell casting by 5%, the second skill level improves the 'hate' reduction to 10% and the third improves the 'hate' reduction to 20%. <BR><BR>
