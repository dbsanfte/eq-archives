This is an important gauge; it indicates how much air you have left.&nbsp; When it runs out your character will begin to suffocate.</I> <BR>* Pan your view down and move forward to swim down.<BR>* Watch your air gauge. When it gets low, emerge for air.<BR>* Pan your view up and move forward to swim up to take a breath.<BR><I>Note: You can swim with your head above water by panning the view up slightly.</I> <BR><BR>
