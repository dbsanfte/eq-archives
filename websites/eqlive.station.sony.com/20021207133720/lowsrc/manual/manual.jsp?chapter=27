<h1>Manual</h1>




	
		<h1>
			27
			Appendix B - Errata for the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Manual
		</h1>
	
	EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark was released with a new printed manual, which is also available for download on the main EverQuest site at www.everquest.com. As with any static printed material associated with dynamic games such as EverQuest, information has a potential to be outdated. In addition to some obsolete information included in the manual, there were also several inaccuracies. These are listed below. Please refer to your printed or downloaded manual so that the comments may be taken in context.

	
		<h2>
			27.1
			Appendix B - Player Corpse Decay Times
		</h2>
	
	p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status. The corpse timer has been changed since the manual was printed. The player-corpse decay times are as follows. Please note that all times are in real time, not game time: <BR><BR>Level 1 - 9: 30 minutes<BR>Level 10+: 7 days <BR><BR><I>*Note: It is best advised to get your corpse right away. Also note that the timer on a corpse ticks down whether you are in game or not.</I> <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.2
			Appendix B - Character Creation
		</h2>
	
	p.24: The starting city for the Iksar is listed as New Sebilis. It should be noted that New Sebilis is also known as Cabilis. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.3
			Appendix B - Sitting and Camping
		</h2>
	
	p.34: The "Jargon Note" makes reference to player-killers lingering around another player-killers regeneration point (bind point, where they return after death) in order to attack them again. It should be noted that this tactic (called "Bind Point Camping") is considered un-sportsmanlike conduct in Player-versus-Player combat, and is against the rules. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.4
			Appendix B - Safe vs. Dangerous Locations
		</h2>
	
	p.35: Section should read: <BR><BR>As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and other players can't kill you. (You have to become a player-killer, or PK, to give other player-killers "permission" to attack you. You do this by giving a Priest of Discord the <B>Child of Discord</B> book in your inventory.) If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous guards may immediately come to the rescue, <B>providing that they are fond of you. Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.</B> <BR><BR>*Note: Changes to the original text are in bold text. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.5
			Appendix B - "Feeling Out" Strangers
		</h2>
	
	p.40: It is stated that you cannot "consider" a merchant. You can, but you must use the "Consider" key ("C" by default) or type /consider on the command line. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.6
			Appendix B - Skills and Combat: Skills
		</h2>
	
	p.49: The next-to-last paragraph on this page reads, "You can have anywhere from 0 to 100 points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher skill ranking". This section is incorrect. This section should read: <BR><BR>Skill values start at 0 and go up from there. The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class. Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill. Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master". <BR><BR>If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your skill. <BR><BR>p.52: The "Tiger Claw" skill is listed under "Other Skills". It should be listed under "Combat Skills" on p.51. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.7
			Appendix B - Participating in Parties
		</h2>
	
	p.76: It is stated that, "Only people of similar experience levels can join a party. A level 11 or 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30 player can't&nbsp;- even if everyone agrees to it." This information is incorrect. Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.8
			Appendix B - Before You Attack
		</h2>
	
	p.56: The bottom of this page references text color associated with "Considering" your target. The procession of text colors listed is: Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Red. The correct procession is: Green, Blue, White/Black (depending on video mode), Yellow, Red. The listed descriptions apply in that order. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.9
			Appendix B - Right Hand vs. Left Hand
		</h2>
	
	p.58: This section makes several references to separate "auto-attack" keys for the right and left hands. These functions were merged prior to the release of EverQuest, and are now controlled by a single auto-attack button (the "A" key by default). <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.10
			Appendix B - PvP: Fighting Other Players
		</h2>
	
	p.67: The second bullet-point makes reference to the "Child of Order" book. The correct name for the item is the "Tome of Order and Discord". <BR><BR>p.67: The last line reads, "If you attack another player in the city, the guards immediately attack and kill you." Please refer to the correction for p.35 above for the correct information. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.11
			Appendix B - Reclaiming Items
		</h2>
	
	p.69: This section states that you can give someone permission to loot your corpse by typing /loot followed by the player's name. The command given is incorrect. The actual command is /consent. Please read the section about <URL="DRAGCORPSES.HTML">/consent</URL> above so that you may be aware of the possible dangers associated with it. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.12
			Appendix B - Participating in Parties
		</h2>
	
	p.76: It is stated that, "Only people of similar experience levels can join a party. A level 11 or 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30 player can't - even if everyone agrees to it." This information is incorrect. Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members. As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.13
			Appendix B - Guild Halls
		</h2>
	
	p.78: "Some of the larger player-created guilds may purchase halls as well". This information is incorrect. Players may not purchase guild halls, houses, etc., in EverQuest. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.14
			Appendix B - Contacting a Game Master
		</h2>
	
	p.94: The bottom of this page makes reference to the commands of "/who Guides" and "/who GM-Admins all". Neither of these commands exist. You should use "/who gm all" to get a list of all visible GMs and Guides in game. Furthermore, the description of a Guide is incorrect. A Guide is a volunteer CS representative that serves as the first line of support for customers in game. They can assist with most issues, however will not be able to give you hints or other information that is meant to be discovered in game. <BR><BR>

	
		<h2>
			27.15
			Appendix B - Guide Program Information and Application Location
