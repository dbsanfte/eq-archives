Recently the Death Fist Clans numbers in the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting down trees and mining the rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have come in to Rivervale that the Orcs are shipping the lumber and ore to the commonlands and stockpiling it for an unknown purpose. Whatever the Deathfists agenda, their increased presence has made the thicket a more dangerous place beyond the protective wall. <P>Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to Rivervale lie mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once stood at these sites are fragments of walls that are presumed to have been constructed around the same time as the nearby ruined tower.  An ancient magical scarecrow stands at the center of one of these ruins and warns passers by that the place is cursed. It is a popular belief among the halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled walls once surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their owner and caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin and the animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the there and buried after their death by an unknown evil.<P>With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye Citadel the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has grown. These somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude Iron Ore from the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to forge weapons and armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of Runnyeye Citadel from the Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these semi-exiled goblins are being far less troublesome than they have the potential to be.<P><BR>April 5th, 3:00am<BR>------------------------------<P>** Graphics Engine Update **<P>- S3 video cards: We've worked around a shortcoming in the S3 drivers that fixes the overlapping or "cutout" looking interface graphics.<P>- All Hardware TnL cards: More optimizations and performance increases.<P><BR>- The EverQuest Team<BR>

Vanadium wrote:<P><B>What about taunt in the new cazic thule?<P>What about the complete heal bug?<P>What about the extra aggro from shaman slow?</B><P>Actually, most of that stuff has been fixed on Test.  Unfortunately we weren't able to push those code changes Live this time around because of some other errors that the code would have caused.  We're making some changes to the server architecture (including character files), and we didn't want any problems to crop up.  So a bunch of the fixes that we've got on Test didn't get to the Live servers this time around.<P>Taunt isn't, technically, broken in Cazic.  The rules for taunt in old-world zones make most of the NPCs in that zone too high level to taunt.  We'll be fiddling with that rule when we get a chance to patch code.<P>The bug with complete heal was/is related to filters.  I don't fully understand it, but we think we'll have that fixed the next time we get to patch code.<P>We plan to make changes to the way slow spells give agro.  The plan is to return them to their old aggravating levels.  But we need to gather more data before we can make the fix properly.  We weren't able to get to that before the patch.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Two items of note that were missing or wrong in the patch message that I wanted to clear up:<P>The proc on the Iksar Skyiron Cudgel of the Arisen has been fixed.  You'll need to trade ask your GM to trade you a new one for your busted version.<P><B>- Fixed a 'safe spot' in Chardok</B> - wasn't what happened.  What we fixed was the zone out of Chardok.  Zoning out should put you in the proper place in the Burning Woods now.<P>Alan<BR>

This will occur over time as zones are updated. <P>So does this affect multi-questing at all?</B><P>NPCs only return items that they dont care about.  They care about quest items for quests that they are looking for.<P>Alan<BR>
