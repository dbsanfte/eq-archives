<h1>Newspapers</h1>
	So, what do you think of the new in-game newspapers?<P>We're interested in any feedback you can give us about them.  If you're not aware of them, well, just ask around.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

I figured I'd post a few of the WOOT! posts about the newspapers.  The response to them was overwhelmingly good.<P><BR><B>The newspapers are great  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">.....<P> I was in Eurdin at the bank and brought a paper just to see what they are like.<P> Well later on I was back in the Warrens when I run into a new NPC, and low and behold I had just read about him in the paper! <P> It made the world that bit more real  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I for one will make a point of buying a paper when I goto town for now on .<P> Exxtor, Shaman &lt;Intrinsic Sence&gt;<BR> Torv.</B><P>-----<P>SmithFam wrote:<P><B>I think they are pretty neat. I'd been off EQ for about 6 months, and came back and came across "The Dwarven Mining report" or something like that. I thought it was fun because it added some perspective on what is going on in the world and it caught my attention when I realized that these weren't JUST stories, but things really going on. I actually experienced the plague going on in the Karana's, so it was fun to read about it with another character.<P>I look forward to more newspapers and maybe I'll get my name in there someday  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></B><P>-----<P><B>I LOVE the new newspapers, excellent idea.  One thing thoug, sadly I missed the first edition, does that mean I lost it for all time?  Could they be posted on the web after a given amount of time?  and no rent? is this EQ's version of recycling lol? these are things I would like to be able to hold onto and reread at a later date, if possiable make them permanent or sell back issues somewhere  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Gamwise <BR>Rodcet nife</B><P>I'll see what we can do about getting them onto the website.  They're no rent because we dont want them all over the place.  I pass mine on to the nearest person when I'm done reading it.  Back issues is an interesting idea...<P>-----<P><B>I saw a vendor I was unfamiliar with last night outside the North Freeport bank and swiftly went to investigate. <P>Much to my delight there was a copy of the Freeport newspaper. I avidly leafed through the periodical, hungry for news of the world. I was disappointed with finding neither crossword puzzle nor comics but was delighted at this innovation. I mentioned it to my guild and the overall reaction was "COOL! Where can I get one?" I think it's a great idea and a spectacular way to let people know what's going on in Norrath. It's a great segue to dynamic events and getting the word out what may be in store.<P>Mocean Tsiknus<BR>Quellious</B><P>Now that would be hilarious!  Tiny little comics in the center section of the papers!<P>Unfortunately these things are text only.<P>-----<P><B>I think the newspapers were a great idea.  As many have mentioned, following the story of everquest in-game has always been challenging.  The newspapers do in EQ what they're supposed to do in Real Life - keep the public informed of goings-on.<P>Keep it up!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Azlina Crafte &lt;Ebony Order&gt;<BR>The Nameless</B><P>-----<P>And there were a hundred more just like that!<P>Thanks for all the great comments.  It's encouraging to see that these sorts of things are well accepted.  And a few people here put in a lot of work getting them in game (not as easy as one would think) and keeping them going (I know that writing something clever on a schedule is pretty hard).  So thanks for the comments, and thanks to those on the team that made/make this happen.<P>Alan<BR>
