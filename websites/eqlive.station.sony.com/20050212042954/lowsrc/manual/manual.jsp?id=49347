		<h2>
			5.16
			Actions Window
		</h2>
	
	The Actions Window is at the
  lower right of your screen. This window has four tabs across the top (under
  the title bar). Clicking on each of these tabs (indicated by little icons -
  silhouette, hand, crossed swords and a chat bubble) will bring up a different
  group of actions. <BR><BR><EM>Main Tab</EM> (silhouette) - This tab holds buttons for six of the most
  common actions (who, invite, disband, camp, sit and run). Clicking on these
  buttons will cause the action. The Who button activates the /who function
  with no other parameters. <BR><BR><EM>Skills Tab</EM> (hand) - This tab allows you to set up buttons for your
  character's skills (such as fishing or sense heading). To do so, just
  right-click on one of the buttons and pick a skill off of the list. That
  skill will be assigned to the button, and clicking the button will now
  activate that skill. The skills listed here will include all skills, even
  combat skills. It is probably best not to assign combat skills to these
  buttons, though, as the Combat Skills Tab has buttons designated exclusively
  for combat skills. <BR><BR><EM>Combat Skills Tab</EM> (crossed swords) - This tab works just like the
  Skills Tab. Right-click on a button and pick a combat skill from the list to
  assign it to that button. Unlike the Skills Tab, the list of skills displayed
  here will only include combat skills (bind wounds, bash, kick and others). <BR><BR><EM>Socials Tab</EM> (chat bubble) - This tab gives you buttons to which you
  can assign nearly any function. There are ten banks of twelve buttons
  available. Clicking the left and right arrows cycles through the available
  button banks. The first bank contains twelve preset social macros. You can
  right click on those buttons to see how they are created and alter them if
  you wish. <BR><BR><EM>To Create Socials:</EM><BR>(1) Right-click on a button<BR>(2) This will bring up the social creation window<BR>(3) Click on the Name area and type in a name for the social<BR>(4) If you wish, choose a color for the name (the name will appear on the
  button)<BR>(5) Type in the text for the social (often referred to as a macro) - a social
  macro can contain any of the / commands available in the game. <BR><BR>For example, you might want to create a social that waves at your target,
  says hello to them, and then invites them to join your group. <BR><BR>(1) Name the social Invite.<BR>(2) Click on the green A to turn the text of the name green (color coding
  your socials can be useful).<BR>(3) In the text boxes below the name and the text color choices, type the
  following, each on its own line: <BR><BR>/wave<BR>/say Hello %t, how are you this fine day?<BR>/invite <BR><BR>As long as you have a valid target (and you're close enough), clicking on
  this Invite social button will cause all of those actions to take place. <BR><BR><EM>Tool Tip: Pointing at many of the buttons in this window will tell you
  what the keyboard shortcuts are for the various actions.</EM>
