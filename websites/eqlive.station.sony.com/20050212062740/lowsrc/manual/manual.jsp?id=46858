			19.4
			Creating a Player Guild
		</h2>
	
	<P>If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are
  looking for, you may create your own guild. In order to establish your guild,
  you must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who
  wish to form this guild.</P>  <P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> You can also use the
  new web-based&nbsp;<A HREF="../../../../../guild_requests/intro_view.jsp">Guild
  Application System</A> to submit a guild creation request or&nbsp;to
  view&nbsp;existing guild requests.<BR><BR><EM>The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for your
  guild:</EM> <BR><BR>1. The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server
  and issue the <STRONG>#makeguild</STRONG> command. This will create a private guild
  channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel,
  although this name can be edited later during the creation process. (You can
  also use the <A HREF="../../../../../guild_requests/intro_view.jsp">Guild
  Application System</A>&nbsp;to make a request or view previous requests.)<BR><BR>2. After the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the
  members of his guild into the channel. To do this, he needs to tell the guild
  members the name of the channel and the password for access. <BR><BR>3. Once 10 or more members are in the channel, they need to issue the <STRONG>#approveguild</STRONG>  command. The guild leader can then issue the <STRONG>#makeguild</STRONG> command. This
  will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. <BR><BR>4. In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of
  the guild's charter. This summary should focus on the guild's role in Norrath
  and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild
  need not be included. You may also edit your guild's name in this screen.
  Once completed, hit <STRONG>Finish</STRONG> and the guild will be submitted for
  approval. It's important that you double-check the spelling of the guild name
  because it could be approved with submitted spelling and then could be very
  hard to change. <BR><BR>5. The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating
  the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for
  revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button.
  Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of
  the guild creation screen. The guild leader can edit the charter and the
  guild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for
  approval. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> If the leader is only viewing the revisions
  needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH, the guild
  will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter
  the guild creation/edit screen. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> If your guild is listed as
  Initial Approval, it is not fully approved yet. Please do not petition on
  server to have your guild created at this point. <BR><BR>6. If the name and charter are approved, the guild leader will be notified
  via email that the guild is ready to be created. <STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> Please
  verify that your email is correct in our registration information by: A)
  Going to &quot;Account&quot; B) Then going to &quot;Change Account&quot; C)
  Then going to &quot;Edit Registration&quot; from the login screen. <EM>NOTE:
  It is important that you have the correct email address listed, or you will
  not get your approval letter promptly.</EM> <BR><BR>7. After the guild leader has received notification via email that the guild
  has been approved, it is his/her responsibility to petition and meet a GM to
  complete the guild creation process. Only the Creator needs to be present for
  creation.<BR><BR>For fastest service, try to petition between 2PM and 10PM PST. If this is not
  possible, you may either petition and allow a Guide to assist you further or
  locate and request the assistance of the Chat GM. </P>
