	<STRONG>[Defaults]</STRONG> <BR><BR>This section contains general information regarding client setup. Items are listed
  here alphabetically, they may not appear in this order in the .ini file. The
  order of their appearance in the file is inconsequential to their function. <BR><BR><STRONG>AttackOnAssist</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want &quot;autoattack&quot; to be automatically
  turned on after issuing the /assist command in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChannelAutoJoin</STRONG> = [channel-list] <BR><BR>Joins you to the listed chat channels when you log in. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChatFontSize</STRONG> = [0-5] <BR><BR>This line controls the size of the text font in your chat window. Default is
  0. When using full screen mode with higher resolutions, it is helpful to set
  this value to 2 or higher, depending on your taste, eyesight, and reading
  comprehension ability. <BR><BR><STRONG>ChatLineSpacing</STRONG> = [0-2] <BR><BR>This line controls the number of spaces between each line of text in your
  chat window. Default is 0. It is not suggested putting this value over 2, or
  it could be very difficult to read text as it scrolls by. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideBuffWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-B function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your buff icons and icons of
  spells cast upon you will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in
  game by hitting Alt-B. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideChatWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-C function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your chat text will not show up.
  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-C. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideHotboxWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-H function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that the six pages of hotkeys will not show
  up. You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-H. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideMainMenuWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-M function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your main menu window with your
  abilities, socials, combat abilities, etc., will not show up. You can easily
  get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-M. <BR><BR><STRONG>HidePartyWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-P function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your group members hit point bar
  and names will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in game by
  hitting Alt-P. <BR><BR><STRONG>HidePlayerWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-Y function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your character name, hit point
  bar, mana bar and stamina bar will not show up. You can easily get it to show
  again in game by hitting Alt-Y. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideSpellsWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-S function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your spells gems (to hit to cast
  spell with mouse) will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in
  game by hitting Alt-S. <BR><BR><STRONG>HideTargetWin</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as the Alt-T function in game. If this statement
  is set to TRUE, than the window that shows target's name and hit point bar
  will not show up. You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting
  Alt-T. <BR><BR><STRONG>InspectOthers</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This line set to TRUE allows you to inspect others. If set to FALSE, you will
  not be able to right-click on their character to inspect. The default value
  is TRUE. <BR><BR><STRONG>InvWinLabels</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This is a Velious only line that enables the labeling to show up when in the
  full screen inventory mode. <BR><BR><STRONG>LastCharSel</STRONG> = [1-8] <BR><BR>This line controls which character is selected at the character select
  screen, so that whichever character you played last will be selected when you
  go to the character select screen the next time you play EverQuest. <BR><BR><STRONG>LoadArmor17</STRONG> through <STRONG>LoadArmor23</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE (Velious Only) <BR><BR>Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with
  Velious into your video card's texture memory. Players with older video cards
  may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you experiencing
  slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in areas with
  many textures. <BR><BR>By default, these are all set to &quot;FALSE&quot;, as it is possible that
  those with lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all
  of the new armor files. At your option, you can switch all or part of them to
  &quot;TRUE&quot; to see the new armor. If you have problems with framerate or
  disk swapping, turn all or part of them back to &quot;FALSE&quot;. <BR><BR>As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries
  if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless
  you are. <BR><BR><STRONG>LockWindows</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This statement is the same as hitting Alt-L in game. This allows windows to
  be rearranged with your cursor if FALSE and locked in place if set to TRUE.
  You can very easily do this in game with using the Alt-L function to toggle
  the lock off/on. <BR><BR><STRONG>Log</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets the default state of chat logging to the log file for your character and
  server. Setting this option to true would have the same effect as logging
  into the game and typing &quot;/log on&quot; at the beginning of every play
  session. <BR><BR><STRONG>MousePointerSpeedMod</STRONG> = [0-3] <BR><BR>This is to allow faster movement across the screen by your mouse. The higher
  the number, the faster the mouse scrolling will be. Default is 0. It is not
  suggested to set this to higher than 3, as it makes it difficult to
  accurately control the mouse movement. <BR><BR><STRONG>RunMode</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want to automatically &quot;run&quot; when you log
  into the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ScreenMode</STRONG> = NORMAL or FULL <BR><BR>Sets the default screen mode for when you enter the game. <BR><BR><STRONG>ServerFilter</STRONG> = [0-1] <BR><BR>0=No, 1=Yes. If this line is set to 1, than Server side filtering is
  occurring. Default is 0. If you are having problems with lag in a raid
  situation, or when many other players are in the same general area in
  EverQuest, it is best to have this set to 1. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowDynamicLights</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Setting this line to TRUE enables the player to see special graphics due to
  light sources on your character such as torches, greater lightstones, in a
  new light so to speak. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowInspectMessage</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>Sets whether or not you want the &quot;CharacterName is inspecting you&quot;
  message to be displayed when you are inspected by another character. <BR><BR><STRONG>ShowSpellEffects</STRONG> = [0-1] <BR><BR>0=No, 1=Yes. This line allows particle effects to be shown if it equals 1. If
  this line equals 0, no particle effects will be seen in-game when someone
  casts a spell. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackFilterType</STRONG> = [0] <BR><BR>This is another Ranger only line that is best changed in-game. The command in
  game allows you to specify not showing certain conning creatures. Default is
  0. Please refer to the section later in this manual dealing with all of the
  /commands to see the proper use of this in game. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackPlayers</STRONG> = [TRUE/GROUP/FALSE] <BR><BR>This line shows the current selection (Default is TRUE) for showing players
  in tracking, not showing players, or only group members. It is suggested to
  change this setting in game to change this value. <BR><BR><STRONG>TrackSortType</STRONG> = [Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider] <BR><BR>This is a Ranger only ability and is best changed in game. It changes the way
  that tracking is sorted, and how it shows up. <BR><BR><STRONG>UseD3DtextureCompression</STRONG> = TRUE or FALSE <BR><BR>This line turns on/off texture compression. If set to TRUE, it can add much
  time loading to the game between the server select and character select
  screens, but can also improve performance. <BR><BR><STRONG>VideoMode</STRONG> = [0-4] <BR><BR>0 is 640/480 resolution, 1 is 800/600. 2 is 1024/768. 3 is 1280/1024. 4 is
  1600/1200. Players need to have the Velious expansion in order to set this line
  to 3 or 4. <BR><BR><STRONG>VideoModeBitsPerPixel</STRONG> = [16/32] <BR><BR>This line reflects and controls the video mode while in EverQuest. Default is
  16 bits. It is suggested that most players keep this value at 16 as
  increasing to 32 can cause a decrease of performance.
