			25.4
			The /report Command
		</h2>
	
	The /report command instructs your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is "/report CharacterName", however the true function of the command sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window. <BR><BR>To properly use this command, use <B><I>Shift-PgUp</I></B> to scroll until the suspect text is in the chat window, then type "/report CharacterName". You should then file a "/petition" (see Contacting a <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?handle=supgm">Game Master</A>), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation of what the /report is meant to show. <BR><BR>
