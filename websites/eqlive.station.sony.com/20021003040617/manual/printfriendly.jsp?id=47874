	p.69: This section states that you can give someone permission to loot your corpse by typing /loot followed by the player's name. The command given is incorrect. The actual command is /consent. Please read the section about <URL="DRAGCORPSES.HTML">/consent</URL> above so that you may be aware of the possible dangers associated with it. <BR><BR>
