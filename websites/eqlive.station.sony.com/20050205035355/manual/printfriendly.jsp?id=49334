			Scrolling through windows (Working with Windows)
		</h2>
	
	A few windows, such as chat
  windows, have scroll bars on the right side that allow you to scroll through
  text or options. You can click the down or up arrows at the top and bottom of
  the scroll bar to scroll the text up or down incrementally. You can also
  click on the bar itself to scroll in larger increments. Or you can click and
  drag the scroll bar up or down. <BR><BR>Players with a wheel mouse can use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down in
  these windows as well.
