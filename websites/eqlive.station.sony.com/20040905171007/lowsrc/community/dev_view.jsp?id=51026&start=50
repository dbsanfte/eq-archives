<h1>Ring of Fire</h1>
	Here's a note about the Ring of Fire from one of our lead designers:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>I was cruising the boards and read some responses to the recent changes to one of the events in Acrylia, thought I'd take a minute and dispel a rumor. I hope the author of this post doesn't mind me using it.<P><I>Did RoF last night and man did they nerf it! From 4th boss till 5th boss the skele's that pop all do AE complete heal. We had about 40 peeps there and got owned twice. Never even made it to the 5th boss.</I><P>After the fourth boss the mobs that spawned were level 2, this was a result of a bug, and fixing it brought the mobs up to the appropriate level. There is a chance that a healer will spawn, but there are none that can cast AE heals. <P>I apologize for the bug having slipped past us.<P>Thanks for playing,<P>Steve Burke<BR>Lead Designer, EverQuest Content<BR>Sony Online Entertainment, Inc<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks Steve.<P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

<B>You may want to look into this then. Our guild did this the other night, and we got wiped twice in a row from the mobs AE healing(CHing) not sure which but the message was distinct that you knew it was an AE heal of some sort.<P>you would see like 6 or more depending on how many mobs was up message like this: A possessed corpse feels Vigrous(speeling)<P>Thanks<BR>Ianan</B><P>Well, they do AoE healing.  And they do Complete Heal.  But they do not do AoE Complete Heal.<P>I just wanted to clear that up.  You'll see a ton of message about certain NPCs (misspelled or not...) feeling better, but you'll only see single instances of NPCs being completely healed.  It's a fine difference, I know.<P>Alan<BR>

Megumi_ wrote:<P><B>Hiya,<P>Whats bothering most people about this is the fact that the mobs are no longer stunnable. We would have to clear 22-30 mobs at once during certain points of the ring trigger. During the 5th-6th wave. (Normally losing a handful of people in the process) This is no longer obtainable by even the highest Guilds on EVERY server. I am in the highest guild on my server, which is probably in the top 10 most powerful guilds in game. If the highest people in game cant get to the 6th boss anymore because of this nerf, then how does sony expect the average guild to come in and make attempts at this?<P>Atleast b4 you made the adds unstunnable, a normal-average guild could come in and get to the 4th boss.. sometimes even the 5th. NOW, only the 2 best guilds on my server even have a chance at making it to number 5. And at 5 we're normally wiped out. <P>This was a great idea to create something like this... However I really think you need to rethink the recent patch and possibly remove the resist these mobs have against enchanters stun.. If we have to bring in an additional 20-30 melee to tank adds we will. But this will only cause us to send in /bug reports saying the zone doesnt have the capacity for this little obsticle sony has created....<P>Please rethink what youve done, RoF used to be fun.. now it just sucks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/frown.gif"></B><P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>The level of the mobs at this stage does make them very difficult to manage. This was intentional. I have personally participated as a player in the event both before and after the bug fix. It is still very possible for a good force of players to get to the fifth boss of the encounter, and as players become more powerful through alternate advancement abilities and equipment they may indeed make it farther. <P>As for smaller raid forces, there are some rewards for making it to the fourth boss that veteran players would be happy with. <P>The encounter is now as difficult as it was designed to be after the fourth boss. The treasure available past that point is commensurate with the difficulty, and the ability for players to obtain it very frequently makes it necessary to require a solid force of players.<P>If time permits, I may place a few waves in between these stages to make the progression more granular. This would have the side effect of taking longer to get to the toughest encounters. <P>As always, I am open to ideas. Feel free to email me any well thought out suggestions. <P>Thanks!<P>Steve Burke<BR>Lead Designer, EverQuest Content<BR>Sony Online Entertainment, Inc<BR>sburke@soe.sony.com<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>And since Steve is brave enough to offer up his email address, I urge you to please keep your comments concise and clear.  And if you're not sure that your comment is something for Steve specifically, please send it to the Dev Corner and I'll see that the right person gets it.  Steve has plenty of stuff to do as it is.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR>

<hr>

Just passing on a comment from Steve.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><P>Thank you all for the feedback regarding the Ring of Fire event. As there was simply not time to respond to each of you directly I chose to post here to update you all.<P>I've settled on some specific changes that address many of the concerns that have been expressed. These changes are being tested now and should go live with the next patch. After testing the new changes for yourselves, feel free to email me with comments.<P>Take care,<P>Steve Burke<BR>Lead Designer, Content<BR>Sony online Entertainment<BR>sburke@soe.sony.com<P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Thanks Steve!<P>Alan<BR>
