			13.7
			Casting a Spell
		</h2>
	
	<EM>To cast a spell:</EM> <BR><BR>* Click on a target (spells that only affect the caster do not require a
  target).<BR>* Left-click the icon that represents the memorized spell you wish to cast.<BR>* Wait for the casting timer to expire and the spell gem to brighten up, then
  cast again if needed.<BR><BR>When you cast a spell, a time gauge shows up indicating how long it's going
  to take to cast that spell. If someone hits you or you take a step, casting
  may be interrupted. Improving your Channeling skill helps you recover from
  these situations. <BR><BR>All spells are linked directly to certain skills - Abjuration, Alteration,
  Conjuration, Divination or Evocation. The better you are at that skill, the
  better the chance your spell has of succeeding. If your casting fails, you'll
  see a message in the text display indicating that your spell
  &quot;fizzled.&quot; Failed spells still consume mana, but don't produce any
  effects. Even if your casting is successful, your opponent may be able to
  resist that spell. Generally, higher-level characters are better at resisting
  spells cast by lower-level characters. <BR><BR><EM>Note: If someone casts a spell on you, a message appears in your text
  display. In some cases, a spell icon displays in your 'buff' box. Right-click
  and hold on the spell icon to find out the name of the spell.</EM>
