			Picking Up/Dropping/Destroying Items
		</h2>
	
	You can pick up items you
  find, and by the same token, you can drop items you don't want (especially if
  the item might be useful to someone else). Some items can't be dropped,
  traded or sold - if you really don't want it, you may opt to destroy the
  item. Occasionally, you may even run across items on the ground in the form
  of a small, brown bag. <BR><BR><STRONG>To give away/drop/destroy an item:</STRONG> <BR><BR>* Open your inventory (<STRONG><EM>i</EM></STRONG>).<BR>* Click on the item (it &quot;floats&quot; on the cursor).<BR><BR>* <EM>To drop it</EM>, click anywhere in your front view where there is no
  player character or non-player character. The ground is a good choice here.<BR><BR>* <EM>To give it to someone</EM>, click on that person. This will open the
  Trade window. Just click <STRONG>Trade</STRONG> to give them the item (the person
  receiving your gift will also have to click Trade to complete the trade, so
  don't run off until the trade is completed).<BR><BR>* <EM>To destroy it</EM>, click <STRONG>Destroy</STRONG>.<BR><EM>Note: Once you destroy an item, it is gone. Make sure you really want to
  destroy the item (and that you have the correct item) before clicking
