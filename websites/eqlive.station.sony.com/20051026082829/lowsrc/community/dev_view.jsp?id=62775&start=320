<h1>Robert Pfister on the Next EverQuest Update</h1>
	<P>Dear Friends,</P>  <P>I wanted to pass along a quick update and let&nbsp;you know that
  we're&nbsp;shifting the July 8 update back a week to July 14.&nbsp; As you
  know from reading posts from Brenlo or playing on our Test Server, this
  update is quite extensive.&nbsp; This update will include several community
  requested features, quite a few bug fixes, and some back-end changes that,
  while invisible to you, will help us immensely in the future.&nbsp; These
  continuing community driven changes will help us to maintain a healthy game
  and to re-affirm to you, our customers and fans, that we do value your input
  and, when appropriate, enhance the game based upon your suggestions.&nbsp;</P>  <P>As part of our ongoing plan to provide you with the best possible play
  experience, we've looked at the testing that went on over the last several
  weeks and determined that these changes should spend another week or so on
  the Test Server.&nbsp; When we update, we want to be sure that the update
  enhances your play experience; pushing code too quickly doesn't do
  that.&nbsp; I know that many of you are eager for the changes you've read
  about or played on Test, however, I guarantee that the extra week will be well
  worth your wait.&nbsp; If you simply cannot wait to experience these changes,
  please feel free to join us on the Test Server.&nbsp; As always, your
  feedback is not only appreciated, but considered one of the things that
  continues to make this game so great!</P>  <P>Thanks again for your support and for you patience.</P>  <P><BR>Robert Pfister<BR>Executive Producer<BR>EverQuest</P>
