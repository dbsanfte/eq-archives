  Spells Window).<BR>* Click on a spell scroll in your inventory (to view a scroll's information,
  right-click on it).<BR>* Click on a free slot in your spell book to scribe the spell.<BR><BR>The timer gauge (at the bottom of the spell book) appears, measuring how long
  it takes to scribe the spell. You only need to do this step once for any
  spell. Once it's recorded, it's permanently in your book. <BR><BR>Now, memorize the spell by adding it to a spell gem slot (you must do this
  before you can cast it):<BR><BR>* Click on the picture of the learned spell in your spell book. A
  rock-colored gem appears on your cursor.<BR>* Click on one of the octagonal spell gems in your Spells Window to the left
  of your spell book.<BR>* The timer gauge measuring how long it takes to memorize the spell. When you
  have memorized it, the gem turns colored.<BR><BR>You can memorize up to eight spells at any one time. To &quot;forget&quot; a
  spell (remove its gem), right-click on its gem slot. You can then memorize a
  different spell in the free slot (if you can't remember which spell gem goes
  with which spell, hold down the alt key).
