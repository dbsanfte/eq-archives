	<h2>Cross Server Chat - An Unannounced Feature</h2>
	
	<P>EQ Technical Director, Scott Hartsman, answered questions from the community about an unannounced feature that was included with the July 24th patch.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes - Cross Server chat is something that was done intentionally - At no small amount of work for both our development and ops teams, for that matter.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The reason that it wasn't announced is because in order to allow this, we had to change around the chat systems quite a bit. We needed a few days of measuring what would happen with existing channel chat under the new arrangement as a proof of concept.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>If that blew up before anyone was chatting globally, we'd have known that we had more work to do. :)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The other reason that it wasn't advertised yet -- As it stands, people have the ability to spam (and in some cases, are spamming) cross-server without any of the standard in-game repercussions.&nbsp; (i.e. If you're a jerk: I won't group with you, my guild won't help you, etc.)&nbsp; That definitely wasn't part of the plan, and we'd hoped to have that addressed before it was released.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Over the next few days, we'll be adding more controls that allow people to keep their channels and private messages local to their servers, among other things.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Best,<BR>&nbsp;<BR>- Scott</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thanks for filling us in Scott!</P>
