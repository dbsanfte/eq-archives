			25.4
			The /report Command
		</h2>
	
	The /report command instructs
  your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest
  servers for logging. The purpose of this command is to create a record of any
  text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the
  EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement. The usage of
  this command in game is a little bit misleading. The syntax of the command is
  &quot;/report CharacterName&quot;, however the true function of the command
  sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window. <BR><BR>To properly use this command, use <STRONG><EM>Shift-PgUp</EM></STRONG> to scroll until
  the suspect text is in the chat window, then type &quot;/report
  CharacterName&quot;. You should then file a &quot;/petition&quot; (see
  Contacting a <A HREF="../../../../../manual/manual.jsp%3fhandle=supgm">Game
  Master</A>), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation
  of what the /report is meant to show.
