		</h2>
	
	<STRONG>Guild Commands:</STRONG> <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildsay &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> or <STRONG>/gu &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> -
  Sends a text message to all fellow guild members currently on-line. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildinvite [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this
  command to invite new guild members. In order to make an officer, the guild
  leader must use the following command: /guildinvite o &lt;playername&gt;. You
  can also just have the player targeted and type /guildinvite o. You must be
  in the same zone as the player you want to invite into the guild. The letter
  o must be lower cased. If the player you want to make an officer is currently
  in the guild, they will have to /guildremove themselves (with themselves
  targeted) , in order to be made an officer through this command. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildremove [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this
  command to remove guild members. Keep in mind that if you target yourself
  when executing this command, you will remove yourself from the guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guilddelete</STRONG> - Guild Leaders may use this command to disband a their
  guild. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildstatus [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> or <STRONG>&lt;<EM>character name</EM>&gt;</STRONG>  Will return the guild status of the targeted or named character (their rank
  within their guild, if any). This command will only work on characters within
  the same zone. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildleader [<EM>target</EM>]</STRONG> - Transfers guild leadership status to
  the targeted guild officer.. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildwar &lt;<EM>guild leader name</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>number</EM>&gt;</STRONG> -
  Allows the guild leader to challenge or accept another guild in guild war.
  Both parameters are necessary, and both guild leaders must execute the
  command. The number is the number of days that the guild war will last, from
  1 to 14. All members of a guild at war with another guild are PvP with each
  other for the duration of the guild war. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildpeace &lt;<EM>guild leader name</EM>&gt;</STRONG>- Allows the guild leader
  to end a guild war. Both guild leaders must execute this command to end the
  war. Guild war will end in any case after the time limit has passed. <BR><BR><STRONG>/guildmotd &lt;<EM>text</EM>&gt;</STRONG> - Officers of a guilds can specify the
  text to show up after the regular server MOTD (Message of the Day) for each
  of their guild members when they log in. The guild message of the day will
  always be preceded by the name of the guild officer that set it up. There is a
  maximum of around 200 characters for this guild motd. Any new guild message
  of the day overwrites the last guild message of the day. When a server goes
  down, all guild messages of the day will be deleted and will need to be
  reset. There is no other way to delete a guild message of the day.
