<h2>Kwill of PlanetEQ, A Community Leader Interview</h2>
<P><IMG src="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/kwill1.jpg" align=right>Not only is Kwill Heartfyre the site director for <A href="http://www.planeteq.com/">PlanetEQ</A>, she is also an office manager and horse trainer. Rumor has it that she also adores halflings. (Ok, Mennix started that rumor so it may not be completely true.) </P>
<P>Get to know more about Kwill and PlanetEQ in this latest installment of Community Leader interviews. </P>
<P><STRONG>Ok, let's get to know you. Who are you, and what do you do for PlanetEQ? Single? Like halflings?</STRONG> </P>
<P>I am Kwill Heartfyre, and I am the site director for PlanetEQ. I work for GameSpy, which has many "Planet" sites. I have been working for GameSpy for one year now, and was a volunteer on the site for one year before that. We have a general site and sites for two EQ servers, Cazic Thule and Ayonae Ro, which include server specific information. </P>
<P>I am not single, much to the disappointment of lots of men out there (hehe), and I do like halflings, but just as friends! </P>
<P>I can't play EverQuest as much as I would like to anymore, but I have two characters over 50 and some others that I have made to try out the different classes. </P>
<P><STRONG>What sets PlanetEQ apart from other EQ sites?</STRONG> </P>
<P>I think what sets PlanetEQ apart from the other sites is we are very tuned into the players. We have EQ information but also editorials, polls, pictures of the day sent in by players and an art gallery. </P>
<P>I want a visit to PlanetEQ to be an ever-changing experience where players can come and share their EQ experiences with other players, whether that be through a screenshot, artwork, or reading something interesting. </P>
<P>Another significant thing that sets PlanetEQ apart from the other fan sites is it is directed by a woman. I am a woman in real life, and I think my gender and perspective on life comes through on the site. It is not geared toward women, per se, but my presence on the site makes a space for women gamers in a mostly male-oriented genre. The site itself is extremely well designed, and has a very elegant look to it, which I can thank GameSpy for. I have a definite style of writing, with a dry sense of humor, and I think that also comes through on the general news and tone of the website. I want readers to hear my voice in the writing, but also feel that they get fair and thorough coverage of news and events concerning EQ. </P>
<P>Our server sites go even further into the player experience, with guild news published every week from guilds listed on the website, and player pictures. We maintain an active community presence for both Cazic Thule and Ayonae Ro. </P>
<P>We also host EQ related sites, so the multi-level dimensions of the site makes it a gateway to other users and features. </P>
<P><STRONG>Any new features planned for the site?</STRONG> </P>
<P>I am always open to suggestions for new features, most of which are suggested by players. The art gallery always has new artists. </P>
<P>The last new feature I added was a role-playing dictionary I wrote for those people who were interested in the back-story of EverQuest, which was hard to piece together sometimes. </P>
<P><STRONG>If you weren't running things at PlanetEQ, what would you be doing instead?</STRONG> </P>
<P>Well, when I am not running PlanetEQ, I am managing an office at a major University or I am out riding one of my horses. One of my other projects is taking thoroughbred racehorses that are done racing and training them to do another job as a riding horse. My latest acquisition is a thoroughbred named Speedy, who was definitely not! His last race, he was actually in front, then realized that he left all his pals behind, so he nickered and let them all catch up. That was the end of Speedy's racing career. </P>
<P><STRONG>Ok, now that you've admitted that you LOVE halflings, you can't stop thinking about them, what's your funniest EQ moment?</STRONG> </P>
<P>I have had many funny moments, most involving miss-tells of one kind or another, but this is my favorite moment, back when I first began playing: </P>
<P>When I was just a very young magician, back in fall of 1999, I was hunting orcs in Greater Faydark. I must have been level 10 or something. As you recall, the spell gems for summoning things were all the same at that time. I was sorely overmatched by those orc centurions, and they had just killed off my pet. Never a quitter, I shot off another pet summoning spell, hoping I could get the spell off and live to see another day. The spell went off...and I was holding a loaf of summoned bread in my hand! Needless to say, they weren't going to be bludgeoned to death with a loaf of bread...I am sure they enjoyed eating my offering over my corpse. Taught me to organize my spell slots, too! </P>
<P><STRONG>If you could pick any playable or non-playable character class and race, what would you pick that reflects the real life you? Why?</STRONG> </P>
<P>Actually, the high elf really does suit me very well. I am a small person in stature, and I like to think that the elves like to give some thought to things in the world. The new model of Kwill with the brown hair looks surprisingly like me, actually (except for the ears). </P>
<P><STRONG>Thanks, Kwill!</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now that you got to know a little bit about Kwill, hop over to <A href="http://www.planeteq.com/">PlanetEQ</A> and check out all the hard work she has put into the site. </P>
<P><STRONG>-Mennix</STRONG></P>
