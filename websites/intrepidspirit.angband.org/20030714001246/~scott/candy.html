I heard that Seth and Adrian Tomine were gonna come to Atlanta and do a
signing at one of my favorite stores--Criminal Records. I was a huge fan
of Seth and I'd loved what I'd seen of Adrian's work. Unfortunately, I
hadn't seen much of it because it always seemed to be sold out in the
stores.<br>
I didn't want to be just another face in the crowd and say "Hey guys, I
love your work." I wanted to give them something so that they might
remember Atlantans as being nice people.<br>
I found a statue of what appeared to be Linus from <i>Peanuts</i> at a
thrift store, and I thought it would make a great present for Seth. While
I had an idea of what Seth liked I wasn't too sure about Adrian because I
hadn't read any of his autobiographical stuff. I decided to give him some
candy that my mom makes--pretzels with peanuts, coated in white
chocolate.<br>
The day of the signing I went in feeling all weird because here were two
of my heroes in the place where I come in once a week. I got in line and
when it was my turn I gave them the goods.<br>
They both thanked me and I got a mini-sketchbook by both of them signed.
Seth drew a great picture on the inside
cover of Palookaville #5 for me
and I bought a copy of Adrian's "32 Stories" which he signed for me too. I
left feeling all special and everything.<br>
That night I started to read "32 Stories". I was really impressed with it.
I felt good until I got to the "Allergic" story. I flipped out. all of a
sudden, I started saying ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod, etc. How was I to know
that Adrian was deathly allergic to peanuts?<br>
I didn't know what to do, and my mom tried to to make me calm down but it
didn't work. I went to bed early, and got up the next morning still
feeling like a wreck. I knew that Seth and Adrian were gonna be staying
with the owner of Criminal Records while they were here so I called the
place up. When I told him that I gave Adrian the bad candy he told me not
to worry because they had tested the candy before he ate it. I was
relieved, but then I had these notions running through my head that he
would probably think I was some crazy fan out to kill him, so I wrote him
a big letter explaining the entire situation. He wrote
back a couple of
months ago and told me that everything was cool.
