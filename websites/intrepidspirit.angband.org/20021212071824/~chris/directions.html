<center><h1>Directions to the Ghetto</h1></center>
<h2>The Geeky Way</h2>
The ghetto lies at North 34.02127, West 84.25690 at an elevation of 1075
feet.  The above coordinates have a margin of error of +/- 14 feet, so
people beaming or using teleport should be aware.
<p>
<h2>The Boring Way</h2>
As everybody will live south...
<p>
Take GA 400 North until exit 9. When you exit 400, head east ( right )
along Haynes Bridge Road for about 3.5 miles.  When Haynes Bridge Road
terminates at Old Alabama Road, you will need to turn left onto Old
Alabama (if you continue straight, you will go into a subdivision).  At
this intersection there will be a BP and Publix on the left.
<p>
After you turn left onto Old Alabama, go straight through 2 lights.  You
will pass a large church (St. Bridget's Catholic Church) on the right,
just before the 3rd light.  Turn right into the Preston Oaks subdivision
at the 3rd light.  To clarify, the first light is at a firestation, the
second light is at Brumbelow Road ( or something like that ), and the 3rd
one is my light.
<p>
After entering the ghetto subdivision, take the third left, and follow it
until it terminates in a cul-de-sac.  My place is the one directly
opposite the road, number 475.
