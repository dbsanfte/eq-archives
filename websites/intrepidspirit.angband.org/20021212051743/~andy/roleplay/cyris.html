<h3>Cyris Sureshot</h3>

<h4>"Let's be rational. I'm certain a mutually agreeable solution exists.
It is merely
a matter of time before we find it."</h4>

<h4>(shaking head) "Crazy humans. No wonder we're losing the war."</h4>

<h4>"This ring's magic is... putrid. I'm not going to defile my art with
its evil."</h4>

<P>Cyris Sureshot was a Lorinesti fighter/mage. He excelled at archery,
although his true talent lied in illusions. A common tactic was to "summon"
illusionary gold dragons and use them to literally frighten the enemy to
death with their vicious attacks and breath weapons. Cyris's Art grew to
encompass a variety of dark, shadowy magics; <I>summon shadow, shadow/demi-
shadow monsters, shadow walk,</i> and another favorite, <i>Justinius's
Black Tentacles</i>. His reasoning followed along these lines: "If you use
spells that have a quasi-substantial appearance but physical effects,
illusionary spells, which are reknown for their quasi-substantial
appearance, will be harder to disbelieve."</p>

<p>Cyris was the son of a Lorinesti diplomat and followed in his father's
footsteps, attempting to reunite the isolationist elven kingdoms with both
each other and the other races. He was well on the road to success when a
hidden evil fell upon the land and began splintering the forces of good. 
But, on the eve of the downfall of good, Cyris was approached by an unexpected
friend. Using his waning talents one last time, he crafted a powerful
illusion that provided Good what it needed most: one more chance.</p>
