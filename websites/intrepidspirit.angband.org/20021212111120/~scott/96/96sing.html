<center><h2>Best Singles (Alphabetically)</center></h2>
1. <b>20 Miles-<i>Ragged Backyard Classics</i> Triple 7" (In The
Red)</b>-Judah Bauer and his brother kick out the jams, covering some old
blues standards and writing some originals. Really good, earthy stuff.
Kill Blues Traveler.<br>
2. <b>Flap-"Smash & Grab World" b/w "Styromania" (Fat Boy)</b>- digging
back into the vaults on this release, this was originally done at about
the same time I was getting interested in this band. 2 sides of
unbelievable acoustic playing, this might sound like a jam session between
Flatt & Scruggs and Zoot Horn Rollo. I guess.<br>
3. <b>Phono-Comb-"The Crass & The Switchblade" b/w "Anarchy at the O.K." &
"53rd & 3rd" (Quarterstick)</b>-spaghetti westerns a go-go. A band that
has a surf background, yet they didn't get a Gregory Niccoll blowjob?
What's up with that?<br>
4. <b>Pineal Ventana-<i>Let Them Fuck</i> EP</b>-I'm counting this as a
single, even though it's almost 30 minutes long. Rock assault on side 1, a
journey into improv on side 2 that will hypnotize you if you stare at the
vinyl revolving around the turntable. Artwork of the year, no contest.<br>
