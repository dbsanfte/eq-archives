<h2><center>5 Best Albums (alphabetically)</center></h2><br>
1. <b>Clobber-<I>Crash Course In Humility</I> (Half Baked)</b>-there are
some bands int his city that project pure energy. Some bands control it
and fluctuate between thought and expression, but others just release a
wall of excitement. Clobber is one of the latter (not saying that thought
doesn’t come into it), and they do it better than anyone else in the city
(or perhaps out of it, for that matter). I could try to name the
highlights of this CD, but it would be hard (at first I thought  "Silence"
and "Recovery Epidemic", but then I thought, "Hey, what about "Great
Crusade"? And "New Year" sounds better than ever", etc.), so let me just
say that the whole dang thing rox, OK? I hope that made things clear.<br>
2. <b>Seely-<I>Parentha See</I> (Third Eye) or <I>Julie Only</I> (Too
Pure), take your pick</b>-for being a relatively young  band, they put out
a pair of great CDs. Personally, I  think I’m inclined to <I>Julie
Only</I>, if only because it throws in 2 more songs. Steven and Joy really
blend together on 
vocals, Lori plays flawlessly (it’s kinda the same way I had been playing
guitar, only about a billion times better, so I’ve gotta think of
something else now), and Eric is the perfect drummer for this band,
providing the jazzy accompaniment and rocky(?) force when needed.
Hooray!<br>
3. <b>The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion-<I>Now I Got Worry</I>
(Matador)</b>-the best introduction of the year, no doubt. While it’s no
<I>Extra Width</I>, it’s still the best party album of the year. I defy
anyone not to lose it while "Wail", "Love All Of Me", "R.L. Got Soul", or
"Get Over Here" is on, and the mere fact alone that Rufus Thomas is on
this album immediately catapults it to near-classic (and once you’ve heard
"Chicken Dog", you can drop the prefix). This is probably what Pussy
Galore would have sounded like if Jon had put Steve Cropper in the group,
so I’m sure the band is proud of this one. BLUES EXPLOSION!!!!
(ironically, that’s not said one time on this album if I remember
correctly).<br>
4. <b>Stereolab-<I>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</I> (Elektra)</b>-I really don’t
know how the band’s going to top themselves on this one. From getting
funky ("Metronomic Underground") to making the perfect pop song ("Cybele’s
Reverie") to rocking out ("The Noise Of Carpet") to transcending into the
realm that only they have dominion over (the title track), Stereolab
proved that they don’t mess around. As I’ve said before, this band is one
of the primary reasons. I’m taking French.<br>
5. <b>Tortoise-<I>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</I> (Thrill
Jockey)</b>-the classiest indie rock (ugh) release this year. Tortoise may
have that "cooler than you" thing going, but don’t hold that against them,
because they’re not pretentious ( or at least they don’t sound like it).
42 minutes of sheer beauty, but most notable for the opening "Djed",
clocking in at 23 minutes. Covering musical ground from ambient to jazz to
avant-garde to dub, this band is at once simple and complex. And that’s no
oxymoron.<br><br>
