<b>Cats for Queens</b>

The puppies all pretty, bald and blinded, like
hideous creatures of an aborted mother; she sat
down holding her splitting gut, hours without
amusement, in clinic setting, fucking sterile
fucking depraved - no shells are saved. Time
passes on the cat clock. Sanity kept by tuning
her organs, percussion in a heart beat, drumming
as the pale white children are cut open on
"clean" metal tables. They pry into, tease inside
inside of you they steal your soul. Rapists
started the trend, all females should learn
to defend and not just let all things be. Cats for
queens, and prevention for our kind.

Doctor, oh Doctor I love to see those mutilated
forms, the bodies stripped down and
remade even better than before.
I see sequences moving, I see the
mothers grooming the extracted foetus',
and I know ( in a lie ) that this is pure,
that this holy - heavenly endorsed.

I know in my heart that this is right.

Repeat, again and again: I know in my heart -
that this is right.

In a real mirror I know it's depraved.

Cats for queens, all lost puppies,
but what is there for me?
