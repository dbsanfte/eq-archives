<h2>The Story</h2>
So, here is the sitch, y0!  Round about the end of August, 2k2, there was an
article on <a href=http://www.slashdot.org target=_parent>slashdot</a>
about using Bayesian probability to filter email, so that the filter would
learn over time.  So this d00d, <a href=http://www.paulgraham.com
target=_parent>Paul Graham</a> ( who is known for something like LISP ),
published <a href=http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html target=_parent>diese
article here.</a>  Like a lot of peeps, I got to thinking how this was a
very cool idea.  So, I done bust out the C++ compiler to have a go at it.  
<p>
Well, according to some d00d named Gary Robinson, Paul's approach isn't
really Bayesian in nature, but by the time Gary published <a

target=_parent> this</a>, the first Lena had been in operation for a few
weeks with very good results.  It don't matter to da' Jesus anyway, I've
added to my pseudo-Bayesian model a Normal PDF model ( or at least a
selector for engine in v0.01e+ ).

The name Lena is a play off of Lina.  For more info on Lina, check out
