<p>Andrew skimmed through the morning traffic, the dew on his spokes
glinting in the early sun.  It had been days sine he felt her presence,
and he wasn't about to let her escape before getting in a few shots.  So
what if he missed the calculus lecture... he was doing good enough to afford
skipping a few classes.  Especially for a chance to see her again.
<p>He felt her to the right, about two blocks away.  Judging from the
clutter of minds (human) surrounding her, she was apparently on the
sidewalk.  His heart raced (No wonder.  Don't bike enough as I should. And
this camera is awfully heavy.) as he sped his ten speed sharply around the
corner.
<p>As he closed in on her, a wave of jitteryness (not again) washed over
him.  He grinned madly, the words of several campy songs flooding through
his head, as his fingers trembled against the handlebars.  Another minute,
and she'd be in sight! (Yahooo!!!)
<p>As he dismounted, he squinted through the dense cloud, letting his
physical and mental sight overlay.  No, she wasn't in sight yet.  With a
deep sigh and a slumping of shoulders, he trudged forward, oblivious to
the crowd.
<p>(What if she's flown away?)
<p>(No you idiot, she didn't fly away. She's still there.)
<p>(Well, she did last time.)
<p>(No, she's still there... WAIT! WHAT IF ITS A TRAP?!?)
<p>Andrew jerked his head up in shock at the realization.  (Why's everyone
staring oddly at me? Was I thinking aloud again?)  As he realized she was
less than a block away (on this street!), he slowed, giving himself time
to calm and compose himself.  He glanced downcast at his feet.  Yet
another reverie flashed into his mind.
<p>(What if it -is- a trap? She'll kill me. Or at least try.  Make my flesh
melt. Oooooh, kinda cool.)
<p>(No, she won't kill you.  Besides, how could she know you're here?)
<p>(Well, shes a mutant.  I know she's there, so she may know I'm here.)
<p>(True. Remember the Fantastic Four . . . .)
<p>Andrew shuddered hard, unknowningly drawing a reaction from those
around him.  Trailing an invisible Fantastic Four through the streets of
New York was -not- one of his smartest moves.  (How could -I- know the guy
in the funky outfit was following me? All I wanted was an autograph.   And
maybe a picture....  Hmmm... Or maybe membership... we could have been the
Fantastic Five, warping to distant galaxies, battling evil and oppression
wherever - )
<p>Andrew woke from his daydream when his bike slammed into a blue mail
deposit box. He chided himself, forcing the goofy grin of his face as he
look up to where he was going.
<p>Panic blazed through his mind as he looked up.  (She's there!  SHE'S
RIGHT THERE!!!)  Sure enough, the woman he had been following was within
two arms-lengths of him!  He froze in awe.
<p>She was looking into a clothing store window, regarding a turquoise
dress almost as delicate as she.  Her features were soft and gentle, with
the sun dancing across her rose lips and tanned skin.  Her brown hair,
dyed with a white stripe, fluidly fell down the nape of her neck and
spilled onto the back of her bomber jacket.
<p>Andrew sighed and closed his eyes, drinking in her majesty with his
Radar Sense.  She was indeed a mutant, and a powerful one at that.  An
endless reserve of strength and energy seemed to reinforce her every
movement, no matter how insignificant.  He sensed  a pristine glamour no
human eyes could ever see.
<p>(Hey! Youre not breathing!)
<p>Andrews eyes snapped open as he greedily gulped down air.  Much to his
fear, the woman turned away from the window and curiously watched him.
<p>(Quick! Ask her out!)
<p>(Catch your breath first!)
<p>(Now's your chance!  Say something witty!)
<p>(No, look away! She won't notice... give you time to think.)
<p>(A one liner! Like, 'hey... nice sun'. No, that won't do)
<p>(OH MY GOD SHES WALKING TOWARD YOU! Run away RUN AWAY!!!)
<p>Andrew trembled and offered a faltering grin to the woman.  He
half-waved, eyes darting about nervously and neck twisting frantically. 
After mumbling unintelligibly, he leaped atop his bike and hurriedly sped
away.
