<h1><center>THE PHOENIX RISES FROM THE ASHES: UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S IN
SEASON<br>
or<br>
THE CYNIC'S "GUIDE" TO ATLANTA<br></center></h1>


…so I'm supposed to write a piece on Atlanta, Georgia, US of A. Basically,
giving a quote-unquote tour of the city, explaining facts about the place,
the attitudes of the people that shape it, and the output of our creative
society. Well, it would seem that I could be able of pulling this off.
After all, I've lived in town (Or more truthfully, the heinous suburbs)
for all of my 22 years, excepting the previous 4 where I actually lived in
the middle of the city attending school. And while I'm no Warholian about
town by any means, I do know some decent places to go, and I've seen quite
a few local artistic types (almost predominantly musicians). So why is it
hard for me to think of anything to say about this town? I guess it's
because it's hard to be a tour guide when you're not wholeheartedly
enthusiastic about what it is you're supposed to support. I think of it in
terms of that poor guy who has to do that lame-ass shtick on the Jungle
Boat ride at Disneyworld (oh great, I mentioned Disney, now I'm gonna get
sued). I mean, you know those people have to hate their lives. It may be
fun to be outside all day sailing around on one of those little mechanized
boats, but after having to tell all of those stupid stupid jokes with
krautrockian precision, I would imagine 1 of 2 things would happen: 1) the
person gets brainwashed and spends the rest of his/her existence with a
Disneyfied synthetic smile (well, if I'm going to piss them off, I may as
well go all the way), or 2) the person, in an insane rage, shoves some
tourist's head into the mechanical alligator's mouth. Not pretty either
way, from my standpoint. And that's exactly what Atlanta is. Sure, there's
some great stuff that goes on here, but it tends to be overshadowed by
something else. Atlanta seems to be enshrouded in hypocrisy. We're one of
the cultural centers of the Southeast, yet we're also hopelessly redneck.
The 1996 Olympics proved the handling of my hometown. Sydney-ans and
fellow Australians, prepare to get stereotyped beyond yr farthest beliefs,
even more than what was done by Crocodile Dundee and Outback Steakhouses
(although I do have to admit that I like Foster's and Olivia Newton-John
used to turn me on when I was 7 years old). When the opening ceremonies
started, the appearance of even Muhammad Ali was downplayed to my friends
and me by that "How Ya'll Doin'?" proclamation that was spelled out by one
of those marching bands. And then after the bombings, we were angry
rednecks. Hmm, the rest of the world though, perhaps those people aren't
right, genetically. Maybe there was a lesson to be learned from
Deliverance, after all! It was archetypes such as the above that made me
determined to lose my southern accent when I was 16. Not that I had much
of one to begin with, but it just struck me as an expression of idiocy.
I've since learned from some people (possibly misguided-at least I hope
so) that a slight southern drawl can be enticing to members of the
opposite sex outside of said region. Dammit, another blown opportunity!
Why must I be so determined in my goals?
     Of course, that's the obvious complaint thrown about around here.
There are worse offenses, in my eyes. I think Atlanta is very tame for
being a city the size it is (about 2 or 3 million). I'll speak musically,
since it's what I can talk about. Most people in this city seem to praise
mediocrity, which cannot help but have an impact on the scene. The local
press for the most part focuses on one genre of music as a specialty and
refuses to check out anything else. Thus, you can't really read anything
of merit by our papers (an exception being the monthly "Stomp & Stammer",
which predominantly covers "big" acts (implying Cat Power, Stereolab,
Kristin Hersh, etc.) but also features local news). Clubs, for their part,
are also pretty lame. A few of the good venues are strictly 21+, and most
of them are 18 and up, leaving a scare few that are all ages (and most of
those suck). The ones that do allow everyone are usually
punk/hardcore/metal/ska clubs, which don't really open minds up that much.
The Masquerade, probably the most notorious club in town, is virtually
always tyke-friendly and I saw many a life-affirming show there in my
formative years (Yo La Tengo, Sebadoh, the Blues Explosion, and "Weird Al"
Yankovic, to whom I lost my concert virginity), but the place has the most
horrible sound in the world due to the fact that a dance club is situated
underneath the live band area, which is why most of the aforementioned
bands won't play there anymore (Lou Barlow once said that he was going to
stop his show and go downstairs and dance to "Another One Bites The Dust":
Pavement got the crowd to elicit cheers once when Spiral Stairs vowed they
wouldn't play there again). Of those clubs enthusiastic to cook kids, as
well as respecting the boundaries of music, the Variety Playhouse does
good for the clout of the city, bringing in everyone from Bob Mould to
Marc Ribot's new Cuban outfit (Ribot being the demigod from the Tom
Waits/Lounge Lizards albums), from country wunderkind Junior Brown to
everyone's favorite eccentric Crispin Glover, from Patti Smith to John
Zorn's Masada. There are no really crazy shows here, like indie rockers or
really out-there jazz, but the diversity far eclipses other venues around.
However, most people in this town don't give a damn about diversity. They
know what they like, and that's what they want. That's what really sucks
about Atlanta: people don't want to go out on a limb that much. And most
of the artists/musicians around town who do great work usually split for
New York or Chicago for that very reason.
     That being said, there are still some good things that this city has,
though. We get a pretty decent run of movies around here, and we have some
video stores that stock really great obscure films. There are lots of nice
cheap places to eat, and you can usually get some good finds in the thrift
stores and record shops around town. And we have an unusual amount of
radio stations that play good music. If I may do some self-promotion for a
second, I work at WREK FM, which devotes itself to the kind of music you
don't normally hear over the airwaves, in most genres. You can actually
hear us over the web at http://www.gatech.edu/wrek thanks to RealAudio,
and if you cross your fingers you may even hear me! Oh, lucky you! And,
you know, it may seem unlikely but once in a while you can meet some
friendly people around this town, as well. The only thing that's really
bad is the lack of local comix and zines, which is basically nil. But then
again, it sounds to me like that's sweeping the USA. Yep, this country's
gone to hell…
     In closing, I thought I'd remark on the pretentious title of this.
The symbol of Atlanta is the phoenix, which is in regards to our city
being burned to the ground in a war about 130 years ago (you know, that
whole Gone With The Wind bullshit). That's all well and good, but to me it
seems like the complacent citizens have clipped its wings. We have the
potential to be a fun and interesting place, one worth writing a guide to
for a publication in another country even, but we tend to be overruled by
the Joe Sixpack mentality. Who's to say, maybe things will change for the
better. I'd like to think so, at least. Well, this really isn't a tour of
Atlanta, now is it? Just some kid waxing about he likes and what pisses
him off. How unusual for a zine contribution, huh? Of course, seeing as
how this is going out to a different hemisphere than the one I live in, I
didn't think anybody would really care where the best burrito joint is
located. Of course, if I'm wrong, just let me know and I'll be sure to
clue you in. But for now, "Touch Of Evil" is on TV and I want to watch the
rest of it, so ciao!
