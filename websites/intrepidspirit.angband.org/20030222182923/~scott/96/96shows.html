<h2><center>7 Best Shows (Chronologically)</h2></center>
1. <b>Half Baked Records Showcase With BOB, Pineal Ventana, and Clobber
(February 9 at Criminal Records)</b>- the first beautiful, warm day of
1996 as well, which made things that much better. Holli, her friend Mark,
and I arrived to see the last 10 or 15 minutes of Clobber, who was
followed by PV and then closing with the best palindrome in rock (yeah,
better than Abba). Everyone sounded very inspired, and I think it could
have been each band's performance of the year (at least for the shows I
went to). And since it was at Criminal, I was able to buy my comics(which
was when Schizo #2 came out). An added bonus!<br>
2. <b>WREK Benefit With the Gold Sparkle Band, Seely, Zen Pusher Gasoline,
and the hal al Shedad (May 3 at BLTs)</b>-a great, eclectic evening. The
hal al Shedad (much better than Car Vs. Driver in my opinion) laying down
the punk foundation, Zen Pusher Gasoline providing the industrial noise in
one of their rare appearances, Seely calming everything down though not
being calm, only to be closed out by the supremely beautiful sounds of
GSB. This is the last time I saw the "classic" lineup, and what a fitting
way to go out. It just makes me want to run down and sign up to become an
op.<br>
3. <b>Tortoise, The Sea And Cake, and 5ive Style (May 8 at the Cotton
Club)</b>-what a strang night. I never got advance tickets to this show,
so I tried to win tickets off the radio. I called WREK and WRAS the day
before, to find out the WREK had gotten rid of their extra tickets, and
WRAS gave them away when I needed to be at my Accounting test, but I tried
to win anyway. I didn't, and I was late for the exam. The day of the show,
The Sea And Cake were supposed to be in the WRAS studios, so I ran across
campus from my statics class to try to get tickets, but the band never
showed up. I flipped the dial and heard John Herndon from Tortoise being
interviewed at WREK. I rabidly dialed the number, but alas and alack. I
was also upset that nobody wanted to go to the show with me, no matter how
much I tried to bribe them. After a long story of having to stand in line
3 times to get in, I missed most of 5ive Style's set. The Sea And Cake
sounded good, but I just don't like the singer that much. Tortoise,
though, completely lived up to my expectations. I got up next to the
vibraphones, and I was in ecstasy for about an hour and a half. Playing
some of my favorites off of their two albums, but not afraid to
experiment, it was an unbelievable show. Afterwards, I walked back to
school with the scary Shoeman until we got to the Midtown Marta, upon
which I ran my butt off. But it was worth it.<br>
4. <b>The Rock*A*Teens, Seely, and Tractor Hips (June 1 at the
Point)</b>-Before we went to this show, Amy, Holli, and I saw "Toy Story"
out on Buford Highway, which was great. As for the show itself, Tractor
Hips were an interesting Polvo-ish band from Chapel Hill, and Seely was
alright though this was not one of their best shows (they did get signed
to Too Pure at this one, however), but the Rock*A*Teens were amazing. I
know that the band was hyped from the onset as being an Atlanta
supergroup, but they are undeniably great now.While the first album
perplexed me a little (good songs, but I didn't really care for the
production), I think the next CD will be classic. When you can hear songs
one time and they are as memorable 6 months laster as your favorite album,
you know you've got it. And they do. And this show proved it.<br>
5. <b>Masada (November 11 at the Variety Playhouse)</b>-quite possibly THE
show of the year. I saw Zorn for the first time last year when Amy and I
headed to Chattanooga for Incus Week, but this was to be the first time
I've seen him with his most popular band. For about 2 hours, they had the
Variety completely hypnotized, as there was no real crowd noise or
anything. The band absolutely wailed, plahing everything from Klezmer to
improv to straight-up bop. Unbelievable.<br>
6. <b>Melt Banana and Pineal Ventana (November 19 at Dottie's)</b>-I was
really excited about this one. PV showed me that they still sound as great
as they did with the new line-up (if the Half Baked show wasn't their
best, then this was), and the awesome Melt Banana totally ruled. If anyone
tells you this is a one song band, then tell them to go to hell. An awe
inspiring show, with each song interrupted by their sweet selves telling
us to call our friends in New Orleans to tell them to see Melt Banana when
they play tomorrow night. And the best Rolling Stones cover I've ever
heard. Rock and roll, I tell you.<br>
7. <b>The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Atari Teenage Riot (December 7
at the 40 Watt Club, Athens)</b>-I was jazzed about this one, too. ATR
nearly blew out my ear, which sucked, although they weren't bad. I jsut
learned that I <i>really</i> need earplugs. When the JSBX came on, though,
nothing else mattered. They were good when they started with "Water Main"
and "Chicken Dog", but as the set progressed, they became the masters of
rock that everybody already knows them to be. The show focused mostly on
the new album (only 1 song from <i>Extra Width</i>), but they totally
convinced me with "Wail" and a truly funky "Fuck Shit Up", but the
highlight was the manic "Flavor". Words can't do justice.<br>
