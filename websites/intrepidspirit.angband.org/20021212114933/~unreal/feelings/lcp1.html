<b>Free</b>

Free for you
Wish we were friends though
You I can never forget
You I opened up for
Free with you
All falls from mouth for you,
for me
Exploration, phobias, biases
Free for you
Different chair, different self
many of me
traveling to combine, melt as one
Free for you
Black to gold
hole to canyon
flowing hidden lies, my secrets
unearthed for me, you
spinning, flipping
my words twist to drop out into the open.
