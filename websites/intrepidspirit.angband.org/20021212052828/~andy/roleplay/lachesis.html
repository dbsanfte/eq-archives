"Have I ever killed a man? No. (produces monowhip) Would you like the
honor of being first?"
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps you can escape me. Perhaps you can even escape my spirits. But
tell me.... do you honestly think you can escape the Night?"

<P>
"Your magic is strong, but my spirits are stronger."

<H3>Gaming Notes</H3>
<P>
Lachesis Windwalk is by far the most popular and enjoyable character
I've played. When creating her, I was looking for a smooth, dangerous
woman, someone you would <B>not</B> want to trifle with.  
</P>
<P>
I found two people to serve as a basis for her personality. The first
was Carmen Sandiego.  As you can see above, Lachesis's physical appearance
more closely resembles that of Carmen. Like Carmen, Lachesis is hauntingly
charismatic, stealthy, cunning, and very, very subtle. Lach's pulled
off more heists than I can remember, and each one was with perfect
professionality.
</P>
<P>
The second character serving as a "role model", if you will, is the
title character of "La Femme Nikita", a French movie that was remade
in America as "Point of No Return."  The title character of this movie
is a young street punk who is taken by the government and trained to be
a top-notch assassin.  Lachesis shares Nikita's edge, her restlessness, and
most importantly, her ruthfulness.  Owl is a powerful friend, but a cruel
huntress.
</P>
<P>
Lachesis represents the more feral and sinister nature of Owl. Lach
is horrifically terrible to her enemies, going as far as to destroy
everything (and everyone) they cherish and love before dealing them 
their Fate.
The changes brought upon her by the Awakening changed her life; once a
peaceful child who loved nothing more than to bask in her sunny garden
and read Greek mythology, she was twisted by Owl into a creature of the night,
a remorseless predator doomed to forever haunt Seattle's streets. Now,
she feels the edges of the street, hears the calling of her Mistress,
and drinks the nightlife.

<H4>Lachesis's Views on her Teammates</H4>
<P>Prime Time - "I wonder why he has tainted himself with artificial implants,
especially since he is fortunate enough to have been blessed with the Kiss
of the Art. A "physical adept", as my hermetic brethen are apt to label
him, he excells at combative warfare... pistols, swords, SMGs - he's
mastered them all. But beneath his cold exterior is a boyish charm, an
eagerness to live life to its fullest and show off his brawn at every
opportunity... and a few secrets that remain so even to me."
</P>
<P>Phil Gates - "A techno-wizard, a Matrix slider that manipulates numbers
almost as well as I manipulate mana. He's by far one of the best;
otherwise, I
wouldn't run with him. But his heart is too big - he's bound by such
chivalric notions as respect and kindness. Fortunately, what he lacks in
coldness he makes up for in talent and tech."
</P>
<P>Thunder - "This elven swordsman met us in Europe... was lost at a bus
terminal and stumbled into us. He's good with weapons, although he's quite
particular over his arsenal. A wide range of the more exotic weapons at his
disposal... narcojets, tasers, sniper rifles, sliverguns... come to think
of it, I do not believe he's ever relied upon a simple pistol or hand gun.
His unusual quietness and the peculiar circumstances about our meeting him has
caused some of our team to question his motives. But not me... I am aware of
his minor deception, and I am privy to his intentions. Now is time to wait...
wait, and watch."
</P>
<P>BloodBath - "A misguided hermetic that has plagued his body with filthy
cyberware. He is strong in the Art, though, and effective with his
spirits.  Very flashy, he stylizes himself as the music world's next Ricco
Waveblast... his novahot wailing on the synthguitar can be annoying, but at
least it calms him - and makes his magic all the more potent."
