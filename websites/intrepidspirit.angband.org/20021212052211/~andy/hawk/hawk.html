<h2><center>This page is dedicated to PSI-FORCE, the greatest comic
ever!</h2></center>
<P><center><img src="psiforce.gif"></img></center>
<P>Above is the cover of Psi-Force's first issue.  The comic is a story of
five runaway teens forced to band together and use their powers against
their intended exploitation by the Powers that Be.</p>
<P>The mid-80s teens composing Psi-Force are:
<br>Michael "Creepy" Crawley: Nerdling capable of making things explode,
but lacking aim
<br>Kathy Ling: Hip 'Princess' who hates her powers and hanging out with
the out crowd
<br>Wayne Tucker: Rebelious Telepath, unwanting leader of the group
<br>Tyrone Jessup: Astral Projecting super Jock
<br>Stacey Inyushin: Russian Healer with a heart of gold</p>
<P>The teens found that if they concentrate on the medallion given to them
by their mentor Hawk (who gathered them together), a creature known as
Psi-Hawk comes into being.  The ever mysterious Psi-Hawk is an almagram of
their powers magnified to an extraordinary degree.  Below are a few
pictures of Psi-Hawk!
