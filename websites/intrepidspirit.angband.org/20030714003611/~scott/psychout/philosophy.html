[disclaimer: i'm too lazy to use capital letters on my philosophy--just
wanted to state that...]<br><br>
<b>psych-out</b> is a show that covers everything i like about
psychedelia. of course, can you really define what's truly
"psychedelic"? its an adjective that gets thrown all over the place to
describe so many types of music that some may argue the genre title to be
virtually worthless. i mean, everything from jefferson airplane to the
orb, dr. john to acid mothers temple, pierre henry to the brian jonestown
massacre, etc. so i say the show is psychedelic, but i guess the more
objective viewpoint is "psychedelic as defined by scott watkins." but that
would be an even worse genre title...<br><br>
so what do i like? well, in homage to one of my favorite "groups", nurse
with wound, i created a <a href="thelist.html">list</a> of groups that i
consider to be the epitomes (epitomi?) of psychedelia. the list is by no
means complete, but its what came off the top of my head when i started
this woefully-under-construction site. i hope the show displays an
interest in the subsets of acid folk, drone, krautrock, psych-pop,
experimental, and just plain ol' for-lack-of-better-terms psychedelic rock
and roll.<br><br>
the majority of people inevitably associate psychedelic music with the
sounds of the 60s, san francisco to be particular. i'll have to be honest
with you--i really don't care much for san francisco music. jefferson
airplane had their moments, moby grape disappointed me when i first heard
them (although i like skip spence's <i>oar</i> album a good deal), i never
went through a dead phase, etc. not that i abhor it--i like what i've
heard of quicksilver, for example. but if that solely constitutes
someone's idea of psychedelic, then they're sadly not going to get their
fix with me. but on the other hand, there are other shows on atlanta radio
(and indeed, other shows on wrek) that cater to this particular
fetish...<br><br>
and maybe i should state something about myself--i'm 26 years old (as of
feb 15, 2002, at least). so i'm not on a nostalgic trip on my show (i'm
making my own nostalgia right now), which might make my show slightly
irreverent--my sanfran comments above probably testify to that. hell, i
don't even take psychedelic (or any) drugs. maybe that seems like a
hypocrisy to some, but i like people who take musical risks, no matter
what their pharmaceutical intake is. <br><br>
but with respect to all of the above, i don't think any of that should
imply a lack of quality on my show. i hate to say these kind of things
because it makes me sound like i'm kissing my own ass, but i think this
show is quite good--of course, i really love the music. and i may not be
much of an authority on west-coast psych, but i think i'm competent enough
on my other interests, or at least no worse than anybody else attempting a
psych show in atlanta, ga (lofty words)...i guess you can take a look at
my playlists or tune in to my most recent broadcast and formulate your own
opinions...<br><br>
<b>origin of the show</b><br><br>
i'm a cd/record collector, not for profit (actually, its made me pretty
broke) but just because i really love music (but who doesn't, i
suppose...). i've worked at wrek since 1997, and i spent all of my time
prior to july 2001 as a normal op/dj who plays whats in rotation. i had no
specialty show, besides my occasional "sunday specials" (2-hour shows on
wrek that feature a different theme every week--i've done sunday specials
on sun ra, thrift store music, old gold records,
sex/violence/drugs/rock'n'roll, yo la tengo, krautrock, syd barrett, and
new york minimalism, and maybe some others i can't recall) and sporadic
guest-host stints on "stonehenge", wrek's obscure-classic-rock show. (in
fact, i'm guest-hosting stonehenge while i type this, so i need to
go--i'll pick up where this leaves off...)
