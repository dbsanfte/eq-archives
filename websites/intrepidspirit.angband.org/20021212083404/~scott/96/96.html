I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that ’96 was many things to many
people. It was a slightly interesting year for me. I spent a lot of money
had my longest break from school ever, and saw dogs having sex for the
first time. Please don’t make me tell that story. I was going to have a
movie section for what was good this year, but I can’t remember the films
I saw (and since I usually saw them at cheap places, they may have come
out last year, anyway). The worst movie was <I>Twister</I>, by the way.
Musically, some good albums came out, but I spent a lot of money on old
albums and reissues. Singles were a little depressing, as not many came
out. Or maybe they did and I just wasn’t lookig
in the  
right places. The
same goes for comics. I got interested in some titles I had missed out on
before, but nothing earth-changing was released with a few exceptions.
Well, enough introductions. Check it out!<br>
