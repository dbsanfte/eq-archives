<a href="http://escape.angband.org/abahph/" target="_top"><b>A Boy And His Pet Heart</b></a><br>
The Heart is a sub-site of Curiosity's Escape, and is run by my good friend iAn.  It all started
when we discovered shoutcast.  Within half an hour, iAn was able to broadcast his own radiostation
over the internet.  He called his station A Boy and His Pet Heart.  Go visit the Heart for some really
good music!

Xander is one of the best writers on the web, if you ask me.  Her stories hit really close to home

really work with the stories very well.  Well, I guess you should go see for yourself :).<br><br>
