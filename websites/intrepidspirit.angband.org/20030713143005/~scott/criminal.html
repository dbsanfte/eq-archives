<h1><center>The Record That Changed My Life</h1></center>
<br>
<i>(This is Lillian at Criminal's introduction to me as it appeared in the
second issue of Criminal's newsletter):</i><b>Scott Watkins is the grand
prize winner of the contest in the first newsletter because he tried to
change the world for the better by informing people that the band Live
sucks. As you may or may not have witnessed for yourself, he's still got a
lot of work ahead of him. For his efforts, Scott won the gift certificate,
a Pavement nitelite, the new Sloan LP, the new Bettie Serveert CD, some
shoelaces and a bunch of other CDs that he really liked.</b><br>
There have been many records that have altered the way I think, but
perhaps the most recent one to achieve this goal was the sophomore release
from Live. Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking, and while I
can't say that I've heard the album in its entirety, much less bought the
damn thing, its contents have  become as much a part of me as the scars on
my face.<br>
Let's set the clocks back to the fall of 1994. It was a hectic time for me
as I was entering the college lifestyle. I had this virginal image about
my new environment, of psycho-beatniks totally hip to the scene, people
who would prove to me that I knew jack-shit about music. I suppose my
expectations were a little, shall we say, grandiose. Musically, it was
still par for the course.<br>
So where does Live come into this? Well, this happened around the time
that <i>Throwing Copper</i> was released. I remember when Live's first
album came out the critics at <i>Rolling Stone</i> were going crazy over
them, and I just wondered "Why?" Now, the boys were back with more of the
same and it bothered me. After I saw their video, I was even more
sickened. Not only was the band under the  mistaken impression that their
lyrics were earth-shattering, but they thought they actually rocked as
well! I declared Live the worst band in America, and I spent much of my
time convincing others of this fact (it wasn't hard).<br>
It was at this point, though, that the album proved its twisted
immortality to me. Georgia Tech announced that Live was coming to the
Alexander Memorial Coliseum, and suddenly every (and I do mean every)
dumbass fratboy-jock was wearing a truly satanic t-shirt commemorating the
horrid event. It was like I was in a giant Chick tract about the end of
the world. And everyone started playing the album. Nonstop. True, at this
point I was playing the then new Orange <i>(by the fabulous and non-sucky
Blues Explosion--Lillian)</i> at least once a day literally, but at least
you were only forced to listen to it in my vicinity. Live loomed over our
campus like some sort of musical virus (did you ever see <i>The Stand</i>?
It was a lot like that), weakening our musical immunities for unoriginal
crap until we were ripe for the picking.<br>
So how did <i>Throwing Copper</i> change me? It confirmed my worst fears,
that 99.2% of the US population really sucks when it comes to making
musical decisions. It also raised my self-esteem in the same regard,
convincing me that I might actually have good taste. Of course, that
theory flies out the window when people find out that I'm a fan of, say,
"Weird Al" Yankovic. But who cares?<br>
In closing, I know that I could have easily written about an album that
truly inspired me (for example: Sonic Youth's <i>Sister</i>, Yo La Tengo's
<i>Painful</i>, Tom Waits' <i>Rain Dogs</i>, Bob's <i>Complex Organism
Blues</i>, DQE's <i>Hershymouth</i>, <i>"Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D</i>,
etc.) but I just wanted to show that a bad record can change your life
just as much as a good one, if not more.<br>
