<b>"Bedlam"</b>

"To live with burning hands isn't easy..."
   -Eugenio DeAndrade-

Sure
you know me.

I am
(THAT girl) perched
in drowsy classrooms cranky
as a sticky clutch and hungry
for a salty
jawline or better yet
a pucker-your-mouth-and-shiver
flash of eloquence.

(so you're a poet) Why
do you say that like I hang out
on street corner begging, "burden
on society -- will work for
aMusement!" (but what
will you DO)?

I will be a Pacific pearl, a hoyden
with rabid hair driving black-rusted trucks
barefoot and singing Aida
with the windows down.

I will EAT CAKE, starve
for tattoos, laundry money, and Brooklyn bagels,
stomp around in my sister's black bootcamp
boots and bark at passersby. People
may say that I am one of THOSE GIRLS
(my mother would die -- she
raised us on the, "Don't speak
until you're spoken to" diet) but yes, I am
the DeepEllum-FrenchQuarter-GreenwhichVillage FREAK
of nature-loving, black-clad, tea
drinking Dallas-NewOrleans-NewYorker applauding
every streetcorner's shrieker of poetry
with saline kick-ass eyes
and a rotten poker face.

I am neither pure nor Puritan, but I am
clean as a river pre-Pocohontas - that is, I
taste of raindrops splashed on granite outcroppings
and I have long out-tumbled my double-decade warranty
and come home enriched.

Sure you know me.

Paint a portrait - make it
a starry Van Gogh (I love
Van Gogh) - slap
on a frame and stick it
in a padded room. Then when
I am having high tea
with earthworms and maggots,
pull out your palace of misconceptions,
crawl in, and bolt the doors behind you.
(if it were me) I'd break
a couple windows -- but then,

as you know,

I was born for bedlam.
