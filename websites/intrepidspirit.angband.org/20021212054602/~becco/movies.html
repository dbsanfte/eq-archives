<H1>My favorite movies</H1>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Any of the original three <I>Star Wars</I> movies: Han Solo is the
coolest
guy ever!!!!
<LI>The <I>Indiana Jones</I> trilogy (although I hear there will be more,
which
would be fabulous, as long as both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are in
it!)
<LI><I>Swing Kids</I>: Awesome dance scene, cute guys, great
music. :) Swing Heil!
<LI><I>Harold and Maude</I>I am proud to say that I saw this movie when I
was a kid- I am not just a follower of the Something about Mary crowd. My
sister and Dad made me watch it and I think it is an awesome movie. Big
bonus: the soundtrack is by one of my favorite musicians- Cat
Stevens. (Listened to him when I was a kid).
<LI><I>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</I>: I think one of the most fun scenes in
any movie is the parade scene. :)
<LI><I>Shawshank Redemption</I>: it makes me cry every time. Extremely
powerful. WOW.
<LI><I>Some Kind Of Wonderful</I>: Definitely my favorite in high school,
<LI><I>Swingers</I>: THis movie is MONEY!
<LI><I>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</I>: awesome movie.
<LI><I>Sliding Doors</I>: a) I like Gwyneth Paltrow b) What an awesome
idea for a movie!!!
<LI><I>Liar Liar</I>: I like Jim Carrey. I like this movie. I want to
kidnap the
kid and adopt him- SO CUTE!
<LI><I>The Matrix</I>: I was in a haze (movie hangover, as one friend
calls it) for a few hours after I saw it.
Cool effects. And Keanu's cheesy acting wasn't as obvious as in other
films. 
<LI> This list is BY NO MEANS finished. These are the first ones to come
to
mind.
