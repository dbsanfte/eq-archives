<b>Flowers</b>

Wither'd riseing, and arose dyeing,
Thriving, striving, living by abiding.
Sorely alive trembling, resembling
Like cold water glistening in the sun.
Completely devoted, arisen and spoken
Words in such rhyme, never broken.
Absence present, parting is pleasant,
Embers burn till wind has won,
Water thrown, air left torn.
Pawned unreachable goals
For few attempts had ever showed,
All failed and untold by the sober soul.
Shattered left scattered upon the floor,
Pieces of me lay lonely like desert rain,
Left only to feel such wide-spread pain.
Flown, by blown to land unknown,
By water by wind let all life begin.
Blooming and soothing,
The wind has sweet smell
From the flowers of earth here to swell.
