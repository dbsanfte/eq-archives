<font size=+2><center><u>On Art and Artists</u></font></center><br><br>
<font size=+1>
Okay, this one's been a long time coming.  It occurred to me a few 
months ago, and unfortunately, I don't remember what brought it
about.<br><br>
I've always had an appreciation for artists, and, like so many others with
an analytical mind, art is an area in which I feel mostly<sup>[1]</sup>
inept.  I think my inability to express myself artisticly only gives me a
greater appreciation for those who can, much in the same way my more
artistic friends marvel at the calculations I can do in my head.
<br><br>
I've made a few attempts at learning to play an instrument.  First was the
Viola in 4th Grade, but when I found out that the Junior High orchestra
was graded on how much they practiced, I stopped before it became an
issue.  Next was, like so many my age, learning to play guitar.  I took
lessons for a year or so, but eventually stopped those as well.  Finally,
during High School, I started to learn to play the bass.  I was actually
pretty good at it, but after taking a summer off, I just never picked it
back up.<br><br>
One of the most discouraging aspects of learning an art, at least for me,
is the lack of any event or accomplishment confirming your status as an
artist.  When I went to school to become an engineer, I knew that after I
graduated I could, in good conscience, call myself an engineer.  This
isn't the case with most artists.  Artists, for the most part, determine
for themselves when they are ready to be considered artists.  In my
opinion, this leads to a few problems:
<ul><li>Some people (myself included) are discouraged by a goals whose
progress can't be easily measured.  It's like climbing a mountain when you
can only see a limited distance above and below you.  You don't know how
far you've come. and you have no idea how much further it is that you need
to go.  In a world where we schedule <i>EVERYTHING</i>, how do you
schedule a variable number of years to learn to play the piano?
<li>As the end of learning process is determined by the student, this
leads to some people declaring they are ready before they truly 
are.  These are the people who sing in a crowd, but probably shouldn't
even be singing in the shower or while they're driving alone in their car.
<li>On the other side of the previous point, you have people who always
consider themselves a student, regardless of their accomplishments or
skill, and as such are reluctant to share their art.</ul>
What it really comes down to, in my opinion, is confidence.  A confident
person is more likely to produce art than someone who is lacking
confidence.  Additionally, I feel confident people are also more likely to
produce art before they are ready.  Thus, confidence can sometimes be used
to convince an audience that an artist is skilled when he or she is truly
lacking any skill.  Consider the painter who is so convinced of his genius
that he simply dismisses any criticism as the product of a lack of
understanding of his work.  In this way, confidence is used as
false-skill, and this practice can be seen in any number of art
forms.<br><br>
Another aspect of art is that it's value is determined mainly by its
audience.  A friendly audience is more likely to place a higher value on
the work, and thus the work is considered to be good until a larger
audience negates this effect.  A perfect example of this is when a band
releases a new album that is considerably sub-par.  A considerable portion
of that band's fans (usually a majority) will be quite accepting, and
remain blind to the fact that it is actually sub-par.  This is the
phenomenon responsible for talentless pop-artists and artists whose work
isn't appreciated in their time.  The critics, and sometimes the larger
audience, assign a value to a work which isn't representative of the
artist's skill, creating a disparity.  This makes two assumptions:
<ul><li>Art has a value, whether or not that value can be determined.
<li>Art's value is not, for the most par, subjective, and is largely
determined by the skill of the artist.</ul>
I feel my first assumption stands on pretty solid ground.  People wouldn't
have spent lifetimes pursuing their art if it had no meaning or
value.  The second assumption isn't anywhere near as concrete, and
requires some backing.  Some artists are recognized as masters of their
art.  This indicates a consensus that the work of these artists has a
value, usually greater than that of other artists.  In doing so, we make a
comparison between the work of a master and that of another artist, and
thereby give them each value.  While this value can vary from person to
person, usually based on individual tastes, the fact that some art is
often said to be better than other art of its type indicates that this is
not wholely subjective.  Thus, if art is to have value, and that value is
not subjective, what other than the skill<sup>[2]</sup> of the artist can
be used to measure the value of art.<br><br>
So, what am I trying to say with all of this?  I think that we, as a
society, are all too willing to concede to the majority opinion when
determining the value of art, and rarely consider the skill of the artist
when making this determination.  This is why popular media (music, TV,
movies) is so full of mediocre attempts to entertain us - we hardly ever
take the time to realize that what we're watching/listening to is actually
crap.
<br><br>
[1] - As a side note, the only "art" in which I feel even moderately
proficient is writing, particularly persuasive writing.<br>
[2] - To clarify, there is more to an artist's skill than technical
ability.  The ability to convey emotions or thoughts is as important, if
not more so.
