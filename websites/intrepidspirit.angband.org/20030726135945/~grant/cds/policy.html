Please read the following rules before asking for a B&P or a trade:
<UL>
<LI>I <u><b>WILL NOT</u></b> sell bootlegs.  Don't ask me if you can buy
them.  Furthermore, I will not trade with anyone who I suspect intends to
sell the bootlegs I am trading.
<LI>All trades are on a disc-for-disc basis.
<LI>All CD's must be burnt DAO (Disc-at-Once).  This prevents the two
second pregap before every track from being added.
<LI>I use Mitsui Silver CD-R's.  If you're trading with me, please use
blanks of a comparable quality (i.e. no free spindles from Office Depot).
<LI><u><b>Don't</b></u> write on the CD's.  Please label them with a small
piece of scratch paper, as post-it notes have been known to pull up the
top coating of some CD-R's.
<LI><u><b>Don't</b></u> use fiber mailers.  Any CD's received in fiber
mailers will be returned.  The fibers in these mailers can adhere to CDs
and work their way into audio equipment, sometimes ruining it.
<LI><u><b>Don't</b></u> write on the CD's.  Please label them with a small
<LI>Please include a reminder as to what is being traded with your
discs.  I do quite a few trades, and it's hard to keep them all straight.
<LI>Please include a setlist for any shows you send.  I provide all of
this information on my website, and would ask the same of you.
<LI>I will not trade any shows which have been officially released.  These
remain on my list for inventory purposes only.  (If I have such a show
without the proper note, please notify me.)
</UL>
That's about it.  Thanks for reading.
