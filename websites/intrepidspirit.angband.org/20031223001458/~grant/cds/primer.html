<P>&nbsp;&nbspOkay, so you want to get a copy of something off my list,
but you've got nothing to trade.  Don't worry, there's a way to handle
this - it's called a B&P (short for "Blanks and Postage").
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
There are a few things you'll need:</P
<UL>
<LI>Blank CD's
<LI>CD Sleeves
<LI>A Bubblewrap Mailer
<LI>An outer-mailer
<LI>A Reminder-note
<LI>Postage</UL>
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
First the blank CD's.  Every CD trader has their preference.  If you'd
like a recommendation of what to buy, I'd suggest Mitsui Silvers.  I've
been trading for about 5 years now, and I've never had any problems
with them.  They're rated for high-speed burners, and are very good
CD-R's.  DON'T send CD-RW's.  Some traders don't have CD-RW drives (not
as common now as it once was), and even if they did, a CD-RW written using
one drive won't necessarily be readable using another drive.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
Next, you need CD sleeves.  My preference is dual caselogic sleeves.  I
bought mine at Best Buy, but if you don't have one of those in your area,
check something like Wal-Mart or the like.  Basically, any place that
sells CDs, as well as other things (video games, electronics, etc.) will
probably have them.  Failing that, you can get single paper cd sleeves
online, or probably at a computer supply store.  If you REALLY don't want
to get any of the above, I've seen people make envelopes out of sheets of
paper, or just toss their CDs in a plastic bag, but I wouldn't recommend
either of these.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
Next you need a bubblewrap mailer.  ALWAYS use bubblewrap mailers.  Other
mailers use some kind of fiber for padding.  This fiber has a tendency to
stick to blank CDs, and then comes off during the burning process in
the burner of the person who is doing you the favor of copying the bootleg
for you.  Some traders are so vehement about this that they will just
return any CDs sent in fiber mailers.  Also, make sure that the blanks
will actually fit in the bubblewrap mailer.  It doesn't hurt to go a
little large, but it can be a pain in the butt sending CDs back if they
won't fit in the mailer.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
The next part, an outer-mailer, is optional but preferred.  Basically this
is just a large envelope (large enough to hold the bubblewrap mailer), and
doesn't need to have any padding or anything.  The only purpose of this is
to send the pre-addressed bubblewrap mailer to the person who is burning
the CDs for you.  Some people will just send a bubblewrap mailer, and
enclose address labels and postage, but that's just more work for someone
who is already doing you a favor.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
The reminder-note is pretty simple.  This is just so the person who is
burning the CDs for you has an idea of what they're burning.  Also, if it
isn't stated on the CDs you're sending, let the person know the
maximum burning speed for which your blanks are rated.  I can burn 
at speeds up to 52x, but since some CD-R's can't handle this kind
of speed, I burn at 24x if I don't know the rating of the CD's.  Finally,
a quick "thanks" is never inappropriate or unwelcome.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
Lastly, comes postage.  It's not quite as simple as you might
think.  The first thing you need to do is put everything but the outer
mailer into the bubblewrap mailer.  Weigh that, and get the appropriate
amount of postage.  THIS POSTAGE CANNOT BE METER STRIPS!!!  Meter strips
are the white strips of paper with the postage and postmark printed on
them in reddish ink.  Meter strips are only usable on the day printed, in
the city they were purchased.  Since the bubblewrap mailer is what is
being sent back to you, it won't be sent on the day you buy the postage,
and it's doubtful it will be sent from the same city.  So, if you use a
meter strip on the bubblewrap mailer, chances are the person who is
burning the CDs for you will have to pay for postage to return your
CDs to you...not a good thing.  So, the easy way to take care of this is
just ask for stamps for the bubblewrap mailer.  Next, address the
bubblewrap mailer as if it's being sent to you, from the person you are
sending everything to.  Okay, we're almost there.  Stick the addressed
bubblewrap mailer (with postage) into the outer-mailer.  Get postage for
this (this can be meter strips since you're sending it that day,
presumably), address it (don't forget return address, in case you are a
little short on postage), seal it, and send it.
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp
So there you go...a crash course in B&P's.</P>
