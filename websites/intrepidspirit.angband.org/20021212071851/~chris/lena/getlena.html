Do note, there is no warranty with the above.  I trust it completely, but
if you try to use it and misconfigure it or you discover an unknown
"feature" while waiting for your first job offer in the past year and you

front of a bus to end your pain... I take no responsibility for any of
that.  Downloading resolves me of all guilt! w00t!  All rights reserved,
not valid in some states, etc, etc, etc...  You can use/change as you see
fit, just give me credit or blame as needed
