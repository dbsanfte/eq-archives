<font size=+1>
Since September 11th, I've been listening to the news a
bit more closely.  I think we all have.  Recently I've noticed how
much news broadcasts have changed in the past several months.<br><br>
First off, it seems as though we've added a new section to news
broadcasts.  In addition to news, weather, and sports, we now get a daily
terrorism update.  Sometimes this can be good news to have, but in the
long run, I think it will only cause us to dwell on what happened.  I'm
not advocating that we ignore what happened, I'm just saying that to move
on, we're going to need to leave what happened on September 11th behind
us.  Instead of letting a wound heal, we keep picking at the proverbial
scab with daily newscasts telling us about the death of a Taliban fighter
here or an Al Quaeda terrorist there.<br><br>
Another disturbing trend I've noticed in the news is how certain news
programs will go out of their way to show some vulnerability in the U.S.'s
defenses.  At first we had the stories about Anthrax, and how devastating
it could be if released in any number of places.  Then we are told about
how easy it would be to smuggle a weapon of mass destruction into the
U.S. by sea in cargo containers.  Then there's the most recent story,
about how terrorists may rent an apartment in a large building and blow it
up from inside.  It seems as though our media is just trying to give
terrorists more and better ideas of how to attack us.  In their attempt to
keep the American public well-informed, they are only putting us in
greater danger.<br><br>
A third difference I've noted, and this is related to my first point, is
how anytime a plane goes down or something explodes, one of the first
things mentioned by news anchors is that it is unknown whether it is a
terrorist attack or not.  In doing so, the media only reenforces the
public perception that an attack is iminent.<br><br>
In his book <u>Manufacturing Consent</u>, Noam Chomsky suggests that the
American media serves more as state propaganda than it does to actually
inform the public.  Chomsky then suggests the propaganda is used to get
the backing of the people behind something they normally wouldn't
support.  I'm not necessarily saying Chomsky is right, it just raises an
interesting question if he is.
