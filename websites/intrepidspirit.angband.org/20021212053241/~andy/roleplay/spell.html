<H1>Priestly Spell Tactics:</H1>

<P>One thing which really burns me is the conviction that priests are only
useful for healing others.  People underestimate the sheer tact and
ability the priest class offers.  Some of Anadis's most common spell
combinations follow.  You'll never view priests in the same way again:</P>

<h5>Protection from fire (3rd level):</h5>

<P>Read this spell description.  When cast upon self, the spell absorbs 
12 hit points <b>per level</b> of heat and fire damage!  Not only does it
work defensively against enemy magic, but it affords the caster protection
from friendly magic.  When surrounded, couple the spell with a wall of
fire (5th level), funnelled tightly around you.  At tenth level, creatures
caught within fire wall will suffer 4d4 + 10 damage per round, assuming
effects are not magnified at Gms descretion.  And you can stay within
unharmed for at least four rounds.  Fire Seeds and Produce Fire are also
good compliments.</p>

<h5>Protection from Lightning (4th level)</h5>

<P>Like above, but only protects 10 hit points per level.</p>

<h5>Cause Fear (1st), Cloak of Fear (4th)</h5>

<P>Fear is often the best weapon.  These spells work wonders against
lesser powered opponents.</p>

<h5>Dust Devil (2nd) + Silence 15' Radius (2nd)</h5>

<P>Summon a Dust Devil and silence it. Send it toward enemy, particularly
mages.  The silence will disrupt spellcasting, as will the devil's cloud.
This tactic deafens and blinds opponent, affording you a few rounds to
gain the upper hand.</p>

<h5>Wyvern Watch (2rd)/Glyph of Warding (3rd)</h5>

<p>All of these spells can be used to ward off the entrance to a dungeon
or a tight corridor the party has passed through.  Wyvern watch only
paralyzes the creature, but glyph of warding can be devastating: 1d4 pts
per level. While only one target will be affected, remaining ambushers
will be very reluctant to proceed, particularly if other spell effects
(continual light, or another Wyvern Watch) are used to scare off the
magic-phobic.</p>

<P>A light spell or faire fire can lure enemies into the ward.</p>

<h5>Obscurement (2nd)</h5>

<P>This is the great get-away spell.  It casts a thick fog over the area,
providing time for escape or hiding.  Follow with Silence 15' Radius, or
turn into a tree (Tree, 3rd) or Meld into Stone (3rd).</p>

<p>Against charging opponents, Obscurement can be followed with a blade
barrier or a wall for devastation. Of course, a wall of fire will burn
away the fog, so don't use that one.</p>
