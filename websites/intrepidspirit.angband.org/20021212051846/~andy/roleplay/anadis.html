<H1>Anadis, Lord of Mystery</h1>

<p>"Put your wand away, silly mage.  I'm a priest of Mystra herself!  Do
you honestly believe she'll let your fireballs harm me?"
</P>
<p>
"Finesse will always overcome brute force. Always."
</P>
<P>
"I am <b>not</b> a healing prayer with legs. You were stupid to 
attack in the 
first place. If you're hurt so bad, quaff a potion."
</p>
<h3>Comments:</h3>
<P>Anadis is a powerful cleric of Mystra, Faerun's Goddess of Magic.  He was
sent on a holy quest to wrest Krynn's stolen magic from Raistlin's grasp.
Flashy, flamboyant, cunning, and a tad bit arrogant,  Anadis is all too 
willing to prove that holy men should neither be underestimated nor
regarded as
mere healers.
</P>
<h2>ANADIS'S SPELL TACTICS:</h2>
<P>
"People all too often overlook the powers which the gods invest in their
prophets.  I am a link to divinity, a channel to my Goddess's glory.
Through me, she can reach into this plane, affect my surroundings... and
although her power is weakened in this realm, it is more than enough to
acheive her goals.
</P>
<P>
"You think priests pale in comparison to mages, do you?  Bah... don't try to
deceive me... your thoughts are crystal to me.  Spells and prayers are 
separate - they rely upon completely differing principles.  But are prayers
less effective?  I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that priests do not utilize their full potential.  They focus
upon such predictable prayers... Bless, Cure what-have-you Wounds, Prayer,
Light.... bah!  Such mundanity!  No excitement, no surprise, just the ability
to fix scraped knees! Hrmph... no wonder we have the rep we do.
</P>
<P>
"I focus on creativity.  Flashiness.  I have a spell for every occasion, and
at least two more on scrolls.
</P>
<P>
"Case in point:  Some travellers and I had settled down for the night when
a pack of wolves swarmed upon us.  Nasty creatures... dire wolves, I believe.
Or perhaps worse.  I had eight on me, but the situation was easily remedied.
</P>
<P>
"I first erected a wall of flame, centered on me so as to engulf my attackers.
The stench of burnt fur soon filled the night air. The creatures quickly 
succumbed
to Mystra's fiery wrath.  The heat was channeled inward, creating an intense
inferno... which I stood in the midst of, unharmed.  You don't think my
goddess would let me die by my own workings, do you?
</P>
<P>
"After insuring the wolves were dead, I dismissed the curtain of flame.  Then,
with Mystra's blessing, I instilled a sembelance of life in each of the
charred
corpses, creating eight loyal servants to serve Mystra's cause.  I
intended for
the beasts to guard us that night, but a fellow cleric (who worshipped a
Goddess
of Healing! The horror!) destroyed my creations. Such nerve!  Fortunately,
we had no more trouble that night.
