First, let's get on with the mandatory group photo:

The trip to Patterson was fun.  To break the ice, we played a card game
(Lunch Money) in which you're school children beating the flaming drek
out of one another.  Way cool.
</p>
<p>
Then we played Shadowrun. I promptly got drunk off my rocker and passed
out.</p>

There's a few more pictures of us roleplaying... but gee, they're of us
-roleplaying- (ick!)  Let's march on to fun stuff.

The next day, went to New York City.  The slew of us met Talieson/Bert and
Christine. (to the right is Yani).  Bert's ultra cool.  We went to
Six Flags when he was visiting.  Most of this is just being printed so
he'll blush when he reads this. (mwuhahahaha!)  But tis true as well.

<P>While in New York, we saw a poster for _SOUTHPARK_! I had to get my
picture with it. (The caption, in case you were wondering, 
reads 'Alien Abductions, Anal Probes, and Flaming Farts.'</p>

Well, I can't have pics of a wiz without pics of THE (rp)WIZ, now can
I? Might lose my wizbit or something. So to ensure no ill blood, here's
Shayd.  Believe it or not, he's actually a normal guy. (wow!)  For some
reason, he looks exceptionally devious and calculating in these shots,
which don't quite do him justice.</p>

Well now look what I've done.  Might as well parade the whole lot of pics.
(actually, the indignation is a facade for my unwillingness to type.  This
whole witty commentary thing is draining).
