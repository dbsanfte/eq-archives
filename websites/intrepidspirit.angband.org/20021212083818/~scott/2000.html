<b>1) Yo La Tengo</b>-<u>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside
   Out </u><i>(Matador)</i><br>
   their "worst" album for Matador is
   better than most bands at their all-time peak. Lots
   of people talk about how this album is so therapeutic
   with relationships and such--I'm too much of a 
   bitter loveless crank to see that but I can tell you
   that its easily the hangover record of the year,
   something I'm more than qualified to discuss...
<br>
<b>2) Broadcast</b>-<u>The Noise Made By People</u> <i>(Warp/Tommy
Boy)</i><br>
   first off, Tommy Boy??!! That gets it some bonus
   points right there...The United States Of America
   reunite and bring a relevant-era Laetitia Sadier
   along with them--can't go wrong with that!
<br><b>
3) Do Make Say Think</b>-<u>Goodbye Enemy Airship The Landlord
   Is Dead</u><i> (Constellation)</i><br>Godspeed without the silly
   tapes and reduced angst! Unfortunately pretentious
   titles are harder to part with but self-help has
   to start somewhere...
<br><b>
4) The William Parker Trio</b>-<u>Painter's Spring</u><i> (Thirsty 
   Ear)</I><BR>in an ideal world, this would be considered
   "straight ahead jazz". yet another reason that 
   there's already a parking spot in hell reserved
   for Ken Burns...
<br><b>
5) Pram</b>-<u>The Museum Of Imaginary Animals</u> <i>(Merge)</i><br>the
   band Stereolab has seemingly tried to emulate for
   the past 5 years flaunt their gorgeous melodies
   once more. If Godspeed You Black Emperor is the
   post-rock Phil Spector, Pram's the post-rock
   Brian Wilson (inevitable comparison #1).
<br><b>
6) Jackie-O Motherfucker</b>-<u>Fig. 5</u><i> (Road Cone)</i><br>if Alan
   Lomax had been A&R man for Kranky Records...
   (inevitable comparison #2)
<br><b>
7) Movietone</b>-<u>The Blossom Filled Streets</u><i> (Drag City)</i><br>
   while Flying Saucer Attack goes off on ridiculously
   awful jungle safaris, Rachel Brook knew when to
   fold and instead marries a slight FSA ambience to
   faint British folk melodies--music so evocative it
   almost makes me want to build a fire!
<br><b>
8) Volcano The Bear</b>-<u>The One Burned Ma</u><i> (Misra)</i><br>4 guys
   who went on a vacation to Germany, Canterbury, and
   Hell (in that order) and have lived to tell the 
   tale. Weirdo record of the year--their live show
   is IMPERATIVE.
<br><b>
9) <u>Damon & Naomi With Ghost</b></u><i> (Sub Pop)</i><br>D&N have always
   been just a little too plain for me. Teaming up
   with Japanese psych ambassadors Ghost results in 
   an album steeped in subtlety that ranks among the
   best work either group has done. If the movietone 
   fire is still going, play this one next.
<br><b>
10)Gorky's Zygotic Mynci</b>-<u>The Blue Trees</u><i> (Mantra)</i><br>in
   which the most underrated band in the world has 
   travelled transcontinentally to sample folk music
   from the American side of the shore. Pop melodies
   of the highest caliber still abound within the 
   short 23-minute duration. This comes out in America
   in 2001, so it can qualify as record-of-the-year 
   twice!
