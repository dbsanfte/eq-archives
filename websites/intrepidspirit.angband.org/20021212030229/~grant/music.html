Welcome to my shrine to one of the greatest passions in my
life:<br><br><b><u>Music</u></b><br><br>
I've been addicted to music for as long as I can remember.  It started out
fairly innocuously, with me listening to what few albums or tapes I could
get my hands on.  During high school, when I got my first regular
job, I became more interested in music, and started building the behemoth
that is now my CD collection; thanks in-part to the cheap prices and poor
selection BMG had at the time.  Then came college, and I started spending
every spare dollar (and some not-so-spare dollars) on a new CD or
three.<br><br>
This is really where my tastes began to mature, and my interest grew.  It
started by asking friends about new music to listen to while working, was
pushed along by my one-year stint as a music critic for <i><a
href="http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nique">The Technique</a></i>, and
culminated in my sizable <a href="cds/bootlegs.html">bootlegs</a>
collection.<br><br>
Anyway, I just want to thank a few people for exposing me to new music and
encouraging this addiction:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://clockwork.dementia.org/~darana">Danny</a> and <a
href="http://www.nd.edu/~aarana">Andy</a> Arana:  These two guys (Danny
more than Andy) have been great in introducing me to new sounds and
groups.  I really can't thank them enough for making my life better on
almost a daily basis.  Sure, I've discovered a few artists I like on my
own, but there are quite a few I never would have run into if it wasn't
for them.
<li>Jeff Martens:  Jeff's a good friend of mine who introduced
me to
artists like Frank Zappa, Ani Difranco, among others.  All-in-all, Jeff's
a great guy who has pretty good taste in music.
<li><a href="mailto:scott@angband.org">Scott Watkins</a>:  A newer friend
who has exposed me to a good bit of
indie stuff, some of which impressed the hell outta' me, and some of which
I just didn't quite get.  Still, he's damn knowledgeable, and still DJ's
on WREK (91.1 Atlanta) occasionally. 
<li><a href="mailto:ryanrichter@il-hotels.com">Ryan Richter</a>:  Ryan's
my brother (half-brother, actually).  He's the
one who got me interested in all this crap years ago, and I can't thank
him enough for what is probably my biggest addiction.
