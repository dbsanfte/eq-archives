<P>Who am I?</P>

<P>Isn't this the question we all struggle with?  And isn't it improper
etiquette to answer a question with a question?</P>

<P>To be honest, I don't know who I am.  One's identity is a constantly
shifting thing, fluctuating from day to day and from situation to
situation.  We don't act the same around our parents as we do around
friends.  But I'm just rehashing that which we've known for ages.</P>

<P>There are countless theories from social, developmental, and pop psych
to discern the "real" you from the vast tumultous sea of personalities you
express.  Let's look at the various faces of Andy, which differ by time
and situation, and see if an integrated personality will emerge.</P>

<P><B>Andy The Perfect Son (and brother, and grandchild, et
cetera):</B></P>
	<P>What can I say? I strive to be the perfect son.
Perpetually considerate, infailiably dependable, sacrificial (in a good
way, naturally), overly patient ... I am all these and more. My family is
important to me, and I try to give back as much as I take.</P>

<P><B>Andy The Perfect Student:</P></B>
	<P>I have always been an exceptional student. I won't bore you
with statistics, but I have never lost my eagerness to learn.  High school
was a blast.  College is even better.  My main motivation may have been 
to please teachers, but I refuse to believe it was something so
superficial.  I can't explain why I constantly strive to do so well. I
guess all that matters is that I do.</P>
	<P>As an aside, Georgia Tech is currently attempting to break
me down.  But the jokes on them, as I've chosen to be the victor.</P>

<P><B>Hyper-Andy-active!:</B></P>
	<P>Somersaults.  Dancing.  Jumping.  Screaming. Spasticity.
Rattlingonamileaminuteinaslittlebreathashumanlypossible.  Although
initially shy around strangers, it takes little time for me to thaw.  And
when I do, I'm possessed with an endless stream of energy that pours forth
from every pore of my body. </P>

<P><B>Brooding Andy:</B></P>
	<P>This is Hyper-Andy-active!'s evil twin.  Looks just the
same, but acts the opposite.  Sometimes, I become inexplicably jealous.
Or I think about my future (miserable in a capitalist society) and grow
sad.  Or I concentrate upon squandered opportunities, or friends I'll see
once a decade if ever, or friends I'll -never- see except as flashing
words, or friends I have now but will part from next year... and I brood.
I suppose I have an optomistic personality but a pessimistic view of the
world.  I don't like to think about the future; it's just too
saddening.</P>
	<P>And no, I'm not bipolar.</P>

<P><B>Andy The Intimidated Authoritoriless:</B></P>
	<P>It's weird.  You know the setting.  Sitting in a chem lab,
mixing up solutions, and a supervisor or prof comes along.  And ya freeze.
Especially if you're me.</P>
	<P>When I'm around prestigious people, I don't perform a
quarter as well as I usually do.  Social psych labeled it performance
anxiety, and I have enough for a small country.  I stammer, and drop
stuff, and go hyper yet feel broody.  Perhaps fear of being labeled a
clutz?  (of course, my actions ironically validate my fears). Or of being
regarded as clueless? (see above parentheses).  Either way, I become much
too intimidated.  I'll need to fix that.</P>

<P><B>Andy The Kick Ass P.L. :) :</B></P>
	<P>Possibly my best year at Tech was as a Peer Leader.  For you
non-Techies, a Peer Leader's analogious to a Resident Assistant for
Freshman, but with considerably more responsibilities.  Perhaps it was the
wonderful section (easily the best that year), or the nurturing staff, or
the most dedicated Freshman Partner Tech's ever had, Julie Phair Rhame.
Or maybe it was me:  given the authority I seek, I went into overdrive
doing what I do best - helping others.  I don't know, but it was a
rewarding experience I wouldn't trade for the world.</P?

<P>Now to integrate.  Well, I'm tired, and calculus never was my cup of
tea. So draw yer own conclusions.  Think for yerselves, ya lousy 
slackers!!!</P>
