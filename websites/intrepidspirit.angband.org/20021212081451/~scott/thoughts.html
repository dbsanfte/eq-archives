<title>My amazing thoughts</title>
<b><center>September 16, 2001</b></center>
wow, its really been a year since i've written anything
here? geez...<br><br>
well, needless to say, there's been a whole lot that's happened in the
last year. i've seen everything <i>from</i> a nervous breakdown, a
pretty
sucky car wreck, having my dog die, and seeing my roommate move out due
to hatred of me <i>to</i> some fabulous trips to boston
and new york, writing for <a href="http://www.stompandstammer.com">stomp
and stammer</a> magazine, hosting a new show on WREK, and (most amazing
of all) getting a girlfriend! and of course take into account seeing the
whole world change as of this past tuesday...<br><br>
i should point out that, despite the possibly negative connotations one
might get from reading the above, i am now in the best emotional shape
i've ever been in my life--my breakdown lasted one horrible weekend
about a year ago, and with the help of my psychiatrist anthony guevara i
got over my hangups and life has been great since--and of course my
girlfriend has given me a new lease on life (more on her in the
future). about the only disappointment right now is my relations with my
former roommate--there were some complications that arose between us and
misunderstandings and awkward moves resulted--i can normally share
whatever i feel on here, but it wouldn't be right to go into what's
happened between us here, because i haven't been able to talk to him
about it. and from the sound of it, he doesn't really want to have
anything to do with me--so its unfortunate that things have happened
this way, but if its isolation from me that will make him happy, then
far be it from me to make his life more difficult--its just
frustrating...so he's moved out and in his place came our friend
jeremiah, and everything's been working out fine in our apt...<br><br>
in fact, we had our first party about a month ago at this time, august
18. maybe you made it out to it--i was worried about our drawing power,
but we probably had anywhere from 50-80 people show, so it turned out to
be a pretty massive success--it was the first time i've ever tried to
act as a host, and i learned one important thing from it all--when being
a host (or even when not being a host) stick to the lesser forces like
beer instead of making potentially damaging cocktails for
yourself...<br><br>
by the way, i need to talk about my new show on WREK--its called
Psych-Out and covers the past and present worlds of psychedelia. sort of
like a cross between wras' post-script, wrek's stonehenge, and the wrek
rotations of "atmospherics" and "overnight alternatives"--you can take a
look at my playlists <a href="psychout.html">here</a> and i hope to make
the page more enticing and more informative. all narcissism aside, i
think my show is quite good and i'd appreciate any phonecalls or emails
confirming or denying this...monday nights 11pm-midnight eastern
time, check <a href="http://www.wrek.org">wrek's website</a> for
more info as well as listening capabilities...<br><br>
and speaking of musical affiliations, the old gold page has gone back to
its previous owner--i don't have the address on me right now, but she's
done a fantastic job on it (much moreso than my primitive nonsense)--you
owe it to yourself to check it out, not only for the design but for the
bevy of new releases that messrs. avett & young have planned to unleash
upon a thirsty public within the next fortnight or two...<br><br>
and i've been writing reviews for stomp and stammer off and on since
february. maybe you've seen some of them (gorky's zygotic mynci, the
magic carpathians, dump, low/dirty three, etc). i just submitted ones
for the new bablicon album as well as the all tomorrow's parties
comp. maybe i'll set up a page of my reviews on here so you can check
them out--and you'll be able to see unpublished stuff like my reviews of
the lothars (didn't notice jeff had reviewed it in passing
previously--dammit) and the soft machine (the masses of atlanta didn't
want to see my comprehensive opinions regarding canterbury's
finest? pshaw!) i'm currently sitting at wrek listening to the
awesome new album by acid mother's temple for reviewing purposes, so 
maybe you'll see something on that in the future--or perhaps
not...<br><br>
i think that's most of what i'll say for now--work's been going pretty
well, and after being there for over a year and a half i feel pretty
comfortable with it all--my family's been doing okay, atlanta life is
still swingin'--what can i say? i hope to write here more often than
annually, so maybe i'll write again soon and it'll be easier than right
now, where i have to review my doings for the past year to see what i
want to talk about--oh well, its getting time for my weekly shift here
at wrek, so i'll depart from now, but keep in touch, and i'll try to do
the same...<hr>

A <b><center>September 20, 2000</b></center>
well its time for the quarterly meeting to the stockholders, i guess. 
contrary to recent thoughts, i haven't done a single thing to my page
since the last time i wrote, excepting my new purchases. oh well,
apologies to tim bernazza and all those like him who come here hoping to 
see something new every once in a while. what can i say? i'll try to get
better...<br><br>
so i'm getting used to living in the city again. its kinda nice to be 
able to go out to eat and not have it take up your entire night due to
the drive. on the other hand, i've gotten into a lot of set schedules
which means i'm on the go lately. but then that can't be true because
i feel bored all of the time. i wonder what's going on...<br><br>
so what's been happening? well, there's work, which is going okay. i was
just talking tonight to my roommate ben about how i have an ingrained
reaction to not discuss work. someone i know pointed out to me that 
americans usually define their life by their work, and europeans define
their life by their friends and family. that makes a lot of sense to me,
of course, i guess i live a european lifestyle...but work's okay, let 
me just say that. but let's talk about something else if you don't
mind...<br><br>
i've received some nice emails from people coming to my webpage over the
past few months! i guess most of them pertain to people reading my
out-of-date list of albums. i guess this page is good for
something...geez, i was looking at it yesterday and i've bought soo much
since then. if you ration out the number of albums i've bought this year
to a one-a-day allowance, i would have something for every day of the year
up until 2 weeks ago. i don't know how that exactly corresponds to the
julian calendar, but suffice it to say its enough to have me scared...i
also heard from my beloved australian correspondent amber, although i
haven't heard back from her since my message (hey amber, if you're reading
this, write back!). of course, i welcome all messages, and like to have
correspondences with people. so write me, why don't you, its a lonely life
& if you doubt it, just consider the time i'm taking to write this
tonight...<br><br>
it has been a little more lonely lately due to my roommate anthony's job
shift. (i have 2 roommates by the way in case you don't know, anthony &
ben). and ben normally doesn't get home until in the evening, so this
place is basically mine and mine alone for a fair part of the night. of
course there are advantages to it like finally being able to hear all of
the albums i've bought recently but i need human reaction to keep myself
sane, i've discovered. kinda funny how all of these people told me they'd
look forward to having me live in town, but now that i'm here i don't hear
from any of them...hmm..well on the other hand i have been meaning to
touch base with a lot of them (r.e. kerns III and belinda, hi!!) but i
forget or else am too broke to do anything. i thought a party would be a
good idea to have a large group of people come over, but as time has gone
on i realize that i probably shouldn't do any such thing. despite my
constant show schedules & appearances at those angband parties, i'm not
much of a party-going person. plus i'm very neurotic & would obsess over
everything to a degree that it would inevitably be a disaster. phat_joe
(assuming you know him, if not try <a
href="http://www.phatjoe.com">here</a>) tells me i'm too uptight. i don't
know if i believe that--i think self-conscious is a better word. but in
any case, he's been a great help through these grey days by hanging out,
playing board games (at last! a board game partner!), etc. why, he's even
let me cohost his shift on wrek this semester! thurs 4-6, by the way. and
he just gave me a great mixtape tonight! you know, i love making mixtapes;
i used to think that was the only thing in life that i knew how to do
well--but nobody had ever made a mixtape for me in my life until this past
summer. about a few months ago, my former boss ramsey tantawi sent me 2
tapes, one devoted to an egyptian singing legend whose name i'll only
misspell, and one that was a total mix! and ramsey is just the person who
can make a good tape for me as well, as i've kinda fallen by the wayside
on the indierock side of things over the past couple of years. if you're
reading, ramsey, as soon as i get a tape deck your tape will be the first
thing i make on it! and now joe has given me one--its all coming
together...<br><br>
so anyway, our apartment is looking a little better than it did the last
time i wrote. i finally bought a big stereo for our living room, and came
up with the design i want in there--autographed photos. thanks to ebay, i
can make our place look like a posh restaurant! my first signed glossy
came in the mail a few days ago, of bob barker. quite an inaugaral way to
start off, don't you think?...well, i think so...<br><br>
what else, what else? well, i just finished reading the huge from hell
compilation by alan moore and eddie campbell--quite fascinating! i've been
to more movies this summer, most recently nurse betty (really liked
it) and almost famous (which was okay, i guess, but i can't fathom how
people think its a movie of the year). well, i guess my problem with
almost famous is i don't like movies where guys "get" the girl at the end
(not that this really happens in the movie, so i'm not revealing anything,
but maybe you know what i mean), and if the guy is a geeky rock journalist
i especially don't want him to get the girl! anthony jokingly questioned
me on it hitting too close to home, but i don't think that's it. i really
wonder how much of that was staged from cameron crowe's life...i do have
to say that i was very wary of someone playing lester bangs in the film,
but i'm happy to say that i was really impressed with philip 3-name,
whatever it is (i always forget). not that its an impressive role, a few
minutes of time, but just the same...turner classic movies has been
showing french new-wave cinema all month, which has been nice. i've always
wanted to know more about those types of movies...well, that's pretty much
it on my entertainment roundup for the moment...<br><br>
this is actually more than i've written in a while. i guess i don't really
have anything better to do. ben is home, but he's playing video games (a
common sight, if you can believe) and the living room stereo is blasting
out AMP's superb 1997 album astralmoonbeamprojections (oh, i'm getting
old). by the way, we've got dsl, which is nice, although our computer is
in ben's room so i always feel like i'm invading his privacy by coming in
here. oh well, like it'll stop me...<br><br>
well, i think that's it for now. no real thoughts, just some up-to-date
things, but i've probably written enough tonight. i seriously still intend
on making this page more noteworthy, and i need to start writing reviews
anyway since i still have that offer from jeff clark to write for
stomp&stammer (although i think we were all drunk at that time so who's to
say if he was serious). i could rattle off some essential music from this
period of my life, but i feel like i write about music too much. hmm, good
attitude to have before writing music reviews. but again, maybe you know
what i mean...<br><br>
so i'll go now, but please keep in touch...<hr>
 <b><center>June 25, 2000</b></center>
can't really write too much right now due to the fact that my relatives
are visiting, but I thought I'd let you know what's up. Yes, since the
last installment I have indeed moved and am at a new location back in
Atlanta. Hurray! However, I'm currently without a computer so I can't do
much with this page. Kinda nice to be without one, though, as it gets me
to do other stuff that would otherwise not happen due to continual
newsgroup checking. So I wouldn't expect too much from this for the time
being, but I'm sure you don't have much of an expectation anyways, now do
you? <br><br>
Just one more thing to add. It's been a very expensive time here in
Atlanta lately. This past Friday night I saw Sonic Youth and Stereolab, I
was at a Criminal instore for Top Shelf Comics yesterday, and I'm going to
see the Peter Brotzmann Chicago Tentet + 2 (- 1) this Wednesday (and am
going to buy their CD box at the show if I can afford it). Of this, I have
to mention that Chris Staros from Top Shelf is a really nice guy! I hope
those of you Atlantans who are reading this & are comics fans (and if you
are, please tell me--I have virtually no friends who like the comics I
like & would really like to know some who do) went to go see him
yesterday. Not only is it inspiring to know that there's somebody trying
to do something with comics in this really stagnant industry & time, but
even moreso to know that it's happening in the town I live in! I spent
mondo bucks there as I've been looking forward to the day since I heard
about the instore. Anyway, I just wanted to mention that--with the new
Drawn & Quarterly, the Swiss anthology I picked up at Criminal yesterday,
and my Top Shelf stash, I've got enough reading to last me the rest of the
year!!<br><br>
So I'll go now...by the way, I'm too lazy to change all of my mailto's at
the moment, but if you wanna write please disregard the
alwatkins@mindspring.com address and try <a
href="mailto:scott@angband.org">scott@angband.org</a> instead. Thanks!<hr>
 <b><center>April 30, 2000</b></center>
I've been meaning to do this for awhile, but since I'm here at WREK
awaiting my shift due to an overlong baseball game, I have some time on my
hands. So I'm listening to a stack of CDs the station has that I want but
can't necessarily afford to just go out and buy (playing Sue Garner & Rick
Brown's album right now, not bad) & thought I could write to you while I'm
waiting. So now you know the background...<br>
Okay, so you might have been wondering where the weekly reviews are. Or
you may have thought that 3 months ago when they might have actually been
a possibility. What can I say...I would like to get back on it, but I
don't know what's caused me to fall so by the
wayside. I do have the intention to get back to writing some more due to 
some flattering comments, but I haven't done so yet. I'd like to try it
soon, and I have all sorts of stuff that I'd love to just comment
on. We'll see...<br>
So what's been going on? Well, I'm finally about to move back into the
city! It's so nice to get out of the suburbs and my parents (nothing
against them, but you should know what I mean). Maybe that will provide
the energy that I am sorely in need of. Or maybe it won't. Regardless, I
will soon find out how many boxes my life can fit into, and you know that
will be fun...<br>
I'd also like to apologize to all of the people who have written me lately
that I haven't been quick to follow up on. Something must have happened in
this Y2K year, because I've gotten much worse at doing it. There once was
a time when I did nothing but write, write, write. I don't know what
happened to that youthful boy, but plain and simple he must have died. I
will try a resurrection process, so pray for a well-placed bolt of
lightning...<br>
Oh well, none of these are actually "thoughts", but thought I'd share
anyway so you'd know what I've been up to. I guess my life isn't as
happening as it once was (which is extremely sad) when I started doing
this, as a college student. Now that I'm one of those 40 hour workers
(waking up at 6:15, no less), I find that I enjoy nothing more than coming
home, staring at the walls, and eventually going to sleep. But you have to
admit, it does sound pretty nice...<br>
Okay, I'm gonna go now...<hr>
 <b><center>February 9,

For those of you who don't know, I turned 24 a week ago, so first off I'd
like to thank any of the nice people who acknowledged such and/or did nice
things for me that were completely unwarranted (excepting Anthony Guevara,
who is by law obliged to buy me something for my birthday regardless of
whether or not he wants to). That being said...<br>
Well, I haven't completely broken my promise of the weekly reviews
yet! This week's installment of my weekly reviews have just been posted,
and they would've been there last night if not for faulty
disconnections. Anyway...<br>
Well, my mind is really at a shambles right now. I guess I can't think
properly during the week anymore (the workplace desensitization to life
has begun), and the weekend looks a little busy. This will be the first
time I've ventured out to live shows in over 2 months, a record I sorta
wish I didn't have to break. To be honest, I don't miss being in clubs or
hearing loud performances or yelling in people's ear or figuring out how
much to tip for overinflated prices...but there are some good shows,
though. You can find me at the Echo Lounge for Seely on Friday and the new
Cotton Club for Macha on Saturday. Again, so you know...<br>
And that's all I'll say for now. More sometime down the road...<hr>
 <b><center>January 24,
2000</b></center>
Okay, I'm not really writing anything right now, but I'm trying to get my
life more organized, and one of the top priorities (after the top top
ones) is to make this page semi-decent again. I always hated archaic
pages, and I'm guilty of it now...so I'm probably gonna erase almost
everything on here once I have the gall to do so, and we'll just start
over, on this the 5th anniversary of my webpage! I'm gonna try to start
doing reviews again, tentatively thinking about one "new" album, one
thrifted album, one comic, and maybe a miscellaneous thing. That way, even
if I don't update any personal info you can still read some new stuff on
here. So will <i>that</i> make you happy, Tim King?<hr> 
<b><center>November 11, 1999</b></center>
Wow, it's been quite a while since I've done this. Of course, I guess
that's the start of every one of these damned write-ups, but I've gone
and done it again. Oh well...<br><br>
So there's been a lot in my life that's gone on ever since July 10, 1999.
I was just getting into the midpoint of my internship at the Post Office.
And since my time has elapsed, you may wonder what my status is. Or you
may not. Well, no matter, I'm gonna tell you anyway. As it stands, I'm on
an extension that will last throughout the rest of the year. After that, I
guess I'm gone. However, I may leave beforehand, as I've already done 1
interview this week and have another one lined up tomorrow (wish me luck).
Actually this one tomrorrow is kinda weird, because it's a position that
interests me but it's located in Seattle. And about a year ago I decided
that I didn't really want to leave Atlanta. But what is a boy to do? This
is the part where all of you females start begging me to stay (crying
optional but preferred). I guess I'll know more tomorrow night, but don't
expect me to write about it for a good 7 or 8 months or so.<br><br>
Anyway, this page itself has been really dusty. I guess I've spent most of
my html time on my pals at Old Gold Records, putting this one by the
wayside. Well, I'd prefer to keep this up-to-date, and recent reports show
that people are indeed coming to this page (quite a shock). And it's old
hat to say I'm going to do something about it, but I may as well keep the
cliche alive...<br><br>
So what have I been keeping myself up to besides work? Well, not much.
I've been trying to get back on track with my reading, which is nice. I
quit buying books a long time ago, since I've got so many that I could
keep on and on forever (excepting comix, natch). Current reading lists
include 3 comix collections and one picture-less one, Kerouac's
<u>Desolation Angels</u> along with <i>Raw Vol. 2 #3</i>, <i>The Essential
Fantastic Four #2</i>, and <i>Impact 1-5</i>. I should point out the
middle selection, the Fantastic Four book. Isn't it great that Marvel has
finally realized that they need to reissue their stuff again? I know they
went wild with it in the 70s, but I was in an embryonic/non-existent state
for most of that decade. Anyway, I wrote Marvel themselves to thank them
for the job (while not being too ass-kissing; I also pointed out how I
read none of their current stuff and listed my favorites), and received a 
very comforting message back from Polly Watson, the reprint editor. It's
people like her that actually give a heart to the huge corporation known
as Marvel. For those of you who haven't read the entertaining classics of
the Kirby/Ditko/Lee era, you owe it to yourself to spend $14.95 on
virtually any of the Essentials series (although admittedly the Avengers
one is a little weak and gets my goat on the female issue one too many
times). As for less classic Marvel times, if any of you out there remember 
Spider-Man's one-time adversary the Hypno-Hustler, please <a
href="mailto:scott@angband.org">drop me a line</a> and remind me how that
story went.<br><br>
Music? Oh, there's been a lot of it, but I've almost sapped myself of what
I'm really after. Things I've been playing a lot recently include the
Thirteenth Floor Elevators' <i>Easter Everywhere</i> (crappy Collectables
version), Fuxa's <i>Inflight</i>, the American Analog Set's <i>The Golden
Band</i>, and Angus Maclise's <i>The Invasion Of Thunderbolt Pagoda</i>
which is pretty danged good. I also picked up some of those "classic"
Rolling Stones records. After all, I have nothing against them as long as
I don't have to pay more than $6 for them. <i>Beggars Banquet</i> and
<i>Sticky Fingers</i> were the two I got, although they're not the main
ones I want (those would be <i>Exile</i> and <i>Let It Bleed</i>, which is
still a good album cover). Speaking of album covers, it seems that the
only interesting thing about <i>Sticky Fingers</i> is the LP jacket.
Although I must admit that the song "Bitch", a song I have long abhorred
(although it, along with "Brown Sugar" (another song I don't like), are
the only Stones songs I figured out on my own, I think), has that part in
it when Mick and Keith yell out "I salivate like Pavlov's Dog!" which I
had totally forgotten about and was pretty cool to hear. Not the words,
but the chords and the vocals (I've always preferred Keith to Mick). I
think I realized why; the basic key of the song seems to be A, yet in that 
one part I mention above, A suddenly becomes the major 5th. Of course, I
know
nothing about music theory (and felt pretentious writing the above), but I
think that's why I was unhealthily fascinated with it.<br><br>
These thoughts things were originally set up so that I could just ramble
off on some non-comix/music subject, though, and I really haven't done
that in a long time. Nor do I think I'll really be doing it tonight. I
guess I need to go eventually since my workhours will change tomorrow due
to my sudden interview status. After that it'll be pretty nice, though.
Stereolab's in town, and although I can't get into their new album too
much, it'll still be a good show most likely. In fact, 2 shows since I'll
be in Athens Saturday night for their show there as well. Stop by and say
hello, why don'tcha?<br><br>
Okay, is that enough for tonight? I hope so. Until we meet again...<hr> 
 <b><center>July 10,
1999</b></center>
Okay, take that optimistic write-up I did on the 4th and forget about it.
As of this present moment, I have no idea what's up. My job hours may have
changed again back to what the "normal" shift is, but I'm not sure. Which
means that once again the only time I'll be able to access this account is
when I'm tired from working all day, and I won't have any creative juices
of which to write all this new stuff. But I probably shouldn't say that
because then you probably won't visit this page again and it'll make me
lonely. Really, I'll try to be good...<br>
And is it just me or is everybody moving these days? I can think of
several people I know who have moved in the past few weeks, I just got
back from helping my cousin Belinda move, and then at the end of the month
all of my old roommates are moving as well. And here I remain, with dear
ol' mum & dad. Hey, if you live in Atlanta and would like a roommate who
will try to be a good kid and not drive you to the brink of insanity with 
endless playings of Robert Wyatt albums and the Captain Beefheart box set,
let me know! Let the deluge begin...<br>
Also, I'm going to try to revive this comix page I have. Back in the day,
what few comments I received from kind people had only to do with my
comics stuff (not that I receive much--about every several months, I might
receive something from someone--this is a call to arms--write me, please!
Tell me if you have any comments about this page, or if you feel similarly
about something, or if you feel against it, or if it's nothing more than
saying "hello"--can't you see I'm down on my knees here???), and I've
neglected it as of late. And it's not from a real-life lack of interest.
Quite the contrary, as I've been buying more stuff than ever, lots of old
collections and I've tried to branch out a little although it's pretty
tough to find things these days. The Comics Journal that featured the 100
greatest comics ever was a real inspiration to me, and I've been out and
about picking up many of those things and learning from them. Also, I've
gone ebay crazy over the past few months and have made many choice deals.
One of which is 26 of the 28 issues of Weirdo, bought because I knew I'd
enjoy a lot of it, and anthologies could open me up to more. And it
already has, since today I found a Carol Tyler book (I loved her story in
issue #20 entitled "Uncovered Territory", and if you hang around with me
you'll probably have to endure me making you read it sometime soon). It
just shows that there's always something that I've missed. If you can
think of anything else I may need to be enlightened about, don't hesitate,
I beg of you!<br>
Okay, I think I'll head off for now.<br>
 <b><center>July 4,
1999</b></center>
Happy independence day to all of youse in our glorious country! And if
you're not, well, uh, fuck off. But seriously, folks...<br>
I'm gonna try to make a habit of writing stuff here at least once a week,
in order to keep this as the fresh daisy for you to come and sniff at from
time to time. I'm hoping it will be a nice little substitute for all you
TV junkies in this rerun period, as you have a new character to look out
for every week! Or maybe it could be like one of those internet voyeur
things where you spy on my secluded life. Hmm, let me make this kinkier by
taking off my clothes. Ahh, that's better...and you think I'm just saying
this...you probably don't want to visualize the scene.<br>
Well, I wrote all this last night but then I got suddenly disconnected 
from mindspring, which means that it's now July 5. And as such, I've lost
my train of thought of what I was originally saying so let me try to start
back up...hmm...this is harder than I thought it'd be...Nah, can't do it,
I'll try something later...<br>
 <b><center>June 28, 1999</b></center>
And again and again. See, I'm trying to get better about this! But it gets
pretty hard at times. For example, I was wanting to get back on track by
writing record reviews and such since I have so much new stuff, but when
I get up in the morning I end up doing wasteful stuff like crosswords and
drinking coffee (or writing things like this), and when I come in I don't
want to bother with it, either. And then there has to be the time that I
actually listen to this stuff I want to review, which is getting less and
less frequent. To prove my point, I just listened to the first Faust album
last night, which I bought about 2 months ago, and it's only like the 3rd
time I ever played it, and the thing cost me @#!? 30 bucks! Whenever I
make an investment like that and then don't get to check it out, you 
know something's not right. Of course, one of the solutions would be to
quit buying new stuff so that way I could get acquainted with what I
already had. Sounds good in theory, right? I swear, Harvey Pekar got it
right, it really is like a drug addiction.<br>
Sadly enough, though, that's about all that's going on. Well, except for
one thing. I have started on my big review thing of, not just 1999, but
of the entire 90s. It may take quite awhile, as it will have quite a few
lists and a lot of autobio stuff, which is great if you're thinking about
stalking me but not so good if you're wanting to be entertained.
Nonetheless, it works as catharsis and if you get something out of it,
well then maybe it will be worth it. I should say that I'm not going to
present it in some kind of "here are my troubles" format. I don't think
the internet should function as somebody's whining post. The object is
to get people to read it, not shy away! So it may not appear that way,
but I am going to try to write it with the knowledge that others are going
to be reading it too (I hope), so it will hopefully be amusing/insightful
enough for you. Well, insightful as it talks about me, not that you can
learn any practical messages from it. I'm no Aesop. Anyway, you can 
hopefully expect that by the end of the summer or so.<br>
Speaking of summer, I'm on WREK 91.1 FM for that time period, namely
Sundays from 2-4 PM. So if you're here in Atlanta, listen up, or if you're
not check out the nifty webcast when you go to WREK's web page (as seen
in my links section). It even archives for the whole week so you need not
be glued in at that one particular time. The things WREK does for
you...<br>
Well, I should probably be running along for now. Yeah, I know, this isn't
really the "thoughts" I intended this page to originally be, as I'm just
relaying facts, but hopefully with renewed writing I can get back to my
original grand scale of things. Just cross your fingers for me.<br>
 <b><center>June 21,
1999</b></center>
Just some quick messages. Mainly, I'm insane and I've learned this from 2
instances. One, I still keep allowing myself to work these crazy hours,
missing good shows and good sleep alike. And second, I'm able to walk into
a record store and on the flip of a coin decide to spend $90 +. Of course,
the item in question is the Captain Beefheart box set, so it's to good
use, but still...As it happens, I just came back from work, and I'm now
listening to CB, so all elements that have fried my brain have come 
together. So that means I can't write anymore. But it doesn't mean I don't
love you, y'know. Soon...<br> 
<b><center>June 6, 1999</b></center>
Okay, I'm back. But I've gotta explain. The last time I wrote anything
here, I promised I'd have this site back up and running with constant
additions. Well, I said that with the best intentions but mother nature
didn't want to cooperate. As it happened, our modem got zapped in a storm.
This left me without the ability to go online for awhile. Finally, after
about a week of inertia we bought a new external modem and was ready to
go. Or so we thought. About a week later, we had another storm come
through,
which not only knocked out our new modem but fried out CPU as well. So
we had to go out and buy a brand new computer, which was a little
disheartening. Needless to say, at the tiniest hint of a storm we unplug
everything in the fuckin' house now. So that has been one drawback.
Another is my new workhours. I'm now working the 4-12:30 shift at the
USPS, which means I try to get all of my activity in the daytime before
I go in, and I don't ever think I have enough time to sit around and write
about this and that to an audience that may not even exist. (However, I
do have time to play about 300 games of Freecell daily--go figure) I know
this is bad because I always hate when people's websites get so out of
date,
like listing your favorite events of 1998 when we're halfway through the
next year (memo to self--take that thing off of my main page as soon as I
finish typing this). So I'm gonna try to make it a little better.  Will
I succeed? I'm skeptical, but you never know. I'll try to get some 
reviews up soon, which I think is probably the best thing I can do.
What's more, it'll give me time to actually listen to/read my new things
and less time to run around buying yet more things. The number of CDs I've
gotten in the past 2 months is pretty staggering, and the comics haven't
been that shabby either. Oh well, I think somebody is trying to call our
house because my connection is slowing, so I need to split for now.<br> 
<b><center>May 3, 1999</b></center>
It's time for that quarterly hello. Unfortunately, the modem got fried a
few weeks ago, but I'm now back up and running again. Of course, I don't
have much time to write as my days are now pretty busy. Geez, I should 
really write more often, because when I wrote the last installment I was
just back at working at the insurance place that I was at for my college
days. Well, for the past 3 weeks I have been an intern for the USPS, and
I can't explain it but it makes me super-tired when I get home. Then
again, I guess it's because I have to wake up at 6:30. The horror! Anyway,
a fair amount of stuff has been happening to me, but now's not the time to
go into it, as I've got to make my lunch for tomorrow. I will try to
update the show info as there are quite a few cool Atlanta gigs soon, and
I wholeheartedly intend to add some content up here, maybe by this weekend
(look for some record reviews, if nothing else). As you can see, I've gone
music crazy lately (as opposed to my normal "crazy" crazy) and there's
plenty I still need to check out. In fact, I think tonight's post-sleeping
selection will be the Red Crayola, so come on over if you wanna check it
out as well. Hmm, I promise I'll write again this week, and I'll probably
edit this page a little, but not now, okay? Oh, you're so sweet...<br>
 <b><center>February 27, 1999</b></center>
Hi, I'm back again. I just want to have something new to replace the dumb
writing I made last Saturday night. It's not like I really have much on my
mind. Anyway, I just got back from seeing the triumphant return of my
beloved Gold Sparkle Band at the Eyedrum. Good stuff, and the cheap beer
was good too, but I felt a little weird throughout it and was ready to
head home. Why? I don't really know, but it could have to do with spending
a lot of money today. I bought a Krazy Kat retrospective, 2 CDs, going out
to eat, paying to get in the door, and the beer, which means my newfound
wealth has been mangled pretty quickly. Oh well, maybe the 15th will get
here soon...<br>
Don't you hate it when 2 things go on in the same night? At the same time
as this, Smog was playing in East Atlanta. I guess I could've gone to
both, but I hadn't considered it beforehand and it seemed too late to
think about it, not to mention it'd just make me feel worse about my
money. I'm trying to save so I can get out of this suburban nightmare, and
I did do a good job by putting most of it up, but still. Like you want to
hear about my economic trials.<br>
So what do you think about publicity for cult things? It's a controversial
topic. Nirvana would be a popular example. When they got big, jocks got
into them who seemed to be missing the point. It's sadly ironic to have
homophobes championing a group like Nirvana. On the other hand, Kurt made
sure to mention his favorites constantly in interviews, which is what
helped turn me on to a lot of music. So I'm personally in favor of it. I'm
thinking of this primarily because of this upcoming Andy Kaufman movie
with the despicable Jim Carrey playing my favorite comedian. While people
report that he's uncanny, I'm still wary as hell. However, this Kaufman
interest has spawned some stuff, like Comedy Central airing specials about
his life and E doing a True Hollywood Story on him. So if nothing else,
you can't argue with that. I think that a lot of people who worry about
this are just insecure in their standing, afraid to lose whatever inside
cool they may have.<br>
By the way, you may be on the lookout for a comeback Sunday Special hosted
by moi on the ever-beautiful WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM. The topic: sex,
violence, drugs, and rock and roll. 2 hours devoted to excess, with artist
pairings you may not have considered before. I've still gotta get it
okayed, but I feel alright about it. After all, I don't seem to remember
any ix-nayed specials in my life. We'll see.<br>
Oh well, it's time to move on. I should point out that as I've been typing
this my ears have been exposed for the first time to the sound of Os
Mutantes, and I have to say its been a good time so far. My spending guilt
is now waning.So until next time (hopefully sooner than later),
...<br><br> <b><center>February 20, 1999</b></center>
Can you believe it? I'm actually writing here! Well, big deal, but it
hasn't happened too often lately so I thought I'd go for it. Also, as is
usually the prerequisite, it's not exactly a joyous occasion for me, but I
don't want to bring you down or anything. I don't really know why I feel
strange because the day's been going well up to now. I don't think it's
because I'm upset with the new Melt Banana offering, although that may be
somewhat related (gee, it take a lot to get me upset). But that's one of
the worst things about the internet: making your little insignificant
depresso-attacks and then unleashing them for everyone in the world to
see. I don't really have time for self-pity (I do have time for playing my
Monopoly CD-rom 200 times a day, though).<br>
Anyway, enough about that. The times have been okay. I'm speaking with the
post office about possibly getting an internship, and the insurance
company I used to work for is letting me work as long as I want with them
and they'll pay me nicely for it. So who knows, maybe I'll be getting
enough cash so I can move back out to midtown on my own. I don't know what
that'll do to my page, since I may not have a computer should the
situation
arise, but I'll worry about that some other time. On the other hand, it
may be upsetting because I'll lose my loser status since I won't live with
my parents. While this is undoubtedly a good thing, the drawback is that
people will discover that I didn't have the loser status only for that
reason. Oh well, we'll just see. Prospective roommates, you have been
warned!<br>
Gee, does any of this stuff matter to people? I kinda doubt it. Unless
you're a friend of mine or else you want to be (the line forms to the
left), this is all just self-important nonsense. Better fill this up with
something you might care about.<br>
Hmm...I can't seem to think of anything. Not that I wrote this as a
punchline, but I honestly can't grasp anything right now. I think I'll
just quit and maybe in a few days I'll think of something. Ah
well...<br><br>

 <b><center>September 9,
1998</b></center>
And it has dawned upon us. I am out of Georgia Tech now, and currently
living back home with me mum and dad awaiting for some company to come
barrelling down our driveway to offer me some huge luxurious job. So while
that's waiting to happen, I guess I have some time on my hands. I guess
you noticed that there are still no memoirs on my web page like I
promised. Well, it takes time. (and to be honest, I still haven't started
yet, but you better keep that a secret) I do want to start doing things
with this page, though, since I have nothing else to do. And besides,
looking at my show list is the only way I know that I'm doing something
these days. And if you look, you'll probably see a couple of cool shows
happening within the next month or so. Cool, huh? Oh well, now is not the
time to write. I guess I should work on sending out my resume to a couple
more places. Sigh...<br>
 <b><center>August 6, 1998</center></b>
Wow, 2 months since I've written anything? And I guess I'm not even
writing anything now, since I've gotta be at work in 27 minutes. I just
thought I'd drop in since there continue to be numerous visits to my web
page, which has been suffering from rigor mortis. It's just that this is
my last month at school, so I've been pretty busy doing--ah, who am I
kidding? I've been doing about as much schoolwork as I've always done (not
much), I just don't know why I've been writing so little. Well, I think
I've just completed one of my courses and in a few days I'll be done with
another, so maybe I'll have time to do some last things. Besides, I still
want to write my whole "memories of college" thing which might be fun and
interesting, even to people like you who don't even care (but then again,
you are at my web page for something). We'll just see. I guess I should
plug a few things while I'm here. I will be doing 2 more Sunday Specials
on WREK-Atlanta 91.1 FM this month: August 16, the music of Tomita, and
August 30, showcasing the Old Gold record/tape/CD label based out of
Atlanta. Actually, I'm just the medium, there will be other people who are
hosting it, but I'll be there and I can contribute too. So be on the
lookoiut for that, and write me if you have any questions. And, as always,
write if you want to. I can think of no better thing in this world than to
receive unsolicited emails, but then again you always want what you never
get, don't you? Well, a boy can dream... More soon, but that's all for
now.<br> <b><center>June 5, 1998</center></b>
And once again I return. It is almost the end of the school quarter (only
finals left) so it's time for my usual procrastination. Well, it's Friday
anyway, which means that I'll always avoid work no matter what the
situation. It's one of those nice lay-about days, and I just got out of
the shower and my hair is drying. You know the feeling you get when you
can take a shower in the middle of the afternoon and it's not really to
get ready for anything but just to relax and then you can get out and
listen to some relaxing music and maybe look at some comics or just stare
out the window? Well, maybe you might have some more fun things to do than
what I've just listed, but that's all it takes to make me happy for a
while. The only sucky thing is that I had to put on a collared shirt
(we're going to the Spaghetti Factory tonight, and even though I realize
that place is far from classy, I still don't feel right about walking in
there wearing some 70s shirt I thrifted that features the old Atlanta
Falcon symbol flipping the bird) which means I have to wear jeans. Well,
it doesn't really mean I have to wear jeans, but I just don't like that
look of wearing a collared pullover with shorts. It's like some kind of
preppy look to me. I think it has to do with the fact that when I was
growing up I didn't have any cool t-shirts (I always wanted one that had
writing on the back of the shirt) so I had to wear Izods (actually, Izods
were too upper-middle class for our family; I wore the dragons, if you
remember those) with those ridiculous jam shorts (what can I say? I was 10
years old) back in the 80s so many times that it totally warped my overall
opinion of the subject. So even though it's a billion freakin' degrees
outside I've got to wear my jeans so that way I can achieve my internal
harmony. Boy, what a timekiller that was. Hold on, my CD just ended so let
me go put on something else.<br>
Okay, I'm back. For your information I am now listening to the Future
Bible Heroes, and I just finished listening to Sonic Youth's
<u>Experimental, Jet Set, Trash and No Star</u>. Please stop cringing like
that. You know, I think I'm the only person in the world who really likes
that album. It seems like everyone slags that album, I guess because it
was such a quiet followup to all of that Goo and Dirty stuff. Well, that's
what's appealing about it to me. I mean, I really like both of those
albums too (actually, I guess there isn't a Sonic Youth album that I don't
like, at least not out of the ones I have), but the somber sound of
Experimental is so mysterious to me. The record is also dated to me, not
as in a dated sound, but as in dated memories. It came out the last month
of my status as a high school student, and I remember constantly listening
to it. I mean constantly. My favorite songs on there are "Tokyo Eye",
"Sweet Shine", "Waist", and "Starfield Road". Oh yeah, "Screaming Skull"
too. Maybe I'm blowing my cool by admitting stuff like this, but I don't
really give a fuck. As for Sonic Youth, I saw them play two nights ago at
the Roxy, which was pretty good. I have to say, though, that I didn't care
for the crowd at all. I hope this doesn't make me sound like some bitter
old man, and I hate making stereotypes like this, but there were a bunch
of high schoolers around me and they just pissed me off. I was wondering
what half of these people were doing there. For example, Pelt opened up. I
had wanted to see Pelt when they played Under the Couch a few months back,
but I didn't have the cash, so I looked forward to seeing them. They came
on and played one continuous drone with interesting embellishments for
about 30 minutes or so. This did not go ever very well. I could give
better justice to their music, but I'm not going to rack my brain for 4
hours so I can write something that nobody cares about anyway, so if you
really want a fair description you can always right me (beg for
communication #413). But back to the show, some guy behind me yelled "Play
some music!" Play some music? Does this guy realize the show he's gone to?
Does he realize that Sonic Youth are largely responsible for noise being
what it is today? Then the aforementioned high schoolers in front of me
apparently kept going on about how much Pelt "fuckin' sucked", according
to Amy, and then threw some pennies at them after their performance. Also,
people kept starting up applause during their set most likely to drop the
hint that they were ready to get them off the stage. But when SY started
doing some loud improvisation at the end of their encore following a
totally rockin' "Death Valley '69" then they are ecstatic. Go figure.<br>
You know, I hate talking about music so much. It makes me feel like I'm
just a one-track mind and that I can't function when I talk about anything
else. To be honest, when I talk to most people music is the last thing in
the world that I want to talk about. People always get the wrong idea, and
think that because I buy lots of albums and read music magazines and the
like that I'm open for discussion on the subject. The worst is when they
try to compliment me to others. This always happened in high school, and I
hated every minute of it. They always said I listened to "cool" music, but
if it was so cool, then why was it that they never listened to it? Were
they admitting to me that they weren't cool (well, actually, there could
be a case made for that, but I really doubt that was their intention), or
were they just try to build back some self-esteem in me since they ripped
me apart from it back in junior high school? Well, who really cares? I
guess I don't see any of them anymore. Good riddance. Okay, I think I've
taken my happy day out-of-the-shower vibes and ruined it by dwelling on
the worst times of my life, so I think I'll stop for now and do something
more productive.<br>
 <b><center>May 21, 1998</center></b>
Hello. I haven't written anything in a while, and I have about 5 minutes
before I go to class, so I probably won't write much here. I just thought
I'd say that things are kinda busy right now, so the last thing on my mind
has been about spending hours on a keyboard typing in stuff like this. 
Anyway, chances are if you're reading this then you probably know me up
close and everything already, so you don't really have to ask me what I've
been doing in the first place. If you don't, well then you can always be
friendly and write me. I'm a nice guy, I write back. It kinda freaks me
out because when I randomly look at my web page the counter has always
been raised by a considerable number (well, at least considerable for me),
which is strange because that means that someone has been looking it over
but it remains a mystery to me. Hmmm. Call Encyclopedia Brown! Oh well,
this pointless excercise is over. It's now time for class.<br> 
<b><center>March 5, 1998<br></b></center>
Oh am I bored right now. It's kinda nice that I don't really feel any
pressure at the moment, but it's kinda bad because that means I'm bored.
This usually happens on Thursday nights when I'm allowed to stay up late
since I only have one class at 2 on Friday. I bought a couple of albums to
make the time go by (FYI the new records by Tortoise and BOB) but I still
feel like I'm missing something. Oh well.<br>
I think I'm going to start doing music reviews, due to the overwhelming
requests I got from everyone. Actually, I never heard from anyone, but I'm
just trying to figure out ways to kill time. I guess I can do comic
reviews even though I don't really buy too much of them right now. I think
comics are in a rut. However, I did receive the new Spit & A Half catalog
yesterday, and I highly endorse them. In fact, I saw about $25 worth of
stuff that I'd gladly send off for, but I'm afraid that I shouldn't really
do so with my monetary state. At least it's getting that time of the
quarter to sell books back.<br>
I'm afraid that I don't have too much on my mind. Not much has been going
on lately, except for my little feud that's been going on in the letters
section of Creative Loafing. You can check it out for yourself by going to
Creative Loafing's web site and viewing the letters to the editor. If
you're like me, you won't be disappointed. But aside from that, things
have been rather dull. No shows recently, no fun activities done with
anyone. For you completists, I've been surviving by listening to albums by
the Kronos Quartet, Big Star, Van Morrison's <u>Moondance</u>, and Yoko
Ono. Yeah, Yoko Ono. I've received shit from several people for purchasing
one of her albums a few weeks ago, and it pisses me off. Not that people
don't like Yoko, that's their prerogative, but when they go around
slamming other people I don't care for that. I asked one such interrogator
if he had ever heard one of her songs. To which he of course replied no,
but then said that he would never want to hear one. I told him that wasn't
the question. The thing about Yoko is that she was someone making
avant-garde music who got mixed up with someone who was not making
avant-garde music. Therefore, people could not identify and instead went
on and on about how awful she is and all of the damage she caused. Of
course, people consider the best Beatles albums to be the ones that
happened after she got involved with them, and everybody goes on about how
"Plastic Ono Band" is a classic (although I've never heard that album, but
I'm gonna look for it at the next record show). I guess they don't realize
that they're contradicting themselves. I've also heard people complain
that Yoko is very pretentious, calling pieces "art" that are debatable.
Well, I can't really make an argument for this; I guess it's just
interpretation. I agree that some moments seem like they're up for debate
("Radio Play" off of the album I bought), and that makes me think of a
great quote from Calvin & Hobbes: "The thing about being avant-garde is
knowing who's putting on who". However, I like a lot of things that other
people would dismiss; "Cambridge '69", the most difficult piece on the
album, is intriguing to me. I also dig things like Voice Crack and Charlie
Parker, which would drive a lot of folks crazy (strangely enough though,
the Voice Crack track on the Live At WREK CD was the one my dad tolerated
the most). I don't really know how to define my fine line of what noise I
like and what I think is just for being pretentious, but if I have any
insight I'll let you know. Or you could always do the same.<br>
<b><center>February 4, 1998</b></center><br>
Yeah, I haven't updated as often as I thought I would, but then again I
never promised nobody nothing (triple negative makes it all right). To be
honest, I'm just writing right now because I've been working
thermodynamics problems for the majority of the afternoon and I need a
break before I start studying for my facilities design test tomorrow. I
think I'm going slightly mad this quarter. At least I have the Kronos
Quartet performance tomorrow night to realign myself. The tickets for that
show, along with a copy of the <u>Harmony of the Spheres</u> triple-LP set
on Drunken Fish records, are my birthday presents from my parents (well,
I decided on them; mom and dad aren't exactly big Flying Saucer Attack
fans, nor do they like any kind of chamber music). For those of you who
don't know, I turned 22 this past Monday (Lee Ranaldo's birthday! I'm so
glad somebody cool has my birthday and not just Garth Brooks!), and I
actually had a swell time in the process. Having a nice dinner with my
favorite people, even despite the infernal "Happy Birthday" song (but the
employees were likable, so even that number was okay with me; I still had
to kick Amy in the shins for it). Ah, if only every night could be like
that. Okay, on to a completely different topic.<br>
Do you ever have one of those revelations? You know, something that makes
you go "how could I have ever lived before this?" Well, I've had one
recently, and for that I'm making 1998 the year of the boxers. No, not
that sport that only wishes it could be as cool as wrestling, I'm
referring to the underwear (duh). I guess briefs are an appropriate
representative of clothing for the south, what with their repressive acts
of concealment, just adding tension, but boxers are the complete opposite.
They're so cool that you can walk around wearing nothing over them and
people don't look at you like you're some sicko. It's like you're wearing
swimming trunks (a nice feeling for all of us, I'm sure), but you don't
have any of that lining crap or the big-ass strings. Yes, they've changed
my life. You see, this is the kind of stuff that made me realize to switch
to this "what's on my mind" format. I wouldn't exactly devote a page to
this.<br>
And in the plug section, I have to wholeheartedly endorse the new issue of
the <u>Comics Journal</u>. Yeah, I know it's $12.95, but it's worth every
penny. Not only is it the 200th issue, filled with retrospectives, but
there's a 45 page interview with Charles Schulz as well as a 55 page
interview with Chris Ware. The Schulz article just endeared me to him even
more, and the Ware interview shows him not to be a pretentious artiste,
but a self-deprecating guy admitting that his ideas don't always turn out
for the best, and even clarifying some aspects of the Jimmy Corrigan
story. I know I wrote cautious comments about <u>Acme</u> in my last
installment, but I still believe in the comic. So there's  alot of good
stuff in there. In fact, the only pieces I've read are the two interviews,
because the issue is so huge that I can't devote any more time to it while
I'm in school (well, I could be reading it now instead of writing this
nonsense, but this is therapeutic for me). Bottom line, get it now!<br>
I went home for the weekend, which eventually led to going to Jonesboro
Road (thrift-store capital of the south side of Atlanta; 5 in a
quarter-mile span). I was in for a shock. First of all, the DAV, my
longtime personal favorite, has now deteriorated to a point where it's
almost useless to go there. It's so sad, I've found so many great things
there (my first Western shirt, records of all genres, lots of great books
at 20 for a dollar, etc.), and now it's basically nothing. No records, no
decent shirts, no books worth reading. Not even any Atari games I don't
have, and that's always been the place where I stock up. The second huge
tragedy to strike was that Last Chance had moved to Mt. Zion Road, miles
away, which takes away the old routine of walking from one store to the
next. I guess it's good that the Southlake Mall area has a thrift nearby,
but it's bad when you have to drive out there to see what they have.
However, it wasn't all tragedy on Sunday. I found numerous items (a couple
of books, ranging from the Loch Ness Monster to the Godfather to the
autobiography of Malcolm X, as well as some records and a cool
Monopoly-type game that celebrates small businesses), but what took the
cake occurred at Value Village. This time a year ago, I was searching for
albums by the High Llamas, particularly <u>Gideon Gaye</u> after I read
some great reviews of them. However, this was about 6 months before they
were to be picked up by a US label, so I couldn't find anyplace in town
that had any of their albums. Well, they got signed to V2 back in August
and the US debut of <u>Hawaii</u> had everyone talking. V2 decided to
reissue the LPs, which all came out last week. I could finally hear
<i>Gideon Gaye</i> after all, but I didn't have enough money to get it
when it came out. However, I found the original pressing of it on Alpaca
Park for $2.40 at the checkout counter of the aforementioned thrift. As I
told someone else, thrifts are truly a blessing from above.<br>
So what's been occupying my world as of late? Album-wise, there's been
that High Llamas album, the new Robert Wyatt record (given to me by Jeff
for my birthday), the first Jessamine CD (given to me by Holli for my
birthday), the Kronos Quartet's <u>Short Stories</u> CD (gotta get ready
for tomorrow night, after all), and the Beatles' <u>A Hard Day's
Night</u>. This has been the first Beatles album I've bought in 4 years,
and this may take out some coolness factor in me, but I don't care. While
I don't believe in the idolization of bands, I don't believe in casting
them off either, and the Beatles will always be a big group with me, even
if I don't play there albums as much as I did back in junior high.
Comics-wise, I finally got the new <u>Nowhere</u> by Debbie Dreschler,
which I remember being good. I haven't got much else, but I did receive
another mega-load of minis from Australian correspondent Amber Carvan, so
once I get through with my test tomorrow, I'll have to immerse myself into
them. It's moments like that, along with my birthday dinner, that make me
glad to be alive. Oh yeah, I need to mention that this past week's Space
Ghost, with his grandfather sitting in, was the best new episode I've seen
since the show that had Beck. It was terrific, especially if you're a fan
of Randy "Macho Man" Savage (and why wouldn't you be?).<br>
Okay, that's quite a lot, even if I didn't really philosophize about
anything. But in case you haven't heard from me in a while, at least
you'll know what I've been up to.<br>

Hi, there. This is the first
installment in what I hope will be a
continuous piece. Instead of typing up a brand new page every year or so,
letting everything remain stagnant except for occasional reviews and show
announcements, I thought it would be better to occasionally just write
about whatever I want to. That way, there's something new, and something
that I might not otherwise be inclined to devote a whole page to. At other
times, I may just write a selected review or 2 and give shoutouts to
whatever strikes my fancy at that particular moment. Unpredictability,
what more could you want?<br>
As for what's been going on with me lately, I've just been going to school
and attending shows as usual. Artists currently on my mental top 40
include the High Llamas, DJ Shadow, and Can. Can has been one of those
bands I've read about numerous times in the past, but just have never done
anything about it until recently. I bought <b>Tago Mago</b>, which has
really been fascinating me. It's not exactly as I pictured them to sound
(not as crazy/experimental as I imagined), but it has blown me away on
several different levels. And it came out in '71, too! Also, I've been
looking for <u>Blonde on Blonde</u> by Dylan on vinyl (for "Sad Eyed Lady
of the Lowlands"), and after being unsuccessful at the major record shops
in Atlanta, I found it for $5.99 at a record show! Yay!<br>
I haven't really been reading many comics lately. Maybe it's just me, but
there just hasn't been much out there that looks terribly interesting.
Well, the new <u>Nowhere</u> is out, which I've been wanting to read, but
I decided I couldn't afford it. So instead I bought the new <u>Acme
Novelty Library</u>. I don't know, I have some mixed feelings about the
comic. I absolutely love Chris Ware's artwork. Everything about it is so
appealing (the colors, the right amount of detail, and of course the
various formats). But as for the stories, while I try to understand them,
I don't know if I say that I like ANL because I get into it or because
everyone else says it's cool. It's almost definitely the most pretentious
thing I get down at Criminal. Everyone regards Ware as a genious, and
while I think I would agree, I would do so a little hesitantly. To me,
it's a little like Chester Brown. <u>Underwater</b> confounded a helluva
lot of people upon it's release 2 years ago. People quickly wrote it off
as just being gibberish, and while it definitely seemed that way, it is
slowly but surely turning into a work that marks it as truely original.
Things are starting to make sense now. As for the tale of Jimmy Corrigan,
it's a struggle to stay with the narrative, particularly when Ware jumps
from the 1800s to the 1990s without a major style separating them (after
all, every Corrigan has that homely look). I can make sense out of some of
it, and I can identify with some of it as well, but there are just some
parts that bewilder me to death. I stare at a particular panel with text
that seems unconnected, and I try to figure out what significance it has.
Maybe I'm just slow, and everybody else has it figured out, I can't really
say since I don't talk to other people who read this title. I occasionally
go back and reread them, and I gather new wisdom sometimes, but others I
get even less of a grasp of what's going on!  Who's to say? If you have
any particular ideas of Chris Ware and why he is or isn't a modern-day
genius, please let me know. I'm still trying to make up my mind. Of
course he's one of the most interesting people on the scene, of that I
have no doubt, but I don't know if he's someone who'll go down in history.
Maybe I'm showing off my ignorance here, I don't know. Then again, to show
it off, I need an audience to do so. So go ahead, make me an idiot!<br>
I guess I don't have a need to say anything else right now. Oh shit, I
just forgot, Bach on a Hook is playing Live @ WREK tonight, and I don't
have a tape to record it with! I guess I'd better get to my room to listen
to it. Until I decide to write again, I depart.<br>
