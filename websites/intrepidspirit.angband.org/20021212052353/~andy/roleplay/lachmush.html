<h4> "I deal in the only thing of worth. Information. I hear every 
breath whispered on these city street, see every dark act 
concealed beneath the dangerous night. The <B>only</B> secrets
safe in this city are those I keep." </h4>
<P>
Much like her tabletop counterpart, the Shadowrun MUSH Lachesis is a cold,
ruthless predator.  Thriving off information, she somehow manages to glean
off details concerning virtually every run that goes down in Seattle, yet
still hide her knowledge from the outside world.
</p>
<P>
Lachesis veils herself in a mist of secrecy and mystery.  She has no qualms
against others knowing her identity - in fact, she strives to ensure both
Seattle's sociallite and shadowy communities are well versed in her name.
But, although she revels in the glamor and prestige she has built for
herself, she makes it a point that none of her quasi-legal deeds slip into
the topic of conversation. After all, the man who just bought her a drink
could very well work for the Star itself.  She has become an odd paradox:
A "legend" with no history to speak of.
</P>
<P>
Continuously walking the fine line between Safety and Danger, Lachesis's
downfall will inevitably be her own curiousity. She has narrowly escaped
death countless times (much to my surprise), although each time it was her
restless curiousity that put her in such a difficult position. She's learned
that some information isn't worth having, but her insatiable streak of
"grinning wickedness" is still there... deeply buried, but waiting to
reemerge.
