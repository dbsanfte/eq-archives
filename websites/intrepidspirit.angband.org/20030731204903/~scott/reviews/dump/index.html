Dump-That Skinny Motherfucker With The High Voice? (Shrimper)
...in which James McNew takes on the compositions of one Prince Rogers
Nelson in the name of indie-rock...and wins! This is a reissue of a
cassette Shrimper put out a couple of years ago, but with 5 more tracks
added. Obvious and less-than-obvious tunes from the Purple One's career
are given new twists, most enticingly on the fuckin' trash guitar epic
"Erotic City" and the aching Spectoresque redo of "When You Were Mine". We
all knew James was a lovable indie icon from Yo La Tengo, but who knew he
was such a sexy motherfucker???
