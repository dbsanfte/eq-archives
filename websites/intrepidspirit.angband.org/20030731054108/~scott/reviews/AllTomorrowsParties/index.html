Various Artists-All Tomorrow's Parties
Touch And Go Records
Rating: 3/6

In case you're not aware, All Tomorrow's Parties is a festival in the UK
(and now in the US too) in which a featured group is allowed to curate a
weekend of shows to their liking. The 2001 pick for the UK Festival was
Tortoise, and this album commemmorates the event with (mostly) previously
unreleased tracks by some of the bands who performed. Let's go into
play-by-play mode, shall we?

The Sea And Cake kick it off with a remix of their song "Bird And
Flag." Sheesh, how much worse can this band get? I remember the days when
they were a pertty charming guitar-pop quartet, but one listen to this
faux-funky remix and "charming" is the last word that comes to
mind. (Ex?-) local talent Prefuse 73 saves the dreck with a pretty cool
soul deconstruction--you can tell his heart is in this, unlike
tSaC. Broadcast are up next, with an atypical insturmental that sounds
like an electronic Neu! on a drunken Oktoberfest evening--fun stuff! But
Calexico dulls is back again with a sound reminsicent of Rachel's on
codeine with some big dumb drums on top. Yo La Tengo know how to properly
play it mellow (what a rollercoaster of consistency this album is), and
they offer a live version of "Our Way To Fall" with Other Dimensions In
Music adding a nice touch on reeds, which is followed by a warm midnight
journey through the cosmic midwest courtesy of Rick Rizzo & Tara
Key. Black Heart Procession is a good band, but this version of
"Waterfront" doesn't do much justice. And that's where this rollercoaster
starts to make its fatal plunge.

Tortoise provides their 15-minute "Cliff Dweller Society", their 1994
contribution to Stereolab's Duophonic label. And true, this was prior to
their album TNT (worst album of the 90s), but its just a messy song suite
that was done about 100 times better on their "Djed". Mike Ladd offers
some heavy soul rock which is somehow even worse than it sounds. Boards Of
Canada offer a brief gasp of Air (that's a pun, folks) before we go to
Atmosphere who appropriately dose us up with smog (another pun but not on
Bill Callahan). Do the compilers really think they were being eclectic by
putting this more-uptempo Blessid Union Of Souls bullshit on
here? Cannibal Ox sounds comparatively fresh and much less cliche-ridden
following this atrocity, even if the track isn't necessarily my style. And
on the rollercoaster analogy, we're back up for the loop-the-loop
finale. Autechre realize that the noise is just as important as the beats,
and they practice this rather well on their Yars' Revenge-ish track. And
finally, Russell Haswell (who I have no frickin' clue about,
honestly) offers an electro-acoustic blast to close the album. It sounds
like a hibernating robot that has just woken up in your stereo, and he
wants OUT!

So there's a fair amount of good, but an unfairer amount of bad. I guess
it comes down to how you feel about riding on a rollercoaster with a shaky
controller at the helm just after you eat. If you really get off on the
thrills offered, I mean really get off, you'll force yourself to enjoy it
regardless. But unless you're absolutely sure, I wouldn't wager it--unless
you're willing to vomit for it.
