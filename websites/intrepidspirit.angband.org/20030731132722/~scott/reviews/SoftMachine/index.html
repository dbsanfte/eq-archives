The Soft Machine-Man In A Deaf Corner (Anthology 1963-1970)
Mooncrest Records
2/6

The Soft Machine was probably the last great British band of the 60s, in
my eyes. Everything that gets me all hot 'n bothered about music can be
found in their first 3 albums--unique sound, influences from pop music to
free jazz, and that all-important sense of humor. Of course, the group
started to lose the latter once they forbade drummer Robert Wyatt to
sing. Given that Wyatt's angelic voice is one of the greatest of the last
50 years, I'm sure they'll be damned for all eternity due to that
decision. Nonetheless the first two albums rank among the very best
British psychedelia, and their third is a landmark of the nether regions
that surround jazz, experimental composition, and rock. So what does all
of this have to do with "Man In A Deaf Corner"? Not a whole heckuva-lot,
to be quite honest.

This set covers mostly live performances, from 5 years before their debut
to the "Third" era. It begins with 6 tracks from the group's free jazz
origin, the first time any of this has been officially heard. And it's
no crime that this is only made available 40 years down the line, as its
not very special. But hey, they were only teenagers at the time (excepting
future Gong-head Daevid Allen, who contributes some godawful guitar on one
track) so I'll cut 'em some slack. Mike Ratledge isn't that bad with his
cross-pollination of Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor, and the tune
"Orientasian", with Wyatt on guitar and set compiler Brian Hopper on
Coltrane-style soprano sax, is actually pretty nice. After this
introdution, we are suddenly transported to swinging London four years
later, where we "hear" some of the repertoire that would make up their
first album--well, we can't actually hear Kevin Ayers' rich baritone due
to the sound quality, and the bombastic 13-minute "Hope for
Happiness" reveals what it would have sounded like it Ratledge had pawned
off his Lowrey organ in exchange for an industrial vacuum cleaner.

Then we jump to what is by far the best segment of the collection, a live
set from 1969 in the Wyatt/Ratledge/Hugh Hopper group that made "Volume
2." Its a run-through of most of that album, and while the studio work
remains the standard, the set is still great. However, this performance
has been issued in the past (with another song, the wonderful "As Long As
He Lies perfectly Still", which was maddeningly omitted on this set for
some reason) as "Live At The Paradiso 1969". The Set concludes with some
dates when they shifted into a jazz vein and added saxophones. There are
presently at least 4 or 5 live albums of this era in print, and all of
them sound MUCH better than these glorified boom-box recordings. And
strangely, the album ends with a recent cover version of the
aforementioned "As Long As He Lies Perfectly Still" by some Wyatt wannabe
who wranged Hugh Hopper and Dave Stewart (not the Eurhythmics guy, the
Hatfield & The North guy) into the deal. Y'got me...

Overall, this set just seems like a way to milk more cash out of Soft
Machine obsessives. And I'm sure it will work (it did for me), and the
world will move on. The danger lies in the curious outsider who might see
that pesky word "Anthology" and thnk this could be the place for a healthy
overview. Well, it ain't. Try the "Volumes 1 & 2" two-fer if you're
interested in vocals, or "Third" if you want instrumentation. Then, if you
want more, buy the other one. Then, "The Peel Sessions" for some great
live music. Then, look for a bootleg with their first single. Then, the
"Paradiso" album. After that, the live quintet album "Noisette." And then,
maybe you'll be ready for this...In this post-Beatles society, I guess
"Anthology" is now defined as "of purely historical value"...
