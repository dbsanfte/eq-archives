<b>Sinatra at the Sands</b>

Sinatra dies.
(And at twenty-seven eleven people
from your graduating class in college
won't be at the reunion for reasons that are out of their control.
They're dead.)

And it's not fair, it's not right.
The world should treat you with more respect.
You should get to live as long as you like.
You should see Sinatra at the Sands.
You really should.
Would change your life.
Maybe you would start doing it your way.
Maybe you'd own a casino
or direct your own movies
or sing at Madison Square Garden.
Maybe you'd be borderline psychologically problematic.
Maybe you wouldn't give much of a damn
if anyone thinks you're a bit too aggressive
for being a girl.
(And as it stands you're more aggressive than all the boys too.)
And some shrink wants to write a book about you.
But you tell him to take a number,
seeing as there's an entire school of philosophy
that's emerging out of your attack on life.
You find that you hang your ass out on that line so much
that they give you the whole damn line.
And you get to rival Nixon on all issues of rejection.
You get to fail and win in one lifetime
more times than most people brush their teeth.
You'll be sent to Rome just to spit in Trevi fountain.
You call the Pope, just to call the Pope.
You get famous and infamous, try out all religions,
change your name once or twice
and live next door to "Controversy," "Scandal," and
"One Hell of a Good Time."

You live and love and chew gum
a little too provocatively.
You're seductive to your own shoelaces.
Maybe you have no honor to defend
so you stop asking other people to defend it.
(But they'll want to…ever so secretly.)
They'll warn their children about you.
They'll re-release the song about not letting your babies
grow up to be cowboys.
Only, this time, you'll be the cowboy.
But behind all this fear and trash-talking to the kiddies,
they'll all go to your parade.
Every last one of them will be there.

At the end when you're laid up
in some Tibetan monastery and the Pope
has flown in for your last rights
(even though you're long since being Catholic),
people will be crying and wanting to know
why you led such an extraordinary life.
All you'll have that's really worth saying is,
"Sinatra died when I was twenty-seven.
I never saw him at the Sands.
But let the record show,
I took the blows,
and I did it my way."
