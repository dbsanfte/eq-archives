<b>"The Center"</b>
("Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing
there, said to His mother, "Woman, see your son!" John 19:26)

see the center of turbulent pain,
the dizzying agony like a top barely tottering at
the end of a schoolboy's string

see the hurricane fury,
the battering of needle-like shafts of rain,
diagonal rays in sheet after sheet of suffering

see the cyclone on display,
a world destroyed in a single body,
killer waves upheave over the perfect soul

hear the mournful thunder,
like a grieving father's moan,
watching the burial of an only son

see the angry flashes in the wrathful sky,
blinding the perfect eyes, single vision,
of the perfect son buried in sin's residue

see the eyes that see in that agony
with love's unbearable beam,
hear the voice that quivers in the pain

see the eyes that see His mother's ache,
with lines etched by trust and puzzlement
over a perfect Son's determined dying

hear the voice that commanded friends from the grave,
that pounded waves into silent submission,
that demanded demons flee their dungeons

hear the voice now strangled but strong,
nearly silenced by the suffering, speak
with the same tone He used with banned children

"Mother, your son"
eyelids nearly failing in death, tongue parched,
the same tone to His beloved friend,

"see your Mother"
and died with the words still flying above
the heads of the divided crowd


Jesus, teach me Your "other-love",
mark p.
