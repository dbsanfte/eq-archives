<p><B>I'm familiar with many roleplaying systems, and I've played an
extensive range of characters. Although a few were one night affairs
designed to just test the waters, most are extremely concrete entities
with a variety of facets and much depth.  Here's my favorite characters,
ranked in order of importance to me. Click on each character to view their
world from their eyes.

<H3> Campaigns I've Run </H3>
<P>
The list of campaigns I've run is not terribly long.  The biggest and
longest I've run is a Shadowrun campaign about four years ago. Five runners
composed the team, the most prominient being Silas Silver, a Raccoon 
shaman who, like the rural myths of his totem, could not let go of any
silver he got his hands on. He was accompanied by Mainframe, a quiet decker
capable of cutting through any ice that got in her way. A few grunts
(Cremesickle - physical adept, Ziggy Stardust - street mage, and Spirit -
noncybered injun) composed the rest of the team.

The second campaign I've run was a TORG campaign. I love this system.
Unfortunately, attendance abruptly dropped to two characters: Endo, the
macho gun-packing lady-killing muscle-bound brawn of the party, and
Illinois Johnson, a fast-talking, studious, clever, multi-multilingual
adventurous scholar. The two perfectly complemented each other and came
quite close to bringing the Ashakans to earth. However, the campaign ended.
