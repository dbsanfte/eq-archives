<center><h2>Best Comics (Alphabetically)</h2></center>
1. <b><I>The Acme Novelty Library #7</I> by Chris Ware
(Fantagraphics)</b>-this giant-size issue did have to come out on one of
the rainiest days this past summer. Thankfully, Eric double-bagged it for
me, and it made it home fine, all the better for me to read a bunch of big
"sad" comics. Sad, you say? But the outside proclaims #7 to be the book of
jokes! Well, you’re right. The text, as usual, is great, as are the phony
advertisements (Success Brand Snort), and whaddayaknow, there’s even a
funny Rocket Sam in here, too! So I guess it’s unusual to have almost all
of the stories tragic instead of the usual all tragic. This issue is a
collection of one page strips that usually get to the point quick, mainly
featuring Rocket Sam, Big Tex, Superman (or God, however Chris refers to
him)< and there’s even one Jimmy Corrigan strip in which our hapless hero
enters the zine world. Ware also gives us the constellations according to
the Acme Novelty Library, and the do-it-yourself kits include little books
of Big Tex, Quimby the Mouse, the Dad puzzle and the Mom game, Rocket
Sam’s spaceship, and even your very own Acme Novelty Library! It’s a
shame, though, since I don’t want to cut up this lavish, beautifully
illustrated issue and I can’t go around throwing out $6.95 whenever I want
to. It’s okay, though, since there’s so much more to this series than just
the cutouts. This is the glory of comics, ladies and gentlemen.<br>
2. <b><I>Optic Nerve #3</I> by Adrian Tomine (Drawn & Quarterly)</b>-quite
a sad streak running so far, I must say. As opposed to Chris Ware’s
surrealist expressions, Adrian writes real-life situations that can really
screw you up. How can anyone not identify with his tales of woe? "Dylan &
Donovan", despite its slightly incestuous undertone (no, not in that
implied meaning of the term, I’m referring to a father taking his
daughters to a comic convention), hits so closer to home in so many ways
that I can’t even go into it. "Hostage Situation" represents an emotion I
felt quite often in high school, of being around jerks yelling stupid
things and feeling helpless to try to change the situation. But the most
tragic story in my opinion is "Supermarket". I read this for the first
time while I was on my lunch break, and when I came back I felt like a
different person. It’s not lengthy, and it’s not complex, so I won’t go
into it, but it killed me when I read it. The issue actually ends on an
upbeat note with the brief "Unfaded". Did I mention that Adrian’s drawing
it better than ever, as well as his storytelling? To be honest, I think
he’s the master of this particular genre. I even thought that Clowes’
recent installment of "Ghost World" had a Tomine influence, in
turn-of-the-tables fashion, but it didn’t measure up. <b>The</b>
indispensable Optic Nerve you must own.<br>
3. <b><I>Palookaville #9</I> by Seth (Drawn & Quarterly)</b>-the
inevitable
end to the fascinating "It’s A Good Life If You Don’t Weaken" storyline ,
in which Seth finally finds contact with Kalo’s relatives. Seth is simply
one of the best working today, with this comic making me feel like I’m in
front of a warm fire as the earth is being pelted with snow. While there
is a tinge of melancholia, the overall story leaves a good feeling, as
well as even adding some in-the-know humor (‘tho I bet Joe Matt is cursing
over page 8). Sure, Seth may not have been able to get what he was looking
for, but he got (in my opinion) something more. An elegance and style
unlike any other item on the market, Palookaville is one of the best
things in comics, as well as in life (By the way this story started in
issue 4, for the uninitiated).<br>
