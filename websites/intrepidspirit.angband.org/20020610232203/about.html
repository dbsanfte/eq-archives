Four years ago students began arriving in a dormitory that might be best
described as a roach infested abomination from the nether regions of the
Abyss.  These students began to become friends, while wearing the title
of freshman.  As time passed they became better friends and met new and
weirder people.  Those they met often became dubbed Grimstari.  The 
title Grimstari was loosely associated with quite a few people.  The 
true born members of the Grimstari, decided they needed to act on their
new found prominence.  
</p>
<p>
The Grimstari then created a newsgroup for themselves.  This allowed ease
of communication and an easy way to spread their gospel.  Soon after the
creation of this newsgroup, they saw a need for more powerful computing
resources.  They created <font color="FF0000">Angband</font>.  Angband quite 
quickly grew in different directions from the Grimstari.  Eventually 
they would be two unique entities tied bound tightly together at the 
core.  The Grimstari created Angband and continue to exist within the 
realm of Georgia Tech.  Angband exists within the realm of Georgia 
Tech, but it also goes far beyond.
</p>
<p>
The Grimstari and Angband do have many crossovers.  For example Angband
won the Grimstari Computer of the Year Award.  As coincidences would have 
it, Angband was also the server that tabulated votes for this Awards 
program.  Angband's most valuable asset is the people who run it.  We 
want Angband to be a user friendly environment so instead of forcing 
computer restrictions we simply have one rule, &quot;If you don't abuse, we 
won't abuse.&quot;  Basically users are free to do whatever they want on 
Angband.  If they start to abuse their rights, then we will request they
stop.  This seems to work very well.  With this attitude in mind, most 
of users have come to really appreciate Angband, for it provides a much
nicer and free computing environment.  Though occasionally an abrasive
user will call down the wrath of the <a href="/~chris">Sys-Admin Nazi</a>.
</p>
<p>
As time passed some more, we realized that Angband had a great deal of 
potential.  At this time we began to seek out things we could add to 
Angband in hopes of providing a service to the Internet.  We started to
add users who needed a place to put their professional webpages.  In time
we decided to organize our efforts to expand.  Our random emailing of 
people offering accounts wasn't really getting us anywhere.  People often
accepted the accounts, but never used them.  So in a concerted effort to
expand our horizons, the Grimstari created <font color="FF0000">Angband 
Across America</font>, and purchased the *.angband.org domain.  We hope 
that things will continue to progress as time passes.
</p>
<h2>Grimstari History:</h2>
<p>
It all started on a stormy night in a small dorm room.  It was hailing so
strong outside vehicles were being torn asunder.  With a maniacal cackle
the mage finished his spell and the room erupted in flame.  From within 
the flame arose a small green little man ( or others claim a tall horned 
warrior ).  One thing everyone agrees on is that he talks funny.  He spoke
to us in a whispering voice, &quot;Grimlock no like proof by induction.&quot;
Thus the first miracle had occured.
</p>
<p>
As time passed and worship of Grimlock became a major part of our lives, we
felt a need to go public, as the Disciples of Grimlock.  Unfortunately we 
needed a name to confront the public with, and DoG just did not size up 
with our needs.  Grimlock spoke to us once again and proclaimed, "Honor 
Tolkien, write good books he does."  After perusing Mr. Tolkien's excellent
literature we discovered the Istari.  In honor of them and in honor of 
Grimlock, we dubbed ourselves Grimstari.  
</p>
<p>
At first we decided to spread the word of Grimlock amongst our fellow geeks
upon this Earth by a game known as Quake.  We soon grew tired of this game.
We then discovered that we had a cult like following on a usenet newsgroup
dedicated to Quake.  We decided that using a Quake newsgroup for spreading
the word of Grimlock was blasphemy so we created the 
<a href="news:git.talk.grimstari">Grimstari Newsgroup</a>.  As time passed
many young geeks joined the folds of the Grimstari.  In an attempt to 
strengthen the young, the true born made a great sacrifice and became 
martyrs to the cause.  Their actions of sacrifice live as models for the
new comers to emulate.  In time all will learn the lessons of self 
sacrifice.
