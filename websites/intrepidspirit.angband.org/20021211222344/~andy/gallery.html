Welcome to my makeshift photo gallery.  You're asking, 'Where are the
pictures?' There's three sets of pictures:  one gallery is a virtual
scrapbook from the second annual Mux party in Patterson.  Another is a
bunch of spare pictures I got scanned, and the third is a bunch of
pictures from Psi-Force, the coolest comic ever.</p>
<P>That's all.  Choose your poison.</p>
