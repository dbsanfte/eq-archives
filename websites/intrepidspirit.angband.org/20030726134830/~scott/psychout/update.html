<b>Dec 24, 2002></b>-i'm temporarily home for the holidays (just one day
really--off to japan again very soon--but i can finally do a few things
that had to be done--fixed a couple of broken links on the links page, and
i'd like to add more but i don't have time at the present--maybe later
tonight...thanks very much for another year of listening and being there,
and i'll see you in 2003! oh, one more thing--the 12/30 show will be a
special 2-HOUR BROADCAST done by my friend justin kau--justin should be
able to provide a great show, and the ska guys at 54-46 graciously donated
their hour to the cause too, so be sure to listen in at 10pm instead of
the normal 11pm on the wrek site in order to hear the show in all its
glory...merry happy to you and yours...

<b>Oct 7, 2002</b>-updated the robot vs rabbit link, and added a new radio
link--and now, just a few more days until terrastock! see you
there...<br><br>

<b>Jul 29, 2002</b>-nothing to really update (other than the
<b>landing</b> show was great!), but tonight's show is my 1-year
anniversary & i just wanted to thank callers for calling, listeners for
listening, and page-hitters for, umm, page-hitting. shout-out thanks go to
(in no order): scott fisk, ashe, needs more thrutch, son of c.o.d., milton
jones, holli estile & beau from post-script, chris from strange
attractors, neil campbell, greg segal, tim from sundazed, mark from robot
vs rabbit, glenn from the jewelled antler collective, melissa from mother
west, psychatrone rhonedakk, mats gustaffson & the broken face, katherine
schweigert, tim king, marshall avett & kiss my grits, kawabata makoto and
acid mothers temple, and needless to say the former satomi osawa...thanks
once again!<br><br>

<b>Jul 15, 2002</b>-yeah, its been slack lately, but that's how life goes
when you don't have a computer...the only time i can do anything on this
site is when i'm here at WREK, and my show's on the air as i type this, so
i'm already pretty busy at it is! maybe one day i'll finish that damned
philosophy of mine...in the meantime, i started up the mailing list idea,
which is something i consistently do every week anyway, to the few people
who have expressed interest (and even some who haven't!). if you're
curious, just write and i'll put you on...<br><br>

<b>Apr 26, 2002</b>-sorry i wasn't on the air this week, but i was off
getting married! yeah, i married my girlfriend satomi in tokyo, so
naturally i couldn't be at the show (i was exploring the buddhist temple
hasedura in the old capital town of kamakura while my show was on)--thanks
to the 54-46 guys for filling in. anyway, i just wanted to say that i
added some upcoming shows to the show page, namely yume bitsu, robot vs
rabbit, and oneida--may is going to be a good month for atlanta...<br><br>

<b>Mar 20, 2002</b>-took off the info on the acid mothers stuff, since its
now a thing of the cherished past. needless to say, acid mothers temple &
major stars fulfilled all of my wishes with their amazing sets monday
night at the eyedrum. this is the show to beat for 2002--i was going to
see a show tonight, but now i have no desire--i just want to coast off of
this show for a little while...hope you made it to the show. and both
bands were very nice, too! always a nice bonus...maybe i'll scan my images
of me with kawabata and the one of me, higashi, tsuyama, and cotton when
the pictures get developed...ahh, still remembering...<br><br>

<b>Mar 15, 2002</b>-i added a couple of more links and gave descriptions
to the links i added last week too. plus i found out about the super
furry animals coming to town next month! and in case i don't write anymore
anytime
soon, come to the eyedrum monday for the acid mothers temple show! check
out the snazzy DIY "psych-out" bookmarks that will be at the door, and say
hey to me if you want--i'll be the one with the cute japanese girl there
that isn't cotton casino...<br><br>

<b>Mar 9, 2002</b>-put some more links up on my links page,
appropriately. i hope to get some descriptions soon.<br><br>

<b>Mar 4, 2002</b>-added more info on the acid mothers temple sunday
special i'm hosting on the 17th. listen!<br><br>

<b>Mar 2, 2002</b>-added information on the damo suzuki/cul de sac show. i
won't be able to give away any passes to the show (in all
likelihood), but nonetheless its an essential show!<br><br>

<b>Feb 17,
2002</b>-created
this update thing, so you'll know when i
add something new. since i weekly update my playlist, i won't bother
mentioning that...this weekend, i started the first half of my
"philosophy", and hopefully i'll get around to finishing it soon. i also
deleted the sunshine fix show from the show listing, since it happened
this past friday--i was there. i caught the very end of 3d5spd--didn't
hear enough to make a real impression of their set. the gerbils had some
decent psych-pop moments, but they played too long. they were all right
musically, but i don't care for the vocals--one of those indie things
where two not-so-good voices try to compensate by doubling up and singing
in a higher-end range--and drug songs come across to me like cheech n'
chong movies...sunshine fix was pretty good. more of an early-70s warner
brothers vibe than i was expecting, perhaps due to ex-hayride guitarist
kevin sweeney being in the group--in fact, they sounded like hayride to me
except with lennon singing...okay, thats not really an "update", but i
don't have a concert review section so that'll do for here...
