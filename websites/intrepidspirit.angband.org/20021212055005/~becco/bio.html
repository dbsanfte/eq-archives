(needs to be updated)<BR>
Let me tell you a little about myself (the serious stuff):
<UL>

<LI> I graduated this past spring with a degree in <A
HREF=http://www.gatech.edu/biology/>Biology</A> from
<A HREF="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</A>, in the Molecular
Genetics/ Molecular Biology track, and earned certificates in
Biochemistry and Social Psychology.
<LI>I am in my second year of medical school at the <A
HREF="http://www.comed.uky.edu/medicine/welcome.html"> University of
Kentucky School of Medicine</A>. It is hard work, but I love it- I know I
am doing the right thing.
</UL> 

<P>Random Info About Me (the fun stuff):
<br>
<UL>
<LI>My favorite color is blue. And lots of stuff I own is blue. And I
really love things that are the same color as my Beetle!
<LI><B> I am a natural blond. Never dyed it, never will!</B>
<LI>I like running and swimming, and try to find time for them.
<LI>I also love music- I have played four instruments (oops! five- i
recently started playing the electric bass) and I am pretty much
addicted to music. What kind? Thanks for asking...
 I have a page of <A HREF="bands.html"> band links</A>. There are a lot
that I still need to add...and maybe some to remove!
<LI>I have the COOLEST birthday-
<A HREF="http://latino.sscnet.ucla.edu/demo/cinco.html"> Cinco de
Mayo</A>, making me a Taurus!
<LI>I LOVE to travel- I have been to Europe a bunch, but there is still
lots to see. I am dying to roam around out in the American west.
