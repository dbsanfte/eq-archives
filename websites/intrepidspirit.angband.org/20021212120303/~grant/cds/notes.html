<b>Notes for Grant's List O' Bootlegs</b>
<br><br>
1: One channel cuts out for the first few songs of the first set.  This CD
was gotten from a tree, so copies without this problem are somewhat
rare.<br><br>
2: When transferred to CD-R, the order of these shows was messed up,
leaving songs from one day on the next day's CD and so forth.  Probably
not tradeable.<br><br>
3: This has been made into an official release by the band, and is no
longer for trade.<br><br>
