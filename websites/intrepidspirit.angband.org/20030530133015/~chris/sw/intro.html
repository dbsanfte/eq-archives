<center><h2>Episode III: Shadow Ascendant</h2></center>

With the reigns of power firmly in his hands, Emperor Palpatine continued to
consolidate his position by seeking to expand the military even further as
Confederate resistance crumbles to nothingness.  The general populace, flush
with liberation and victory, wildly support the new Emperor in his
efforts<br>
<br>
Behind the giddy thrill of triumph, Imperial agents fan out across the
galaxy seeking those who would return to the old ways of the Republic.
Special Imperial Death Squads begin to hunt down the Jedi and their allies,
seeking to turn them to the service of the Emperor, or destroy them.  In the
early days of the purge, references to Jedis' service to the Republic are
stricken from the histories, consigning them to be a footnote in history.
In a matter of years, the Jedi will become a mythic band that never actually
was, so thorough are the Imperial Agents.  Those who protest against this
quickly disappear.<br>
<br>
As the march of time crushes the Jedi under the jackboot of anonymity, a
more sinister malaise takes hold in the populace.  Distrust, fear, and
xenophobia all erupt as the memories of the Jedi fade.  As the Emperor's
less than altruistic plans begin to unfold, small bands of partisans begin to
band together, fanning the flames of discontent.<br>
<br>
The small rebel groups, frustrated by the magnitude of their foe and doomed
to failure, seem desperate for a hero to unify their cause...
