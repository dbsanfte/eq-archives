<center><h2>Most Intriguing Releases (Alphabetically)</center></h2>
1. <b>8-Crash Landing (Half Baked)</b>-quite possibly the strangest
release ever put out from our fair city, 8 gives you a reason to hope for
the future of music. A noise band without really being noisy, they
understand patience, which too few bands grasp, especially when it comes
to noise. For the ultimate experience, listen to this while driving
through the middle of nowhere. If it doesn't raise your pulse, you're
either deaf or dead.<br>
2. <b>Harvey Milk-My Love Is Higher Than Your Assessment Of What My Love
Could Be (Yesha)</b>-as I have mentioned previously, this disc could be
called the Sybil of all heavy metal albums. Going back and forth between
deep minimalist rock and classical as well as several other genres, this
is the most confusing thing these boys have ever put out. And that's a
good thing.<br>
3. <b>Masada Chamber Ensembles-Bar Kokhba (Tzadik)</b>-2 Cds of moving,
"radical Jewish culture". Very structured, this is reminiscent of a
classical piece, even though you'll find it in the jazz section. By the
way, there is no saxophone on this album, nor is John Zorn on it, but he
did write all of it. This is great for melancholy days, or studying. The
emotions of the players shine through the pieces, which says much about
the group Zorn assembled. Inspiring.<br>
4. <b>Sun Ra-The Singles (Evidence)</b>-unbeknownst to me, Sun Ra and his
variuos Arkestras put out singles. Of course, they were extremely rare, or
else they wouldn't have been Ra releases. All of the known singles have
been collected for this 2 CD release, and it is pretty diverse. I bet you
didn't know that Sun Ra was recording with doo-wop singers, did you? Disc
1 deals with this, and it's okay, but disc 2 is the strong point. What
with the Mars deal this year and this collection, the cosmos has never
been more intriguing.<br>
