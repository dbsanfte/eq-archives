<h3>Bands</h3>

<a href="http://www.acidmothers.com">Acid Mothers Temple</a>-Japanese
high-flyers led by the ubiquitous Kawabata
Makoto (Mainliner/Musica Transonic/Toho Sara/<insert band name
here>). Expect everything from takes on Occitanian folk music to freeform
freakouts...also noteworthy is their <a
href="http://bbs12.otd.co.jp/amtbbs/bbs_plain">message board</a><br>

<a href="http://www.gorkys.com">Gorky's Zygotic Mynci</a>-they may not
be
all that relevant to my show nowadays, but there was a time when they
were
the best psych-pop band active. Now they're just the best pop band. Not
necessarily a step downward...<br>

<a href="http://www.robotvsrabbit.net">Robot Vs. Rabbit</a>-this band, 
out of Kannapolis NC, contacted me since they thought I might be
interested in their music. To my pleasant surprise, I was. A drone
ensemble that definitely rewards those with curious ears.<br>

<a href="http://www.superfurry.com/">Super Furry Animals</a>-my
current-day psych-pop favorites, although they really diversify
themselves among many different genres. And I love anyone who names an 
album "Mwng"...<br>

<a href="http://users.macunlimited.net/mflower/">The
Vibracathedral Orchestra</a>-Neil Campbell's great drone group from
the UK. He described their music in <i>The Broken Face</i> as "a small 
group of notes but a large selection of instruments." There y'go...<br>

<a
href="http://www.brainwashed.com/vtb/vtb.html">Volcano The Bear</a>-my
current
favorite
for British eccentricity. I was willing to take a day off from work and
drive in the horrid rain one week after a massive rainy carcrash to Athens
to see this band, who i had never heard before. Needless to say, I wasn't
disappointed. Is this music? Is it ever!<br>

<h3>Radio</h3>
<a href="http://www.wrek.org">WREK 91.1 FM Atlanta</a>-since 1968, the #1
station in Atlanta and, dare I say, the world!<br>
<a href="http://www.wras.org">WRAS 88.5 FM Atlanta</a>-the monolith of
Atlanta radio. Not broadcasting on the web, but if you're in the city
limits check out Post-Script (spacerock) and Entering The Aquarian Age
(esoterica)!<br>
<a href="http://radiofree.homestead.com/">Idiot Control</a>-a weekly
broadcast out of Princeton NJ that is strikingly similar to Psych-Out (or
the other way around)--of course thats a good thing...<br>
<a href="http://www.tafcommedia.net/homecenter.htm">Radio Free
Kansas</a>-a site that contains links to some psych/prog
shows. Psych-Out used to be listed on the page, can't find it anymore,
but its still a worthy link...<br>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com/main/main.html">Aural
Innovations</a>-a webzine concerned with psych, space, prog, etc,
usually emphasizing lesser known groups. <br>
<a href="http://brokenface.fupp.net/index.html">The Broken
Face</a>-perhaps the zine that comes the closest to examining my
favorite music. This is a Swedish publication put out by Mats
Gustaffson (no, not that one), and covers the avant-psych scene to a
T, as well as featuring the pop bands I love. Authoritative.<br> 
<a
href="http://www.vcn.bc.ca/sig/htmlsig/psychome.htm">The
Psychedelicatessen</a> - very comprehensive site!<br>
<a href="http://www.terrascope.org/home.html">The Ptolemaic
Terrascope</a>-and of course you can't forget the Terrascope. 31
issues strong as of my typing this, and they still do a pretty bang-up 
job. It seems easier to make it through the "Rumbles" section these
days, too...<br> 
<a href="http://www.stompandstammer.com">Stomp
And Stammer</a>-the lone Atlanta publication that gets it right. Of
course, I also write for them, but of course there's no conflict of
interest there...<br> 
<a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk">The Wire</a>-the world's leading
resource on the experimental music of today. Not really a psych zine,
but there's other great areas of music to explore too...but David
Keenan does a stellar job of writing up the latest Japanese psych
releases too...<br>

<h3>Record Labels & Distributors</h3>
<a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/">Aquarius Records</a>-San
Francisco store that continues to write the most entertaining
consistently-paced email
update list around. I feel like I know these kids! Home of the tUMULt
label too, which has put out some worthwhile music.<br>
<a href="http://www.blrrecords.com/">Bela-Lactam Ring
Records</a>-interesting label that has released music by Volcano The
Bear, Rick Reed, etc. Home of the curious Lacta-mase 10" series.<br>
<a href="http://www.cameraobscura.com.au/">Camera Obscura
Records</a>-Australian label that has been canonized for its reissuing 
of the Black Sun Ensemble debut, but of course you can find good stuff 
from Abunai!, The Black Swan Network, and others here...<br> 
<a
href="http://www.eclipse-records.com">Eclipse</a>-amazing
distributor, a nice guy, and on top of everything else, a top-notch
label issuing quality music from acid mothers temple, migrantes, pelt, 
etc.<br> 
<a href="http://soundexchangehouston.com/fleece/">Fleece
Records</a>-documenters of the Houston psych scene, still going on
strong today as evidenced by groups like Dunlavy.<br> 
<a
href="http://www.forcedexposure.com">Forced Exposure</a>-the
godfathers of post-everything music. Is there anyone alive who hasn't
ordered from them before?<br>
<a href="http://www.fractal-records.com/">Fractal Records</a>-French
label that keeps getting better and better with their CV, from
previously unearthed gems by Ilitch to modern-day Kawabata
extravaganzas, and even non-psych oriented stuff like some great
Xenakis reissues!<br>
<a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com/mailord/god.html">Garden Of
Delights</a>-a site hosted by Aural Innovations, this is the American
distributor of the intriguing German label devoted to
reissues. Perhaps the only label that can be negative in their press
releases, but when their issues are on (like Xhol Caravan, Gila, etc), 
they're <i>on</i>!<br> 
<a
href="http://www.brainwashed.com/kranky/">Kranky</a>-I don't know how
I would've made it through 1997 without Kranky Records and their
impact on the spacerock scene. Classic releases by Jessamine, Amp, and 
Labradford can be found here, among many others, and they keep going
on...<br> 
<a
href="http://www.motherwest.com/">Mother West</a>-an underrated label
from NYC that has issued some of the best compilations of recent
memory--modern psych from around the world in their "Turn Century
Turn" & "Flourescent Tunnelvision" discs. Plus the spontaneous
compositions of Escapade, and the genius of Conrad Schnitzler.<br> 
<a href="http://www.othermusic.com">Other Music</a>-they're well-known
for a reason...<br>
<a href="http://www.roadcone.com">Road Cone</a>-this Portland label
goes across the map, from ecstatic jazz excursions and improv to the
psych sounds of Hochenkeit and Jackie-O Motherfucker. Worth checking
out, and cheap too!<br> 
<a
href="http://www.squealermusic.com">Squealer</a>-quickly becoming one
of the labels to be reckoned with, we've seen everything from great
High Rise reissues to new stuff by Acid Mothers Temple and one of the
best, albeit non-psych, groups to ever come out of my beloved hometown 
of Atlanta, the Gold Sparkle Band.<br> 
<a
href="http://www.twistedvillage.com">Twisted
Village</a>-remember when I said Aquarius had the most entertaining
"consistently-paced" email updates? I had to make that distinction due to
Twisted Village, who produces the greatest lists. Period. Not to mention
they know their psych extremely well, thanks due in part to the expertise
of Wayne & Kate. Their subterranean shop in Harvard Square blew my mind
when I visited it in May 2001, and in its own way, it was the inspiration
for me to create this radio show. <br> 
<a
href="http://www.vhfrecords.com">VHF</a>-Flying Saucer Attack, Pelt,
Vibracathedral Orchestra, Kawabata, on and on. Perhaps the best label
in America today.<br>
