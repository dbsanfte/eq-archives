<center><h2>Best Reissues (Alphabetically)</center></h2>
1. <b>RCA Greatest Hits Series (RCA)</b>-this compiles a greatest hits of
old school jazz superstart at a very affordable price, which is great for
an introduction to buying jazz. Important people from Armstrong and
Ellington to Artie Shaw and Lionel Hampton are featured. Really, there is
nothing else to say, as these names speak for themselves.<br>
2. <b>Southern Culture On The Skids-<i>Santo Swings!</i> ep
(Estrus)</b>-one of the greasiest releases by on eof the greasiest bands
in rock is reviesited. Need help on your Spanish? Look no further, for
Spanish renditions of tunes by Slim Harpo and the Swingin' Medallions. And
nobody needs to interpret the other themes of the double 7", which covers
wrestling, masochism, Little Debbies, and surf, surf, surf.<br>
3. <b>Ultra-Lounge (Capitol)</b>-I know it's trendy, but I love this
series. 12 volumes of perverse easy listening from the 40s- 60s. The
various genres within the genre are well represented, and there's no
downside to the whole series, at least not from the ones I have heard. And
the liner notes are fun, too, with an overview of the subject and drink
recipes that are <i>so</i> stylin'. <i>Space Capades</i>, volume 3, is a
good starter.<br>
4. <b>Yo La Tengo-<i>Ride The Tiger</i> and <i>President Yo La Tengo/New
Wave Hot Dogs</i> (Matador)</b>-As Geffen did for Sonic Youth a few years
back, so Matador is doing for YLT. Of course, everything ever put out by
this band is legendary, so there's no sense going on about it. Except that
the live version of "The Evil That Men Do" from <i>President Yo La
Tengo</i> is quite possibly the greatest song ever recorded.<br>
