<b>Streaks of Crimson</b>

Oh how quiet
Like music
Running through crystal
Liquid tunnels
Caressing the foreign
Velvet
Chamber
Like lust
So pretty
So soft...
To touch
To feel
To know
To fold slowly
And press
So gently
And swallow
Dear God;
I'll lick
The stamp
And drink
To this
And feel
So warm
I will
Caress
And teach
And learn
And find
My faith
And catch
Again
I'll know
I'm safe
- - -
I know
That I can crush
Anything, so gently
Without effort
Help me
And believe me;
These little slices
Of reincarnation
(We don't breathe here)
Feed me.
- - -
It's sad
To know
That I
Can wake
Anywhere, anytime
And breathe
Again
It's sad
To know
I do
Not feel
Like this
And won't
Again
Until
The light
Prevails
- - -
I danced with Alice
And swam here
And kissed the madman full on the lips
And collapsed
So drunk
So soft
So invisible
- - -
Oh, what I would destroy
For only one touch inside of you
Oh, what I would corrupt
And make fragile
If I had but one touch inside of you
Oh, and what insight I would have
Into the virginal God that you allow to rape you
Oh, and what a blessed thing it would be
If I could give you so much more than security
No, I will not break and shatter
What you will defend with your intellect itself
Because no, I will not be with you forever
And it is too easy to destroy something so small...
- - -
And when I fell
I felt nothing but the hissing air
And when I reached the bottom
I felt nothing but the catharsis,  and the hands of my heart...
- - -
So much like echoes carved in wood
So much like the footprints left in sand
- - -
So much like the tide
Which, like fire
Erases everything...
- - -
So much cold here
Knee-deep i n snow
What does it remind you of...
Somewhere,
Traces of red, brown and yellow
Maybe I can find Theseus here
I've been here for so long, you know
I'll try and speak to you gently
But there are so many quick photographs
So many remarkable instances:
Moments without context.
Memory is a book to be read
Tragedy is just a sprinkling of blood
In an entire desert of snow.
A slight disturbance below;
Another paragraph in an infinite series of chapters.
A siren,
A curtain call,
A tremble;
A broken seal,
Awakened in an avalanche of laughter.
