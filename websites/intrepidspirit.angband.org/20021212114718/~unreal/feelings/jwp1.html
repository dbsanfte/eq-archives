<b>seemed a Possibly</b>

this Love seemed a Possibly
in the breast pocket of Hope
but was named Inevitably when
held by proud father Certain.

it grew into a bright young Then,
married a blushing Perfection,
and spawned a precocious Destiny
that curtsied a smile
to a stern melting Existence

you see this Love standing in a photo next to Now
(who's eyes are always shuttered)
air sniffing proud with arm around
and little concerned for When
who needs the help, nor can afford
a gold watch.
