<h2>Lena: A Better Way to Pray</h2>

By utilizing history, we are capable of fortelling the future, kind of.
For all words in our message frequency distribution ( M ), we look to see
if there exists a word ( w ) in our history ( H ).  If w exists in H, then
we use it in our probability calculation.  If it doesn't, different things
happen based on the exact engine, but in general, one of two events occur,
One: we use a default value that is fairly low as an estimate, or Two: we
ignore it.
<p>
The calculation engine returns a probability that is then compared with
the user parameter corresponding to the threshold of sure-ity.  If the
spaminess of the message exceeds the threshhold, the message is routed to
SPAM_DEST ( /dev/null, a file for monitoring, whatever ).  If not, it is
delivered to MAIL_DEST.
<p>
Lena has two main modes of operation: delivery and learning.  We've seen
delivery.  Learning takes place after the message has been delivered.
When a message is received, the user reads it to verify the message was
delivered to the appropriate location.  If not, the user "trains" Lena by
telling it the message should be clean, or dirty, as appropriate.   There
are probably many was to train Lena, but I took the following route:
<p>
<menu>
  <li> Take a large body of spam free mail ( roughly 200 messages )
  <li> cat cleanfile | formail -s lena -learn -addClean
  <li> As spammy messages get delivered, tag them as dirty
</menu>
<p>
This approach ensures that it errs on the side of caution.  Simple mutt
macros enable the user to easily tag the message as spam or clean as need
be.  The macros are included below.
<p>
<pre>
macro index \ed "| ~/usr/bin/lena -learn -addSpam^Md"
macro index \es "| ~/usr/bin/lena -learn^M"
</pre>
These macros set up alt-s and alt-d to tag messages.  The ^M is one
character, not two.  The delete-as-spam macro also deletes the email.  It
may take a week or two for lena to overcome its positive bias from the
pre-seeding.  However, if you get a lot of email, it could be much faster.
<p>
So how do you get lena to monitor your email for ya?  Use .forward! ojv (
"Man, its obvious!" );  .forward below...
