      Zone Guide</font></b></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
      </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
                     Najena in located next to <a href="images/lavastorm.jpg">Lavastorm</a>, to the very north of the Antonica continent.&nbsp;
      To get to Najena, follow the mountains to your right (when zoning from Nektulos Forest).&nbsp;
      It will take you to a broken gate where a small tunnel will lead you to the entrance to Najena.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Najena is close to a necromancers dream, as this dungeon is full of undead creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Do not be fooled by the bones on the floor as most skeletons in Najena remain that way
      until you attack or they attack you.&nbsp; As soon as you zone into Najena, a Large Skeleton
      will be on the floor.  Past that skeleton, a small area has two more Large Skeletons or an
      occasional Greater Skeleton.&nbsp; If you keep going past this area you will enter another very
      small room.  Five skeletons spawn here, most commonly from the Large kind.&nbsp;
      An Ogre Guard also guards this area and spawns pretty fast.&nbsp; From this room you can choose two
      different paths.&nbsp; The one to your right will lead to the "small room", a room where two
      Tentacle Terrors spawn.  The path to your left will lead to another small room with a few
      Earth Elementals and occasional Mist Elementals and further down to the "large room".&nbsp;
      The large room spawns a variety of creatures.  Right at the entrance you find two
      skeletons standing on each side.&nbsp; If you kill these, they will spawn Tentacle Terrors
      instead of two more skeletons.  Further inside you can find a few Elementals (either
      Earth or Mist ones) and an Ogre Guard.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">That is a brief description of the first part of the Najena dungeon.  The second part of it is
      a much more difficult one and you should only adventure deeper in Najena once you
      reach level 24 or so.&nbsp; But once you do get to that level, make sure you pay Najena a visit
      as this is the most rewarding area of the dungeon.&nbsp; The first area you can visit can be
      accessed through an illusionary wall to the left of the hallway.&nbsp; A few higher level
      skeletons will be guarding this area but as a necromancer you should have no problem
      dealing with them.&nbsp; Follow the tunnel downstairs and you be in the good part of the
      dungeon for mid-level characters.&nbsp; Three different creatures are very sought after in this
      part, the two higher ranked Ogres, the Captain (level 27) and the Officer (level 24), door
      to right,  and the Bonecracker Ghoul (level 23-25), door to left.  All three will drop very
      good loot, specially Bonecracker who carries magical items such as the barbed whip and
      flesh rings.&nbsp; The Ogres expensive pieces of armor including bronze platemail parts.  A
      Visiting Priestess (level 26) is often around the Captain's room so be careful.  She can hit
      hard and is accompanied by Ogres.&nbsp; She can also heal critters fighting around her.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You need to fight Bonecracker in order to proceed further inside the dungeon.  He will
      drop a key that will open the door to the first of three NPCs.&nbsp; I will
      describe them later in this analysis.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The best tactic for characters level 16 to 20 is to stay close to the entrance of Najena and
      fight the Tentacle Terrors from the small room if at the lower part of the
      level range just given or from the large room if at the higher part.&nbsp;
      It is important to understand that skeletons will attack you on sight until you reach level 18,
      Ogres will do the same until you reach level 19 (for the lower level ones), and Greater Skeletons until you reach level
      20.&nbsp; Thus, make sure you take some time to clear up your way back to the zone to
      Lavastorm every once in a while so that you won't get a train if those nasty Tentacles
      turn out to be more dangerous then you first thought.&nbsp; A party is necessary until you
      reach level 20+ to fight the tentacles.&nbsp; The tentacles will drop very good loot, often a
      platinum or two and sometimes the Tentacle Whip, a powerful weapon that drains life
      from its opponents.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Once you reach level 20+ you can start going deeper inside Najena and fight the tougher
      ogres and Bonecracker.&nbsp; Once again, make sure you bring some friends along as these
      are some nasty opponents.&nbsp; The Ogre captain hits very, very hard and is surrounded by
      several lower level Ogres guarding him.&nbsp; Thus, a train is not unlikely to happen.
      Bonecracker is on the door to the left of the stairs, while the Ogres are to the right of the
      stairs.  Both rooms are heavily occupied.&nbsp; The Ogre room is full of Ogres
      (doh!) while Bonecracker's room has 2 necromancers with their pets and an Ogre Guard that
      occasionally walks in.&nbsp; The worst thing about these rooms is that they are quite small,
      making it very hard to distinguish events in a battle (most of the times I had no idea what
      was going on in there).&nbsp; If you are considering fighting Bonecracker, I would advise that
      you have someone tanking him while the others focus on killing the necromancers since
      both of them cast DoT spells and can inflict quite a lot of damage.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Characters level 25+ may attempt fighting the NPCs located in Najena.&nbsp;
      As I mentioned before, once you kill Bonecracker you will get a key that will open the
      door to the first NPC, Drezlna.  To get to her, go to the large room where two Tentacle Terrors spawn
      and head past the gates with Najena's symbol.&nbsp; You will go past a few elementals and will
      have a choice to turn left and head down some stairs.&nbsp; This is the way to Najena but I will
      come back to her later.  Keep going just a little more and you will hit a wall.  Take the
      path to your right and immediately turn left.&nbsp; If you turn right and then another right you
      will fall down a hole to a cell where an injured halfling spawns.&nbsp; This cell requires a key
      (Guard key) so try not to fall in it :).&nbsp; After turning left, turn left again (turning right will
      take you to another fake hole) and follow path until you get to three closed doors. The
      door to your right is locked and is Drezlna's spawning place.&nbsp; She is the easiest of
      the 3 NPCs and is guarded by a few necromancers and their pets.&nbsp; Other things might spawn in
      there such as Tentacle Terrors and Ogre Guards.&nbsp; As is true with all NPCs, Drezlna
      doesn't always spawn so you might have to kill the entire spawn and hope she appears
      on the next one.&nbsp; A full party of levels 25+ should have no problem killing her and I have
      done it with no clerics in my team.  Have someone open the door and pull Drezlna
      outside.&nbsp; You should all kill her before anything else to prevent her from charming
      someone.&nbsp; Drezlna drops a ring that gives +5 vs. disease attacks, bronze armor, and the
      Stiletto of the Bloodclaw.&nbsp; None of these items are very common and it might take your party quite a few tries to get what you are looking for.&nbsp;
      The important thing is she drops the key to the second NPC in Najena, Rathyl, as well as the
      gold key to Najena.&nbsp; One last note, once you are done killing Drezlna for the first time, you
      should camp inside her room.&nbsp; She will spawn with your party there and it will make it
      easier to kill everything that spawns in there, specially if you take the necromancers
      before they can cast a pet.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Well, Rathyl is an entirely different story.  I could say with reasonable confidence that he
      is a lot harder than Najena herself.&nbsp; To successfully kill Rathyl, you must
      have a very well balanced party, with clerics, tanks, and spellcasters.  Not having at least 1 high level cleric
      means death in the majority of cases.&nbsp; To get to Rathyl, take the middle door from where
      you just fought Drezlna and follow path.&nbsp; You will get to a room where you will see a few
      cells.&nbsp; Rathyl is in one of the corners, behind a small gate like door.  You will need the key
      found at Drezlna's corpse to open this door.&nbsp; Rathyl is guarded by quite a few magicians
      and necromancers.  Once the battle starts, there will be so many things to kill that
      surviving will take all your party has.&nbsp; And the worst thing is, once you kill Rathyl, he
      will reincarnate and come back as a pretty large skeleton.&nbsp; So, keep those healers safe and
      healing and pray nothing goes wrong because the zone is very far away.  Rathyl will drop
      the Traveler's Backpack, bronze armor, and a magical bracelet (not sure about the
      stats).&nbsp; He will also drop a key to Najena's room.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Finally, the final battle!  Your party has killed Rathyl and is looking for the main prize of
      the dungeon.&nbsp; Getting to Najena can be quite tricky if you don't know you
      way around. Here is what you have to do.&nbsp; Go back to the point I mentioned before where you can take
      some stairs down.&nbsp; At the end of the stairs you should see a small water pool.&nbsp;
      Jump in the water and be careful with the few frogloks that spawn in it.&nbsp;
      Swim down and go straight ahead.&nbsp; Once you see that you can go back up again, do so.  You will get to a
      place with a locked door, Najena's spawning place.&nbsp; The hardest thing about Najena is
      actually finding her.&nbsp; She does not always spawn and it might take your party a few tries
      to actually face her.&nbsp; Najena is guarded by a few necromancers and a few magicians.
      They all have pets and will often train you as soon as you open the door.  Rathyl's battle
      is tougher, but Najena herself is a pretty nasty NPC.&nbsp; She has a pretty high
      resistance to magical attacks and charms reasonably easy.  Thus, focus your attention on killing her as
      soon as you can.&nbsp; I would recommend the use of the /assist command in this battle as
      you will be likely fighting in the small corridor before the door to Najena's room.  The
      space is very limited and the amount of creatures attacking your party is beyond your
      comprehension :).&nbsp; A very rewarding battle once you win as Najena often carries the
      popular Flowing Black Robe.  And pretty much everything she drops is great for a
      necromancer such as the Black Tome with Silver Runes.&nbsp; A fun battle indeed.&nbsp;
      Do not camp outside her room though as it prevents Najena from spawning.&nbsp;
      It is best if you camp before the water pool and swim back to her room after the spawn has
      happened.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">One final comment:  you do not have to fight these 3 battles in the order described above.&nbsp;
      You can get a shiny metal key from Ogres and if you do, you can fight Rathyl before
      Drezlna.&nbsp; If you do so, you should then kill Drezlna to get the gold key that opens Najena's
      door. (thank you Jim)</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">In time, past the water pool you go to find Najena are a few strange inhabitants to the
      dungeon such as Black Widow Spiders and Goblins.&nbsp; You can actually hunt in the goblin
      camp located just past the water pool.  It is a heavily populated camp and requires a level
      25+ party to take it down.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Overall, Najena is another one of my favorite hunting grounds.&nbsp;
      It has creatures for characters level 16 all the way to level 30+ and provides the necromancer
      with very good experience and loot.&nbsp; There are several things here that can be sold for more than 30
      platinum and some for more than 300 platinum.</font></p>

      part of the dungeon is not apparent and can only be accessed through an illusionary wall.
      Also, the part of Najena's dungeon where the NPCs spawn are filled with fake holes and
      you might be locked in a cell with quite a few creatures attacking you if you fall into one
      (having a wizard levitate you party might do wonders).  Finally, the keys to both Rathyl and
