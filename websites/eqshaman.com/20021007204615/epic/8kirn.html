      Icon</STRONG><BR><BR>Go into City of Mist.<BR>Go across the 
      bridge.<BR>Open the gate.<BR>Turn right.<BR>Go straight forward through 2 
      arches.<BR><BR>In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall 
      running down its side.<BR>Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull 
      skeletons, etc., from the first door you<BR>see at the base of the 
      temple.<BR><BR>Open the door. Inside is another door directly in front of 
      you, do not open this<BR>door, it leads to top of temple. Look instead to 
      the right, where three skeletons<BR>spawn. Pull these skeletons to 
      courtyard and kill them.<BR><BR>Go back into door, head right and ye will 
      see a room set below ground level with<BR>three phantoms in it, standing 
      on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms.<BR>There are two doors 
      beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to the<BR>right. 
      Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and 
      a<BR>small bag on the floor in the left corner. Click on the bag, you now 
      have the High<BR>Scale Icon. Gate out.<BR><BR>Using Invisibility to Undead 
      potion (Unlife Awareness) will get you past the last<BR>three skeletons 
      and phantoms. They will still scowl at you, ready to attack, but it 
      is<BR>a bluff. They will NOT be able to see you.<BR><BR>Be warned, 
      however, as the golems of the area can see through Invisibility 
      to<BR>Undead, and you may run across a couple on the way to the temple 
      area.<BR>There were no rogue-locked doors between the zone and the High 
      Scale icon. </FONT></P>
