      <BR><BR>Getting in the Tower:<BR>We found this the hardest part - took 
      over 2 hours to get from this area to Kirn. Here's my thoughts if<BR>they 
      are helpful.<BR><BR>The exit from the city is a long winding tunnel. You 
      find the quest npc for another class sitting near<BR>a pool... keep 
      going... eventually you will come to an open area with the tower off in 
      the distance.<BR>The open area has 2 spawns - a rock golem and elemental. 
      Kill those, move up. You have 6 minutes.<BR>The open area faces the 
      tower... dips down, flattening in the bottom before rising again towards 
      the<BR>tower. In this area before the tower you will come across a few 
      roamers... a rat and several rock<BR>golems and elementals.<BR><BR>There 
      is a tunnel to the left which leads to, I belive, Master Yael. That's not 
      where you want to go.<BR>The rat and some rock golems and elementals 
      referred to above come from this tunnel and interrupt<BR>your 
      progression.<BR><BR>There are a couple of revenant and wanderer roamers 
      here too.<BR>In front of the castle are two spawns - revenant/wanderers. 6 
      min spawn.<BR>The question becomes pull to the first opening from the 
      tunnel, pull to the flat or just keep on<BR>moving forward. We pulled to 
      the flat to prevent continuously fighting the 6 min respawn at the 
      top.<BR>This is tough as you attract all of the roamers from the Master 
      Yael tunnel.<BR><BR>I suggest that you pull to the flat but do not pull 
      the inside of the tower for one or two rotations... just<BR>bide your time 
      splitting up the spawn from this area. Some rock golems in this area 
      cannot be<BR>mesmerised by a (very talented) L57 enchanter... so you need 
      some tanks to keep an eye on these<BR>specific high level golems when you 
      find them.<BR><BR>When you get on top of the flat spawn, wait until the 
      two revenants at the doorway spawn and then<BR>kill them. You then have 6 
      minutes to kill around 3 revenants in the first room of the tower. The 
      trick<BR>here is to move inside... do not get sophisticated trying to pull 
      the tower to outside - the respawn rate<BR>and number of mobs is likely to 
      be too high. Then it's just a gritty room by room assault to keep<BR>ahead 
      of the respawn.<BR><BR>   -
