    face="Verdana"><small>Well I read the Why to make a Troll Shaman and they have a lot of
    good points but I think Barbs have some great points too. I decided to make this in a
    pro/con format.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pros</strong><br>
    The biggest pro would have to be travel. We are welcomed in all port cities and all others
    except the 3 dark cities. This can be a great benefit while traveling Norrath.<br>
    Racism - The other races in Norrath might think twice before allowing a Troll or Ogre in
    their group. The DO eat most of them if you havent noticed! Whereas a Barb is just like
    their big brother ;)</small><br>
    <small>Halas has a great newbie area followed by outer Everfrost or BlackBurrow.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cons</strong><br>
    We dont see well. We do get an infravision spell though</small><br>
    <small>Halas is not that easy to get to when you are ready to by a new set of spells</small><br>
