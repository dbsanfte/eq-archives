<br>
Have you ever thought of getting paid for the game you’re so enamored with?&nbsp; Do 
you have some unique knowledge or perspective of EverQuest that could benefit 
others?&nbsp; Are you simply missing the motivation to write your thoughts down?<br>
<br>
All you need to do is condense your thoughts to writing and we’ll send you a 
quick $20.&nbsp; We are searching for informative articles about EverQuest that could 
benefit other players.&nbsp; Sharing your experience has never been easier, and 
there’s now a monetary incentive to do just that.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can share your expertise on virtually any aspect of EverQuest such as tips &amp; 
tricks, a guide to most anything, tactics necessary to kill a particular mob, 
how to do a specific quest, where to craft a unique item, various trade skill 
techniques, how to pull in a certain zone, or anything else that could benefit 
your fellow players.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There are only a few simple requirements: first, it must be original content 
that you created.&nbsp; If it is protected by copyright, or cut-and-pasted from 
another site, we can’t use it.&nbsp; You also agree that by sending us an article you 
are granting us permission to post it, and use it as part of our sites.&nbsp; You can 
still, of course, post it other places as well.&nbsp; If it’s useful, and you 
authored it, we’ll most likely use it and will send you $20 soon after it’s 
submitted.&nbsp;Please submit your article and if we post it up we will send you $20 
immediately. <a href="mailto:accounts@mysupersales.com">CLICK HERE TO SUBMIT</a>&nbsp;
