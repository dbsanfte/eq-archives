    face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>1. Regeneration. Regeneration is truly an awesome
    ability to have. It allows you to rely significantly less on healing for yourself, and
    more on the healing and buffing of others in your group, or offensive spells if you are
    solo. It is VERY nice to have when kiting the enemy, or simply running from a fight when
    low on health. Also, Regeneration and Chloroplast spells at later levels DO STACK on your
    existing Troll Regen. Cannibalize takes away 50 hit points and gives you 25 mana. Having
    fast hit point recovery is a vital advantage to the Shaman for the purpose of casting more
    and better spells.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>2. Infravision. Ogres get this as well, and
    it is an invaluable benefit. One less buff you will have to cast on yourself.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>3. Great stats. I personally think Trolls
    have the most efficient stats for a shaman. Shamans need to be strong and have stamina,
    but no where near as much as an Ogre has. Put as many points as possible into Wisdom, this
    should get you a 95 - not bad at all - and the rest into Agility and Dexterity. Your
    Strength and Stamina will be over 100 by default - more than enough for a priest class,
    and high enough to get you a decent bonus to your damage and hit points at later levels. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>4. Cooler look. If you're an Ogre, you're
    just an oversized, obese, ugly humanoid. If you're a Troll, you've got big floppy ears,
    long pointy nose, and lots of chest detail down to that pot belly. We don't look nearly as
    stupid (facial expressions) as Ogres do; on the contrary many of our facial expressions
    are conivial and sly, even sinister. This is my opinion of course; others may differ. ;)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><small>5. Better newbie area. Now, I've never
    actually BEEN an Ogre, I'll be the first to admit that. But, Innothule Swamp is an
    excellent newbie area, with lots of things to kill. We're also closer to the Orc camps of
    Southern Ro. I've been to the Ferrott and it just doesn't look that good for anyone past
    level 5. Running and swimming through the swamps here is excellent for raising your
    Swimming skill without even thinking about it. </small></font></p>
