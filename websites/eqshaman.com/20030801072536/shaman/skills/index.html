Shaman recieve a nice blend of both combat and casting skills, as well as a ton of useful alternate advancement abilities.
<p>
<li>Note: Formula means the formula used to calculate the skill cap for your current level. For instance, the formula for Alteration is "5 + (Level x 5)". So, if you were level 4, your Alteration would not be able to rise past 25.<br>
<li>Note: For Archetype, Class, and some PoP Ability AA, the second/third rank will cost more than the original, using the formula "Base Cost x Rank Number". For example, quick buff costs 3 points at rank one, 6 points at rank two (3 x 2), and 9 points at rank three (3 x 3).

  <td>The more stamina you have the longer you can hold your breath underwater. More importantly, stamina affects how many hit points you have.</td>
  <td>This will be either your most important or second most important statistic. A shaman's power is often based by looking at their HP. The more stamina you have, the better. Stamina is however soft capped at 255, which means that any stamina you have over 255 will yeild a low number of HP.</td>

  <td>Wisdom</td>
  <td>The more wisdom you have the faster you learn casting skills and the more mana you have.</td>
