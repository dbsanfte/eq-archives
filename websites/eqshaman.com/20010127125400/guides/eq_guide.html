<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The Shamans of Norrath </font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">In the lands of Norrath, there are
considered to be three primitive races. Those are the Barbarians of the Northern Plains of
EverFrost, the Trolls from the southern swamps of Innothule, and the Ogres front the
southern jungles of Feerott. Within these races, there is only one class than has a true
casting ability from the start, and that is the Shaman. Many would argue that a Shaman is
not a part of a viable group in the later phases of life, that a Shaman is more geared
towards solo hunting. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">This is not the case. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">A Shaman can wear all armor except that
within the plate mail line. There are very few piercing or slashing weapons a Shaman may
wield, an ax being one of them, but the Shaman can wield almost all one-hand and two-hand
blunt weapons. The Shaman also has a few skills specific to the class or race that most
others do not have. And the Shaman is granted magic from the start of his life. This magic
grants the Shaman the power to enhance or hinder abilities, to heal or hurt instantly, or
to heal or hurt over long periods of time. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">With these abilities, a Shaman can
perform as a tank, a caster, a healer, a buffer, or a debuffer. A tank is the fighter in
the front line that takes most of the damage and protects the casters while wielding a
mighty weapon. A caster is one that wields powerful magic and creates big bangs for
massive damage on an enemy. A healer is one who stands back and watches over the fight and
heals his comrades as needed. A buffer is one who casts beneficial magic, such as strength
or speed enhancements. A debuffer is one who hinders the abilities of the enemy, such as
to slow its fighting or weaken its abilities or resistance. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">It is true that a Shaman will never be as
good a tank as a warrior, as good a caster as a wizard, as good a healer as a cleric, or
as good a debuffer as an enchanter, but no one can come close to the buffing abilities of
a Shaman. Also, no other class can do all of these things. How many wizards can charge
into a fight and take the hits from a giant? A Shaman in the best buffer and good at
everything else. No other class can boast being the best at anything and still be very
good at everything else. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Who is a Shaman?</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The only races allowed to be Shamans are
Ogres, Trolls, and Barbarians. The choice of race will be totally dependent on exactly how
you choose to play. If you want to spend a lot of time with &quot;good&quot; friends or
traveling the lands with little fear of being killed by the local guards, the Barbarian is
the way to go. However, Barbarians have no night vision. At night in the lands of Norrath,
it is dark. The candle with which you start is not adequate to see everything. There are
other light sources available, but nothing as good as true night vision. But this is only
a problem at the lower levels. At level 9, Shamans get Serpent Sight, which grants
Infravision; and at level 24, Shamans get Ultravision. So you only need worry about vision
for a short while. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Barbarians also can wear medium or large
armor. This allows for more usability of the loot gained and the ability to choose medium
over large for the lesser weight. Additionally, Barbarians have the highest starting
wisdom and charisma, which are two of the three primary skills for a Shaman. Barbarians
also have good agility. Barbarians have a great newbie zone with lots to do and kill. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">A Town Called Halas</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Halas is a fairly small town, but has
most things you will need to get started. In order to leave Halas you will have to either
wait for the ferry or swim, and swimming is a necessary skill anyway. And there are
vendors in the entrance to Halas and one on the Plains of EverFrost to buy your goods. The
passes to Halas are crowded with lesser mobs, and they open to the plains of EverFrost
where there are mobs up to mid twenties levels. EverFrost also connects to PermaFrost, a
high level dungeon, and to BlackBurrow, which is a low-level dungeon. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The only disadvantage here is that Halas
is on the far northern corner of the continent, which means a long run from most places,
and to leave your homeland, you must pass through BlackBurrow and into Qeynos Hills, which
can be deadly at the youngest levels. If you want the best overall stats, choose the Ogre.
Ogres have only a few points lower wisdom than a Barbarian, so almost the same mana, and
they have extremely high strength and stamina. Ogres do have lower charisma, so the best
choice would be to increase charisma. Plus, Ogres get ultravision that is perfect night
vision. This still does not mean that it is not dark, but you can see much better than any
other race but Dark Elves. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The only drawbacks to Ogres are that they
are large and evil. Being large means not fitting into many places and being forced to
wear only large armor, which is heavier. But this is made up for by the extra strength.
Being evil means that most npc&#146;s in good zones will kill you on sight. The only towns
that will accept you are your hometown and possibly the Troll and Dark Elf lands. It is
possible to increase faction with the good races, but time consuming in most cases. Ogres
also have a good starting zone, although not quite as good as the Barbarians or Trolls.
There should be plenty to kill and do for almost all levels. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Plus, the Ogre starting zone has entries
to Cazic Thule, which is a higher level dungeon, an area besieged by spectres, which are
very high level mobs, an entry to Rathe Mountains, which is also a higher level area, and
an entry to Innothule Swamps. Also, there are vendors here to sell wares. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Trolling Around</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Being a Troll is not a bad choice. Trolls
have much less wisdom than any of the others, which mean much less mana. Their strength is
not even close to that or an Ogre. Low charisma and intelligence also hurt. But Trolls do
have higher agility and dexterity, and Trolls have infravision, which is the ability to
see heat in the dark. Though not as good as ultravision, it is still much better than the
night vision of a Barbarian. This in itself does not totally make up for the lacking
stats. What does that is the inborn Troll ability Regeneration. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">This ability allows the Troll to heal at
a rate much faster than the norm for all other races. Basically, a Troll can heal almost
as fast standing as other races can sitting. This makes for less downtime and for longer
fights as while the mob is doing damage, the Troll is healing. Additionally, Trolls have
an excellent starting zone. It has mobs for most lower levels and is covered in water,
which helps to build your swimming skill. Innothule is connected to the forests of
Feerott, to Southern Ro Desert, and to the froglok dungeon Guk. Guk is a low to high level
dungeon and is quite huge. Southern Ro has several orc camps, some undead ruins, and
farther north in the sands of the zone are even some much higher level sand giants. Also,
there is a vendor in the swamps to sell your wares. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The Skills of a Shaman</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to the normal skills for all
classes, such as swimming and languages and trade skills, all Shamans start with skills in
one-hand and two-hand blunt weapons, piercing weapons, abjuration, alteration,
conjuration, divination, and evocation. At level four, Shamans can train in channeling. At
level 8, Shamans can train in meditation. At 15, Shamans get dodge. And at 30, Shamans get
specialization. Additionally, Shamans get the unique skill of Alchemy (ability to create
potions) at level 25. The slam skill is inherent to all large races. Since Shamans are all
large races, it fits well here. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike a warrior who can actually train
and become better at slam eventually doing damage as if a second attack, Shamans do not
get the skill to train. But it is a viable combat skill. The best way to look at it is not
as a second attack, but as a possible attack aid. Slam has the ability to disrupt an enemy
caster. If you are in melee, slam will only do 1 point of damage if it hits, but even that
is enough to interrupt an enemy caster. At level 20, the slam skill also gains the ability
to stun, which can be very helpful dealing with fleeing mobs without wasting mana or in
causing a short pause in the mob&#146;s attacks. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Attributes for Shamans </font></b></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The primary attributes for
Shamans are stamina, wisdom, and charisma. Stamina allows casters more hit points with
which to survive attack. Wisdom grants more mana with which to cast. And since much of the
shamans magic is buff or debuff, charisma helps to overcome those resistances. This chart
shows the starting stats for all Shamans. Additionally, all Shamans are given 30 skill
points to distribute as they see fit. </font></p>

</center></div></font>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Stamina affects hit points per level as
well as ability to run or wield heavy weapons for long times. Each swing of a weapon take
a little stamina, as does each stroke swimming or step running or leap jumping. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Wisdom affects the ability to resist
alteration magic, such as charm or debuffs. Wisdom is also the attribute that directly
affects the amount of mana available for hybrids and healers. For a Shaman, higher wisdom
means higher mana. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Charisma affects the reaction of
non-player characters (npc's) and the prices obtained buying or selling goods. It also
affects the caster's ability to overcome the target&#146;s resistances to alteration
magic. In other words, higher charisma means debuffs are not resisted as much. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Strength affects the amount that can be
carried and the chance to hit at maximum with a weapon. Having higher strength does not
mean you hit harder. Each weapon has a maximum hit value. Having higher strength means
your chance of hitting for maximum damage is increased. As to weight allowance, better
armor is often more heavy, thus more strength is needed. Also, many of the better
two-handed weapons are quite heavy. Having higher strength means a better ability to wield
those weapons. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Agility affects the ability to avoid
being hit. This directly relates to base armor class and chance to successfully dodge a
blow. The more hits avoided, the less damage taken. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Dexterity affects the ability to hit or
recover from being hit. Higher dexterity means a greater chance of hitting an opponent,
especially with ranged weapons. Dexterity also determines how quickly one recovers from
being hit so that he can strike again, or so he can cast the spell. It additionally
affects a caster's ability to avoid being interrupted. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Intelligence affects the speed at which
skills are learned. It also directly relates to the amount of mana for a caster. For a
Shaman, higher intelligence means the ability to maximize skills more quickly, but has no
affect on mana. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Turning Skills into Strategy</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">For a Shaman, regardless of race, the
best course is to put all possible skill points into wisdom. This will maximize the amount
of spells able to be cast. For a Troll, this is critical as the Trolls have the least
initial wisdom. The remaining five points can go into any attribute. More strength means
carrying more. More agility means getting hit less. More dexterity means less
interruption. More stamina means more hit points. More charisma means cheaper prices. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">If you choose a Troll or Ogre, charisma
might not be a bad selection as charisma also affects the ability to overcome resistance
for alteration magic. For a Troll, intelligence might be best or you will still be
learning skills from the last level when you make the next one. For a Barbarian, strength
is good for the extra carrying capacity. Agility is always better than stamina as a choice
because being hit less means you do not need the extra hit points, plus, all of the
classes available for Shamans have very high stamina anyway. Regardless of what the last
five points are put into, there is no wrong choice. All abilities are nice to have
increased, but none are as critical as wisdom. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Additional Starting Choices</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The choice of gender is personal
preference. It has no effect on abilities. It does, however, affect your role-playing,
just as does the choice of a name. Try to choose a name appropriate to your race. To see a
female Troll named Bob doesn't speak of someone trying to role-play. Try to choose a name
to match the race and gender, that is, if your intention is to role-play. The last choice
is that of a deity. For Barbarians, there is no choice. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">If you are a Shaman, you will be a
follower of the Tribunal. They believe in justice above all else, even above courts, that
justice reigns supreme and violators of this will suffer the vengeance of the Tribunal.
For Ogres, there is also no choice. All Ogre Shamans must be followers of Rallos Zek, the
WarLord. These followers believe only in strength and power, that it is truly survival of
the fittest. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">For Trolls, you have a choice of
Cazic-Thule, the Faceless and Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate. Followers of Cazic-Thule
believe the fear conquers all, that the world can be ruled by enforcing oppression with
fear. Followers of Innoruuk believe that hate is the creative force of all things that by
destroying with hate, they can bring about new creation. Either choice for a Troll is
okay. If you follow Innoruuk, the Dark Elves are more likely to like you, but the good
races will not. If you choose the Faceless, some will like you some will not. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Either way, regardless of deity, there
will be some npc's that like you and some that hate you merely for the choice. Starting
location is also set based on race. From this point, you enter the world of Norrath as a
newly born Shaman.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Beginning as a Shaman</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">All Shamans start with a newbie club, a
Tome of Discord, five food and water, a letter to the Guildmaster, and two spells.
Barbarians also start with a candle. The two spells are Minor Healing and Inner Fire. The
first thing you should do is scribe the spells. To do this, click the spellbook button and
then click the spell, dragging it to an open spot on the open spellbook. It will begin to
scribe. When finished, scribe the other. Once both are scribed, memorize them both. Click
the spell in the book and a button will attach to the mouse. Move the button over to the
left and drop it in an open spot along the left edge of the book (all will be open at this
point). Then memorize the other one.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">In EverQuest, all spells consume mana.
You memorize the spell, then you may cast it as many times as you like and have mana for.
To cast something different, simply night click the spell button and you will forget the
spell so you can memorize another one. The spell will still be in the book. After this,
click done in the lower right corner and you will stand. Open inventory (click the persona
button), the open your equipment (button above your picture on the right). Equip the club
(click and drag the club from inventory to the first hand slot (lower left most slot on
equipment). If you are a barbarian, also place the candle in your other hand. It will not
show on the character, but will provide a little light, though not much. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Now, make the choice of Order or Discord.
If you want to compete in Player versus player combat, then find the Priest of Discord and
give him the Tome of Discord, and he will make you pvp. If you will never want to be pvp,
simply destroy the Tome. If you are undecided, then put the Tome in the bank. Just
remember if you choose pvp, no one will be able to heal you other than another pvp. If you
want to play pvp, the best choice is to play the pvp server. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Next, find your Guildmaster. In Halas,
the Shaman guild is around the corner to the left of the bank. Go down into the guild and
the last booth on the end is the Guildmaster and two vendors. In Grobb, the Shaman guild
is just to the right of the bank. In Oggok, the Shaman guild is in the caves on the East
of the main pass (go in the front and go to the right). Read the letter (double right
click). It will tell you whom to find. Give the letter to that person, and you will get a
tiny bit of experience and a newbie tunic. The tunic will afford you a little bit of armor
class protection for the upcoming fights. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Now talk to the Guildmaster (right
click). The best course is to put all five starting points into one-hand bashing (for the
club). This will make you hit more often in combat. Then, talk to everyone in the guild
(click the person and hit &quot;h&quot; for hail). Be very careful not to accidentally hit
a, or forget to hit enter before typing. If you hit a, that's attack, and you will be
killed. Some of the npc's may talk to you. If you pick the right words out of the text in
your talk back to them, they will offer you quests. Many of the quests are as yet
unfinished, but there are a few for the newbie characters. Check on the quests available
here. They won't tell you what they will reward you, but one of the quests will grant you
a first order spell. Get all the quests you can and worry about how to finish them if at
all later. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The Pros of Con</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">One last thing to remember ... con
everything. This is done by either right clicking the target, or selecting the target and
clicking the con button or typing &quot;/con&quot;. This will tell you how hard the mob is
related to you. It is not 100% accurate, but much better than nothing. The cons are in
colors and text. Be sure to ready it all. If it scowls at you, then it will attack. If it
is amiable, then it likes you a lot, will talk to you or sell to you at a very good price
if it does that at all. And there are colors ranging from green meaning you will most
likely not get any experience and the kill would be fairly easy to red meaning it would
mash you. And within each color, there is specific text, such as &quot;you might win&quot;
or &quot;you would have the upper hand&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Be sure to judge and read all creatures
before attaching. You will find that some of the little creatures are even tougher than
the big ones. This will be particularly important when traveling to other lands. Con the
guards from a good distance to see if they will kill you. If they are Dubious or better,
then you should be safe. This is also a good time to setup your hot keys. I would
definitely setup one for attack, one for slam, one for spells, one for persona, one for
sit, and one for sense heading. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">No matter where you are or what you are
doing, keep clicking sense heading. It will take forever for it to get up, but it is worth
it. I placed attack on the lower left, slam center left, and sense heading center right.
In combat, first click combat, then click slam. Then, click sense, and every time sense
becomes available, click it again, just be careful to watch the entire fight and not just
the sense button. This will allow the skill to raise more quickly since you will be using
it more. Now you are ready to face the world. Head back to the entrance to the town and
zone into the wilds. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<b>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">First Order (Level 1 to 4) </font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">As soon as you zone into the wilds, cast
Inner Fire on yourself. Once it is cast, sit a few and let your mana rebuild. If you
fizzle a few times, just keep trying. Inner Fire will give you an additional 2 armor class
and 20 hit points. Once your mana is full, stand up and run out into the wilds themselves.
Remember, here is where you must con everything. Find a blue con creature. Make sure the
creature is alone, as many creatures will help one another. Spiders, for example, will
leave you alone for the most part. But as soon as you attack one, all others near will
attack. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Pay very close attention to where you are
and where the guards are. If you get in over your head, turn and run for the guards. They
will kill anything attacking you in most cases, although it may get in a few more hits on
you before it's gone. And always be on the lookout for whatever was asked for in the
quests. If you are Barbarian, the best spot is just at the entrance to the pass to where
the two guards stand by the campfires before the cave to Halas. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Many woolly spiderlings and white wolves,
decaying skeletons, gnoll pups, ice goblin welps, and polar bear cubs will go by.
Spiderlings will not attack unless attacked. The rest will attack, so stand back. The
gnolls and goblins sometimes have sacks or bags, the decaying skeletons sometimes have
rusty weapons, the spiderlings sometimes have silk and fungus and legs, the wolves and
bears have meat and pelts. The gnolls, goblins, and skeletons also sometimes carry a few
coins. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">If you are Ogre, just outside the gate,
turn left about 45 deg (SE) as if headed towards Innothule. There are lots of snakes,
bats, decaying skeletons, froglok tads, jungle spiderlings, and lizard men. Just be sure
to con each before attacking. The bats, snakes, and spiders should be non-aggressive
unless attacked. The lizard men sometimes have armor or weapons, and the decaying
skeletons sometimes have weapons. The rest have wings, or silk, or something to sell. And
be sure to keep all of your snake scales, even if you have to bank them. They will be very
useful later. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">If you are Troll, just outside the gate,
keep heading a little N along the wall and just into the swamp. There are lots of rats,
snakes, fungus man trackers, frogloks, kobolds, and decaying skeletons. The rats and
snakes should be non-aggressive. The frogloks sometimes have netted or clothe armor, which
you can wear or sell. I would be sure to keep every pair of netted gloves you find,
however. They can be sold to Monks for a pretty good price since they are magical, which
grant the monk a magical attack. Also, keep all your snake scales, even if you have to put
them in the bank. You won't regret it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Once you have selected a target, run up
to it, hit it, then fall back to a fairly safe area from which to you can fight or quickly
escape if needed. Fighting in the water is not good as at this point, the mobs will always
be a much better swimmer than you. At this level, you shouldn't be fighting any casters,
so use the slam skill every chance you get. The extra point of damage isn't much, but
every little bit helps. As you start to take damage, target yourself (hit F1), click your
minor heal button, then retarget the mob (click it) and continue attacking. When you kill
it, right click the corpse and take whatever is there. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">If you still have good mana and hit
points, then attack something else. Otherwise, back up to the wall and sit to heal and
refresh mana. When ready, go again. When your inventory is full, run back to the closest
vendor, sell everything you don't need, and then head out again. Be sure to keep your
Inner Fire up. It should last about 15 minutes before dropping. In all the areas, the
spider and spiderling silk sells well (over a gold and just over a silver respectively).
Rusty weapons can also be worth as much as a few gold. Whenever possible, take out
anything carrying a weapon as the weapons can be sold. Also, be sure to watch the mobs you
kill for a better weapon for you. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Hand&#146;s On Fighting</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Although the newbie club is decent, it's
not too grand. A Cracked Staff is a much better one-hand blunt weapon, and it usually goes
for just over a plat if you want to stick with one-hand blunt. The other choice is to go
for two hand blunt, in which case you will need to find a worn great staff or a rusty war
hammer. Anything will do. Just remember that the faster you can hit, the faster your skill
will go up. If you go with a rusty weapon, then get a smith to polish it for you into a
tarnished weapon. That will give you another 2 from the delay. It's not much, but every
little bit helps. If you stick with one-hand, then you can use a shield for extra armor
class. If you go two-hand, you loose the shield but have a better choice of weapons later
in life. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The best bet is to keep going back and
forth to get both up as high as possible. It isn't really important to train both at this
age, but it will become more and more important as you grow older. As soon as you have
enough coins, the first thing to buy is a bag or pack or purse. The purse is usually first
since it is only a little over a silver and holds 4 items. Put your food and water and
anything else you find there and keep making trips and selling. The more you can carry,
the less trips you will have to make. Every chance you get, buy a new o bigger pack so
that you can carry more. Don't worry much about weight since you are as big as a house and
just as strong. Just make as few trips as possible. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Spelling Victory</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The next thing to buy is your spells. The
first one you should get is burst of Flame. It will allow you to tag a mob from a distance
instead of running up to the mob, hitting it, then running back. It allows you to bring
the mob to you instead of you going to it. And the damage isn't too bad. It does 5 damage
for 7 mana, which can be a big help in a fight. Just remember that spells are always more
important than armor. First get all your spells, then start buying armor as you can. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">The next spells to pick up are Strengthen
and Dexterous Aura. They will give you 10 points of strength and dexterity respectively,
which will come in handy making you more powerful and able to carry more weight. If you
have enough, then you can pick up Endure Cold and Cure Disease, but neither are really
necessary. In the newbie grounds, there is little to disease you yet, and there are no
casters to hurt you with cold magic. Flash of Light is a nice spell as it reduces the
mob's chance of hitting you, but it is not available anywhere close. It is sold in Oasis,
but that is a dangerous trip for a level 4 player. The spell is also sold in some cleric
guilds, although you may need to have a friend buy it for you since the clerics may not be
too fond of a tamer of spirits. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Happy Hunting</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">As you increase in level, don't spend any
more skill points just yet. If you get killed, don't worry about it. Just look at it that
you get more free food and water (up to level 4). And be sure to save as much money as
possible. If you work it correctly, you should be almost to level 4 within an hour of
play. But don't make level 4 just yet. Just before you do, find a safe spot and get
killed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, get killed on purpose, but it has to
be before you make level 4. In less than 1 kill, you will get back much more than you
lost. Plus, you will restart with 5 more free food and water. If you don't care about the
food and water, don't get killed. Just go back and loot your body and go on. As soon as
you hit level 4, run back to the guild. Put one point into Channeling to prime the skill
or learn the basics. Channeling will help you to keep from being interrupted while
casting. Also, in order to cast, you must be stationary for 2 seconds. With very high
channeling, you can actually sometimes reduce this. But don't count on the skill to be
100% effective. Once you get the skill, just head back out and continue hunting. </font></p>
