      Shaman Guide (Lvl. 1 to 14)<br>
      </font></span></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><br>
      <br>
      Ok, let me try and pass over some Information for the starting Iksar
      Shaman. This guide is written as an newbie guide, but I think it contains
      some useful information for others too:<br>
      <br>
      <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Getting started (Lvl 1 to 4):<br>
      </b><br>
      <u><b>Level 1:</b><br>
      </u>First to do is outside EQ: Visit EQ-Atlas and print out their maps of
      East Cabilies, Field of Bone (FOB) and maybe Lake of Ill Omen. These maps
      are a wonderful help when starting out.<br>
      <br>
      Then scribe your 2 spells in your spellbook, memorise them and use Inner
      Fire at all times. It is the best HP buff you can get mana wise and helps
      to get the Skill up.<br>
      <br>
      Then visit the “Haggle Baron”. Tell the Klok there “I will perform
      the small service”. He will give you an 8-slot backpack and want you to
      fill it with cured wolf pelts. Perform this quest as often as you can
      because every turned in backpack will give you some coin (up to 1.5 gp),
      good exp. and a random piece of curscale armor, which will be vital for
      you for a long time.<br>
      <br>
      Head out to FOB. Follow the path a little bit over the hill. There is your
      newbie area. Stay at the city side of it.<br>
      At lvl 1 hunt scaled wolf pubs, but be careful, because they aggro on you
      and will gang up. So attack one and step back some way towards the city
      entrance. This is called “pulling”. After you have finished it, heal
      up and pull the next one.<br>
      <br>
      Stay away from beetles and scorpions at lvl 1.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as you have filled your backpack with the pelts, combine it and
      run back to the Haggle Baron to turn it in.<br>
      <br>
      Actually I found lvl 1 harder than in other newbie zones because of the
      wolfs tendency to gang up on me. But as soon as you reach lvl 2 FOB really
      begins to shine.<br>
      <br>
      <u><b>Level 2 to 4:</b><br>
      </u>Continue to hunt scaled wolf pubs and clubs, but also try out decaying
      skeletons, beetles and scorpions. Just make sure to con them, so you dont
      attack something other than intended. While Decaying Skeletons are
      agressive, beetles and scorpions are not until attacked. Beetles will gang
      up when you fight one, scorpions wont.<br>
      <br>
      Be sure to watch the incoming messages at all times, because there will
      inevitably be “trains”, meaning a poor soul running to the guards with
      some mobs on his tail. Since most of these come out of the “pit”, they
      are way higher than the ones in the newbie area and will kill you with one
      or two hits.<br>
      <br>
      At lvl. 4 make sure to go to your guild master and train one point in
      channeling. It will max out fast<br>
      <br>
      Dont spend money for weapon or armor at these lvls! You will need it to
      buy your spells at lvl. 5. But there are some lvl. 1 spells you might want
      to buy: Strengthen, Dexterous Aura, Burst of Flame, Flash of Light<br>
      <br>
      Some may disagree on flash of light. Despite its somewhat limited
      usefulness in combat, it may help to get that spell through which
      otherwise would have been interrupted. Plus it helps to get the Evocation
      skill up, which will greatly help when you get Invisible at higher lvl.<br>
      <br>
      On a notice: If you want, you can turn in the scorpion pincers you get
      from scorpions at the Warlord (1. Floor of the building right of city
      entrance when coming out of the city). He will give you less money than
      the Klok, but faction and some exp. for it.<br>
      <br>
      <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The Pit (Level 5 to 11)<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <br>
      </b></span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
      Level 5:<br>
      First run to your guild and buy as much of your lvl 5 spells as you can.
      Spells worth buying are: Feet like Cat, Sicken, Drowsy, Frost Rift, Summon
      Foot, Gate. If you can afford others, ok.<br>
      <br>
      The Drowsy spell can be found as follows:<br>
      Use the teleporter in the guild hall, which will teleport you on the roof.
      Climb all ladders down and turn left. There is a Klok selling the spell.
      To get out again without Gate, climb up again and jump down at the
      buildings front. You will receive some damage from falling, but dont
      wander around in the basement trying to find a exit. There is a nasty hole
      in the ground, where you probably will die if you fall into it. And when
      not dying, it will be hard to get out there. I had to call a guide at lvl
      5 to teleport me out. His comment was: “There is a way out, but it took
      me 3 hours to figure it out”. So be careful!<br>
      <br>
      Next thing you can do at lvl 5 is making the first <u>Shaman Cudgel Quest</u>:<br>
      Dont bother around with the mortar quest they will give you! It can take
      hours to forage that mud crabs at Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
      <br>
      Jump into the water at the guild and swim through the bridge, turn left
      behind bridge and search the side until you discover an underwater
      passage. Swim into it and surface in the last hole of the passage (if
      someone is already hunting there, the other holes are ok too, just take a
      little longer). To get out of the water, look straight up and jump! Hunt
      all the mobs here, which should be green to you now. From time to time an
      Iksar Outcast spawns. Kill him. He will drop a named skull. You will need
      3 different skulls. For me he was dropping them one after the other, could
      be just luck though. Time needed: 30 – 45 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Turn in the skulls and your cudgel (mace) you got from the guild when
      turning in your newbie note to the trainer on left side of the guild
      leader (when looking at him from entrance). This will get you your new
      cudgel of the petitioner.<br>
      <br>
      Now at latest get a piercing weapon and use it and the cudgel to get both
      skills up. A note on 2 handed blunt weapons: while most other races Shamen
      use them, I haven’t found any cheap 2hb to buy in Cabilies or as loot.<br>
      <br>
      Now you can go into the “pit”:<br>
      The pit is a dried reservoir, having many ramps to get into. One is at the
      end of the street through the newbie area. There are two zones here: if
      you enter from the newbie zone, you are in the low lvl part (about lvl. 5
      to 9), left you see a skeletal Dragon, behind it is the high lvl part
      (lvl. 10 to 15). But mobs from high lvl part tend to wander in low lvl
      part sometimes, so be careful.<br>
      From my viewpoint grouping is vital here and much more fun, so find a
      warrior or monk or maybe a second Shaman of your levelrange.<br>
      <br>
      Just a notice on behaviour: Some people tend to use the ramps to rest.
      This isn’t a very good idea, esp. for the two ramps towards the city.
      These will be used by all people training mobs towards the city guards. It
      is almost impossible to train a mob past someone sitting and meding or
      healing without “loosing” it. Since they are low on hitpoints anyway,
      it often results in them getting killed. So dont rest /med on the ramps.<br>
      On the other hand: try to avoid at all cost to train a mob past someone
      meding/resting at the side of the pit. Its highly unfair saving your butt
      on the cost of others. I know it sometimes accidentally happens and want
      to apologise to the ones having suffered from me!<br>
      <br>
      Mobs to hunt: Lesser Scalebones, Large scorpions, Carrion Shredder,
      Bonecrawler, Scaled Wolfs and Iksar footpads.<br>

          they can be turned in at the warriors guild with the Taskmaster in the
          <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          </span>you can combine 2 giant pincers and give it back to him. He
          will give you very good exp, gp and a note to <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>deliver to Warlords at the gates. Turning them in with the

          since they will bring no exp.</font></span></li>

          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:

          in 3 loose scales and 5 gp in East Cabilies to the left guard at the
          left tunnel to FOB. He will give you an unfinished coif. Using a forge
          with the coif and 3 further loose scales will give you the final coif.
          If you fail, the <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>loose scales will be lost, but the unfinished coif remains. So
          just bring some more scales with you. 10 should <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>do even with no smiting skill.</font></span></li>

      At lvl 8 you get meditate at last. Only put one point in it, it will max
      out fast.<br>
      <br>
      At lvl 9 by your next spells (if you can afford them):<br>
      Spirit of Wolf, Tainted Breath, Light Healing, Summon Food<br>
      <br>
      You can turn over to the middle of the pit with hunting Greater Scalebone,
      Scaled Wolf Hunter, Giant Scorpions or Iksar bandits too.<br>
      <br>
      An additional note on our DOT-Spells: Tainted Breath and Sicken stack,
      meaning you can use both at the same target without cancelling each other.<br>
      <br>
      You should by now know what to hunt and how and are well received in every
      group with your healing and sow-capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      Now its time to upgrade your weapon and armour:<br>
      1HB:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br>
      Armor:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reinforced
      Rhino armour, about 0.5 - 0.75pp per AC from Kurns<br>
      <span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Banded 1 – 2pp per AC from Smiths<br>
      <br>
      Kurns Tower (Level 11 to 14)<br>
      <br>
      From lvl 11 on you can start hunting in Kurns at the entrance hall. Always
      group here! A group with a warrior or with one or two monks about a lvl
      higher than you is best for exp. If you go for cash or just want to get
      your weapon skills up, get one or two warriors about 3 lvls higher than
      you and play their healer. Use your weapon to raise all the time not
      meding up. Additionally you will get about 0.5 to 1 bubble of exp. per
      hour this way.<br>
      <br>
      Kurns is ok for money, if you can get a group (3-4!) to go to basement at
      13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> lvl loot gets good too.<br>
      <br>
      I hope I could help some young Iksar Shamen this way! Have fun and stay
      safe!<br>
