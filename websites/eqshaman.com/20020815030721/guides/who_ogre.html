    </b>When choosing a shaman, the first and most obvious choice you have to make is: Good or
    Evil. You should only be reading this if you can accept the fact that evil races are only
    welcome in 3 cities to start with. I emphasize the welcome because there are places in
    these cities where you will still be KOS.</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><p><font
    face="Verdana">Ok, so you are going to be evil. Why choose to be an Ogre Shaman over a
    Troll? Starting Stats Ogres start with 28 more stat points that Trolls.While most of those
    go into stamina and strength, its still a significant number of extra points. Wisdom Ogres
    have more wisdom than trolls to start. Since wisdom is THE defining stat for a shaman,
    this is quite significant. Newbie Area Say what you like, but the Feerrott is a pretty
    good newbie area. The roads close to Oggok will raise you from levels 1-5 or so. You then
    move to lizard camps for a few levels, followed by skeleton and zombie camps. This will
    get you to about level 10, where you can go to the temples outside Cazic Thule and kill
    Lizard Men until 14 or 15. The connecting zones are Innothule Swamp (Troll newbie area),
    Rathe Mtns, and Cazic Thule(CT). If you like the troll newbie area, its an easy enough run
    to the swamp. For later levels, Rathe Mtns can carry you from level 10 to 50! Cazic Thule
    is also one of the best mid to high level dungeons. Regeneration is a spell Trolls, as a
    race, regenerate HPs faster. That is great for warriors and Shadow Knights, but not nearly
    as important for a shaman. We get regenerate and chloroplast, which are quite adequate at
    the later levels. Agility/Dexterity/Charisma Ogres have lesser numbers in these 3 stats,
    but look at how it affects them All three of these stats can be raised to more than
    adequate levels through spells that all shaman get. While charisma is nice for charming
    animals above level 29, the few extra points will not make a difference in your overall EQ
    experience.</font></p>
