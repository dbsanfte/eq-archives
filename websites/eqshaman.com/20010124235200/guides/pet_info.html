    guide on a shaman pet.<br>
    <small>by </font><font face="Verdana">Death</font></small></strong></p>
    <font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><p>Unlike most other pet classes Shamans have to come
    to terms with pets mid way through their career. We do not depend on our pets, they just
    make life alot easier and more fun. </p>
    <p>Unlike other pet classes our pet is far more fragile and we must look after it. The
    most important lesson is to make sure you dont use your pet to tank for you. </p>
    <p>In dungeons i will usually be with a full group and will almost always have my pet to
    taunt, mainly because the fights should be relatively short and the pets can regen alot
    quicker than you can. </p>
    <p>Buffs: </p>
    <p>First thing shamans do is buff the pet like mad. Whilst this may extend its life by a
    few more rounds, its not a replacement for defensive skills the pet lacks. Your pet will
    usually be approximately 10 or more levels lower than the mobs you will be hunting. I
    generally do not buff my pet other than buff his attack speed. </p>
    <p>In certain situations i will buff the pet, particularly in dungeons where there isnt
    alot of room and there are likely to be several mobs attacking the pet at a time. Evaluate
    if you need to buff your pet or not, not wasting mana on buffing you dont need will reduce
    your downtime. </p>
    <p>Devotion: </p>
    <p>Whist its touching that the pet will attack any mob that agros on you in many
    situations its not desireable to have your pet attack the mob from the outset,
    particularly if you are pulling a mob or kiting it. </p>
    <p>The command /pet guard here will command the pet to stand at the spot. </p>
    <p>For example, i see a Hill Giant in West Commonlands and decide to take it out. I
    command the pet to no taunt and to guard the spot and go out and tag the giant. </p>
    <p>I dot it and run it around for a while to ensure the giant is nice and agro on me. I
    then run past the spot where i left my pet and order it to attack the giant. </p>
    <p>By this stage the giant has lost between a quarter and half its hit points and isnt
    interested in the pet. I can run around in circles with the giant following me whilst the
    pet is chewing on its behind. <br>
    Occassionally the giant will be distracted by the pet and turn on it. Stop and reapply
    dots and maybe even a DD and it will come running after you again. When its low on hit
    points just turn around reduce its attack speed and melee it until death. This example is
    typical of outdoor shaman fighting and you can apply it to almost any mob where you have
    room to run. </p>
    <p>Agro: </p>
    <p>Its an art form comming to grips with how EQ mobs interact with players, their pets and
    which target they consider to be the target to attack or persue. Whist some mobs have been
    coded to ignore pets, pets are generally considered to be players in terms of how
    aggressive they become towards them. </p>
    <p>Whilst our pets are relatively low level they hit fast and double attack aswell (they
    never duel wield). What they will do is hit more often than you will, this in itself will
    raise the pet on the mobs agro list. Ask any ranger why mobs agro on them when a taunting
    warrior which is outdamaging them cant keep the mob off the ranger. Speed of damage is
    more cruicial than the damage itself. </p>
    <p>Luckily the no taunt pet command now finally works and shamans also have the ability to
    stay high on a mobs agro list with the usage of dots which naturally damage the mob every
    tick. </p>
    <p>Unlike any other pet class, Shamans are the only ones that can tank better than their
    pet. Its in our best interest to keep mobs off the pets. Our pets are expensive to cast
    mana wise and should be considered a long term dot rather than a protective device,
    although they are an excellent life saver in time of disaster. Dont be afraid to leave
    your pet to be devoured to buy yourself some time to zone out. </p>
    <p>Pathing Problems: </p>
    <p>All dungeons have the problems with pathing bugs and quirks. Your pet will follow these
    paths in an attempt to get to your position in the quickest time. This often goes bad,
    very bad very fast. Pets can and do wander off in dungeons. You need to keep a careful eye
    on your pet. If you are camping a room then use the /pet guard here command so the pet
    will stay in one spot and not move around too much. After a fight the pet will return to
    that spot and the chances of it wandering are much reduced. </p>
    <p>In dungeons i almost always leave the /pet taunt function on. Some times the only
    advance warning you have of impending disaster is when you get the message that your pet
    is taunting when your group is sitting down and recovering from a fight. Its important you
    inform your group when a pet is missing in action. </p>
    <p>If you notice your pet is gone and you havent seen it taunt anything then immediately
    cast invisibility on yourself straight away, this will destroy the pet where it is. The
    /pet get lost command will only work if its in range. </p>
    <p>If it is taunting then be prepared to retreat or evac. Make sure the group is informed,
    they should have alot of experience with other pet classes which all share the same
    problem. </p>
    <p>In many outdoor areas close to walls there are no pathing lines which will cause the
    pet to wander off, avoid fighting or travelling close to zone walls with a pet. </p>
    <p>Pet Problems: </p>
    <p>Apart from the pathing problems another problem you have to be careful of is that the
    pet is erratic in its choice of target to attack. Classes that root or mez can get a tad
    irrate with pet classes when pets like to attack a target which everyone else wants to
    ignore. </p>
    <p>Make sure you are in control of your pet. Dont be afraid to tell it to back off and
    attack the group target. Dont be shy with hitting those keys, sometimes it takes a dozen
    commands before the pet will switch to the desired target in the heat of a large battle. </p>
    <p>If its becoming a nuisance then at times you have to tell it to get lost if you cant
    control it. </p>
    <p>When enemy enchanters are around use the /pet who leader command as pets have almost a
    non-existant resistance to magic and are easy prey for enemy charms. </p>
    <p>Pets are viable targets for your and your parties area effect spells, area effect DD
    and rain spells are not recommended when pets are around. </p>
    <p>Commands: </p>
    <p>/pet attack<br>
    /pet guard me<br>
    /pet guard here<br>
    /pet as you were<br>
    /pet back off<br>
    /pet follow me<br>
    /pet health report<br>
    /pet who leader<br>
    /pet sit down<br>
    /pet stand up<br>
    /pet taunt<br>
    /pet no taunt<br>
    /pet get lost </p>
    <p>Hitting F1 will toggle between targetting yourself and your pet. Simply hit F1 twice to
    target your pet quickly if clicking on it is difficult.</font></p>
