      Skull Quest No. 1:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierophant Oxyn in the Temple of
      Terror hands you a Component Mortar and asks you to fill it with two Small
      Mosquito Wings, one Bone Chips, and foraged Mud Crabs (found in Lake of
      Ill Omen).&nbsp; You get some xp, faction and a few copper, along with
      some Cursed Wafers.&nbsp; After&nbsp; you return these, ask Hierophant
      Oxyn &quot;What lost skulls?&quot; and he responds,&nbsp; &quot;You must
      have heard of the Trilac Brotherhoods disappearance. They are the skulls
      of three soon to be ancients. They were taken from this temple by a silent
      intruder. Crusaders are always on duty. I do not know how they got into
      our vault. Every petitioner is ordered to search for the three skulls and
      return them to me along with their petitioner cudgel and then they shall
      become clairvoyants.&quot;&nbsp; When asked &quot;What Iron Cudgel of the
      Clairvoyant?&quot; Hierophant Oxyn shakes his head and waves a finger in
      your face.&nbsp; If you are looking to be handed the Iron Cudgel of the
      Clairvoyant then you are sadly mistaken.&nbsp; Perhaps if you were to
      gather a few [lost skulls] for the temple we may find you worthy to wield
      one.&nbsp; So you obviously need to gather the skulls to find out how the
      get the cudgel. The three skulls are named Waz, Morgl, and Lorgl. The
      intruder can be found in the &quot;sewer&quot; area of East Cabilis. (I
      have been told he has been spotted in the Swamp of no Hope as well).&nbsp;
      The way to get to the sewers from the Temple of Terror is to swim past the
      bridge then to the left and under one of the docks that the gondola stops
      at. If you find an underwater tunnel that has barracuda swimming in it,
      you have found it. Follow the tunnel and you'll occasionally come to some
      open areas that you can jump out of the water. Any jump-out point is good,
      however the last one allows the greatest access to MOBs to kill and cause
      the Iksar outcast to spawn. In this area spawns mostly mosquitoes, and
      scorpions with the occasional decaying skeleton. The rare spawns are the
      Iksar outcast and the giant leech. Collect all 3 skulls and return them to
      Oxyn along with the “Cudgel of a Petitioner” you received when you
      gave your guild note to the guild master (NOT THE WOODEN ONE). You receive
      some faction, coinage, your very own <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics12/Iron_Cudgel_of_the_Clairvoyant.html">Iron

      Skull Quest No 2:</font>&nbsp; After completing the first quest,
      Heirophant Onyx sends you on a two part quest. The first part is to get
      two Cleansers of the Outland skulls and return them to him along with your
      Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant. He says when you have done this he will
      tell you where to get the next two skulls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Skull with I is
      found on a stuffed giant barracuda in Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      Warsliks Woods, a Rogue Shaman Spawns.&nbsp; He drops a Jawless Skull and
      a note.&nbsp; The note tells you about the barracuda.&nbsp; You need to go
      to Field of Bones and kill another rogue shaman to get the Mandible.&nbsp;
      The note also says that you can buy Mendglow Clay in Cabilis, but nobody
      can find a place that sells it.&nbsp; It can however be foraged in the
      Burning Woods by a master forager (with much effort).&nbsp; Take your
      Jawless Skull, Mandible and Mendglow clay and combine them on a potters
      wheel (make sure you have a decent pottery skill).&nbsp; Do NOT add water.&nbsp;
      The combination will result in Skull with II.&nbsp; Turn Skull with I and
      Skull with II along with your cudgel of the Clairvoyant to Oxyn and get
      some xp, coin and an Iron Cudgel of the Seer (4/21).&nbsp; When&nbsp; you
      finish this, Hierophant Oxyn says, 'We are in your debt.&nbsp; You are
      truly one who shall collect all the lost ancient skulls.&nbsp; Take your
      weapon.&nbsp; Go to Hierophant Zand and he shall guide you further.&nbsp;
      Tell him you are [the chosen saviour.] (submitted by Brokyyn)</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="Shaman Skull Quest No 3"></a><font color="#ff0000">Shaman
      Skull Quest No 3:</font>&nbsp; Tell Hierophant&nbsp; Zand &quot;I am the
      chosen savior&quot; and he closes his eyes and bows before you. &quot;I am
      honored to meet the one who shall pledge his life to the return of the
      Skulls of the Ancients.&nbsp; However, I must see proof of our prowess as
      of yet.&nbsp; Go to the outlands and retrieve one Froglok Hexdoll, and no,
      they are not found on Frogloks.&nbsp; They are shaman dolls made by the
      goblin tribe.&quot;&nbsp; The doll can be found on a Goblin Hextracer in
      Warslik's Woods.&nbsp; After you turn in the Hexdoll, you get a note to
      deliver to Crusader Quarg in Field of Bones.&nbsp; Quarg gives you a six
      slot container and tells you to go to the Tower of Kurn and bring him the
      Skulls of the Caste of Bone Bretheren, a caste of powerful shamans who
      perished fighting undead in the Field of Bone several decades ago.&nbsp;
      You are to get the skulls of the 5 Caste members along with the Skull of
      the Leader.&nbsp; The Leader Skull is a Lore skull with an &quot;X&quot;.&nbsp;
      The others are non lore Skulls with an &quot;X&quot;. (When Identified,
      they say Caste of Bone Bretheren).&nbsp; They all off the Crusader in
      Kurn's Tower.&nbsp; Put them in the bag and combine it.&nbsp; This turns
      the bag into &quot;C.O.B.B box&quot;&nbsp; Take that back to Crusader
      Quard, along with your previous cudgel, and he will give you the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics12/Iron_Cudgel_of_the_Mystic.html">Iron
      Cudgel of the Mystic</a>.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="Shaman Skull Quest No 4"></a><font color="#ff0000">Shaman
      Skull Quest No 4:</font>&nbsp; After giving Crusader Quarg the box and
      cudgel he gives you your mystic cudgel and says... &quot;The temple shall
      be pleased. As instructed by the Hierophants, here is your Iron Cudgel of
      the Mystic. You have done well that I must ask you to [collect the
      Crusaders of Rok Nilok].&nbsp; Take this chest (6 slot). Inside you shall
      combine the skull of their leader and at least five of the caste members
      (sound familliar). You then will go to the Swamp Garrison and deliver the
      full chest and your Iron Cudgel of the Mystic to Mystic Dovan. Go to him
      now and inquire of the Crusaders of Rok Nilok.&quot;&nbsp; Mystic Dovan
      spawns after 9pm on top of the building with the warlord in Swamp of no
      hope and says when you inquire &quot;Mystic Dovan lowers his head in
      sorrow let us have a moment of peace. I cannot find the words to speak of
      the unspeakable act of the gods which took the lives of the legendary
      Crusaders of Rok Nilok. You must find the answers for yourself. All I can
      do is wait for their return.&quot;&nbsp; The legend of Nilok says that he
      and his followers were shrunk down by a magical rain and that nilok's head
      burns red.&nbsp; You need to go to the first goblin ruins in Warsilik's
      Woods (when entering from Field of Bone) and hunt the Goblin Bloodtracers.&nbsp;
      These drop the 5 glowing skulls you need. You also need to get one Lore
      glowing skull (also dropped by these goblin bloodtracers, but much more
      rare).&nbsp; Combine the 5 skulls and lore skull in the box given by Dovan
      and return them to Donovan, along with your previous cudgel I think, and
      you will recieve the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics12/Iron_Cudgel_of_the_Prophet.html">Iron
      Cudgel of the Prophet</a>.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="Shaman Skull Quest No 5"></a><font color="#ff0000">Shaman
      Skull Quest No 5:</font>&nbsp; After completing quest 4, Donovan will ask
      you to retrieve the skulls of Di Nizok.&nbsp; He says says &quot;bring
      them to me, I shall wait within Zand&quot;, whatever that means.&nbsp; You
      don't get a container, so either you pick one up later or there are only
      three skulls to find (the fourth slot would be for the cudgel).&nbsp;
      Thus, this is still unsolved.</font></p>
