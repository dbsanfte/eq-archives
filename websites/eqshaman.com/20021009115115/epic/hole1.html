      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>Hole Strategy # 1</STRONG><BR><BR>Just want to 
      make a post for how to do the hole part of the quest, as it is one of the 
      more difficult<BR>feats we have.<BR><BR>I found out today that the Keeper 
      of the Tomb in the left hand courtyard of the revenant tower will<BR>eat 3 
      groups alive and laugh if you aggro him. the good news is that Invis to 
      dead works in the<BR>tower.<BR><BR>Yes i know some of the revs still scowl 
      at you but they will NOT attack. Go through the gate, run<BR>through the 
      middle main doors of the tower and to the back where a single door opens 
      to stairs<BR>leading upward. follow this up a couple flights to Kirn 
      himself, then drop invis to dead in his room<BR>and kill the three revs in 
      his aggro range. Kirn is indifferent, so no AE spells. give kirn the icon 
      as<BR>soon as you have breathing space, kill him and evac out of there or 
      invis to dead again and run out.<BR>My raid failed today because we 
      stopped to pull the courtyards and the keeper caught us. 15 coffins<BR>and 
      four slow bodydrags with my halfling rogue later, i logged. The tower is 
      dangerous, dont let the<BR>relatively easy time you had with the 
      elementals fool you. Get in, get the ring and get out.<BR>It took us about 
      4 hours to get to the tower. if your pullers have never been to the hole, 
      urge them to<BR>make halfling rogues and get them there, bind them in 
      paineel by the hole entrance, sow them and<BR>show them around. This will 
      save a lot of time.<BR><BR>Dragging bodies is not easy. 11 mobs after the 
      zone in, there is a dropoff you must jump down to<BR>progress, but you 
      cannot reach coming back. To get back to the zone ye will have to have a 
      high<BR>picklock skill and be able to sneak through the main castle to 
      unlock a door leading back to the zone<BR>via a long bridge above you. Not 
      possible with a 2nd level rogue, as lockpick is too low.<BR>You are able 
      to drag the bodies to just below the dropoff and kill your rogue, giving 
      him a insta<BR>deathgate to paineel where you can return to the area from 
      the top of the dropoff, and from there ye<BR>can summon the corpses of 
      those below with careful manuevering on the lip of the ledge. 
      time<BR>consuming, but it works.<BR><BR>There is a shortcut at one point 
      that involves leaping down a waterfall just past the city. if you 
      take<BR>this route, make it very clear to everyone that they should not 
      jump off the waterfall's edge or run off<BR>the edge or they will splat 
      like an egg instead of hitting the pool below. I believe that you 
      take<BR>damage from water landings if you are encumbered, so make sure 
      noone is lest they die. It's a<BR>loooong drop.<BR><BR>If anyone else 
      wants to throw in some tips or accounts of successful or failed raids 
      please do so.<BR>
