    <small>Level 15&nbsp; -&nbsp; 20<br>
    I have been soloing in the Karanas lately and thought I would share my experiences. I
    started around 15. I would first SoW and lightly buff myself ( dex/agil ) and then Med
    back up to full. Once I had full mana go find a good blue . In North Karana depending on
    your level that could be from Pincer beetles to griffons. I prefered around 18 - 20 to
    kite griffawns and borer beetles. I found borer beetles to actually be harder than
    griffawns. <br>
    <br>
    Now I would hit them with spirit strike and run (until I hit level 19 then I would start
    with an Affliction DoT ) . Then I would hit F9 three times to get a third person view and
    circle the view around behind me and pull out as far as I could to watch the critter chase
    me. Once he got right out of distance to see him I would stop count to 2 ( fast) and hit
    spirit strike again . Immediately start running once you see &quot;hit for 7X
    damage&quot;. Try throwing a tained breath in there for variety. Then just make wide turns
    when you run out of running room and rinse and repeat. Be sure to not get near other
    Griffs or beetles if that is what you are kiting or you will have 2 on you.</small></small></font><hr>

    <p><font face="Verdana" COLOR="#000000" size="1">I just looked at the msg under
    &quot;soloing strategies&quot;....to me that looks like a bad idea. Up to 20 a shaman has
    the melee of most hybrids, a better race for melee and better stats (higher str and so
    on). What I did up to 20 was cast slowdowns, heals, a then meleed things to death. It
    seemed to work just fine for me. Even at lvl 45 I will still melee when solo. Using buffs,
    my pet, debuffs, venom of the snake and scurg, I can solo two HG's in a row (takes about
    2mins per kill). If I tried the nuke/run &amp; dot/run idea, it would take me a lot more
    of my mana and take longer to do it (dots only do 2/3 if the monster is moving). I say use
    the stats we were born with and the good armor we can get!</font></p>
