<p>
Head to the castle in the Tenacious Mountains. Check out <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/tenebrousmtnsmap.html">this</a> map from EQ Atlas. The castle is #4. Trilexior spawns on the 3rd floor by the stairs and wanders around the 3rd floor. He is level 50, but don't be fooled - he has a TON of HP, rampages, flurries, enrages, nukes for 528 damage every so often, has a 200 damage lifetap, and hits for about 137. He is completely poison and disease resistant, so the only DoT you will be able to land is your epic, if you have it. Cold based nukes work pretty good, which will be your main means of offense. Make sure you and your pet are both buffed to the max for this fight. Try to alternate who tanks between you and your pet, letting both of you take some damage.

Trilexior Aeridia's corpse goes limp and falls from the air, bursting into a cloud of dust upon impact with the ground.</td><td width=10%></td></tr></table>
