    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">1) You must be level 49, or you will not be able to do it
    solo, period. Cold spells (like our DD) are 100% resisted in kedge. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">2) If you don't have a fishbone earring or rebreather,
    you're in for a WORLD of pain. Without a fishbone you simply cannot go AFK or you'll
    die... </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Oh, and you remember those serverlag spikes? The ones where
    the RCV packetloss goes to 30%, back down to 0, back up to 30%, and nothing happens for up
    to a minute or two? Well, enduring breath's duration is clientside, and so is drowning.
    That's right, EB can go out during serverlag and you can drown before you can cast it. You
    can be sitting at your computer and just watch it happen. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">So anyway, if you don't have a fishbone or rebreather try
    your DAMNDEST to borrow/buy/beg/steal one. If you can't pull it off, buy a couple (5 or
    10) water-breathing potions from your local potion vendor for emergencies. (not your local
    shaman, the vendor has em cheaper =/) </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Also buy two entire backpacks of fish scales. Yes, I
    realize that's 320 scales. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">3) In kedge, ALWAYS fight with your back to the wall, and
    fight in a corner if possible. This is to prevent spell interruptions; every time you're
    hit underwater you move backwards. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">4) Make a level 36 pet, the one that hits for 51. You can
    test it on lancer swordfish, they're really easy. Park your pet at the spot marked &quot;<b><font color="red">1</font></b>&quot; on the map. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">5) Your home for the next X hours (hopefully X&lt;65!) is
    marked &quot;<b><font color="red">2</font></b>&quot; on the map. Wedge yourself into this
    corner. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">4) The fierce impaler's placeholder spawns in the very back
    of the room, at the spot marked &quot;<b><font color="red">3</font></b>&quot;. It then
    follows the arrows to &quot;<b><font color="red">4</font></b>&quot;, &quot;<b><font color="red">5</font></b>&quot;, and then back to &quot;<b><font color="red">3</font></b>&quot;.
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">The placeholder has a spawn time of eighteen minutes and
    can be either a piercer swordfish (level 33 to 38, mostly green at 50) or an impaler
    swordfish (level 38-42, all blue at 50). </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">5) <b>How to solo-pull the placeholder.</b> </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>i)</b> First, make sure that there are no lancers
    visible behind the pillar. They'll show up at <b><font color="red">6</font></b> or <b><font color="red">7</font></b>. Usually <b><font color="red">7</font></b>. If a lancer is there,
    just stand up in your home corner and slap it with togors insects. Your pet will attack
    the fish, so root it and swim over to <b><font color="red">1</font></b> and med until it
    dies. It shouldn't take long. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">If a lancer is present right behind the pillar there, it
    will aggro on you when you go to pull the placeholder. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>ii)</b> Alacrity your pet. Make sure your pet has
    talisman up. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>iii)</b> From your home at <b><font color="red">1</font></b>,
    stand up, look straight up and swim to the ceiling. Then, let yourself float down. You
    should be about 2 feet behind the ledge and NOT that close to the pillar. As you float
    down, check <b><font color="red">4</font></b> and <b><font color="red">5</font></b> for a
    piercer or impaler. It will be fairly high up-- remember kedge is a three dimensional
    dungeon. If you don't see either one there, it is either at <b><font color="red">3</font></b>
    (and thus inaccessable) or dead already (so wait). Target the impaler/piercer placeholder
    by clicking on it. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>iv)</b> Turn around and face back to the zone. Swim
    forward until you hit the wall at <b><font color="red">2</font></b>, then pop togor's
    insects. The second togor's insects finishes, swim over to <b><font color="red">1</font></b>.
    With a bit of luck (and some practice) the placeholder and the placeholder alone will
    follow you to <b><font color="red">1</font></b> and attack you. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Your pet will instantly attack it and take its attention
    off of you. If the placeholder is a piercer, root it, swim to <b><font color="red">1</font></b>,
    and med. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">If the placeholder is an impaler, ebolt it, root it, swim
    to <b><font color="red">1</font></b>, and med. After 42 seconds, ebolt and root again.
    Watch your pet's health, sometimes you need to toss a gheal on it. If the impaler breaks
    root and attacks you at <b><font color="red">1</font></b>, root it again and med at <b><font color="red">2</font></b>. <b>ALWAYS STAY IN A CORNER!</b> </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">6) <b>How to solo-pull and terminate the fierce impaler.</b>
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>i)</b> The fierce impaler is a nasty mother. Before I
    pull him, I make sure that my pet and myself have talisman, guardian, and chloroplast up
    and <i>especially</i> that my pet has alacrity. Yes this will take a lot of mana and yes
    you will have to med when the fierce impaler has actually (oh my god!!) spawned... but
    it's worth it. Get full mana just in case. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>ii)</b> You can try to pull the fierce with togors like
    the placeholder, but usually he aggros on you as soon as you get to the ceiling and start
    floating down. He has a <b>HUGE</b> aggro radius. So, give it a shot... I managed to pull
    with togors 3 out of 6 fierce pulls. Regardless, the fierce should be on you and you
    should be at <b><font color="red">1</font></b> with your pet hitting it. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana"><b>iii)</b> If togors isn't in, togors. Then plague, ebolt,
    root, swim to <b><font color="red">2</font></b>, and med. After that, it's the same as an
    impaler placeholder-- watch your pet's health and ebolt/root a couple of times, always
    staying in the opposite corner. I have never had to zone a fierce impaler. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">7) Loot your gloomwater harpoon (heh heh), set your timer
    for 18 minutes, and repeat. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Hope that helped! </font></small></p>
