	<b>Laws</b><p>
1. Guild Members will not dishonor the name of the guild, nor commit the guild to any actions without the Dark Councils approval.
<p>
2. The Guild should be a priority, as we are family. First...and Foremost.
<p>
3. Absolutely NO Kill Stealing, or anything of this nature will be tolerated. Offenses will result in a warning, and the second time will result in the player being removed from the guild.
<p>
4. Play with Honor, and Honesty. 
<p>
5. Roleplay as much as possible, and HAVE FUN! Thats what its all about for us all! )
<p>
6. Begging is beneath the honor of any guildmember. Charity towards your fellow guildmates is honorable. ( This doesnt necessarily mean giving away items... but if you have an item you no longer need, check with your guildmembers before starting transactions outside of the guild. )
<p>
7. Disputes will be settled IN-HOUSE, not in public. Speak with your class leader if there is a problem that you feel needs resolving. They will carry it to the dark council for review.
<p>
8. Use the "roleplay" command rather than the "anon" command if you wish for your class to be anonomous. All should wear the name proudly. There should be no reason to go without your Guild Name.
<p>
9. A person's Main character must be in the guild. Not thier twink or lesser character unless as secondary guild characters.
<p>
10. No members will be accepted if they have characters that are in another active guild. This may cause conflicts of interest.



<p>

4. After your week of apprenticeship, your name and deeds will come before the Dark Council by your class leader. The council will then determine whether you are accepted into the guild.
