      enterance to the city and hail the guard on the right. Say I am being 
      assigned to help. He will tell you to get him 4 rhino beetle eyes. Go down 
      to the pit and kill rhino beetles for the eyes, of course. Once you get 4, 
      give them to the guard for exp, money, and a minor item such as rockhopper 
      hide armor, or a wooden practice hammer.</blockquote><BR>

		<blockquote>
		<BR>You say, 'Hail' <BR><BR>Master Barkhem says 
        'Welcome to my shop. Please feel free to look around at the armor we 
        have available. If you are looking for work, just let me know. 
        <BR><BR>You say, 'I am looking for work' <BR><BR>Master Barkhem says 
        'That's great news! I could really use a hand. I have constructed some 
        shield frames ideal for use with the carapaces found on [bloodlings]. 
        Unfortunately I do not have the time to collect any of the shells. You 
        can either purchase the frames and keep the shields for yourself, or you 
        can return them to me and I <BR>will compensate you for your troubles. 
        <BR><BR>You say, 'what are bloodlings?' <BR><BR>Master Barkhem says 
        'Cht`Thk bloodlings are parasites found in the thickets just beyond the 
        south gate. You best be careful, they have a habit of sucking the blood 
        from a person and spreading diseases. <BR><BR>He is a Merchant also so 
        click on him to buy the Sheild Frame <BR><BR>Master Barkhem tells you, 
        'That'll be 3 gold 2 silver 4 copper for the Carapace Shield Frame'. 
        <BR><BR>Collect 8 Bloodling Carapaces and Click Combine <BR><BR>You have 
        fashioned the items together to create something new! <BR><BR>Bloodling

        ALL <BR><BR>If you want, you can exchange the Shield for a Bloodling 
        Plate for making armor. <BR><BR>If you Turn it in to Him: <BR><BR>Master 
        Barkhem takes the shield from Siaman and glances it over. He smiles and 
        nods his head in approval before speaking, 'This is some quality work my 
        friend. Although you could use some practice in your style, I can sense 
        true potential in your smithing skills.' Master Barkhem rumages around 
        behind his counter for a bit and pulls out a <BR>rather large bloodling 
        carapace and hands it to Siaman. 'This was too large for me to use for a 
        shield, but I think you can craft it into some fairly good armor. Just 
        treat it in a forge with nepeta oil and the proper mold, the oil should 
        soften it up enough to become pliable. Once fired in the forge it will 
        harden to the mold. I'd love to see how It turns out.' <BR>

You say, 'Hail, Animist Mahron Sood'

Animist Mahron Sood says 'Hail mate, did you need something from me or are you looking to do me a favor? 
<p>
You say, 'I will do you a favor' 
<p>
Animist Mahron Sood says 'I've been playing with this little hopper for a while with the hopes of maybe domesticating him. He's fond of grimling parts, so that's what I bring him when I come over here to sit around and 
work on my leatherwork. I'll make you a deal... If you bring me four grimling toes or finger bones, I'll trade them for one of my leather pieces. Don't mix them up though.... I'm trying to see which he likes best... fingers bones or toes. 
<p>Your reward is a random piece of leather armor</p>

	  <b>The Button Girl</b>
	  <br>
	  
	  <blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Delival' <BR><BR>Delival says 'Hello 
      there. I do not suppose you have seen a little girl running around with a 
      box of buttons? I sent [Shainai] over to Master Barkehm's place so I can 
      finish these [uniforms] I am working on. <BR><BR>You say, 'what shainai?' 
      <BR><BR>Delival says 'Shainai is my little girl. While I am [inactive] I 
      would like to see her as much as possible so I brought her with me here. I 
      am starting to worry that she may have gotten lost near the palace. If you 
      see her and have the time to escort her back here I would be indebted to 
      you, friend. <BR><BR>Shainai walks from her home to the palace, wanders 
      around in the lower <BR>level until she reaches the arena and then wanders 
      home. If you hail her <BR>before she reaches the palace steps, she will 
      say 'Hello, my name is <BR>Shainai and I am on a very important mission 
      for my Daddy. He ran out of <BR>buttons for the officers' clothes so I 
      have to get him more. I am an <BR>excellent helper.' (You get a similar 
      response if she is near home at <BR>the end of her journey.) <BR><BR>She 
      will then continue on her way. When she reaches the palace steps she 
      <BR>stops skipping and looks around, 'Uh oh' <BR><BR>From this point if 
      you hail her... <BR><BR>Shainai says 'Hi. I was getting some <BR>buttons 
      for Daddy and I got a little lost. I know the way, I mean it...but if you 
      wanted to follow me home to make sure I got there safe and all, you could. 
      <BR><BR>You say, 'I will follow you home' <BR><BR>Shainai says ''says, 
      'You will?!? Oh good, now I won't be so lonesome. Here hold my bag of 
      buttons if you please, my arms are tired. Ready? Follow me now, I know the 
      way.' Shainai pauses and looks around, <BR>'Hrmmmm....' <BR><BR>She then 
      meanders home, getting a little lost on the way. When you reach her home 
      Delival sees you come into the room but looks just past you, 'Shainai is 
      that you?' <BR><BR>Shainai says 'Ahhh, home at last. <BR><BR>Delival says 
      'Well thank heavens you're finally home, perhaps I should think twice 
      before sending you out alone next time, little one. Thank you so much for 
      bringing her back, my friend. Looks like she managed to <BR>talk you into 
      carrying the buttons for her as well. <BR><BR>Give the bag of buttons to 
      Delival. <BR><BR>Delival says 'Well I wish there was <BR>more I could do 
      to repay you. Take this old compass and what change I can spare with my 
      most sincere thanks. Now off to bed Shainai, you have had a busy day. 
      <BR><BR>Delival gives you a compass, which sells to merchants for 1pp and 
      a few gold (not 2pp) and some money. I've had between a few coppers to 
      1pp. <BR>Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better. 
      <BR>You gain experience!! <BR><BR>Shainai yawns deeply, 'Daddy I'm sleepy, 
      could you come tuck me in ?' <BR><BR>Delival sighs and says, 'My hands are 
      full right now hon.' <BR>Delival looks your way curiously and asks, 'I 
      don't suppose you would want to tuck her in for me if I give you a 
      blanket?' <BR><BR>You say, 'I will tuck her in' <BR><BR>Delival says 
      'Thank you again, have been a great help. Here is her favorite blanket, 
      just give it to her and she should be fine. G'night Shainai. 
      <BR><BR>Shainai settles comfortably in for restful afternoon nap, 'Thank 
      you for walking me home, it was ever so nice of you. Goodnight.' 
      <BR><BR>Total experience is 1 yellow at level 1.
