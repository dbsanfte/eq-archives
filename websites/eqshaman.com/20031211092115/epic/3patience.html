Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island (location -900, +1600). If she isn't up, her spawn time is 2 hours.
<p>
Make sure you have Spirit of Wolf, Levitation, and Enduring Breath up and running, as well as a pet. During this encounter you might have to kill sharks, some as high as level 42. Some sharks also see through Invisibility, so make sure you can take these down solo or have enough help along to avoid being killed.
<pYou say, <b>'Hail, Ooglyn'</b>
<p>
Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh.'
<p>
Give her the gem.
<p>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you there. We goin for a swim, shaman!'<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
<p>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn feels much faster.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.<br>
Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<br>
Ooglyn's body pulses with energy.
<p>
Follow Ooglyn. She will swim past a ruined boat and eventually end up at the bottom of the ocean at location -1600, +4200. If you accidently lose her, just go to the loacation. She might be waiting there for you and she might not. Either way, it doesn't matter. Now, summon a pet if you plan to fight the sharks or cast Invisibility/Invisibility versus Animals if you want to try and avoid them. Note that some killer sharks see through invisibility.
<p>
Ooglyn says 'Ok, here is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman!'
<p>
During the course of this event many NPC's will spawn, asking you to follow them. Do NOT move from this spot or you will have to start over. You do not actually have to talk to any of the NPC's, you just have to wait. Four minutes later, Srafen the Soaked will appear.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, Srafen the Soaked'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Why hello there! Ahh, it's good to see a new face down [here]. So you've come to [wait] with [us] eh? That is splendid! It's been getting very boring lately.'
<p>
You say, <b>'Where is here?'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Oh! Well this is where [we wait]. It's not much for looks but if you're lucky, a pretty fish will swim by. Oh, and once Dillon said he saw one of those fish women, a mermaid, he called it!  Although, I'm not so sure of his state of mind, hehehe. He's been waiting here much longer than I.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What do we wait for?'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'We've been waiting quite some time, really. I have been here the least amount of time, but that doesn't help keep the boredom away, heheh. What are we waiting for, you ask?  HehehHAahahah!  What are we waiting for??  Heheheh, what a silly question!  It's quite obvious if you take the time to think about it.  Heh.  Ummm..  I'm really not sure.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What about us?'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Well, there's me, Srafen. I've been down here for, can't quite remember, a number of years, I guess. If my wife saw the condition my clothes are in, she'd whack me, I'm sure, heheh. Although I'd bet she's long since dead, probably. Then there's Dillon. He says he's been here since those people up top in Erud blew that big hole in the ground. Not sure what happened but I guess it was a long time ago. Hmmmm, who [else]?'
<p>
You say, <b>'Who else?'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Ahh, yes, there's also a really old guy I've only seen a couple times, name's Froham. Whew, he is really old, and not much of a talker. Mostly mumbles from time to time. Dillon says he's been here since Erud first took his people across the sea. Not sure who this Erud feller is but Froham isn't in the best of shape, so it must have been a LONG time ago. Froham did mention there's one other guy but we've never seen him. He apparently had something to do with the Combine Empire, no idea what that is though.'
<p>
Three minutes after Srafen appears, Dillon the Drowned will appear.
<p>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well met again, Srafen. How goes it?'
Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey there, Dillon! Good to see you again, I think.'
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, Dillon the Drowned'</b>
<p>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey Srafen, who is this weirdo talking to me? Or is it another one of those funny illusions Froham keeps talking about?'<br>
Srafen the Soaked looks around frantically a moment then laughs and says, 'Ohhh, them!  Hehehe!  This is a friend of mine come to wait with us. Isn't that exciting, Dillon?  And it's not just an illusion, I don't think!  Say, are you [an illusion], shaman?'
<p>
You say, <b>'I am not an illusion.'</b>
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Awww, well that's too bad. Although illusions and real people don't seem to be much different at times, so, please stay and keep Dillon and me company. We could use it, right Dillon?'<br>
Dillon the Drowned shrugs and says, 'Whatever.'
<p>
11 minutes after Dillon the Drowned appears, Srafen will speak.
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey Dillon, why don't you tell us again about what happened up top? You know, where they blew that big hole into the ground.'<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Again? Oh I don't know Srafen, I don't want to [bore] our company, even if it is an illusion.'
<p>
You say, <b>'You won't bore me.'</b>
<p>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well ok, I was sent here a long time ago to wait. When I got here, I couldn't believe all the violence going on. Why would the spirits send me here to wait when all this fighting and commotion was going on, I wondered. There were great battles on the ocean in splendid ships made of pine and shining with [magical enhancements]. While I was waiting below, blasted, bloody body parts were floating down to the bottom of the ocean all around me.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What magical enhancements?'</b>
<p>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Yes, their ships were very strange, constructed in very unusual designs and all seemed to shine with a multicolored glow. I heard there was even a ship that could stay completely underwater for long periods of time. It had huge steel spikes protruding from the top of its hull used to 'swim' under enemy ships and puncture their hulls. I always thought that someday all this magic would cause something [disastrous] and eventually, it did.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What was disastrous?'</b>
<p>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well, one time, I was here waiting as usual. The fighting was particularly heavy up top, lots of banging and rumbling around. And suddenly there was a tremendous screech! I had to cover my ears, it was so loud, even down here. It felt like the water itself was being torn asunder; I could imagine what was happening above. After a few seconds of the screeching came a terrible tremor and rumbling. Great cracks opened up around me and water rushed to fill them, almost dragging me down into the gods know what. It calmed down a little while after that and there hasn't been any real fighting ever since. I suspect they're all dead now. For weeks afterwards, the water had a kind of dead taste to it. I became ill during that time.'
<p>
3 minutes after Srafen speaks, he will say this and depart:
<p>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Okay, well, I've had enough. Yet again, we've waited for nothing. Sometimes I really wonder if the spirits are real after all. Well I for one am going to go find something fun to do - this is obviously a waste of time. Come with me, shaman, it'll be great fun! Fairwell Dillon.'<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey wait! I'm coming with!'
<p>
3 minutes later, Froham the Forgotten appears.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, Froham the Forgotten'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten looks up at you and mumbles a brief greeting. He appears uncomfortable around others.
<p>
You say, <b>'Who are you?'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten glances up at you, fiddling with his bony fingers and mumbles, 'Mmmm me name's Froham..I'm 'ere [waitin].'
<p>
You say, <b>'What are you waiting for?'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten says, '...just waitin'..it'll [be ere soon], I s'pose.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What will be here soon?'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten obviously has trouble communicating.  He shifts uncomfortably and says, 'Well I'm not sure, but it's real important. I been 'ere fer a [long time], a real long time. So I'll keep waitin' til it comes.'
<p>
You say, <b>'How long is a long time?'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten says 'Been 'ere since Erud sailed over with his friends. They let me catch a ride on their ship after I told them I needed to come 'ere to wait. He was a nice fella, real smart. Though I'm thinkin' he's dead by now. Maybe [Abe] knows fer sure. Abe's been here longer'n me, even.'
<p>
You say, <b>'Who is Abe?'</b>
<p>
Froham the Forgotten says 'Yeah, Abe's an old guy. Well, he's kinda beyond bein' old if ye know what I mean. Not all together either. His mind floats all over like the sea around us. But he's got enough sense to wait here like he's done fer, well, fer dang near ever. If ye see him, and he ain't much fer talkin straight, ask him about [a broken arrow]. Not sure what it means to him but it seems to bring him around.'
<p>
Froham will not respond to any more attempts at conversation. 6 minutes after he appears, he will depart and say this:
<p>
Froham the Forgotten sighs heavily and says, 'Looks like it's not comin'. You know, Abe told me of a great treasure a ways away from here, guarded by one o' them girls with the fish tails. I always wanted to go but those two jokers, Dillon and the other young one, never had the guts. Why don't ye come with me, shaman?  We'll split the treasure fifty-fifty, fair and square.'
<p>
5 minutes later, Abe the Abandoned will appear.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail Abe the Abandoned'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then, suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [ABE]!'
<p>
You say, <b>'Who are you Abe?'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend you mine but I don't wear the same size.
<p>
You say, <b>'What eyes?'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine] fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And now we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What is the Combine?'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What about a broken arrow?'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned 's eyes suddenly come into focus, looking deep into your own and says, 'There was a time when we cared for the world and trod with the spirits along the paths of the cosmos. We built many great things and worked to preserve what was. I came here to wait for an answer when we began to die off. We could not figure why this was and I was chosen to come here and commune with our friends. We carved an arrow, and everyone who was left shaved a sliver of wood from it. We let it drop to hallowed ground and our highest shaman stepped on it, breaking it. I've been waiting here for so long. So, so long, to give it to the spirits, and thank them.'
<p>
4 minutes after he appears, Abe will say this:
<p>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time.'
<p>
You say, <b>'I will give them the arrow.'</b>
<p>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without a word.
<p>
You recieve a broken arrow. 3 minutes later, Abe will depart and say:
<p>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer! Come with me and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledege is not for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me Shaman!'
<p>
2 minutes later a greater spirit will spawn.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail a greater spirit'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path].'
<p>
You say, <b>'What is the next path?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his instructions.'
<p>
You will receive a "small gem".
<p>
(As for the broken arrow, there is no found use for it and the majority of shaman just destroy it.)
