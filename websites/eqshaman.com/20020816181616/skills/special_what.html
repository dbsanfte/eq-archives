    </b></font></font>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>What is it?</strong></small></font>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Specialization is the means by which a caster
      increases their mana efficiency in a given area of magic.&nbsp; Once an
      int based caster reaches Level 20, or a wis based caster reaches level 30,
      they obtain the ability to specialize in the fields of magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Whilst a caster can specialize in all five fields of magic, only one field
      can exceed a skill of 50.&nbsp; Whichever skill first exceeds 50 becomes
      the primary specialization of the caster from that time on.&nbsp; If you
      choose the wrong specialty, you can alter it by completing a quest in the
      Temple of Solusek Ro.</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>How does it work?</strong></small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>When a spell is cast a roll is thrown to see
      if it receives the specialization bonus.&nbsp; The higher your specialization
      skill the more likely it is the roll will succeed, and the greater the
      benefit of the roll.&nbsp; A successful roll will do two things:</small></font>
      <ul>
        <li><small><font face="Arial">It will reduce the mana used on the spell.</font></small>
        <li><small><font face="Arial">It will reduce the chance of fizzling.</font></small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">An unsuccessful roll will merely cause you to
      cast the spell with normal mana cost and fizzle chance.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Note:&nbsp; It has been confirmed by Geoffrey
      Zatkin, the Arch-Magi at Verant that:</font></small>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><font face="Arial"><small>Specialization <u>does not</u>
          increase chance of recovering after interruption.&nbsp; This is based
          purely on Channeling</small></font></strong>
        <li><strong><font face="Arial"><small>Specialization <u>does not</u>
          make spells cast faster.&nbsp; This is a fixed amount.</small></font></strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>To raise your skill you will need to spend
      one practice point in the skill initially.&nbsp; This will raise your
      skill to around 25 or so.&nbsp; Spend 1 point in each of the five skills.&nbsp;
      After this the best idea is to pick the specialization you want, memorize
      a Level 1 spell of that type and cast it on yourself for an hour or so
      until you reach 51 skill.&nbsp; After that you can simply go and play
      normally safe in the knowledge your primary specialization is set.&nbsp;
      It rises fairy quickly so don't be surprised to see it climb up fast.&nbsp;
      The max skill limit on specialization is 5 + (5 x Level), with a maximum
      of 200.</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>What should I specialize in?</small></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>This is of course the big question.&nbsp; In
      some cases, such as wizards, the answer is clear.&nbsp; However, the other
      classes have a bit of a tougher time in making their decision.&nbsp;
      Firstly it is recommended you examine the spell lists on this site and
      search by spell type to get an idea of exactly what spells are in what
      class.&nbsp; For example if you were an Enchanter thinking of specializing
      in Evocation, you would notice that only 5 of the 200+ spells use this
      skill.&nbsp; It would be ill advised to specialize in Evocation as an
      enchanter.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>When deciding between competing specializations
      you have to weigh up the number of spells which will benefit from it, the
      situation those spells will be used in, how often you will use those
      spells, and the average mana cost of that class of spells.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><small>Note that if you accidentally specialize
      in the wrong thing there is a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro which can
      wipe you Specializations so you can start them all over again.</small></b></font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Arial"><small>--</small><small>Shamans--</small></font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>Shaman's have two real choices: <strong>Alteration</strong>
      and <strong>Conjuration</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Conjuration</strong> is mainly useful for Shaman's who solo or
      kite a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a good specialization to take if you plan
      on soloing up until around level 35, or plan on using DoT's a lot.</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Alteration </strong>is used for
      almost all of the Shaman's buffs, heals, regenerations and the like.&nbsp;
      These are used mainly in downtime, but you can save a great deal of mana
      with using this as your specialization. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Alteration</strong> is a pretty safe bet, but if you attack more,
      and enhance less, then <strong>Conjuration</strong> is still worth
      considering.</small></font></td>
