      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>The Test of 
      Wisdom<BR></STRONG><BR>Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit 
      (looks exactly like a wisp).<BR>TIP: You can stand at neg 500 neg 5300 in 
      West Karana and he will path by you.<BR>I've now done this twice and never 
      waited more than 20 - 30 min tops. He will also<BR>path by Tower 2, 
      actually colliding with it on his journey. Just keep looking<BR>around so 
      he doesn't slip by you. . . . - Belgar<BR><BR>Once spotted, run up to him 
      and Hail him repeatedly at close range to get him to<BR>stop 
      moving.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail a wandering 
      spirit'<BR></STRONG><BR>a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for 
      a moment. It seems to be regarding you 
      with<BR>interest.<BR><BR><STRONG>Give the "small gem" to the wandering 
      spirit.</STRONG> <BR><BR>a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! 
      Good! You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to<BR>the Mountains they 
      call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They will know 
      you<BR>when they see you and instruct you on how you can help, but you 
      must hurry!<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>You 
      gain experience!!<BR><BR>Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the 
      Goodly (approx level 32) at loc<BR>pos 6300, pos 1550. If you talk to him, 
      the conversation is as follows:<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail Tabien the 
      Goodly'<BR></STRONG><BR>Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are 
      here, Waring . I was beginning to think I would be<BR>abandoned in my time 
      of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of my 
      patron<BR>Mithaniel Marr.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What 
      task?'<BR></STRONG><BR>Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once 
      have been shining and regal but is now scoured<BR>in cuts, dents, and 
      chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's Promise. It is a 
      sacred relic<BR>that was actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the 
      Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is<BR>immeasurable and I have been 
      charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch of the 
      false<BR>god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be stopped! 
      Please, destroy him and bring me<BR>proof of his death.<BR><BR>The other 
      one is Glaron the Wicked (approx level 32), his loc is pos 2900, neg 
      1900.<BR>If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<BR><BR>You 
      say, <STRONG>'Hail Glaron the Wicked'<BR></STRONG>&nbsp; <BR>Glaron the 
      Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should have 
      known they<BR>would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and 
      myself. Very well, you will have to<BR>suffice. I have a [task] you must 
      fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress 
      your<BR>masters.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What 
      task?'<BR></STRONG><BR>Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking 
      bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased<BR>stench as soon as he 
      unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider than the first, 
      of<BR>blackened bone with a larger than normal hilt, obviously for 
      defense. He says, 'This festering blade<BR>is called Woe, and this 
      scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay 
      by<BR>Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection 
      of such holy relics. However,<BR>there is one in these very mountains who 
      seeks to destroy these relics. End this idiot follower of<BR>Marr's life 
      and bring me proof.'<BR><BR>Now both these guys are fools, what do we do 
      with fools? <STRONG>We kill them.</STRONG> Take their<BR>items (Envy, Woe 
      and Marr's Promise) back to West Karana and give all three to<BR>the 
      wandering spirit at the same time.<BR>NOTE: Marr's Promise will not fit 
      into any bag, except either a Tinker's Bag or a<BR>Large Sewing Kit, for 
      it's huge size.<BR>NOTE: Conversation with Glaron and Tabien is not 
      required to finish the quest.<BR>You may, if you wish, simply kill them 
      outright.<BR><BR>a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the 
      test, keep up the good work.<BR>a wandering spirit says 'You are close to 
      passing the test, keep up the good work.<BR>a wandering spirit says 'It is 
      unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. 
      Both<BR>paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items 
      given to them. The mere protection of<BR>these material belongings was not 
      as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they<BR>act 
      with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw 
      this and acted<BR>accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three 
      treasures made into one to ward off the<BR>falsehood of possession, the 
      [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked the path and now, as your<BR>final 
      test, we must set you along one [last path].<BR>Your faction standing with 
      TrueSpirit got better<BR>You gain experience!!<BR><BR>You say, 
      <STRONG>'What shield of falsehood?'</STRONG><BR><BR>a wandering spirit 
      says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and Envy and 
      fashioned<BR>them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this 
      in defense of possession and the<BR>weakness that comes with hoarding 
      treasure instead of using it to accomplish your goals. May it<BR>serve you 
      well, Barbarian.<BR>Congratulations. You have now received ...</STRONG>

      in<BR>our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if 
      you have the ability to act out what<BR>must be done. There are many

      serious<BR>than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go
