              decided to try a little alchemy. Went to Qeynos, retrieved 11 rat
              ears, back to Halas. Got the Alkanet . Succeeded 8 times with lvl
              11 skill. But this mixture created the Charming Deceit potion for
              me. Maybe they changed it? Just so everybody knows.<br>
              My Int while making the potions was 81 ( and still is for that
              matter =)). And yes, it is a Charisma potion. Plus 15&nbsp;I think
              (which is nothing to sneeze at)</font>
