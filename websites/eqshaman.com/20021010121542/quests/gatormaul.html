    Hope this helps all those interested in getting themselves a maul. First of all let me
    state that the maul was gotten by a high elf wizard who is agnostic and owns a guise of
    the deceiver (good luck recreating that unbelievable luck out), however, I believe this
    quest to be doable in other ways if you are willing to take the time. Namely, either have
    a wizard or druid gate around your newbie ogre warrior to get Dvinn's heart, or, try it
    invis (don't see why it won't work long as you don't right click on anything).<br>
    Hoakay, let's get down to details:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>1</strong>. Go to crushbone, blast the crap out of Dvinn and get his heart (easy
    enough). Please be sure that the room is empty or if it is camped offer them a dragoon
    dirk to loot his heart (you'll get another, no loss here). Ogres and Trolls will have to
    have someone pull Dvinn from the tower of levitate to it (as Verant seems to not like fat
    people , crackmonkies).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2</strong>. Catch a ride or foot it to Oggok (pretty safe these days, guards are
    camped 24/7). <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3</strong>. GET A CRUDE STEIN ( so easy to do, guard killers leave them all over
    the place). This step is crucial, you must have the stein in hand to do the quest.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>4</strong>. The third bottom hole of five (the one on the right) leads through the
    shaman guild, stick right until you enter a room with maybe 6 hallways leading off from
    it. You want to go down the one in the middle, should be 3rd from the right I think (there
    will be a bed in the room).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>5</strong>. If you happened upon the room at nighttime, have a sit big guy (start
    sweating if you are invis, heh). At 8am, the Bouncer in the room should unspawn, and at 10
    am (like 5 min later), Ambassador K'Rynn should spawn.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>6</strong>. Nuke K'Rynn (do not let him run!). He has a heart and a Goon Dirk
    every time.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>7</strong>. Put your crude stein in hand and head to the warrior guild. Give both
    hearts to Lork (we started as dubious and moved to amiable, hehe, little bit of xp too,
    which makes up for all the time spent getting those mauls, rofl).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>8</strong>. Admire new Gatorsmash Maul (worked every single time for god knows how
    many times now, this would be a good time to run like hell you invis people).<br>
    Hope this helps you all get your own maul , if not, feel free to look us up to purchase
    one on Mith Marr, be glad to get you one. Good luck and Godspeed brothers and sisters.<br>
    <br>
    Give me Gatorsmash or give me death! <br>
    Oh, one last thing, don't get one unless you have quickness at 29, or plan to bank it
    until then, and the damage is capped until 30, then again till 40, then one more at 50,
    happy hunting. </font></p>

      I ran the quest with my barb shaman and a 40 Druid ( Elam of Prexus ) last
      night we gathered the hearts, invised ourselves, he wolf formed us and we
      went to Lork to hand the hearts in. Well he said something to the effect
      of ..&nbsp;<br>
      I smell an enemy here.. It you!...&nbsp;<br>
      Luckily he didn't attack he just didn't give us anything. So I started a
      Level 1 Ogre and Elam buffed a skin like diamond and wolf form on me on me
      and he took out the inkies. I looted the hearts and we went back to oggok
      I stayed in ogre form and handed them in and got my Maul. The pay off for
      my druid friend was a total of 4 Dragoon Dirks he now has on my and his
      other characters. The inkie in oggok always drops a dirk and dvinn
      happened to have one each time we got him. Oh yeah BE SURE YOU ARE INVISIBLE
      IF YOU ARE NOT A OGRE ( even if you are in wolf form ) IF YOU GO THROUGH
      THE OGGOK SHAMAN GUILD . They can smell who you really are.</font><font color="#FF0000"><br>
