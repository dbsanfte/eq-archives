    [Quote from original post: I am only 30 at alchemy, but have looked through many of the
    potions. The only thing that I can make to sell so far is a SOW potion. No one wants to
    buy those stat potions that raise 2 stats 5 and drop one 5 for 10 to 12 plat. I noticed
    the regen potion will cost about 50pp to make. Don't think too many people will give me
    75pp for 1 regen. Seems that alchemy could use a little revamping.]</i> </font></p>

    <small><small>Gordon made another post in response to the Shrink item issue on the
    official forums today. Here's the scoop: </small></small></font><ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana"><small><small>Clarity is a defining spell for the Enchanter class.
      A clarity item was rejected because it would devaluate the Enchanter class. Than the item
      is supposed to shrink everywhere (dungeons and outdoor zones) making it better than the
      Shaman spell. Now there are 2 possibilities, its either an item that's been dropped or
      quested. Or its a potion that shaman can make with alchemy. In the last case how can a
      shaman get a spell in potion form that's more powerful than the original spell ???</small></small>
      </font></p>
      <p><i><b><font face="Verdana"><small><small>One of the reasons that the Shrink spell is
      dungeon only is that we wanted it to be a utility spell, not a &quot;look at me, I'm a
      miniature troll&quot; spell. By limiting it to dungeon only, we at least have it someplace
      where there is a context for it.</small></small> </font></p>
      <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The new shrink item will be a potion that is created
      through alchemy. Since only shamans can do alchemy, there's no worry about taking
      something away from them. We went ahead and decided to make the potion &quot;shrink
      everywhere&quot;, since its cost will dissuade people from using it as a &quot;show
      off&quot; spell. </font></small></small></p>
