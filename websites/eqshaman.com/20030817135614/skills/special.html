<h4>What is Specialization?</h4>
<p>
Specialization is the means by which a caster increases their mana efficiency in a given area of magic. Shamans gain the ability to specialize at level 30, along with the rest of the wisdom casters (intelligence casters can specialize at level 20). There is a seperate specialize skill for each of the 5 fields of magic. While you can train in all of them, only one can exceed a skill of 50. Whichever skill exceeds 50 first will become your specialization, eventaully maxing at 200. If you accidently choose the wrong specialty, you can start over by completing a <a href="specializequest.html">quest</a> in the Temple of Solusek Ro.
<p>
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p>
Whenever you cast a spell, there is a chance that the specialization bonus will kick in. The higher your specialization skill in the respective field of magic the higher the chance of the bonus kicking in. The bonus will do two things:
<p>
<li>Reduce the mana cost of the spell.<br>
<li>Reduce the chance of fizzling.
<p>
Specialization does NOT increase your chance of recovering after interruption. This is based purely on Channeling. Specialization does NOT make your spells cast faster. This is a fixed amount.
<p>
<h4>How do I specialize?</h4>
<p>
You will have to train a point in each specialization skill to learn the basics before the skill will go up on its own. When you do this, the skill will automatically rise to 25. To get up your specialization skill, all you have to do is cast spells of that respective field of magic. Remember, you have to get your skill over 50 to lock it in as your specialization. What some shaman do is just learn the basics of whichever you want to specialize in and then go out and hunt as normal. You do not have to worry about the other skills going up because you have not learned the basics in them. Then, after you have gotten over 50 with your chosen skill, you can come back to your trainer and learn the basics in all the other specialization skills.
<p>
<h4>What should I specialize in?</h4>
<p>
Shamans have two real choices for specializatoin: Alteration and Conjuration. Conjuration would be useful to the solo shaman, the one who uses a ton of damage over time spells. Alteration is used for all shaman buffs (except for AC/resists), heals, slows, and debuffs. In other words, the vast majority of the spells you use as a shaman, period. Alteration is what the majority of shamans pick as their specialization, but conjuration is still worth considering if you solo a ton.
