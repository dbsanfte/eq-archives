<table><tr><td width=90%>To solo the Great Saprophyte you will need to be about level 45. If you are under 45, some help is recommended. His spawn time is from 2 hours and 45 minutes to 3 hours. Keep in mind that he does not drop Remove Curse every time and you may have to kill him multiple times before you actually acquire the spell.
<p>
To get to the Great Saprophyte, enter the Echo Caverns from the secret entrance in the Shadow Haven (check out <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadowhavenmap.html">this</a> map from EQ Atlas). Once inside, go forward and take a left. When you reach the wall, follow the passage right and head straight. You will come to a gate. Pass through it and take your next right. Go forward and take a left. You will enter some water. Take your next right. You will enter a cavern filled with boglings. You have reached your destination -  get out a pet and buff up. Check out this <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/echocavernsmap.html">map</a> of Echo Caverns from EQ Atlas. The Great Saprophyte is #5.
<p>
The boglings here range from level 22-35. Clear your way in. Once around the corner, you will see him (if he is up) - he is a giant mushroom. Fortunately, he is permanently rooted in place. Carefully pull all the boglings out of the room and elimate them without getting the Great Saprophyte's attention. They can be single pulled, so you should not have any troubles.
<p>
The Great Saprophyte is level 35, but is very strong for his level. He may be stuck in one spot, but he can summon you if damaged (which means you can't just nuke from afar). During the fight he will cast a knockback and a 300 damage poison nuke. Once he is slowed it should not be a problem keeping your pet up.
<p>
You have slain The Great Saprophyte!<br>
Your faction standing with Cult of the Great Saprophyte got worse.<br>
You gain experience!
