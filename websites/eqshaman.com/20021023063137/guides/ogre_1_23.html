    <br>
    <small>Introduction</b><br>
    An Ogre Shaman is, hands down, one of the best classes available. You will have the
    greatest strength and stamina of any race, and you will be able to cast extremely powerful
    spells including heals. Although any experience in EQ is much enhanced by grouping, these
    features will allow you to survive much longer soloing that any of the weaker races. As
    you progress in levels you will become much sought after by groups for your Spirit of Wolf
    spell (SOW - allows individuals to &quot;pull&quot; or flee much faster), for your heals,
    and for your considerable fighting/tanking ability. Granted, you will never be able to
    tank as well as a warrior, or heal as well as a cleric, but your mixture of powerful
    strengths makes an Ogre Shaman a best friend to many.</small></font><p><small><font
    color="#000000" face="Verdana">Another wonderful aspect about being an Ogre is that most
    Ogres are good role-players. I believe that this is because it's rather fun to talk like
    an Ogre. &quot;Me bash gud.&quot; &quot;You puny.&quot; &quot;Hmmm, lizzie is gud to
    eat.&quot; Etc. In addition, there are not many Ogres presently in existence, which makes
    Ogre territory less occupied and easier to find kills and good loot. It's also enjoyable
    to be the most massive PC in existence. You will inspire awe in others at your sheer size
    (not to mention the role-playing aspects of running away from a Gnome, like an elephant
    would run from a mouse).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Disadvantages of being an Ogre include 1)
    being hated by most races and 2) being huge. Travel to other areas is much more dangerous
    because you are KOS (Killed on Sight) by most races except the Dark Elves and Trolls.
    Having such a large body can also be a disadvantage in that in certain dungeons
    (especially Upper Guk) with narrow hallways, it can be hard to maneuver or get through if
    anyone is in your way. The size issue can be a huge bother - aka you can't even fit behind
    the throne in Crushbone. However, both of these drawbacks are tolerable and there are ways
    to work around them. For example, 1) you could kill what you need to, to improve faction
    if you really want to be in a particular region and 2) you can stay in dungeons that tend
    to be more open (Crushbone and Unrest have been good).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>The Creation</b><br>
    One of the first questions is where to put your 30 additional attribute points. I have
    often heard a rumor that attribute points are less valuable when over 100 - I have not
    found this to be the case. I tested out a variety of classes and races looking at HP and
    Stamina as a benchmark, and have found that class has more effect on eventual HP than does
    Stamina. </font></small></p>

        <td vAlign="bottom"><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">As you can see, the
        additional HP from adding 25 to stamina is the same for a Dark Elf Enchanter, as it is for
        an Ogre Shaman (aka whether you're above 100 or below it, the additional HP/lvl is not
        huge). The additional HP will eventually make a difference, which can be seen by
        multiplying the level 1 HP by 10 or 20. </font></small><p><small><font color="#FFFFFF"
        face="Verdana">The Ogre Shaman does not compete with an Ogre Warrior for sheer tank
        ability, but will definitely hold up under fire better than any other full casting magic
        user (of course, keep in mind that a Shaman can bind him/herself wherever they desire,
        where a Warrior can only be bound in certain spots by someone else). Ogres start out with
        very good Strength and Stamina, and most other things are average, except Charisma, which
        is very poor. </font></small></td>

    </table>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">The decision of where to place your
    additional attributes will probably not have a large effect until you reach higher levels,
    so it is important to decide what kind of character you will want. If you think you would
    be content to stand back and cast spells - put a majority into Wisdom. If you are more
    interested in getting dirty and occasionally tanking - put a little more emphasis on
    Stamina. Strength is another good area to place some additional points - as this directly
    correlates to how much you can carry with you (something that does become very important
    when you're in enemy territory). I would not consider putting any points towards Charisma
    because you will never be getting great prices from NPCs as an Ogre, and secondly, because
    most of your selling will be done with other PCs who couldn't care less about your
    Charisma. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Weapon choice is somewhat clearer. You can
    use 1H blunt and a shield, or 2H blunt. Most shaman prefer 2H blunt because it does
    considerably more damage, and the loss of a shield does not make much of a difference in
    how often you are hit (a good offense is &#133;). Use your 1H blunt club that you get at
    the start, until you can get your hands on a decent 2H blunt, then switch. Obtain a magic
    2H blunt (aka a Glowing Wooden Crook, etc) if you can, because then you will be able to
    hit any magic undead you run into (shouldn't come to these monsters until your teen
    levels).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>The Formative Years (Rank I - Levels
    1-4)</b><br>
    During these tender years of Rank I, I would suggest not wandering too far from Oggok. As
    you exit Oggok, if you follow the path and turn left at the 2 forks, you will come to an
    innkeeper. Adventuring behind her is a very good place to start. First rule of thumb -
    ALWAYS /con what you are about to attack. Green, blue and white (if you're feeling brave)
    are your best bets, where yellows and reds will likely end up in a corpse recovery trip.
    Second rule of thumb - Always keep a reference point so that you know where you are. Pick
    unusual landmarks and focus on recognizing them, so that when you do die (and you will
    die) you know where your corpse is. Third rule of thumb - Get accustomed to picking off
    wandering critters with spells - using Burst of Flame to bring them to you instead of
    chasing them down is a valuable, timesaving skill, plus it helps keep your bearings.
    Grouping is usually not recommended at Rank 1-4, but can always be fun for periods.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>The Troublesome 2's (Rank II - Levels
    5-8)</b><br>
    I say that these years are troublesome because by these levels you have gained substantial
    power, but still have to show restraint as to where you wander. After level 4, when you
    die you will lose experience, so restraint can be very helpful in the long run. From
    levels 5-8 I would suggest hitting the lesser lizzie camps - there are three of them which
    you will find if you wander behind the inn. One of the nicest things about these levels is
    that grouping becomes more helpful. When you are hitting the lesser lizzie camps and
    suddenly a couple Lizardman Mystics respawn and blind you; it will be helpful to have a
    friend close by. During this period you should also start working on getting better armor
    and weapons - admittedly a life long struggle.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>Introduction of Spirit of Wolf (Rank III
    - Levels 9-13)</b><br>
    Level 9 brings one of the greatest boons to Shamen - Spirit of Wolf (SOW). You will become
    a very valuable member of any team, simply for this reason, not to mention the rest of
    your skills. This spell is incalculably helpful in that it allows you to run much faster
    than normally. It allows you to travel faster though difficult zones, and it allows you to
    flee from a fight that has turned out to be much harder that you initially though. At
    level 9, armed with SOW, the brave can consider wandering over to the stronger lizzie
    camps with friends or the smaller temples outside Cazic Thule. It is here that you can
    receive incredible payoffs from the lizards, but the region is typically busy for this
    reason. You should attempt to replace whatever armor you have with the stronger banded
    armor - which can be purchased from other PCs.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>The World is your Oyster (Rank IV -
    Levels 14-18)</b><br>
    By level 14 you should now have a good idea of what to expect from the temples, and are
    starting to find it easy, being less wary of lizzie trains. The greatest blessing of level
    14 is Bind Affinity. Bind allows you to set your gate (or death) point. One word on
    obtaining this spell - it presently is not available in either Oggok or Grobb, so you have
    to get it in Neriak, or pay someone to buy it for you. One of the major advantages of
    being able to cast the spell (as opposed to having someone else cast it on you) is that
    you can bind yourself anywhere. Common sense become very handy in deciding where you
    should bind yourself&#133; needless to say staying close to zones and choosing safe
    locations is very wise. With this ability, exploring the world becomes much safer. You can
    travel anywhere and bind yourself near the zone, knowing that if you die you will not have
    to walk back all the way from Feerrott. Because of your newly found freedom, you can
    wander the lands, amazing people who have never seen an Ogre before. Take caution however,
    because most lands will be very dangerous to you, not because of the monsters that may lay
    ahead, but because of the foul guards that may inhabit the region. Any regions that have a
    city in or adjacent to them (besides Feerrott and Innothule Swamp) will have wandering
    guards of very high levels (higher 30's) who will likely kill you on sight (KOS).</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">A little dying trick - If you die and your
    corpse happens to be in a relatively dangerous area, there is an easy way to get it out of
    harms way. 1) Make a social button (by R clicking it) into a corpse retrieval button -
    /Corpse. 2) Pay someone for an invis (Enchanters have the strongest invis) while standing
    as near as SAFELY possible to where you died. 3) Quickly run close to your corpse, and
    start hitting the Corpse button as you walk away from the dangerous region. Voila - your
    corpse is now somewhere where you can loot it with peace of mind! Now I would say that
    this is something you should only do if it is very necessary. For example, if you corpse
    happened to be right in front of the Felwithe guards.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><b>A New Role (Rank V - Level 19-23)</b><br>
    At Rank V, you finally get a strong healing spell and you will find that your role in
    groups tends to shift to a healer more often. It is nice to have the option of standing
    back and healing Warriors or other Tanks, or choosing to get into the fray. At level 20,
    you can have a last name and will have more than enough experience as to what you want to
    do, so I will no longer presume to advise you. ;)</font></small></p>
