      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>The Test of 
      Patience<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2><BR>Head to Erud's 
      Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island.<BR>Approx. loc 
      -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 
      hours.<BR><BR><STRONG>Preparation:<BR></STRONG>Bind on the Island or 
      Qeynos<BR>Have SoW, Levitation and Enduring Breath up and running.<BR>Have 
      your pet spell ready to cast.<BR>Have gate or evac, if wizard/druid in 
      group, ready to cast.<BR><BR><STRONG>Minimum Levels Required (more is 
      better):<BR></STRONG>Solo: 49+ Shaman &amp; pet (or even lower using 
      Inviso to Animals)<BR>Duo: Two 44+ Shamans &amp; pets<BR>Group: Well 
      balanced high 30's or better.<BR><BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail 
      Ooglyn'<BR><BR></STRONG>Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been 
      waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need<BR>da test. So's I gib 
      you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so 
      long<BR>dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while 
      me look for test. Oh, hey,<BR>shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, 
      please, heheh.<BR><BR><STRONG>Give her the gem.</STRONG><BR><BR>Ooglyn 
      says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you 
      missed it. The<BR>sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I 
      like you so I take you there. We goin for a<BR>swim, shaman!<BR>Your 
      faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>You gain party 
      experience!!<BR><BR>Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<BR>Ooglyn feels much 
      faster.<BR>Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<BR>Ooglyn is surrounded by a 
      brief lupine aura.<BR>Ooglyn begins to cast a spell.<BR>Ooglyn's body 
      pulses with energy.<BR><BR>After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she 
      starts to run away. Follow her until she<BR>disappears into the water. 
      Then run out over the water (make sure you have<BR>levitation and some 
      sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, +4200.<BR>Dive 
      down about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet spells. Then proceed 
      to<BR>the bottom of the ocean and wait patiently as this test 
      suggests.<BR>Ooglyn may be waiting there for you there or she may not. If 
      she's not there, no<BR>worries. It won't effect the quest.<BR>&nbsp; 
      <BR>Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah 
      will eventually<BR>spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive "a broken 
      arrow" from Abe, and a<BR>"gem" from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the 
      conversations with Abe and the<BR>Greater Spirit are presented here. 
      Conversations with the others is merely "fluff".<BR>Did I mention 
      patience?<BR>Invisibility to Animals: Several have reported that using 
      Invisibility to Animals<BR>while waiting will keep the sharks from 
      attacking you.<BR><BR>NOTE: You will also have to fend off the regular 
      Sharks and the much tougher<BR>Killer Sharks that roam the area while you 
      wait UNLESS you keep Invisibility to<BR>Animals up constantly.<BR><BR>TIP: 
      Despite what ANY of the spirits or Ooglyn say to you, DO NOT leave 
      this<BR>location. They are only trying to trick you. Remember, this is 
      about Patience.<BR>Now then, once you are at the bottom of the ocean at 
      neg 1600 pos 4200 . . .<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail Abe the 
      Abandoned'<BR></STRONG><BR>Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward 
      you but his eyes never come into focus. You can't<BR>tell if he's looking 
      at you, behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then ,suddenly, he 
      shouts at<BR>the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM 
      [ABE]!'<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Who are you abe?'<BR></STRONG><BR>Abe the 
      Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know 
      where to look and<BR>you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if 
      you can't get your eyes right to see what you're<BR>looking for. I'd lend 
      you mine but I don't wear the same size.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What 
      eyes?'<BR></STRONG><BR>Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the 
      mud with his finger although it doesn't seem to<BR>make any sense at all. 
      He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? 
      The<BR>curtains fell and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that 
      we thought we knew. The dream of<BR>the [Combine] fulfilled when we 
      finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And now<BR>we are 
      abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'<BR><BR>You 
      say, <STRONG>'What is the combine?'<BR></STRONG><BR>Abe the Abandoned 
      shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think 
      so,<BR>wouldn't you? But I guess not'<BR>After a few minutes, Abe will 
      speak again. Be patient! :)<BR>Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time 
      will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our<BR>friends again. But 
      the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear 
      our<BR>obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it 
      to when it is time.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Yes i will give them the 
      arrow'<BR></STRONG><BR>Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his 
      shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without<BR>a word.<BR>A few minutes 
      later . . .<BR>Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found 
      it! I know the answer! Come with me<BR>and I will tell you. Eyes are 
      everywhere and this knowledeg is not for everyone. Finally my 
      centuries<BR>of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me Shaman!<BR><BR>Stay 
      glued to that spot. <STRONG>DO NOT follow him</STRONG><BR><BR>After or 
      before Abe spawns, a greater spirit also spawns . . .<BR>a greater spirit 
      begins to cast a spell.<BR>a greater spirit's body pulses with 
      energy.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail a greater spirit'<BR></STRONG><BR>a 
      greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know 
      what to expect. We<BR>are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be 
      patient and quiet else we may miss what<BR>could be harmful. Can you sit 
      still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your 
      eyes<BR>with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? 
      Timing is everything, and without<BR>patience you cannot be sensitive to 
      timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe you<BR>are ready 
      to walk the [next path].<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What is the next 
      path?'</STRONG><BR><BR>a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. 
      But before we can allow you to act in our name,<BR>we must know that when 
      you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask 
      that<BR>you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains 
      and search out one of us. He is<BR>a wanderer, and it is his nature to 
      drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to 
      ensure<BR>understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He 
      will not be easy to find, though, and<BR>you must remember what you have 
      learned down here to succeed in finding him. When you do, give<BR>him this 
      gem and follow his instructions.<BR><BR>You will receive a "small 
      gem"</FONT></P>
