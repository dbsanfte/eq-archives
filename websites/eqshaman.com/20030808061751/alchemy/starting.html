        Started in Alchemy
        <blockquote>
            <p align="left">So you wanna make potions for fun and
            profit? Well, maybe just for fun anyway. Here's the
            step by step way to get your new shaman skill
            started.</p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size=-1>The Initial Step:</p>
            <p align="left">Alchemy is a Shaman-only skill which
            Shamans of level 25 or higher can learn, gaining the
            unique ability to make potions. Unfortunately, unless
            you like throwing away money, the skill cap on
            alchemy is so low at level 25 that you'll likely fail
            on most attempts to make potions and lose your
            platinum very fast. </p>
            <p align="left">What is the skill cap on Alchemy? Put
            simply . . .</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p align="left"><em>(Your character level minus
                24) times 5</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left">Hence, at level 25, the maximum skill
            in alchemy you can achieve is 5 or [(25-24)*5] . . .,
            at level 26 the maximum skill is 10 or [(26-24)*5] .
            . ., and so on.</p>
            <p align="left">Since most of the Lesser Stat potions
            don't become trivial until 18 to 22 alchemy skill,
            here is our recommendation:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p align="left"><em>&quot;Get your shaman to
                level 29 before attempting to train in Alchemy
                and be sure you've saved or accumulated 21 guild
                practice points when you hit level 29.&quot;</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left">The trainer at your shaman guild in
            Halas, Grobb, Ogguk or Cabilis will allow you to put
            21 initial practice points into alchemy skill, but no
            more. Further increases in skill must be obtained
            &quot;in the field&quot;, which means to get further
            skill increases above 21 you will need to attempt to
            make potions at a slightly higher skill than you
            currently possess. </p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size=-1>A Word about Wisdom vs
            Intelligence:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p align="left"><em>From the Ruins of Kunark
                Players Guide:</em></p>
                <p><font face=verdana size=-1><strong>Intelligence:</strong><font
                size="2"><strong> </strong>Affects how
                fast you learn many skills. For a Necromancer,
                Wizard, Magician, Enchanter, Shadow Knight or
                Bard, it also affects maximum mana at each level.</p>
                <p><font face=verdana size=-1><strong>Wisdom:</strong><font
                size="2"><strong> </strong>Affects <u>how

                Paladin, Cleric, Shaman or Druid, it also affects
                maximum mana at each level.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Despite what these definitions indicate, there are
            currently two schools of thought regarding skill
            increases. Much of this is due to conflicting reports
            from player guides, posts on message boards, news
            excerpts for Abashi (Gordon) and/or the general rumor
            mill:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>First School of Thought:</strong>
                Intelligence makes skills go up faster, Wisdom
                helps success rates in making a product.</p>
                <p><strong>Second School of Thought:</strong>
                Whichever attribute is higher is the determining
                factor in both skill increases and success rates.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There seems to be some recent posts from Brad
            &quot;Aradune&quot; McQuaid, indicating the Second
            School of Thought is the correct one:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>Quote from Brad McQuaid:</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font face=verdana size=-1><em><strong>&quot;WIS:</strong></em><em>
                affects the amount of mana the priest classes
                have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you
                can learn many skills </em><em><u>if your wisdom
                is higher than INT</u></em><em>. </em></p>
                <p><em>- Brad&quot;</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And another post that further supports the Second
            School of Thought:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>Quote from Yakatizma, Verant employee on
                EQ Boards:</em></p>
                <p><em>Without revealing the details of the
                equations the relationship is as follows.<br>
                The higher of either Int. or Wis. effects both
                the chances of success and the rate at which
                skill points are gained. The forthcoming various
                stat bonuses for various skills, such as the
                strength bonus for blacksmithing will provide a
                success bonus that will stack with the Int/Wis
                bonus.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Neither of these quotes contradict the first
            description under Wisdom above indicating that it
            affects &quot;<em><u>how fast you learn specific
            skills</u></em>&quot;. Therefore, inasmuch as Shamans
            have inherently higher Wisdom in the first place, we
            recommend:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>&quot;Get your Wisdom as high as you
                possibly can before attempting Alchemy skill
                increases or potion making&quot;</em></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p align="left">Inasmuch as the skill cap for a level
            29 character is 25 alchemy skill, you may want to
            stop attempting to increase your alchemy skill once
            you reach alchemy skill 22 (waiting until your shaman
            hits character level 30 before attempting the
            &quot;trivial at 27&quot; potions on the <a
            href="trivial.html">Trivial Chart</a>), or you may
            wish to attempt to reach your skill cap of 25. The
            choice is yours to make.</p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size=-1>Optional &quot;Blood
            of Wolf&quot; Method:</p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size="-1">It has been suggested
            by some shamans that making only the Blood of Wolf
            potions from skill 21 through 37 (trivial level for
            Blood of Wolf) would provide the young shaman with a
            more viable product for sale to the public, thereby
            decreasing their learning costs as they can recoup
            their platinum. This is a valid method and you may
            want to choose this method of increasing your alchemy
            skill. What generally happens when using this method
            is your inventory becomes overloaded with BoW
            potions, forcing the shaman to sell quickly to clear
            up enough space to continue making more potions and
            gain more skill increases. Naturally, this tends to
            deflate the price charged for BoW in zones with the
            herb vendors for BoW. I've often seen shamans selling
            BoW in Firiona Vie for 8 platinum per potion which,
            when you consider failure rates, is very close to
            actual cost of making the BoW potions. It's all about
            supply and demand. BoW is in high demand which tends
            to push the price up, but by overloading supply in
            the BoW &quot;herb vendor&quot; zones, the price is
            pushed down, at least in those zones. Either method
            of increasing skill is valid, but as much as I hate
            to see one of our best potions get undersold, I too
            would recommend the Blood of Wolf method to increase
            skill from 21 to 37 to save the shaman some money in
            the learning process. Naturally, if you're the only
            shaman in the zone selling BoW at that time, you can
            still charge a fair market rate for the potions and
            will likely recover a greater amount of platinum for
            furthering your skill, although it might take a
            little longer to sell out your inventory. </p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size=-1>Also, you can discuss
            pricing with another shaman if they are also in zone
            selling BoW. This is commonly known as &quot;Price
            Fixing&quot;, which is illegal on the Earthen Plane,
            but then again, there is no Federal Trade Commission
            in Norrath to prevent us from doing such. </p>
            <p align="left"><font face=verdana size=-1>Underselling any
            potion only hurts all shamans in the long run. If all
            shamans stuck to a <a href="thumbprice.html"><font
