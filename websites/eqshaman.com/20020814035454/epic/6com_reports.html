      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp; <BR><STRONG>The City of Mist 
      Reports<BR></STRONG><BR>You must now acquire the following six reports 
      from the City of Mist. Five of the<BR>six messages drop from skeletons, 
      golems and goos at the zone, but the Student's<BR>Log is only found on a 
      Spectral Courier.<BR><BR>Personal Diary Page, identifies as "Report 
      Information 1 of 6" in Lizardman. It reads:<BR>I heard last night that 
      there was some kind of commontion at the castle. Guards were<BR>shouting, 
      spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was 
      an<BR>assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the 
      command of a dragon,<BR>some even say there was some divine intervention. 
      I have no idea why any god would<BR>strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is 
      a paragon fro the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope<BR>whatever it was sticks 
      to attacking the castle and not my shop though.<BR><BR>Crier's Scroll, 
      identifies as "Report Information 2 of 6" in lizardman. It reads:<BR>Hear 
      of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High 
      Priest<BR>into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held 
      in honor of the event<BR>and the High Scale will be present to judge 
      various contests of skill in arms. Booths will<BR>be set up selling 
      various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all.<BR><BR>Merchant's 
      Letter, identifies as "Report Information 3 of 6" in lizardman. It 
      reads:<BR>The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. 
      I won't need such a large<BR>order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian 
      made it known to me that they would not need<BR>as many new robes this 
      coming season as "none were quite ready to don them." My<BR>colleagues 
      have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these 
      days. It<BR>seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. 
      However I'm sure we'll find<BR>new customers soon and our orders will be 
      back to normal shortly.<BR><BR>Written Annoucement, identifies as "Report 
      Information 4 of 6". It reads:<BR>Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret 
      that we inform you of our Queen Neh`Ashiir's<BR>disappearance. Our best 
      scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her<BR>trail. 
      The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture 
      into the<BR>Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All 
      interested parties should report<BR>to the royal Quartermaster's office. 
      Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom<BR>guide 
      us.<BR><BR>Priest's Diary Page, identifies as "Report Information 5 of 6" 
      in lizardman. It reads:<BR>Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his 
      "wisdom" has cut our church's donation yet<BR>again. He claims it is to 
      bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wipe out during<BR>the 
      Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more 
      that I<BR>ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the 
      city's smiths can craft. This<BR>along with the recent replacement of our 
      Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz <BR>leads me to suspect our 
      King is planning on all but destroying our church entirely. I<BR>don't 
      understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him 
      mad.<BR><BR>Student's Log, identifies as "Report Information 6 of 6" in 
      Lizardman. It reads:<BR>Missed mass again today. This is the third time 
      this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice<BR>however as I was able to attend 
      the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the<BR>clergy will 
      change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend 
      regulary.<BR>Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it 
      appears mass may be<BR>discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I 
      could attend many more classes as well as<BR>spend more time rubbing 
      elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to 
      miss<BR>tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is 
      taking members again.<BR><BR><STRONG>After placing the 6 report pages in 
      the Booklet, hit combine and return the<BR>combined Booklet to the 
      Sentinel Spirit at loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle.<BR></STRONG><BR>You 
      say, <STRONG>'Hail Spirit Sentinel'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 
      'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right 
      direction.<BR>Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of 
      the first queen may have caused<BR>Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From 
      there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the 
      city's<BR>eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. 
      Perhaps bringing this knowledge to<BR>the King's now cursed form will lift 
      the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk,<BR>was a 
      bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. 
      Take what you find to<BR>my brother here In the jungle beneath the murky 
      waters of a pond.<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got 
      better<BR>You gain experience! </FONT></P>
