There are several methods to begin the quest, including:
<p>
<li>Kill Capt Surestout in the Ocean of Tears at location +800, -5400.<br>
<li>Kill Blinde the Cutpurse in the Rathe Mountains (on cyclops hill).<br>
<li>Kill Peg Leg in the Butcherblock Mountains at location +260, +1650.<br>
<li>Kill the Iksar Outcast/Manslayer in the Field of Bones (in the marauder cave.)
<p>
While the information here is gleened from Capt Surestout, any of the above will yield the same information and the "tiny gem" needed to continue in the quest.
<p>
After killing Surestout (he's level 20), "a lesser spirit" will spawn where he's killed.
<p>
Capt Surestout died.<BR>
Your faction standing with Pirates of Gunthak got worse.<BR>
Your faction standing with Firiona Vie got better.<BR>
Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak.. They will avenge me.. Unngh!!<BR>
a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, a lesser spirit'</b>
<p>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman?'<br>
<p>
You say, <b>'Yes'</b>
<p>
a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way?'
<p>
You say, <b>'He threatened my life'</b>
<p>
a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman.'
<p>
You say, <b>'Who are you?'</b>
<p>
a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman?'
<p>
You say, <b>'I wish to know more'</b>
<p>
a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.'
