    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">My Theory of Mortifer Syythrak&#146;s Spawn </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana"><br>
    As quick note I have been in the Rathe Mountains for over two months now studying this. I
    have read every single post that I could find. I think this will be a guarantee to my
    Shaman Brothers out there that this information will force the spawn of Mortifer. Just
    like other known camp spots of Named MOB&#146;s where you have to keep clearing spawn till
    the spawn Tables provide the random Named one included in the spawn cycle. </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">I have been successful at killing Mortifer right at
    the Exact Spot he spawns twice in a week&#146;s period. My first kill produced the Monk
    only vest and left me not very sure I had the key to his spawn. I the second time I killed
    him I got what I had set out for, the Staff. </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">Location: Rathe Mountains Skell Tower Area<br>
    1) I first noticed that there are two types of Lizard faction, Lizard Man, and Allize
    Taeew<br>
    2) Mortiy&#146;s faction is Allize Taeew </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The main premise to applying my theory revolves
    around Faction as the key to his spawn location.<br>
    Randomly in this area lizards spawn with Tae faction and Lizard Man faction<br>
    There is a very large spawn table involved here.<br>
    Lizards, Orcs, Obs. Drakes, Large Skells, Small Skells, Possibly Bears, </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">So the fun begins. I started killing all random
    spawn in the area with the exception of the two Haunt spawn spots, and the two other camps
    (Orc, Lizard). The spawn table I mentioned above has to be killed off. Random lizards will
    have the Taeew faction. It is my opinion that full spawn table has to be killed off to get
    the Mortifer randomly included in one of the spawn tables. As a side note to what I have
    noticed is that one Lizardman Scout spawns at the end of the valley near towards Feerott.
    IM not sure if this signifies the beginning or the end of the spawn table but I think it
    is significant. Also the spawn will come to a crawl unless you kill Balsaks as you go.
    This seems to keep room open for more randoms to spawn. </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">My first night I tried this on my own for 5 or 6
    hours when Mortifer spawned right at the red spot I have on the map. Following weekend I
    invested 12 to 16 hours killing the spawn tables. Again right at the red spot on the map
    he spawned. </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The map I have included shows some general spawn
    locations in yellow. Red is the spot twice I actually saw him spawn. The blue spot is
    roughly where the Liz Scout spawns and he travels up the valley to the hill. The big green
    spot is the small hill that exists. Around the hill on it, and through out the valley
    random spawn occurs. </font></small></small></p>
    <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">I am hoping this to be the one of my most
    significant contributions to our community. I was determined to figure this because it
    seems so unfair that we do not have some really significant weapons available that other
    classes do. </font></small></small></p>
