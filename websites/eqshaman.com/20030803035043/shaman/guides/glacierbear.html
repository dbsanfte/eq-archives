    Bear hunting guide<br>
    <small>by </font>Zaske</small></font></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">So you want to get the Glacier Bear eh young Shaman? </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Come sit by the fire, and let old Zaske tell you how. I too
    was once frustrated with the thought of never getting the prized Totemic Helm. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">I've now bagged that bear four times, and can live
    comfortably on my profits. Here is my hunting tips: </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Here is a map of the bears cave, deep within Everfrost:</small><br>

    <p><small><font face="Verdana">To find the cave, follow the river that traverses Everfrost
    to the north. Coming from Halas, and staying along the north side of Everfrost, you'll
    come accrossed the north tower, and some old ruins. Just behind the north tower, you'll
    find a hole in the ice. Once you enter the water, just swim north and you'll find the cave
    enterance underwater. If you're swimming skill is above 95, you'll be able to swim to the
    cave without worrying drowning or using magic. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">The bear is around lvl 30, and tough. I never bagged him
    solo without my trusty Wolf by my side, so be careful. He is 100% resistant to cold based
    magic, so do not waste your mana on such magic. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Now you know I don't like to meander here and there waiting
    for the damned thing, so instead of growing old waiting fer the damned thing to come out
    of hibernation, I enlisted a little &quot;friend&quot;, if you know what I mean. I picked
    a Ranger friend, knowing that their tracking skills would be helpful, and I had some
    friends quickly level her up to her fourth or fifth season. I figured her tracking skill
    would be good enough at that point to track just about all of that cave area. I also
    picked a Wood Elf Ranger, since they can root around and forage food and water, enough to
    keep them alive in a cave anyways. With the help of some friends, my ranger friend was
    able to make it safely into the cave, and camp. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">And that is my secret. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">What? You do not think that is such a great tip? Let me
    explain...my &quot;friend&quot; just sits in the cave, and every day, before I go out
    adventuring, my friend checks for the bear. But more importantly, every night when I go to
    sleep, my friend check for the bear again. All four times I've gotten the bear has been
    either late at night, or early in the morning. Two of my kills came when I started to wake
    up 15 minutes before my usual wake time, and just quickly have my friend check for the
    bear. I'm usually quite a ways off. Thank the spirits for my speed buffs, as you can
    imagine I have a long run, and the whole time I run, I pray to the spirits that no one
    will check the cave. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Other things I have noticed. When the bear appears he walks
    counter clockwise following the red circle on the map. He does not go into any alcoves,
    exceptin for the area with the undead house (I know this, as I have killed him there
    once). The Undead that spawns in his place, are the only wandering things you'll find in
    the cave. They walk much like the bear, but take a shorter path, marked in blue on my map.
    I've also heard rumors of those that say two bears can spawn at the same time, but I have
    never seen this myself. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">I also marked on the map, a place all should avoid. It's
    marked &quot;instant death&quot; as that's what will happen if you venture there. Sulon
    McMoor, a foul tempered Magi resides there. You best not cross his path. Stay away from
    him and you'll be safe in the caves, as they are mostly deserted. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">So there is my secret, get yourself a young ranger ally,
    and hunt late into the night, and early in the morning, when most are asleep, and you too
    will get yourself a Totemic Helm in no time. I'd guess it'll take you about 2 weeks to get
    yourself a helm you ya do as I say. And the best part is, you'll be spending only a few
    minutes a day extra, as opposed to hours and hours of sitting and waiting. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">One lucky morning you'll check for the bear, see him, your
    heart will stop, and you'll be running and praying like I say. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Good luck young shaman, may the power of the Tribunal lead
    you to greatness...and a Totemic Helm</font></small></p>
