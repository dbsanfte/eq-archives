<font color="orange"><h2>Part 6 - The City of Mist Reports</h2></font>
<p><br><p>

<table width=90%><tr><td>

You must now acquire the following six reports from the City of Mist. Five of the six messages drop from skeletons, golems, and goos at the zone in, but the Student's Log is only found on a Spectral Courier (level 34). The Courier is a rare spawn in the western half of the stables. Check out this <a href="http://eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html">map</a> from EQ Atlas. The courier spawn is #6. It's best to just clear the stables over and over again until you get all the pages.

<p>
<i>I heard last night that there was some kind of commontion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon for the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though.</i>
<p>
2) Crier's Scroll, identifies as "Report Information 2 of 6" in Lizardman.
<p>
<i>Hear of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all.</i>
<p>
3) Merchant's Letter, identifies as "Report Information 3 of 6" in Lizardman.
<p>
<i>The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly.</i>
<p>
4) Written Annoucement, identifies as "Report Information 4 of 6" in Lizardmen
<p>
<i>Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us.</i>
<p>
5) Priest's Diary Page, identifies as "Report Information 5 of 6" in Lizardman.
<p>
<i>Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his "wisdom" has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wipe out during the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me to suspect our 
King is planning on all but destroying our church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.</i>
<p>
6) Student's Log, identifies as "Report Information 6 of 6" in Lizardman.
<p>
<i>Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing 
elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again.</i>

Combine the 6 pages in the booklet and return the finished product back to the Sentinel Spirit (location +1250, +300).

Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From 
there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle beneath the murky waters of a pond.<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
