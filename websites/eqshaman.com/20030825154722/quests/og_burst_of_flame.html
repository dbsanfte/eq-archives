        The Oggok Burst of Flame spell quest is
        obtained from Zulort in the
      
      
        Shaman Guild area.&nbsp; The items
        required are four (4) froglok tadpole
      
      
        fleshes.&nbsp; If you give Zulort the four
        froglok tadpole fleshes he will
      
      
        give you the Burst of Flame spell and some
        faction.&nbsp; Be careful to give
      
      
        the 4 fleshes to Zulort in this way:&nbsp;
        take one of the fleshes and give
      
      
        it to Zulort.&nbsp; A window with four
        slots will come up showing the one
      
      
        froglok flesh you gave to Zulort.&nbsp;
        One at a time, place the other 3
      
      
        froglok fleshes into the slots, one flesh
        per slot.&nbsp; When you have done
      
      
        this all four slots should have one flesh
        only.&nbsp; Click on Done or Give
      
      
        (whatever the button says).&nbsp; BAM!!
        You've got the spell and some
      
      
        faction.&nbsp; I have done this quest
        about 4 times and I always get the same
      
      
        spell, so don't waste your time trying to
        get something other than the
      
      
        Burst of Flame spell.<br>
