    <br>
    <strong>Dodge - </strong>Level 15 - helps you avoid what would have been a sucessful hit</small><strong><br>
    <br>
    <small>Fishing</strong> - Seems silly at first but I have found it a great way to get
    scales for the spell enduring breath, fish for food <small>(I know we can summon food)</small>
    , and some cheap free items like daggers, sandals, and other misc things.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Beg</strong> - You run the risk of NPCs aggroing on you if you beg to them too
    much. I have heard you can increase it safely by begging to a pet during downtime. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bind wound</strong> - <font color="#808000">Skill capacity: (lvl x 5) + 5</font></small><br>
    <small>Some people swear by it but I dont think they were shamans. I haven't found much
    use for it. </small></font>

      <font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you get</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">the
      skill up to a respectable level, you can heal 30+ points a bandage.</font>
      <font face="Verdana" size="2">Even though we can heal with spells, saving
      mana for other things, DoTs,</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">buffs,
      is important especially if you do not have tons of mana to</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">expend.</font>
