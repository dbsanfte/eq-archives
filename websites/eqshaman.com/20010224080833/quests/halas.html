    Give Jinkus a piece of Mammoth Hide Parchment (from Cindl - Ask her 'what
    mammoth hide parchment?'), and a bottle of datura ink (from Greta outside
    Smokes and Spirits - Ask her 'what ink?'). He will give you a wanted poster.
    Take this to one of the Bank guards in Qeynos. They will give you a List of
    Qeynos' Most Wanted. Return this to Jinkus for Initiate Symbol of Justice,
    exp, and faction (+ShamenofJustice, +MerchantsOfHalas, -CircleOfUnseenHands,

    &nbsp; In Halas, there's a cigar shop SE of the Shaman temple called Dok's Cigars. &nbsp;
    Talk to Dok inside and he'll mention a cigar, but he has none in inventory. &nbsp; If you
    ask him about the cigar, he will relay a story about attempting to make something he calls
    cigars, but burning himself all the time, so he switched to candle making.&nbsp; A few
    more questions gets you the quest to go get honeycombs for him to make candles - you get a
    jar with 6 slots &amp; combine button.&nbsp; In return, he says he'll give you a 'special
    candle'.&nbsp; Your reward is xp, plat and the <a

    piece of large tattered or patchwork armor, or sometimes even rawhide.&nbsp; For those of
    &nbsp; you working on that complete set of patchwork, she sometimes gives the pieces that
    are not available to tailor.&nbsp; Faction for Merchants of Halas, Wolves of the North and
    Shamen of Justice goes up and Rogues of the White Rose goes down.&nbsp; She is also
    looking for Wrath Orc wristbands and says she will give Raw-hide tunic, leggings or

    color="#ff0000">Ivan McMannus' Remains:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Renth McLanis in McDaniels
    Smokes and Spirits seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus. He was supposed to escort
    Ivan who is a courier, but he ended up drinking the night away and Ivan got killed. Now he
    needs to find Ivan's Remains, but he doesn't know they are located. If you tell him that
    you will [search for the courier], he will direct you to Arnis McLish out in Everfrost who
    will then direct you to the lady who knows where the remains are (Megan). Arnis tends to
    hang out around the ramp into Black Burrow, but he runs around quite a bit in the area.
    You may have to chase him down or wait for him to come back. He will tell you that
    Snowflake (her pet wolf) can lead you to Megan if you ask him [where is Megan]? Snowflake
    is located by the two guards area on the edge of the tundra. Snowflake will lead you to
    Megan who is by the North Tower. If you ask Megan &quot;Where are Ivan's remains?&quot;,
    she will then tell you her sad story and ask if you [will dive for remains]. When you tell
    her that you will, she hands you the special box needed to complete the quest. The remains
    are at the bottom of the river and you have to access them through a hole in the ice.
    There are at least two holes in the river; the correct one is near the south side of the
    river and has a large piece of white ice jutting out of the frozen river next to the hole.
    When you dive, as you descend toward the north you will see a goblin diver. I killed this
    one and he only had an ice goblin necklace. The next goblin north of that one had a
    barbarian rib in his loot. Fighting the goblins below water is difficult (they are fast)
    so I lured them out of the hole in the ice to kill them on the frozen river surface. The
    rest of the bones are located on the river floor and look like small bags. The items you
    collect are: Barbarian rib, skull, jaw, and femur.&nbsp; The very first item is almost
    directly below the hole in the ice (was the femur for me). The other two items are further
    to the north along the very bottom of the river. I suggest returning to the surface to get
    a fresh air supply between grabbing each item. The furthest piece is dangerously far from
    the hole. A person needs a swimming skill of around 30 to swim straight to the furthest
    item and still be able to return to the hole before drowning. Once you have all four
    items, you combine them in the box and give them back to Renth McLanis. He will reward you
    with experience, some money, and a minor item.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Sleet, Kyll &amp;

    Langseax:</font>&nbsp; This is the quest to obtain the <a
    href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics3/Langseax.htm">Langseax</a> or the
    <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/graphics4/Langseax_of_the_Wolves.htm">Langseax
    of the Wolves </a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete Version: Go to Renth McLanis in the tavern across
    from Mac's Kilts.&nbsp; Ask him &quot;What dangerous matter?&quot;.&nbsp; He tells you of
    a crime.&nbsp; Agree to hunt the murderer.&nbsp; Renth then sends you to see Dok in Dok's
    Cigars.&nbsp; Find out all you can about the crime.&nbsp; He tells you to go see the
    leader of Clan McMannus.&nbsp; This is the fishing village located in West Karanas. &nbsp;
    Speak to the leader.&nbsp; Then speak to Ulrich McMannus and he tells you Frostbite can
    track prey if he has a piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok and ask him &quot;Where is
    the sweaty shirt?&quot;.&nbsp; He then tells you he sold it to Tundra Jack.&nbsp; Find
    Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost.&nbsp; He will tell you that Iceberg is using it
    for a collar and that you can distract Iceberg with his favorite meal, Lion Delight.
    &nbsp; Go back to Halas and speak to Teria O' Danos.&nbsp; Do the lion meat quest (you get
    coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight).&nbsp; Once you have Lion Delight, be sure
    to bury it lower in your container then your normal food to prevent it being eaten by you.
    &nbsp; Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg and receive the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and
    faction adjustment.&nbsp; Now run to the village and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE:
    Frostbite will wait for the murderer to spawn before he takes off.&nbsp; He walks pretty
    fast so I wouls strongly suggest that you have Spirit of Wolf on you.&nbsp; It also helps
    to have a party member along that can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times
    and have had to start over.&nbsp; Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the way.
    Help him out.&nbsp; Be very careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) Frostbite will
    lead you right to the criminal. The murderer will be either Paglan or Basil.&nbsp; Paglan
    is tougher to kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is around level 20. &nbsp;
    Kill whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops a Barbarian head and then return to
    Halas with the head. Give the head to Renth for faction, coin, and of course, the Langseax
    (if you have Basil's head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is Paglan's head).&nbsp; I
    am not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even if you can just kill both and get
    both heads, but it seems that you wil normally get Basil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short
    Version:&nbsp; Run to village, and receive the lion meat. &nbsp; Run to Halas, turn in
    meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and coin. Run to Iceberg, give Lion
    Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run to Frosbite, give shirt, gain exp. Kill the
    criminal. Return head for faction, coin, exp and Langseax. &nbsp; One thing to keep in
    mind is that your faction drops a good deal with the thieves guild with this quest, and
    the banker in Halas is a thief, making it possible that doint this quest can cause you to
    get kos if you try to use the bank.&nbsp; Also, you need a high faction with the Wolves of
    the North to finish the quest.&nbsp; The faction changes are as follows:&nbsp; When you
    complete the lion meat quest:&nbsp; Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+1)
    Merchants of Halas (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-1); &nbsp;&nbsp; When you trick
    Iceberg and get the Sweaty Shirt:&nbsp; Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+1),
    Merchants of Halas (+1), Steel Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-1);&nbsp; When
    you kill Paglan or Basil:&nbsp; Rogues of the White Rose (-1);&nbsp;&nbsp; When you turn
    in Paglan's or Basil's head for your reward: &nbsp;&nbsp; Shaman of Justice (-1), Wolves
    of the North (+1), Merchants of Halas (-1), Rogues of the White Rose (+1);&nbsp; Faction
    adjustments overall:&nbsp; Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+3), Merchants of
    Halas (+1), Steel Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-2).&nbsp; (Submitted by Joril

    &nbsp; This quest is also a part of the Langseax quest.&nbsp; If you talk to one of the
    merchants outside the city before the lake, you can get a quest to get lion meat from the
    fishing village.&nbsp; Talk to Einhorst McMannus in the barbarian fishing villiage in
    Western Karanas.&nbsp; He will refer you to a female barbarian nearby to get the meat.
    &nbsp; You must say to her &quot;I will deliver the Lion Meat Shipment to Halas&quot;.
    &nbsp; You get some minor coin for this quest.&nbsp; A good idea is to combine this quest
    with the note to Einhurst quest since they both go to the same place.&nbsp; (Submitted by
