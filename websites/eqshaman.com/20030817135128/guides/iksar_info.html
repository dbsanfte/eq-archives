      Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis,
      or New Sebilis as some call it, is a great walled city located deep in the
      heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis
      detected a spark of great wisdom within your life force. It was then that
      your path was chosen. Having reached the season of rebirth you have been
      summoned to the Temple of Terror. It is there that you shall study the
      ways of the unholy shaman known as the Scaled Mystics. Through the
      Hierophants, ancient Iksar ancestors shall guide you through the stages of
      the Scaled Mystics so that one day you may become a vessel of great power.
      Together with the Crusaders of Greenmist you form the religious backbone
      of the Iksar empire. The Iksar Legion does not act without the aid of the
      Scaled Mystics. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike
      the Iksar and cannot be trusted. Only within Cabilis are you truly safe.<br>

      There are many ways to assemble a good Iksar Shaman. One logical way would
      be to add 20 pts to wisdom and 10 to Str. The Iksar Shaman has a very nice
      starting wisdom but poor strength. Yes we can buff strength but 70 is just
      too low.<br>
