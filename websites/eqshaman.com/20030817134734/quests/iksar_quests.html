      </strong><i>As an Iksar one thing I noticed fast was most quests give you
      a container. HINT: These are also good as backpacks! - Madd</i><br>

      <font color="#ff0000">Bone Chips:</font>&nbsp; Trooper Mozo, outside the
      gates to the Field of Bone, promises to give you 10 sp for 4 Bone Chips.&nbsp;
      however, you will instead get laughed at and get between 1 to 7 sp.&nbsp;
      The xp is good though and you gain faction with LegionOfCabilis,
      CabilisResidents, ScaledMystics, CrusadersOfGreenmist and the Swifttails.

      <font color="#ff0000">Scorpion Pincers:</font>&nbsp; In the Field of Bone,
      Warlord Zyzz desires the return of four Scorpion Pincers off of Scorpions.&nbsp;
      Return them for xp, some coin and increased faction with LegionOfCabilis,
      CabilisResidents, ScaledMystics, CrusadersOfGreenmist and the Swifttails.&nbsp;

      <font color="#ff0000">Curscale Shield:</font>&nbsp; Talk to Drill Master
      Dal in Fortress Talishan and Mention that you are a new recruit and he
      will hand you a Partisan Pack, a 10-item backpack.&nbsp; He wants you to
      fill it with one Giant Blood Sac of the Giant Leech, Scout Beads from
      Goblin Scout, one Sabertooth Kitten Canine, and three Bone shards.&nbsp;
      Combine and return it to him and he will reward you with a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics11/Curscale_Buckler.html">Curscale
      Buckler</a>.&nbsp; (Submitted by Muse)<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">Curscale Skins:</font>&nbsp; Klok Mugruk gives you
      an 8 item backpack to fill with Curscale Skins from Scaled Wolf Pups and
      Cubs.&nbsp; Combine them and return the pack for small coin and a piece of
      Curscale armor, which is excellent armor for a newbie. This quest gives
      very good experience (almost a bubble of experience at low levels).&nbsp;
      The following factions improve: CabilisResidents and LegionOfCabilis.&nbsp;

      <font color="#ff0000">Shestar's Scaled Coif:</font>&nbsp; Trooper Shestar,
      inside the gates to the Field of Bone, wants 5 gp and three loose scales.&nbsp;
      In return, he gives you Shestar's Unfinished Coif.&nbsp; This gives no ac
      or other bonus, but he tells you that you can blacksmith it to fix it up
      if you use 3 scaled wolf scales.&nbsp; So run out and get three more loose
      scales, combine them in a forge with the unfinished coif (no water
      needed), and you will get the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics12/Shestars_Scaled_Coif.html">Shestar's
      Scaled Coif</a> for your troubles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Muse)<b><strong><br>
