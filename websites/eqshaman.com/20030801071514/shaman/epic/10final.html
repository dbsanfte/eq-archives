Return to the City of Mist and give the ring to Neh'Ashiir. To get to Neh'Ashiir, travel up to the final platform. Check out this <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html">map</a> from EQ Atlas. Pull the Black Reaver, which is 100% magic immune. After Black Reavers are killed, there is a chance that another will spawn directly afterwards on the spot. In this way, up to 50 or more reavers can spawn in a row, although high numbers like this are very rare. After the all Black Reavers are done, Neh`Ashiir will spawn. She is non-KoS, but will attack immediately after you give her the ring, so the following conversation will fly by.
<p>
Neh`Ashiir says 'Nothing is left to hide now. You shall have the truth. But truth is not won easily and if you cannot defeat me, you have not the ability to see that vengeance is served. Brace yourself!<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain party experience!!
<p>
She drops her diary:
<p>
<i>..another bazaar.. I was asked to judge..wrestling contest. It must have been the ten thousandth one this week. Oh how I grow weary of...political monotony. The earlier days were much..exciting, crusades against..unworthy and smashing our opposition. Kirn's life must be epic indeed. He.. at me again during.. match. Hmmmm.</i>
<p>
Give the diary to the Spirit Sentinel under the pond in the Emerald Jungle (at location +3685, -640).
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Rak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go!<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
<p>
Proceed to the Plane of Fear with a raid force and slay either Dread, Fright, or Terror (the three personal guards of Cazic Thule). After you kill one of them, an "Iksar Broodling" will spawn by the corpse. He is only level one and is not KoS. Kill him an loot the tear. If your guild is not powerful enough to raid the Plane of Fear, try to tag along with another raid. Ask beforehand if anybody will be needing the tear; if nobody does you are in luck.
<p>
Return to City of Mist and give the Tear to Lord Rak'Ashiir. Rak'Ashiir can be found at the end of any Black Reaver "cycle", as explained above with Neh'Ashiir. This means he can be found at any place where Black Reavers spawn. When people are killing Reavers, they often leave without killing Rak'Ashiir (as they have no reason to and he is rather nasty). Check around with a tracker and you might find him without having to kill Reavers. Lord Rak'Ashiir is non-KoS, but will attack you immediately after you give him the Child's Tear.
<p>
This is the final encounter of your epic quest. You will need a group or more of people able to defeat a reaver spawn to get to Rak'Ashiir in the first place. However, if Rak'Ashiir is already up you you can do this encounter with as little as 4 other people - one rogue to open the castle door, one magician, and two clerics, levels 60-65. However, the more people, the better. Lord Rak'Ashiir casts a 2000 HP area affect spell which can be very mean. The recommended stragegy is to use one or more magician level 49 fire pets. The reason to use the level 49 fire pet and not higher level pets is because this pet has a very high innate fire resistance and will not be effected by the area effect spell.
<p>
<li>Buff the fire pet(s) up with a full set of buffs.<br>
<li>Park the pet(s) around Rak'Ashiir.<br>
<li>Make sure everyone is hidden behind walls or far enough away so they are not effected by the area effect spell.<br>
<li>Hand in your tear. There is a good chance of you dying. Heal yourself and try to let the fire pets taunt Rak'Ashiir.
<p>
It is best for the rogue and other melee (if any) to stay with the casters until late in the fight. Sometimes you might get adds and the melee's can take care of the problem without interupting the clerics. Let melee engage more so towards the end of the fight, so if they die to the area effect spell it wont be so devastating.
<p>
Once Rak'Ashiir is dead, loot the "Iksar Scale". Head to the Spirit Sentinel under the pond in the Emerald Jungle (at location +3685, -640).
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What is lost?'</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate].'
<p>
You say, <b>'What is the Spear of Fate?'</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes].'
<p>
You say, <b>'What of these Black Holes?</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What powerful shaman?'</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What of the cosmos?'</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What of the breach?'</b>
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah.
