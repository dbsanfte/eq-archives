<table><tr><td width=90%>It is VERY hard to solo the underbulk. If you want to try, you should be level 65 with very high end gear and have a bunch of AA. It is recommended you bring at least a melee friend along, preferably a paladin. Keep in mind that Levitation does not drop every time and may require multiple kills to obtain.
<p>
Head to the Deep and start killing your way in (the monsters here see through invisibility). You will not be able to single pull (as a shaman), so be prepared to deal with adds. The spawn time on these trash monsters is about 6 minutes, so you will have to progress relatively quick. If you have a cleric/paladin/enchanter however, you do not have to kill anything, as you can just lull the monsters and pass by carefully. At the first fork in the road, turn right. At the next fork, turn left. Shortly after, you should come to a dead end. There are a set of 3 monsters here and the underbulk might already be up. If not, you will see "a young thought leech" or "An Enthralled Underbulk", which are the placeholders. Just keep clearing the monsters. Spawn time here is 20 minutes. The underbulk is level 52 and has a lot of HP.</td><td width=10%></td></tr></table>
