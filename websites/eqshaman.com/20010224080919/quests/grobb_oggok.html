        Kaglari Skeleton Quest</b>
      
      
      &nbsp;
      
      
        <br>
        Given By: Urako who is located up on the
        ledge behind Kaglari.&nbsp; Just take the
        stairs on the left of Kaglari up and take first right on to the ledge.
        <br>
        Items Needed: the four skeletons, the Baker, the Butcher, the Captain,
        and the Minstrel. <br>
        Items Needed: Troll Oven Mittens, Ogre
        Butcher Apron, 3 Pickled Froglock, and 4 Lizard Scout Fifes.<br>
        <br>
      
      
        Where to Get the Items: This is a long
        quest that involves many mini quests.
      
      
        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;The Baker: After you get the quest go to
        the bar behind the Warrior's Guild and there should be a brownish/red
        looking Skeleton next to the bartender. Walk up to him and hail him and
        then say Come Back to the Closet or some variation of that.&nbsp; He
        will say he can't unless you get him a pair of Grobb Oven Mittens.&nbsp;
        Go to Carver Cravek who is in front of the Shaman Guild and ask him for
        the Grobb Oven Mittens.&nbsp; He will ask you for 3 Froglok Meats and 10
        gold pieces.&nbsp; Give those to him and he will give you the Grobb Oven
        Mittens.&nbsp; (Note: This can be done many times to get the mittens)&nbsp;
        The Grobb Oven Mittens are 4ac +5 fire resist.&nbsp; Give the Mittens to
        the skeleton and he will pop into your inventory.&nbsp; He will then say
        that Basher Nanrum saw his skeleton friend.<br>
        <br>
      
      
        The Butcher: Go find Basher Nanrum.&nbsp;
        If you head towards the entrance to Grobb and cross the little moat
        there and go to the left, Basher Nanrum should be in the little room
        there.&nbsp; He's the same Basher that gives the Fire Beetle Eye Quest.&nbsp;
        Ask him &quot;Wheres the skeleton&quot; and he'll reply that he saw him
        by Carver Cravek. Go to Carver Cravek and there will be another skeleton
        standing by him. Target the skeleton and say &quot;Come back to the
        closet?&quot; He replies that he would if he had an Ogre Butcher Apron.
        Getting this apron has been tough for many people.&nbsp; Since Trolls
        and Ogres at the best tolerate each other, faction might be too bad with
        Chef Dooga to get the Apron, especially if you've done the Fire Beetle
        Eye quest too many times.&nbsp; Anyways, go to Chef Dooga in Oggok and
        con her to see if you can get the apron.&nbsp; If she is dubious to you
        then you are able to.&nbsp; If threatening then you better run!
        Otherwise, ask her about the Ogre Butcher Apron and she will tell you to
        bring her 3 Pickled Froglok.&nbsp; The recipe for pickled Froglok is 1
        Froglok Meat + 1 Vinegar + 1 Jug of Sauces.&nbsp; Put these in an oven
        or spit and combine.&nbsp; This usually fails since most people don't
        have much of a baking skill.&nbsp; So the best thing to do is to get a
        baker to make it for you or stock up on the ingrediants.&nbsp; The
        vinegar and Jug of Sauces can be found to the right of the Oggok
        entrance if facing it.&nbsp; Give Chef
      
      
        Dooga the Pickled Froglok and she will
        give you the Apron.&nbsp; The Ogre Butcher Apron is 6ac +5 fire resist.&nbsp;
        Give the Apron the the skeleton and he will tell you that Basher Sklama
        knows where the next skeleton is.&nbsp; Head out to the swamp and find
        Basher Skalma on the left.<br>
        <br>
      
      
        The Captain: After you find Basher Skalma
        ask him &quot;Where's the Captain?&quot;&nbsp; He will reply that he saw
        the Captain on a little island in the Swamp.&nbsp; From what I hear you
        must spam Basher Skalma saying &quot;Where's the Captain?&quot; many
        times before the Captain will actually spawn.&nbsp; The Captain is
        located next to the sunken ship in the swamp.&nbsp; The Loc is -1617,773
        and he only spawns at night from what I hear.&nbsp; Find him and he'll
        say something about losing his ship and that he would come back to the
        closet if he got a new one.&nbsp; Now it's time to go and buy the ship
        in a bottle from Chef Dooga.&nbsp; She won't sell it to you unless she
        con's indifferent or better.&nbsp; You'll either have to have Wolf-form
        cast on you or have someone buy it for you, although it might be
        no-drop, not sure.&nbsp; Once you get the ship in a bottle, give it to
        the Captain and he will tell you that Basher Avisk saw his skeleton
        friend the Minstrel.&nbsp; Thank goodness, the last one spawns inside
        Grobb.<br>
        <br>
      
      
        The Minstrel:&nbsp; Find Basher Avisk and
        ask him &quot;Where is the Minstrel.&nbsp; This
      
      
        is another one you'll have to spam.&nbsp;
        The Minstrel spawns at the Warrior's
      
      
        Guild by the Bashin Place sign.&nbsp; The
        Minstrel will come back to the closet
      
      
        for four Lizard Scout Fifes.&nbsp; Then
        run over to Oggok and camp the Lizard
      
      
        Camps until you get four fifes.&nbsp; Give
        them to the Minstrel and viola, you
      
      
        got all four skeletons.&nbsp; Give the
        four skeletons to Urako and she will give
      
      
        you the Kaglari Mana Doll.<br>
        <br>
        
      
      
        Reward Given: Kaglari Mana Doll is Shaman
        only, Ogre, Troll, Barbarian. +15 mana, AC 4.
      
      
        Faction Hits: Not sure.<br>
        <br>
        
      
      
        Comments: The toughest part of the quest
        is getting the skeletons to spawn and having good enough faction with
        the Ogres so that you can interact with Chef Dooga.&nbsp; I am dubious
        to her so have yet to get the ship in the bottle.
      
      
        Dark Elf Enchanters have the best chance
        of doing this quest because of
      
      
        Alliance.&nbsp; Trolls should do this
        quest early on.&nbsp; It's time consuming and not sure if it's worth the effort, but
        IMHO as far as the actual quest goes this is definitely a good one.
