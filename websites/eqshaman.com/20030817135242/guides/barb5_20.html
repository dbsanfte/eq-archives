    </strong><small>by Keltek the Barbar - Fennin Ro Server/Nameless Server</small> </font><p><font
    face="Verdana"><br>
    <small>5-6:<br>
    Kill gob scouts at the Caster igloos (sw corner of EF). If you're having trouble at 5th
    doing this, then grab a friend (a warrior prefferably in case the caster beads for your
    gavel ever drop....warriors have no use for em so won't fight you for em) </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">7:<br>
    Group up and take out Polar bears near the 1 Guard (Brendyl). Keep a Polar Bear Skin or
    two on you in case you ever see Karg for your cloak. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">8,9:<br>
    Solo or group the polar bears. Fight in the BlackBurrow entrance (stay outside the BB zone
    for now) and if you need help run to Arnis or the BB zoneline. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">10,11:<br>
    Get a group for Mammoth Calves and farm on the edge of the tundra in front of the 1 guard
    spot. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">12:<br>
    Hit the Wisps on Eruds Crossing. Be sure you have a magic weapon for em, cause you can't
    schmackem without one =) </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">13:<br>
    Wisps still prefferably, but Guards in BB will also do. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">14,15:<br>
    Do the BF quest if you haven't gotten a magic weapon yet and get the Testament of Vernear
    quest started in Qeynos (you just got Bind, use it often!). Hunt Wisps solo or the Elite
    Room grouped (called the green rm). Excellent loot either way. Might want to head to
    Highpass Hold at 15th. (on your way to HH give your greater lightstones (one at a time)
    from the Wisps to the Gypsy woman whose name starts with an &quot;M&quot; (make sure you
    have an open inventory slot every time you give a GLS) in the Gypsy camp in N Karana.
    She'll give you a research book which you can sell for 8-9pp) </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">16:<br>
    Head to HighpassHold and the Gnolls (Get a map!) if solo. HH Orcs if in a full group
    (you'll do better in a full group with the Orcs). Camp Dyllan for the Testament page or if
    you see an SK (or is it a Palydin quest?)camping him for the letter you can ask to loot
    the page when they get him. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">17:<br>
    Hunt E Karana solo or grouped. Pull reavers (not undead yet), Gorge hounds, Dark Stalkers,
    and Highland Lions/Lionesses to the very edge of the river. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">18:<br>
    Same as 17th or if in Everfrost-Orc Shamen solo or Mammoth Mammas in a FULL group. Also
    Orcs in HH (grouped) or Gnolls solo. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">19:<br>
    Undead Reavers, Gorge Hounds, Dark Stalkers in EK if solo. Orcs in a group in HH or Gnolls
    solo. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">20:<br>
    I went to Dagnors Cauldron but had a hella time solo hunting Bosuns and Casters near the
    NPC camp. If you get someone else to group with you you'll get more than decent
    experience. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Hope this helps you guys, and good hunting! </font></small></p>
