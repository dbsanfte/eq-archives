        </font></small><font size="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana"><img align="left" border="0" hspace="8" src="../images/shaman.gif" width="105" height="161"><b>Before not much longer, you should be able to
        reach level 5</b>, which is the Second Order for Shamans. At level 5, you get new spells.
        The first spell to get, or the first spell if damage is your priority, is Frost Rift. This
        spell provides 15 points of direct cold damage for only 15 mana, which is a little more
        efficient than Burst of Flame. (Also note, from this point on, the majority of your direct
        damage spells will be cold spells only.) I would keep Burst of Flame and Frost Rift both
        memorized for now and just keep casting them as needed. </font><p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>The next one is Sicken.</b> It is available on the vendor on
        the stone hand in the center of the Innothule swamp or on the vendor on the temple ruins
        on the northern edge of the plains of EverFrost. This is the first Damage over Time (DoT)
        available to Shamans This spell will do about 8 damage instantly, then do an additional 2
        points every tick (6 seconds) for 21 ticks (just over 2 minutes). That is a total of 50
        damage for only 30 mana. Additionally, almost all creatures in Norrath heal at a rate of 1
        point per tick. By doing 2 damage every tick, you are preventing them from healing
        themselves, so even if the mob runs, he will regain no hit points until after 2 minutes.
        By that time, they may actually be dead. This is an excellent opening spell, then follow
        by melee and direct damage. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>The next one to get is Scale Skin.</b>
        It provides an additional 6 armor class and is stackable with Inner Fire. (Note here, that
        ALL shield and hp spells available to a Shaman are stackable with Inner Fire. Ever at
        Eighth Order, I still use it constantly.) This will provide an excellent source of
        protection for only a little cost. The only drawback is that it uses snake scales every
        casting. But since you Trolls and Ogres saved all your snake scales, you have a head
        start. For the Barbarians, you will have to make a run through BlackBurrow into Qeynos
        Hills, then south into North Qeynos. This is another newbie zone plagued with hundreds of
        snakes. You can either start killing them for the scales, run to the vendors and buy all
        the scales you can find, or just start auctioning for them. If you do not care about the
        extra ac, then forget this spell for a bit. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>At this level, you can also get Feet
        Like Cat</b> (plus 18 agility) or Endure Fire (resist fire plus 20), both of which last
        about 15 minutes. Kitty feet is an excellent choice. Endure Fire is nice to have when
        facing mobs who cast fire magic, but not very useful at this level. The other buff is
        Fleeting Fury. It grants a burst of 15 strength, 20 dexterity, and 6 armor class for about
        18 seconds. This is only a 3 tick spell, but casts quickly and provides a little burst of
        damage and damage avoidance. In the debuff line, there is Drowsy. It will slow the attacks
        of the enemy to about 80% of normal for a few minutes. This means that the mob will try to
        hit you less than normal. Then there is Cure Poison, which will attempt to do just that.
        (Note here that for every poison level, you will have to cast the spell once. For example,
        Poison is a 3rd level poison, so you will have to cast CP 3 times to cure it. In most
        cases at this level, the poison will be weak enough that you can sit it out. If, however,
        you are low on hit points, you may need to cast it.) Summon Drink and Spirit Pouch are
        also available here. Summon Drink will actually summon water so that you do not have to
        buy water any longer. The only draw back is that the water will be gone if you loose
        connection or log out. But it can save some money, and is a great way to practice your
        Conjuration skill. Spirit Pouch summons a 4-slot bag for your use. The bag will only last
        until you loose connection or log out, and then anything inside will be gone. But the bag
        will hold large items, and anything inside will have the weight drastically reduced. With
        a Spirit Pouch, you could actually hold 4 Mammoth Tusks without hurting your weight limit
        (of course, at this level you won't see a mammoth tusk, but still.) Just be careful to
        have it empty before you log. It is a great weight saver, though. And there is Gate, which
        is the teleport spell. It will allow you to be transported back to your bind point (the
        point you come into the world when you die). It can be used for an escape spell, but it is
        a mana hog, so be careful not to be too brave thinking it will save you, especially since
        like any spell, it too can be interrupted. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Now, how do you get enough money to
        buy</b> all these spells? Well, keep doing what you are doing. Kill everything in sight
        for a while and keep it all. For the Trolls, just keep hunting in the swamps and working
        on your swimming, venturing farther and farther from Grobb. Just remember to con
        everything before attacking it. And be careful not to attack a froggie with lots more
        froggies around. The only guards are still the ones at the entrance to Grobb, so be
        careful. You can also be very brave and try you luck in Guk. The froggies in the entrance
        are lesser levels, but may still destroy you. I would probably hunt here with a group if
        at all at this level. There is, however, good loot to be had there. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>For the Ogres, you can continue
        hunting</b> in Feerott, or venture over to Innothule to hunt. Innothule would probably be
        the best spot since you have to go there anyway to get the Sicken spell. Again, you can
        try Guk, but be very careful. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>For the Barbarians, once the mobs in
        the passes</b> to Halas are all easy blue or green, you can venture into Black Burrow or
        onto the Plains of EverFrost. On the plains, there are snow leopards, snow orcs, ice
        goblin scouts, wolves, polar bears, woolly mammoths and calves, and skeletons. If you hunt
        here, be very careful as some of the mobs can be very high level for you (woolly mammoths
        are in the 20's). And farther from the passes, there are snow orc mountaineers and
        shamans, both much higher levels. There are guards near the entrances to the passes, so if
        you get into trouble, just run back there. If you choose BlackBurrow, it can be very busy
        and very dangerous. But there is good loot to be had there. I would only go here at this
        level with a group since it can be very dangerous. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>This is a good time to start looking
        into grouping</b>, or you can continue to solo. If you solo, just remember that EverQuest
        is designed for grouping. It is possible to solo, but is more dangerous. Do not be
        surprised if you die much more often when you solo. However, Shaman is one of the best
        solo classes since they can do almost everything. If you group, it is best to identify
        your role in the group right from the start. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>This is also the time to start looking</b>
        for a better weapon and armor. You should be able to afford a little patchwork armor if
        you haven't taken up tailoring. You can usually find players selling it for a few gold.
        For a weapon, if you can afford it, try to get a fine steel weapon. If you are an Ogre or
        Troll, you should be able to pick one up from a high level player returning from
        Cazic-Thule for only a few plat. If you can't afford one yet, then just try to start
        saving for it. Fine steel is much faster than any other level of weapon except some of the
        magic ones. If you are a Barbarian, try to get a Bronze weapon from some of the adventures
        who have been killing bandits in the Karanas. They should be no more than a few gold. If
        you have chosen two-hand, then you can stick with the worn great staff or a fine steel one
        or anything in between. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><br>
        Trade Skills </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>This is a good time to break in for
        Trade Skills.</b> Shamans can do almost any trade skills. Jewelcraft is probably not a
        good choice since it take enchanted metal and Shamans have no metal enchantment spells,
        but if you can afford to buy the metal and gems, it can be profitable, although your stats
        are not geared towards it. Fletching and Bow craft is possible, but pretty much useless
        for a Shaman since you cannot use a bow. Brewing can be fun since it allows you to make
        your own home brew. (Alcohol, if your tolerance is good, can offer some nice benefits to
        stats. If your tolerance is not good, it can be a bad situation.) Cooking will allow you
        to make your own food, but not much good for a Shaman since you will be able to Summon
        Food at Third Order. And there is Alchemy, but that is much later in life. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>For a Shaman, the best trade skills
        are tailoring</b> and smithing. This can be a very effective way to save some money in
        making your own armor. I would suggest tailoring to start since it is the cheapest, then
        going into smithing a little later. Both skills can turn very expensive, but are good
        money makers in the end. Either way, Trolls and Ogres need large armor (bear pelts for
        tailoring) and Barbarians need medium or large (cat or bear). There are polar bears, polar
        bear cubs, and snow leopards in EverFrost for the Barbarians. For the Trolls and Ogres,
        there are bears in Rathe Mountains, but they are in the level 12 range, or higher. Be
        careful if hunting them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>For the skills, I would suggest
        dumping 20 points</b> into the skill from the start. This is the maximum that can be
        placed into a trade skill, the rest must actually be learned. Then start working on your
        skill by making yourself some armor. For smithing, it will be a LONG process of getting
        the skills needed for smithing, but you can eventually get the skills needed to make your
        own banded armor. The choice is yours to learn a skill to get the armor, or to just save
        and buy it. Just remember that your first priority is to get the spells. <br>
        <br>
        Grouping </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>This is also a good point to break in
        and discuss grouping.</b> Shamans, because of the wide variety of things they can do, are
        excellent in a group. It is true that a Shaman is not as good at any one thing as the
        others, but no other is as good as so much. The Shaman can work some as a tank, some as a
        healer, some as a caster, some as a debuffer, and some as a buffer. No other class can
        come close to the Shaman in terms of sheer buff power. True, the Shaman ac-hp shield is
        still only a level 1 shield, but the ac-only shield and the hp-only shield are great. And
        the attribute buffs are not equaled by anyone. The only attributes Shamans cannot buff are
        wisdom and intelligence. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>As a buffer, Shamans should choose
        their buffs wisely.</b> Always buff yourself as much as possible. If, however, it comes to
        choosing to buff a tank with strength or yourself, choose the tank. Any tank that has
        grouped with a Shaman will always want a Shaman. Yes, there is a little more downtime
        waiting to refresh mana from all the buffs, but as you increase in level, the buff
        downtime will lessen because the duration of the buffs will increase. The level 20-ish
        buffs last about 45 minutes, while the level 30-ish buffs last well over an hour. There
        are still some, like the vision spells and the still first level Inner Fire, which you
        should always keep up on yourself unless there is another caster who can keep theirs on
        you. It is only 10 mana for another 3 ac and 20 hp (at high levels). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>If there are others who can cast buffs</b>,
        like the Ranger Skin Like Rock or Feet Like Cat or the Cleric Center or what not, let them
        take some of the buffing. Always keep tanks up with strength, your fast tanks and caster
        with dexterity, as many as possible with stamina and agility, and bards and enchanters
        with charisma. Always keep charisma and stamina and dexterity up on yourself, and agi and
        str if possible. If there is a Ranger, let him do Feet Like Cat and you do dex. Yea, his
        kitty feet is not as much as your higher level agility spells, but it will save you some
        time. If there is a cleric, let him do Spirit Armor and save your Protection or Shifting
        Shield for yourself or only the front line tank. All in all, just manage your mana as well
        as the mana of the rest of the group as much as possible to minimize the downtime. Tanks
        tend to get jumpy when they have to sit for long times, especially those without mana.
        Many times that means jumping a small mob and accidentally pulling a train. But, if you
        have a good puller, let him pull a small mob or two for the tanks to play with while you
        med. If you have Regeneration up on yourself and are using Cannibalize like any good
        Shaman does, then you will have a little mana for emergencies anyway. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Also, Shamans get the Quicken line</b>
        of debuffs, which increase the attack speed. If you couple Quicken on a tank (133% attack)
        with Targar's Insects on the mob (66% attack), hen the tank is hitting twice as much as
        the mob. This is the same as the Enchanter's line, so if you have an Enchanter, it is best
        to let him do this since he has more mana anyway, or you can share the quick buffs so more
        tanks get the benefit. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>As a debuffer, you will not be as good</b>
        as an Enchanter, but you do have a good range of spells. Where the Enchanter has Tashan to
        hit for a res magic reduction, all you have is the Malice line. It does hit all saves but
        disease for nice reductions, but it's not an automatic hit like Tashan usually is. Malice
        tend to be resisted a lot, but if it sticks, then every save but disease will be a lot
        less (about 20). And if you have an enchanter, then keep Malice loaded anyway. Once the
        Enchanter hits with Tashan, Malice will usually stick and then reduce the other saves. And
        your casters will love you for it. Plus, you also have the Insect line and the Disempower
        line. The Disempower line is exactly the same spells as Enchanters, just a spell order
        later (it lowers strength, dexterity, and armor class so the mob hits for max less times,
        actually hits less times, and is hit more times). The Insect line slows the mob's attack
        speed (Insects replace Drowsy later in levels). If there is an Enchanter, you can share
        the debuff duties with him doing slow and you disempower or so, or you can let him do all
        the debuff while you concentrate on something else. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>As a healer, the Shaman will never be
        as good</b> as a Cleric. The Shaman's maximum heal is Greater Healing, which is about 270
        hp for 150 mana. Clerics get this, and another higher heal, plus have more mana. But, the
        Shaman can work the role of a backup healer at the higher levels, or the role as THE
        healer up to about level 30. Be very careful if the Shaman is the only healer, though.
        That can get tricky as mobs tend to come after anything that is healing. At the level 30
        range, never go into a dangerous area without two healers, be they Cleric and a Shaman, or
        Shaman and a Druid, or two Shamans. At higher levels, it should always be a Shaman and a
        Cleric (for the Cleric's better heal and revive). As a healer, the role is to stand back
        and save mana for when it's needed. When time to heal, one good tactic is to develop a
        system so the other healers know who you are healing. One good trick is to call out
        &quot;HA&quot; to heal the character with a name starting with A. It doesn't much matter
        what system you use, but the goal is to not have two healers both hit a tank with Greater
        Heal if it is not needed. Yea, it is better to heal twice than not at all, but if you have
        a system, then you can conserve the mana. Also, be sure to yell if the mobs turn on you
        because when you are fighting a mob, you usually get interrupted or are too busy to heal
        your team, which will do nothing but get them very mad with you, especially if someone
        dies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>As a caster, the Shaman skills start
        to loose</b> big ground at the higher levels. At level 30, the best direct damage spell
        the Shaman has is Frost Strike for about 150 points of cold damage. At 34, the Shaman gets
        Winter's Roar for 250 points of cold, but most of the mobs then are well over 2,000 hp.
        The Shaman can fill the caster role, but it is best done by balancing direct damage and
        DoT. The Shaman's DoT is incredible. The disease DoT's last a very long time and only do a
        little damage a round. The poison DoT's do a lot of damage each tick for about 42 seconds.
        Be very careful when casting DoT's. Mobs very much do not like to be DoT'ed. The tank must
        be doing more damage per round than you, or the mob will turn on you. If you hit the mob
        with a few DoT's, then he will not come off you. But then again, that's why you have
        better armor. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>All groups should have a defensive
        tank</b>, offensive tank, wild card class, healer, caster, and shaman. The defensive tank
        is the one with lots of armor and hit points. He is the one who will taunt and be getting
        pounded most of the time, although he will be dishing out his share of the damage. This is
        best as a warrior, paladin, or shadow knight. The offensive tank is the one who will be
        dishing out the melee damage. This one can still take some hits, but will be mostly
        offensive. This is best as a monk, or as another tank with very fast weapons mainly to
        disrupt enemy casting. The next is the wild card class. In most cases, this will be
        another tank, but it can also be another caster depending on the situation. Just about any
        class can fill this slot. Next is the primary healer. This is the one who will do the
        majority of the healing and combat over-watch. This is best as a cleric. Then is the
        caster. This is your primary damage maker and boomer. This is the one you must most
        protect for this is your firepower. If a mob gets on him, then is the time to hit with a
        DoT or whatever it takes to get the mob away from the caster. This is usually a wizard or
        other pure caster. Then is the Shaman. And in a group like this, your role will vary
        depending on what the other classes actually are. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Nothing personal against the other
        classes</b>, but the best class combination I have found for a Shaman is probably Shadow
        Knight for the defensive tank, monk for offensive, Bard for the wild card, Cleric for the
        healer, Wizard for the caster, and Shaman. Shadow Knight have good armor and hit points,
        plus some nice secondary magic, like the Darkness line of spells to slow the mob movement.
        The Monk is a combat machine at higher levels. Hit him with a strength and agility and
        dexterity plus a quickness and he is unstoppable. The Bard is a good tank able to dual
        wield fast weapons, plus the Chains song and damage song and all the other backup songs,
        plus the Bard can help in downtime with the mana song and healing song. For a healer,
        Cleric cannot be beat, especially for the Revive when the tank is bound many zones away.
        The direct damage of a Wizard is supreme. For a fast turn and burn, nothing beats a
        Wizard. In this group, the Shaman would play the role of secondary healer to backup the
        cleric, and of debuffer to hold the mobs. Additionally, the Shaman would work as the
        buffer for quickness. Yes, that is 3 roles, but most of the time will be watching over the
        group and healing. Quickness lasts about 3 minutes, so it is cast on the Monk and maybe
        the Bard or SK before the fight. Just keep Regen running on yourself and Cannibalize
        memorized for the immediate mana needs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>However, you cannot always have the
        perfect group</b>. As long as you have someone to fill all the roles in the group, you can
        make the group work. I have never seen a group with 6 wizards, for example. There is no
        tank, so the first big mob pull would be deadly to at least one of the wizards. A group of
        6 wizards would be a massive power source, but without a tank or healer, very risky. The
        best group is as stated; two tanks, healer, caster, shaman, and wild card. If the wild
        card is another caster, then the Shaman can act as a tank sometimes. Though not as good as
        a warrior, it is possible, especially if the Shaman has good armor, like Rubicite. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><br>
        Shamans in Player versus Player </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>If you have chosen the path of Discord</b>,
        or if you are playing on the Pvp server or on the Race-war server, then pvp will be of
        great interest to you. It may also interest you in terms of dueling on the normal servers.
        As a Shaman, you should do very well in pvp once you survive to the higher levels. You
        have the advantage of lots of buffs on your side and of the ability to heal and hurt.
        Plus, you have the DoT's and Root. In all fights but those against a druid, you will have
        the advantage of speed. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>In one on one fights, you should do
        very well</b> if you use your tactics very well. In groups, it will depend entirely on the
        make up of your group, and on the abilities of your team. This should serve as a rough
        comparison between the classes. Remember, however, that just because you should win, does
        not mean that you will. Tactics is everything, along with a little luck. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against a caster, you should have a
        good chance.</b> Casters can have some massive damage spells as well as some of the spells
        you have. If you know you will be facing a caster make sure you have at least Endure Magic
        running. Against a wizard, try to have all of your resistances at maximum. Wizards,
        Magicians, and Enchanters do not get much for poison and disease, so if you have to
        sacrifice, sacrifice those. Against the other casters, try to avoid the pet and go after
        the boss. If you have to fight against both, it could turn very bad very quickly. The key
        is to charge in against a caster, root him if you have to, and hit as hard and fast as
        possible. Be sure to save some mana for heals as he will be blasting you. The best bet
        would be to hit him with a DoT or three and Root, then charge in and try to disrupt,
        saving as much as possible to heal. Once he is out of mana, the fight is over. Also, with
        all your resistances maximized, you will hopefully resist many of his spells anyway.
        Enchanters can be a little tricky with all their debuffs, but with Endure up, you should
        be okay. Either way, all casters have low hit points compared to you, so you should come
        out okay. Necromancers, however, might be different. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Necromancers also have some very
        wicked DoT's.</b> Their Darkness line will override your speed (as will root from the
        others), so be sure to keep SoW memorized for emergencies. Against a Nec, you have to kill
        him as fast as possible. There will be no outlasting a Nec from a distance. He can hit you
        with far more DoT's than you can him, plus he can lifedrain to heal. However, lifedrain is
        not a true heal. If you can charge in avoiding the pet and hit hard and fast, you should
        come out on top. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against a Cleric, you should have
        little problem.</b> Clerics do have the ability to heal, and it is much better than yours,
        plus they can cast some wicked blind spells, which make your screen go blank. They can
        wear better armor than you, but are generally not as good a fighter. Close and bash him
        while using DoT and direct damage, and you should come out on top. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against a tank, the key is to root and
        blast.</b> Although Rangers, Paladins, and Shadow Knights have magic, it not not close to
        the magic you posses. The Paladin Lay Hands basically means you have to kill him twice.
        Rangers have heals, but not high level ones. In all fights, you should be able to out
        blast them. If they close to melee, it could get close, especial with the rogue back stab,
        so make sure a rogue does not get behind you. If you can root and DoT, you can taunt
        without fear. Now, Rangers do get SoW at high level, and SoW can break root, so be careful
        of that. The only onther concern at all against a tank is the Shadow Knight Harm Touch.
        Make sure you have Endure Magic up against a SK. A level 34 SK can HT for over 500 points.
        Have the heals ready and root him. SK's also get the Darkness line, although lower level
        than an equal level Nec. Either way, with good tactics, you should still come out ahead. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against a Bard, you should have no
        problem.</b> You cannot out run a bard if he has an instrument playing, but then again, if
        he has an instrument, he cannot do much damage. You cannot root him because just as your
        SoW breaks root, so does his speed song. The best bet is to DoT and blast. He can wear
        better armor and hit faster, but you can blast harder and faster, and you can heal bigger.
        He should not be a big problem. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against a Druid will be the closest
        fight.</b> Druids have DoT's although not nearly as good as yours. Druids have better
        direct damage than you by far. And Druids get the same heals as you, plus can run just as
        fast. From a distance, you will probably loose even though your DoT's are better because
        the Druid will have more mana to heal and can blast you harder. The best bet is to charge
        in and take the damage from the thorns. Druids cannot wear as good of armor as you, nor
        are they as good at melee. Just try to interrupt as much as possible and beat him to
        death. This will be your hardest opponent, except maybe another Shaman. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Against another Shaman, there is no
        limit</b> to how the fight could go. This will depend entirely on tactics and equipment
        and skills. You may be able to wear him down from a distance, or you may be able to close
        and beat him to death. There is no sure winner here, and it will depend on how the
        opponent chooses to fight as to how you should. You can either let him control the
        direction of the fight, or you can control it. If you get in the first DoT and can close,
        you should be able to interrupt him enough to keep it in your favor. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1"><b>Overall, you should be
        able to beat any foe.</b> It is possible that the opponent can be more lucky and resist
        more of your magic thus turning the tide in his favor. Then again, that can be the case in
        any fight be it against another player or against the computer. But in the long run, you
        should have a good chance if you use your brain. </font></p>
