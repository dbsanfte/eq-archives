<table><tr><td width=90%><li><b>Note: DO NOT perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Bear or Form of the Great Bear. Being in an illusion may bug the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to fail.</b><br> <li>Note: The entire quest is faction based. This means that are able to skip the latter parts by doing the first ones over and over again until you max your True Spirit faction. Once you have max faction, you can go straight to Lord Rak'Ashiir and turn in your child's tear. However, this can be very time consuming and is not recommended.<br><li>Note: There is no level restriction for the shaman epic quest. However, you do have to be level 46 to enter the Plane of Fear to get the tear. One can get around this by just having another shaman turn in the tear for them and then looting the scale (keep in mind that only a <b>shaman</b> can turn in the tear). If you are doing this, make sure you have maxed out your True Spirit faction beforehand using the above method.</td><td
