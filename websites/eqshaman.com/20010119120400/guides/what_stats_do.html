      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In working with the people doing the
      strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general
      information as to what the stats do.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm going to post them here.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a change in the sense that we
      were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, we're not posting any
      formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more
      direct impact on gameplay than others.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're posting this for clarification, and
      because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We
      will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats
      affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of
      twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're
      not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after
      the game's been out for more than a year.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anyway, here you go:</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills;
      how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard
      you hit with bows</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">STR: determines how much you can carry;
      influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn
      many offensive skills</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">STA: affects how many hit points you
      have, how long you can hold your breath</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">INT: directly affects how quickly you can
      learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as
      well as shadow knights</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">WIS: affects the amount of mana the
      priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn
      many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHA: affects amount you will be paid for
      goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving
      throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">AGI: affects how quickly you can learn
      some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much
      damage you take when you are hit</font>
