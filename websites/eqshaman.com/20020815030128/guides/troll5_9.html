    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Well me got to level nin at last. It took
    ages cos I was stoopid. So me gonna tell you how not to be stoopid lik Dawnrose. First me
    tell you wots you want to do first.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Spells <br>
    So you now level fiv. You can get loads of gud spells! Now me understand you not rich so
    me tell you wot you shud buy. Well you can get da feet like cat. Dats a gud buff spell
    that helps you bashing and makes udder trolls lik you a lot. Dis you shud buy. You shud
    also get frost rift. It much better spell dan burst of fire. Drowsey is ok me tink. It
    maks tings bash slower so you cast it on dem froggies an dey cant hit you as often.
    Fleeting fury is no gud if you lik bashig tings on your own. But wen you wit udders it gud
    to cast dis on da bestest basher in da group. It makes dem into a death machine! But it
    only last 20 seconds. A great spell is gate. It brings you back to where you were last
    bound. Me liks dis cos I could go running around den jus cast one spell an be back in da
    swamp. It becomes really gud when you get bind affinity but dats not for ages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Don't buy scale skin. Its stoopid an you
    need snake skins to mak it work. You don't need edure fire and spirit pounch yet so if you
    got no money den leave dem for later. Summon drink ok but me a lazy troll an milk is so
    cheep me jus buy dem. Now all dem spells can be bought in Grobb but udder gud spell is
    sicken. For dat you need to find a troll that is standing on a big hand in da swamp. Now
    you gotta be careful cos der are two hands in da swamp. On one is da troll dat sells loads
    of shaman spells but the udder has shadowmen. Dey very bad mojo. Dem da worst tings in da
    swamp an dey lik bashin silly trolls that run up an ask to buy spells.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Sicken is a gud spell dat can mak tings
    sick. It's a DOT wich means it hurts dem over an over again till it wears out or dey fall
    down ded. Wot to fite Okie you redy now. At level fiv an six you want to hunt da froggies
    an da weaker froggy fishermen. Also dem walking mushroons are gud for experience. If you
    are wit som udder trolls you can kill da tougher fishermen an the two froggy guards
    outside guk. On your own you shud wait till level seven before kiling the tougher
    fishermen an guards. Now me only found dis wen I was nearly at level nin but it would be
    really gud for level seven and eite. You goes to the Ferriot. Dats de Ogre newbie zone. In
    one cornor der are loads of skeleton camps. Dey great! No nasty spells an dey don't every
    run (me hates da froggies dat always be running away, me dont lik fast food). Gud fast
    spawn rate means you shud shot up to level eite. Dis is greet level. It greet cos you get
    meditaion! Loads of mana now an da skill shots up real fast.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="1">&nbsp;*** Remember da gloves?***</font></strong><small><br>
    </small><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Remember wen I said to keep all dem
    majik gloves and to buy any you see on da merchants? Well now is da time to make sum reel
    money. You head to the Northern desert of Ro an you auction dem for 4pp. Just auction dem
    as majik gloaves dat let you bash magik tings. You get loads of monks an hummies dat want
    dem. Me sold six of dem da first time I did dis. Now da clever bit dat I forgot wen I did
    dis. Der is anudder spell called flash of lite. No troll or ogre sells it but da clever
    hummie clerics can use it an dey sell it in der big cit. But we cant get der cos hummie
    guards kill trolls just cos we eats hummies. So wots you do is you asks a nice hummie to
    buy it for you (dont eat da hummie as dis can ruin da deal). Dey get da spell an gives it
    to you. Now you can eats dem if you want.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#ffffff" size="1">Level Nin<br>
    You gud and strong now.<br>
    Next stage is from nin to forteen. Me taking you thru datwen I get der.<br>
    Gudhunting!</font></td>
