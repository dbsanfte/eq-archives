Go to the City of Mist and head across the bridge. Open the gate and turn right. Go straight forward through 2 arches. In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall running down its side. Now, you have two options.
<p>
1) Fight your way in. Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull skeletons, etc. from the first door at the base of the temple. Open the door. Inside is another door directly in front of you. Do not open this door, as it leads to top of temple. Look instead to the right, where three skeletons spawn. Pull these skeletons to the courtyard and kill them. Go back into door, head right and you will see a room set below ground level with three phantoms in it, standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms. There are two doors beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to the right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and a small bag on the floor in the left corner. Pick up the bag, which is the High Scale Icon. Gate out or fight out.
<p>
2) Run in, grab the scale, and run out. First of all memorize Spirit of Cheetah and buff yourself and your pet up fully, as your pet will work as a decoy while you rush in. Cast Cheetah and go inside the door. Turn right, go past the skeletons, and look for the three phantoms on a raised dais below ground level. Go past the phantoms and through the left door. Grab the scale, and leave the way you came.
<p>
NOTE: If you are using the running method you may want to have a practice run (cast Cheetah, check out the area inside the temple, and then zone out). This way you will have a better chance at survival.
