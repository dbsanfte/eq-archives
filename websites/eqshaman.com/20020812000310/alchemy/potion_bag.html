To make 5 charge or 10 charge potions you will need to have a Bear Skin Potion Bag. I keep one in the bank at all times. The bag is made through tailoring, here is the recipe:<p>

2 spiderling silks = silk thread (Tailoring Trivial 15) <br>
3 silk threads = silk cord (Tailoring Trivial 26)   <br>
thick grizzly bear skin + silk cord = bearskin potion bag  (Tailoring Trivial 68) <p>

The bag is tradable so if you have no tailoring skill get a friend to make one with the materials you gather. The skin is a semi-common drop off grizzlys in West Commons and other zones. <p>

Now make 5 or 10 single charge potions and put them in the bear skin potion bag. The combine is a no-fail combine , meaning you will allways succeed. <p>
