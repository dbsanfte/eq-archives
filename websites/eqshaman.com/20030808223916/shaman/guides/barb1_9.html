    shaman to level 9 - </font><small>Jalia Barbarian Shaman of Veeshan</small></font><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
    Levels 1-4</font></b></font><p><font face="Verdana"><small>You start out
    in Halas, a not very large town but it has just about everything you need. Wander around a
    little and hail the npc's to see if they have anything interesting to say. Some of them
    may want to send you on quests, and some of those quests are simple and useful at the
    early levels. Then, when you've memorized your spells, take the ferry across the lake.
    After your first trip you will probably start doing what most people do, which is to swim
    across. It's usually faster and it increases your swimming skill.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>On the far side you will zone into
    Everfrost. This is your hunting ground, and is divided into two halves. The eastern half
    is the plains, full of nasties that you don't want to go near for several levels yet. Far
    to the east is permafrost, a dungeon for very high level characters; you may notice
    powerful players coming through on occasion because of this.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>The western half of Everfrost is a maze of
    paths that wind between frost-covered hills and chasms. This is the newbie area, with
    Halas on the north end and Blackburrow on the south. It's easy to get lost out here; there
    are not a lot of players about, and there are many things for you to kill. It's an
    excellent place to hunt. Everything except the spiders and skeletons are agressive and
    will attack without provocation, especially gnolls and goblins. You can get in over your
    head very quickly, and you can get lost easily if you wander. Stay close to home for the
    first couple of levels... you will find yourself running for the guards with a sizeable
    train following at some point. Gnolls and goblins carry money and sometimes sacks and
    backpacks or other good loot, so kill them when you can, and kill any skeleton that
    carries a weapon, especially a staff. The merchants by the tents in the cavern will give
    you a good price for them.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>I strongly suggest teaming with at least
    one other player, even when you're starting out. The beasties will gang up on you, so you
    need to gang up on them. At some point you're going to find yourself waist-deep in polar
    bears, wolves, goblins, and gnolls, and you'll need help taking them all down. Don't be
    shy -- ask others, especially those of about your level, if they'd like to team up. It's
    for your own safety, and theirs as well. Just two players of 3rd to 5th level can wade
    through a pile of beasties without too much trouble, especially if one is a shaman.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Going solo, even at 5th level, is more of a
    risk. I can't stress enough that you will, at times, be battling 3-6 beasties at once.
    Multiple polar bear cubs can wear down even a 5th level character who's soloing.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Save those ruined bear pelts, and if you
    don't take up tailoring, find someone who has. There is no excuse for a barbarian to not
    have a set of patchwork armor by 6th level at least; polar bear cubs are everywhere and
    drop pelts a lot, so the raw materials are more plentiful than anywhere else that I know
    of.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Level 5</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>You get new spells, including Frost Blast
    (which will immediately replace your flame blast as your preffered direct damage spell)
    and Gate, which instantly transports you back to where you spawn when you die. What's not
    so cool about this is that, for a fifth level shaman, it will cost more than half of your
    mana to cast, and may well fizzle out. Practice it a lot. It will allow you to not worry
    about getting lost, but it isn't a great way to excape a battle at this level. There is
    also the spell Sicken, a direct damage/poison spell which you can't get in Halas but you
    CAN get out on the plains. It's well worth it, but this might be a dangerous journey for a
    5th level shaman. Ask a more powerful shaman about where to find it and how to get there
    safely.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Gnoll pups, goblin whelps, and decaying
    skeletons are no longer worth experience points. Unfortunately, bears, wolves, and spiders
    don't carry weapons or cash, so you may find yourself killing the smaller monsters anyway.
    More powerful gnolls and goblins can be found, but not easily and not a great number of
    them. Until you reach sixth level, it's still a good idea to take on every bear cub and
    wolf that you find.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Levels 6-7</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>You can now wander the newbie area without
    fear, but will find precious little worth killing, just the occasional wooly spider or
    goblin scout. It's time for you to move on, and this means either to Blackburrow or to
    Qeynos Hills, on the other side of Blackburrow. If you group with others, you might brave
    the Everfrost plains, but there are lots of nasties out there than can chew through a 6th
    level shaman in a hurry. If alone, I reccoment killing the four gnoll guards that spawn at
    the entrance to Blackburrow, or hunting in Qeynos Hills. Otherwise, you should group. I
    also travelled to Western Karana at this level (very dangerous) and the Toxxilia forest
    near Erudin (across the water, you will need to group to hunt there and there are few
    players about to group with). Basically these are really difficult levels to get through,
    you just have to persevere.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Levels 8-9</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>When you reach level 8, make a trip back to
    Halas and put one practice point into Meditate. You will be ever so grateful to have this
    skill! At this point, you are going to want to save all of the money you can just to buy
    the 9th level spells once you get there. You can hunt in Western Karanas or on the
    Everfrost plains with a little more confidence at this level, but the best loot will come
    from the gnolls in Blackburrow, and you need the cash. Group if you can, and if you're
    desperate for cash, bash on gnoll pups and goblin welps/scouts. You won't get experience,
    buy you'll raise the capital you need for your spells.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>When you reach 9th level you will get some
    very nice spells. Spirit of Wolf is a very cool spell; you can make friends everywhere you
    go by casting this spell, and you can earn money. More importantly, you can run from all
    of the nasties out on the plains or in Western Karana, save the dreaded hill giant. You
    can hunt with confidence now, even kite a little. Also you'll get Tainted Breath out on
    the plains (your first serious Damage over Time spell, although still not that great), and
    if you go to Qeynos and have a human friend buy for you, you can get Serpent Sight. You
    will never need a lantern or torch again.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Once you've gotten a bubble into 9th level,
    you are more than ready to make that trip to Rivervale, Freeport, or even the far
    continent of Faydwer. As a precaution, bank any possessions you can't afford to lose, then
    cast spirit of the wolf and run run run! The further you get from Halas, the fewer shaman
    you'll find, and the easier it will be to group with other players. However, if you only
    get as far as Rivervale and Misty Thicket, you will at least have found a great place to
    hunt for the next two to four levels. Have fun!</small></font></p>
