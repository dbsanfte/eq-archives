      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone
      has their own theory on the best way to play a given race / class
      combination. I make no claims other than this is how I played my
      character. I am currently a level 18 Barbarian Shaman with 450PP in the
      bank. I have 2 magical weapons, full banded armor and every one of my
      spells. This has been achieved in just over 5 days of playing time. Is
      this good? I really don’t know. I’m telling you this as an indicator
      of where my character is at currently. It’s up to you to decide if
      it’s good or not and if this is the path for you.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
      only thing to consider when creating your character is how to distribute
      your 30 skill points. I put 10 into charisma for a total of 75 and the
      other 20 into wisdom for a total of 100. Your wisdom has a direct impact
      on how much mana you have, so many people will tell you to put all of your
      skill points into wisdom. I chose to put 10 points into my charisma for
      two reasons: cost of items and impact on future charm-type spells.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Items
      that you are buying will cost less, and items that you are selling will
      sell for a greater value the higher charisma you have. Will 10 points make
      a huge difference? Not really (though it does help a little), but when you
      reach level 14 and get your first charisma spell, you’ll really notice
      the difference.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
      befriend animal and charm spells are also directly related to your
      charisma. The higher charisma, the longer the spells will hold. While I
      have yet to achieve the level needed for these spells, I’m sure I’ll
      be glad I put those 10 points into charisma. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before even starting
      your character, learn how the /LOC command works. Forget sense heading as
      the /LOC command is much more powerful. Besides, the clouds in every zone
      in Everquest move west, so you can tell which way you’re heading
      anytime.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here’s a quick
      description of the LOC command - Basically, when you get a LOC (by typing
      /loc) you’re presented with a set of three numbers. They will looks
      something like this – 1682.25 678.12 37.89.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You are only concerned with the first two numbers before the
      decimal, 1682 and 678.</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
      first number, 1682 is your north / south location. The second number, 678
      is your east / west location. When you go north, the first number goes up
      and when you go south, the first number goes down. Same with the second
      number, except it goes east / west. (the third number is your altitude, I
      think, and was only used for testing, I think, and was supposed to be
      removed but never was, I think)<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now,
      go to one of the many Everquest sites on the internet and check their maps
      section. Find a map of Halas, Everfrost, Blackburrow, Qeynos Hills, North
      Qeynos, South Qeynos and West Karana with loc numbers and print them out.
      This will help you from getting lost and make learning areas much easier.
      Everfrost in particular is very easy to get lost in. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another
      important thing to do is to program one of your hotbuttons for the /LOC
      command. Anytime you think you might get killed, hit that button. Scroll
      up and look at your /LOC when you die and you will be able to find your
      body easily. There is nothing more annoying than someone /shouting every
      minute “can someone help me find my corpse?” They should have learned
      how to use /LOC.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another
      important thing to do is in your display settings. Click options and
      display. Change the “same resolution” setting to yes and change your
      resolution to the highest setting your 3D card can handle (800X600 for
      Voodoo2 and 1024X768 for TNT2 – the only cards I have used). Also, set
      your clipping plane all the way to the right. If the game runs really slow
      at this point, reduce the clipping plane until it gets back to normal. My
      366 has no problems at all.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now,
      hit the F10 key and you will go into full screen mode. This enhances the
      game greatly, not only because you can play the game full screen, but also
      because it allows you to see more of your surroundings. Important for
      those MOBs sneaking up on you.<o:p>

      want to drag the following buttons to your hot buttons: persona, spell
      book, sit, melee 1, bash skill button and anything else you think you
      might need. Also, don’t forget that /LOC button. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will start in the
      city of Halas. Find your guild (by using the maps you printed out). Follow
      the hallway all the way to the back room. The woman in the middle is your
      guild master and that’s who you give your guild letter to. Memorize your
      inner fire and minor healing spells. Next, find the person who sells level
      one spells. See how much burst of flame is going to cost you and remember
      that amount. Put one training point into one hand blunt and head toward
      Everfrost.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you leave Halas,
      you’ll have to cross a body of water. You can either swim or take the
      raft. My advice to you is to swim as it’s an easy way to increase your
      swimming skill. You’ll get your swimming skill into the 30’s or 40’s
      just by doing swimming back and forth across this lake.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you zone into
      Everfrost, you’ll come out in an area that has two tents with merchants.
      Left of these tents is the pathway into Everfrost Peaks. You’ll notice
      two guards half way down the path protecting the fine citizens of Halas
      from outside invasion (or something like that). These guards will be your
      best friend for the next 5 levels.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you follow the
      pathway, it will eventually come out into Everfrost Peaks. Walk out into
      the open area where the local MOBs are walking back and forth, right in
      front of the pathway. You will want to focus on polar bear cubs, ice
      goblin whelps, wooly spiders, decaying skeletons and gnoll pups. Don’t
      kill the wolves, as the reward is not worth the risk. Also, don’t leave
      this area. Keep inner fire on you at all times as well.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kill any MOB listed
      above walking alone. Don’t attack if there are other like-creatures
      close by as they will gang up on you. Wait until you get one alone, attack
      it and run up the pathway a little bit to get out of the traffic. Kill it
      and repeat. If you get in trouble, and at this level I consider trouble
      down to a bubble of health, run to the guards and they will kill it for
      you. Also, be sure to kill anything that carries a staff. Cracked staves
      sell for over 1PP to vendors.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Keep the following
      – skeleton bones, polar bear pelts (not ruined, the white polar belt
      pelts) and wooly fungus. Sell everything else.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first 2hB weapon
      you get from a kill, keep it and alternate using it with your club. This
      will keep your 1hb and 2hb skill levels up as you level. There’s a sever
      penalty if you try to learn a new weapon skill at a higher level, so keep
      this up.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As soon as you get
      enough money for burst of flame, head back to Halas and buy it. We will
      now change your hunting technique a little. Stand just inside the pathway
      leading to the guards. You are far enough away from the traffic where they
      won’t bother with you. Find a MOB by itself and cast burst of flame on
      it. It will singe for 5 points of damage and come running to you. This is
      called pulling and is a much safer way to hunt. Kill it, pull another one
      and keep doing this over and over.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buy all of your
      spells as soon as you get the money. I’ll leave it up to you as to how
      you use those spells, but you will find a use for all of them. So make
      sure you get them all.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Polar Bear pelts
      should be given (given, not sold to) to Cindl in Mac’s Kilts. She will
      give you money, EXP and a piece of patchwork armor. This is a great lower
      level quest, and a great way to get your armor. If you don’t have that
      piece of armor, wear it. If you already have it, sell it back to her.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you stand outside
      your guild, there will be a guy (can’t remember his name) standing in
      the corner outside the guild to your left. Talk with him and you will get
      the wooly fungus quest. He will give you as jar to collect 8 of these.
      Combine 8 in the jar and return it to him for money, EXP and a spell. This
      is another great quest. Get another jar when you turn one in, and sell any
      spells you get duplicates of.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buy a backpack as
      soon as you can afford one, and keep your bones in it. Halas has a lot of
      decaying skeletons and you’ll soon have quite a collection of bones.
      I’ll explain why later.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is what you will
      do for the first three levels, and they will go by pretty fast. When you
      get level 4, you can afford to head out a into the peaks a little more,
      but don’t get too far as it’s easy to get lost. Also, at level 4, be
      sure to put a skill point into channeling at the guild. This skill will go
      up by itself and helps in keeping your concentration while casting spells.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At level 5, you get

      merchant is located on the opposite side of the platform. Get your spells

      head to the Blackburrow entrance and kill the stronger gnolls that guard
      the entrance. Don’t get too cocky however; be sure to con them all first
      before attacking. Their levels can vary and you don’t want to run into
      one two levels higher than you. Continue to kill everything and gate back

      isn’t actually that difficult, but the chance of getting killed by a

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Qeynos Hills (QH),
      hunt anything that cons even or lower to you. Most everything will still

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By this time, you
      should have saved up a lot of those bone chips. You have two choices here.
      First off, find a Necromancer in the zone, the higher the better. You can
      either sell him a stack of chips (20) for 1 or 2 PP (you’ll have an
      easier time selling them for 1pp), or do what I did. Save a backpack full
      for a total of 160 chips, and offer them directly to any Necromancer
      higher than 10<sup>th</sup> level. I generally charge 12PP per backpack of
      chips, but I have also gotten 15PP per pack on occasion. This is a great
      moneymaker and bone chips are easy to come by, especially in Everfrost. I
      still do this into my 18<sup>th</sup> level. Kill skeletons, save bones,
      and sell a pack full for 12PP.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Get to know QH well.
      Walk around and con everything. Kill everything you can. Go to the ruins
      and kill regular skeletons when you can, just be careful of the Putrid
      Skeletons and Dread Corpses. Kill them too when you can, but that will be
      a few levels yet.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      out for rabid wolves. Kill those and keep their putrid pelts. You’ll
      also notice rabid grizzlies running around. You can’t kill them yet, but
      when you can, you’ll be spending a lot of time doing so (see levels 9
      – 14). In the mean time, take those putrid wolf pelts into North Qeynos
      (NQ). In the Temple of Life, you’ll find a ramp leading up to a
      teleporter. Run into the teleporter and find Priestess Clauria (or
      something close to that). Give her those putrid wolf pelts for some coin

      can use that meditate button when looking at your spell book, speeding up
      the time required to scribe spells and lessening the time to regain lost
      mana.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just keep doing this
      and you’ll be able to make levels rather quickly. Be sure to use your
      sicken spell when you’re battling those harder creatures. It will
      greatly speed up their deaths.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Levels
      9 – 14:<o:p>

      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Level 9. This is it.
      You get SOW and your life changes forever. Gate back to Halas and buy all
      your spells. Remember the poison / disease spells are in the plains at the
      ruins. Sense animals can be bought in Surefall Glade. Spirit sight can be
      bought in he mage guild in South Qeynos, though you’ll have to get
      someone to buy it for you.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Keep yourself SOWd at
      all times. Don’t go into a battle without it. Also, you can offer it as
      an auction for donation. Some people will pay 5PP for a SOW. You’ll
      often see people asking for a SOW and willing to donate. Never pass that
      chance up. Immediately offer your services and run to where they are to
      claim the donation.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The next important
      spell is tainted breath. Again, this will help kill a creature much
      quicker.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now you will start to
      make quick XP and money. This is the best quest in the game in my opinion
      and I am still doing it on occasion at level 18! The rabid grizzly quest.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you out from the
      Blackburrow entrance, you’ll notice a small rise on your left. Over that
      rise is a valley of sorts that runs all the way to the guard tower. This
      is the main spawning grounds for the rabid grizzly. Two other spawning
      points are across the road on the other side of QH, between the river and
      newbie area in the hills.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Con any rabid grizzly
      you see and if it’s even, attack it. Use your sicken and tainted breath
      spells (they stack) and melee it. Keep the skin, heal, meditate, and find
      another one to kill. Their spawn times will change from day to day, so if
      there are none around, kill rabid wolves and anything else you can.
      Remember to keep killing at all times.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take those rabid bear
      hides to the same Priestess in the Temple of Life you gave the putrid wolf
      hides to. At level 9, I was getting almost a full bubble of XP, 1 – 2PP
      and a spell scroll per hide! This is by far the quickest way to level!
      I’ve turned in 7 pelts at a time (sometimes you get lucky), made 12PP
      and made the next level! I went from level 9 to 14 quicker than I went
      from 8 – 9. This just cannot be beat! Never stop hunting rabid
      grizzlies.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The server I am on
      has very little people so the hunting was never crowded. You may have a
      harder time if your server is crowded and everyone is trying to hunt the
      rabid griz.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I went from a couple
      PP to over a hundred during this time. As soon as you can, upgrade your
      club to a better weapon. I bought a morning star for 13PP from the monk
      guild in North Qeynos. Just always try to have the best weapon you can
      afford. Also, now is the time to start buying banded armor when you can
      afford it to replace what you have. Banded usually sells for 1PP per AC,
      with volume discounts given if bought in a set.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can also head
      into the Qeynos aqueduct system anytime and kill the injured rat for the
      +5hp earrings. There’s some other nice items to be had down there, and
      guides are available on the internet on how to hunt in the aqueducts.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you get a group,
      you can head over to West Karana and hunt bigger game, but this is in no
      way is as beneficial as the rabid grizzly.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This should quickly
      get you to level 14.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Levels
      14-18:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Level 14 you get your
      next spells. Buy all of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Invisibility
      to Animals can be bought in Surefall Glade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Poison / disease spells are in the plains of Everfrost.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Continue to kill
      rabid grizzlies. In the down time, head to West Karana and kill bigger
      game. You can also head into Blackburrow now feeling relatively safe,
      though you still have to be careful.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blackburrow has two
      levels of gnolls. Regular gnolls and hard gnolls. Regular gnolls, like the
      burly, patrolling and guardsman gnolls will leave you alone at this level.
      The elite guardsman, commanders and brewers are what you are after. Kill
      them carefully for XP and good loot. Don’t be afraid to run if you get
      in trouble. SOW will save you and prevent you from dying by getting you to
      the zone.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another good way to
      make money is by killing bandits in WK in a group. Bandits drop bronze
      weapons sometimes, worth 1 – 3 PP each, and human bandits drop bandit
      sashes. Bandit sashes can be turned into Chesgard at the Paladin guild for
      XP, coin and a weapon, sometimes a bronze. Sell the bronze for money to a
      merchant.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, during these
      levels, kill higher level gnolls in Blackburrow, keep on the rabid grizzly
      and do big game and bandits in WK. This will make you a lot of money and
      get you good, quick XP.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another thing you
      should do is get yourself a magical weapon. Around this area, it’s easy
      to get a Bloodforge hammer for 20 – 20 PP. As soon as you get one, start
      also killing willowisps (they require a magical weapon to hit).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Willowisps drop one
      of three things. Burned out lightstone, lightstone or greater lightstone.
      Destroy and burned out lightstone you get. Sell and lightstone you get.
      Keep any greater lightstone (GLS) you get.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I saved up two
      backpacks full of GLSs. In North Karana, there is a gypsy camp with a
      merchant named Myrissa (or something close to that). Give her the GLS one
      at a time and she will give you XP, coin and a book. Sell the book back to
      her for about 8PP each. Another great moneymaker. That’s over 128PP for
      two backpacks full of GLSs!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You’ll hear people
      talk about willowisp island (Erud’s Crossing) and how great it is to
      hunt willowisps there. Forget it. I spent a few days there but had much
      better luck in QH and WK. Don’t waste your time.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Phew! That’s a lot
      to read. This is what I have done thus far and it seems to have done well
      for me. In no way do I make any claims that this is the best way to play
      your character in EQ. It worked great for me, and should work great for
      you also, but you may find your path goes a different direction.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

      questions or comments, you can email me at <a href="mailto:stinger@mtco.com">stinger@mtco.com</a>.
      Also, I didn’t take the time to proofread this because it’s too long,
      so no flames in that department please.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
