      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=-1><STRONG>The Three Books of Lord 
      Ghiosk</STRONG><BR><BR>You must kill Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist and 
      bring the three books drops to a<BR>Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald 
      Jungle. Reports indicate he's no slouch, so<BR>bring 3 full groups of your 
      uber friends (level 55 +) to the party.<BR><BR>The Three Books Lord Ghiosk 
      drops (accurate Iksar translation):<BR><BR>Book 1<BR>Neh Ashiir's 
      disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have 
      a<BR>saying that goes "Neh's chances". We all know this is used to define 
      an innumerable<BR>variable but not many know of its relation to the event 
      in the early years of our fair city.<BR>For as many people as there were 
      in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Neh<BR>Ashiir's 
      disappearance. Others say there were political tensions between the queen 
      and<BR>her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for 
      good measure a few<BR>pointed to the stars and said that people from 
      beyond the sky took her. One thing all<BR>agreed upon however is that the 
      relationship between the royal couple was decaying.<BR>Political 
      scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two that implied 
      a<BR>separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie 
      the highly<BR>publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as 
      Kirn left the city only a<BR>few weeks before. It is recorded in many 
      texts that the visage of Rak' Ashiir reflected<BR>his despair over his 
      wife's vanishing although it is a well known fact that it was mostly<BR>an 
      act played by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one 
      day we will<BR>find the truth but at this point it would mean little to 
      the public.<BR><BR>Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log<BR>1. New wash 
      basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster 
      and<BR>place the order tomorrow.<BR>2. The chandelier in the main hall was 
      finally repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to<BR>the contract holder 
      tomorrow.<BR>3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 
      dozen finely made vials.<BR>What they are for he would not explain and was 
      very firm that I do this as quickly as<BR>possible. Best to make haste to 
      fulfill the order, rumours abound of the Advisor's<BR>mastery of the 
      arcane.<BR>4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no 
      explanation for the shortage<BR>of wax says our civilian contract holder. 
      Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort<BR>with the next pick up 
      crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure 
      the<BR>symbolism.<BR>5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's 
      Icon to the church as discretely as<BR>possible. If Rak Ashiir returns 
      from his journey early and discovers it was found in the<BR>royal bedroom 
      it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it 
      ourselves<BR>with the help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our 
      contacts in the church. The<BR>less people that know of this the better. 
      It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant<BR>who found it within the 
      sheets.<BR><BR>Book 3<BR>Throughout the history of the High Scale it was 
      common for the knights to practice<BR>complete celibacy. It wasn't until 
      the controversial Kirn was given the hallowed title<BR>that contact 
      between the sexes became tolerated. While Kirn wasn't the mightiest of 
      the<BR>High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name 
      of our Lord of<BR>Fear. One being the battle known as the Bone Rending 
      when Kirn lost his fabled whip,<BR>Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able to 
      defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only.<BR>Before this battle 
      many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a leader and 
      patriot<BR>for the people.<BR>However Kirn's might and his lecture on the 
      use of females in religious crusade and<BR>duty convinced the public that 
      celibacy had its place in divinity but non-celibacy also<BR>had a place 
      and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kirn among many 
      women<BR>was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign 
      although his corpse was<BR>never brought back for burial as it was lost 
      far across the ocean among distant brothers<BR>on 
      faith.<BR><BR><STRONG>Bring the three books Lord Ghiosk drops to a Spirit

      says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we 
      thought. It<BR>also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of 
      affair with Neh. We have little but<BR>speculation at this point, so 
      making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding 
      the<BR>resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really 
      happened. We suspect the icon<BR>mentioned in this log could now be 
      located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to<BR>Kirn, 
      wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards.<BR>Your faction
