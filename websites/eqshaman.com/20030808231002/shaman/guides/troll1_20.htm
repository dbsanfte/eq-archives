        Tactician's Guide v1.0 by Dirtforke</b></font></td>

      <tr vAlign="top">
        <td><font face="Verdana"><small>Greetings all. Since there seems to be a
        need for Shaman tactical guides, I decided that I would sit down and write one. I have
        finally reached the 19th level of enlightenment, and let me tell you, things only get
        better from here. All levels before 19 were utterly hellish, but now I can truly see the
        power of the Shaman, the Troll Shaman, coming to light.</small></font><p><font
        face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>I. Why choose a Troll Shaman?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>1. Regeneration. Regeneration is truly an
        awesome ability to have. It allows you to rely significantly less on healing for yourself,
        and more on the healing and buffing of others in your group, or offensive spells if you
        are solo. It is VERY nice to have when kiting the enemy, or simply running from a fight
        when low on health. Also, Regeneration and Chloroplast spells at later levels DO STACK on
        your existing Troll Regen. Cannibalize takes away 50 hit points and gives you 25 mana.
        Having fast hit point recovery is a vital advantage to the Shaman for the purpose of
        casting more and better spells.</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>2. Infravision. Ogres get this as well, and
        it is an invaluable benefit. One less buff you will have to cast on yourself.</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>3. Great stats. I personally think Trolls
        have the most efficient stats for a shaman. Shamans need to be strong and have stamina,
        but no where near as much as an Ogre has. Put as many points as possible into Wisdom, this
        should get you a 95 - not bad at all - and the rest into Agility and Dexterity. Your
        Strength and Stamina will be over 100 by default - more than enough for a priest class,
        and high enough to get you a decent bonus to your damage and hit points at later levels. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>4. Cooler look. If you're an Ogre, you're
        just an oversized, obese, ugly humanoid. If you're a Troll, you've got big floppy ears,
        long pointy nose, and lots of chest detail down to that pot belly. We don't look nearly as
        stupid (facial expressions) as Ogres do; on the contrary many of our facial expressions
        are conivial and sly, even sinister. This is my opinion of course; others may differ. ;)</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>5. Better newbie area. Now, I've never
        actually BEEN an Ogre, I'll be the first to admit that. But, Innothule Swamp is an
        excellent newbie area, with lots of things to kill. We're also closer to the Orc camps of
        Southern Ro. I've been to the Ferrott and it just doesn't look that good for anyone past
        level 5. Running and swimming through the swamps here is excellent for raising your
        Swimming skill without even thinking about it. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>II. How does the Shaman solo?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>In my opinion, the Shaman stands right
        behind the Druid as the best all-around solo class in the game, and at later levels
        probably surpasses them in terms of raw damage dealing power. We don't get their teleport
        spells, but we DO get Spirit of the Wolf and Spirit of the Cheetah for the speed that is
        key to both escaping and kiting your opponent, as well as excellent &quot;Damage Over
        Time&quot; spells. Here's a breakdown of what you'll be doing all the way to Level 20:</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>1. Level 1-5:</b> You'll be in the
        swamps of Innothule, killing froglok tads, lesser kobolds, and moss snakes. Like most
        priest classes, you start with a protective magic and a healing spell. Inner Fire, and
        Minor Healing. There is a Shaman quest in Grobb you should do to acquire a free Burst of
        Flame spell. Yay! By the way, another Shaman showed me a really neat trick: You can use
        the spell Inner Fire to heal yourself! When you cast Inner fire, it gives you 20 hit
        points for 10 mana, a very efficient spell indeed! In addition, it is an Abjuration spell,
        a skill which is generally slow in getting up because it is not cast as frequently as
        other spell types. Minor Heal gives you 12 hit points for 10 mana. Of course, you'll still
        want to cast Minor Heal frequently, to get that Alteration skill up. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>2. Levels 5-9:</b> Frogloks are your
        main quarry at this point, both regular and the froglok fishermen. Mushroom-man trackers
        and water moccasins also. Around Level 7 or 8 you might try taking out the guards at the
        gates to Guk. As you go deeper into the swamp beware of kobold hunters, froglok foragers,
        and the dreaded Jojo: a very high level kobold that will eat you for lunch. You will
        probably want to find the large, stone hand out in the swamp. It is here that both Troll
        and Ogre Shamans can purchase their disease and poison spells, which are the mainstays of
        a Shaman's offensive potential. At level 9 you will get Spirit of Wolf, a key element to
        safe movement throughout most parts of Norrath. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>3. Levels 10-14:</b> At these levels
        many Trolls will start thinking about going to South Ro, Oasis, and North Ro. At level 14,
        you receive Spirit Strike, a decent direct damage spell. Combine this with Tainted Breath
        (poison spell), and Spirit of Wolf, and you have a moderately effective way of kiting a
        creature. Here are some effective combinations with these spells:</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>a. Root and Blast: Do like the wizards do.
        Root your opponent, hope like heck that it holds them in place, and lay into them with
        Spirit Strikes. You should be able to get in 3, maybe 4, at level 14, doing 250 points of
        damage. Beware, however, that your spells will fizzle more often than you would like.
        Fortunately, Verant made some recent modifications to fizzle so that one or two fizzles do
        not completely screw you.</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>b. Root, Disease, Poison, Blast: While the
        level 5 Sicken spell is a poor man's disease spell, it is effective in virtually stopping
        your opponent's hit point recuperation. It is very low mana and casts fairly quickly. Once
        cast, Sicken makes your Tainted Breath spell that much more effective, since your opponent
        won't be regenerating 1 or 2 hp per tick. After Sicken and Tainted Breath have been cast,
        use your remaining mana to blast. If you have a little mana left, you might want to cast
        another Tainted breath near the end of the fight to insure your opponent's fate. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>c. Root, Disease, Poison, Kite: Kiting for
        a Shaman really isn't very effective until Level 24. Kiting for a Troll or Ogre Shaman can
        be particularly difficult and dangerous because you are killed on sight by merchants and
        other NPCs you might run by during the kite. Before you kite, always know the zone you are
        kiting in EXTREMELY well.</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Always try to kite somewhat near the zone
        exit, because it is fairly common for things to go wrong. For obvious reasons, always be
        fully buffed with Spirit of Wolf and all other buffs you normally use. At level 14, the
        buffs I consistently used were Inner Fire, Feet like Cat, Turtle Skin, and of course,
        Spirit of Wolf. <br>
        <br>
        You can start out your kite with a Root, or just lay into it with a Disease spell right
        away. Root is a double-edged sword. If it works, then you'll PROBABLY have time to hit
        them with disease, poison, and a blast or two before you start running. If it doesn't
        work, then you'll have wasted 30 precious mana and have the monster chasing you already.
        The tricky part when you're running away is getting your spells off before they pound you.
        It's not that a little pounding is bad for a Troll Shaman. On the contrary, Shamans can
        take quite a beating, but even as a Troll Shaman your hit points are not going be anywhere
        near those of a melee class. You have to time it somewhat carefully because you need to
        stop, be motionless for 2 seconds, and then cast. If your spell is out of range when you
        try to cast it, don't worry --- keep clicking that spell button! By the time that creature
        comes within range of your spells it will be only a few seconds before it is upon you.
        Those precious few seconds are the time it will take for you to get off your spell, and
        start running again. When the creature is almost dead, you can turn around to engage
        directly. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>4. Levels 15-20: </b>You'll be killing
        crocs and orcs in Oasis, orcs and gnolls in Highpass, kodiaks in West Commons, and
        possibly heading into a few dungeons here and there. Actually, I waited on entering any
        dungeon until I was level 19 and had the regular Healing spell. At level 19, you will
        receive the first of your powerful disease spells. This one, Affliction, does roughly 300
        points damage: 25 initial, and 5 points per tick to 300. Remember, since mobs regenerate 1
        hit point per tick, this effectively makes it 4 hit points per tick. Kiting can be made
        much more effective with this spell. You also get a couple of resistance debuffs: Malise
        and Insidious Fever. These aren't really that useful, however, until you have the mana to
        cast them. At level 24 you will get a nice poison spell (Envenomed Breath), which, in
        combination with the full length of Affliction, do around 500 damage to your opponent
        while you run around at a safe distance from them. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b>FACTION: </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Troll Shamans have advantages and
        disadvantages to their race. The biggest disadvantage by far is the KOS, or Killed on
        Sight, factor. You MUST CON EVERYTHING in a new, previously unexplored area. If they scowl
        at you, and are 'ready to attack', then that creature will attack you, simple as that.
        Once you reach level 34, or so, you may want to take some time to get faction up at
        strategic points around Norrath. These points include High Keep, Qeynos, Halas, and
        possibly Greater Faydark. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>High Pass/High Keep:</b> Ah, the city
        besieged by baddies. Easy to make a name for yourself here killing orcs. Kill enough, and
        you will be able to move through High Keep to East Karana. I wouldn't stop to chat with
        anyone, though. As always, con everything before you make a move in its general direction.
        If you know the way through High Keep to the Karanas already, you should be able to avoid
        merchants, notorious for kicking Troll and Ogre butt when they least expect it. By killing
        the orcs first your faction should rise enough with the guards and the citizens to allow
        you a pass-thru to the Karanas. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>Qeynos:</b> Again, one must pass through
        the Karanas to get here. Actually this one might not be too difficult. You can get to
        South Karana using the Ferrott-Mount Rathe-Lake Rathe route, but again, there is a bridge
        to cross. The place to increase Qeynos faction would be Black Burrow, I am sure. Kill lots
        and lots and lots of gnolls! </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>Greater Faydark: </b>You probably don't
        have to bother with this, but if you're ever in this zone, know that it is patrolled by
        the Wood Elf guards, and you never know where you might see one wandering. Kill lots of
        orcs near and in Crushbone to raise faction enough to wander this zone somewhat safely. </small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small><b>Halas: </b>You get here by travelling
        through Black Burrow, and I believe you raise faction by killing Ice Goblins en masse. It
        actually would be nice for a Troll or Ogre Shaman to be able to make a pit stop here and
        pick up spells and alchemy supplies. Also, Permafrost is a good dungeon, supposedly
        improved upon in recent updates with better equipment and more and varied monsters. </small><br>
        </font><small><font face="Verdana"><br>
        </font></small><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Shaman Summary:</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>Shamans are powerful. They can:</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>1. Summon food and drink for themselves or
        others.<br>
        2. Levitate over water or mountains, or cast levitate on others.<br>
        3. Breathe underwater indefinitely with Enduring Breath (or cast this on others).<br>
        4. Run faster than everyone else (except Druids and Bards) with Spirit of the Wolf, and
        later, Spirit of the Cheetah.<br>
        5. Wear chainmail armour, as well as certain kinds of magical plate at later levels
        (Druids can't!). <br>
        6. Summon a magical pouch for heavy items to be contained in. (They have no weight while
        in this pouch!)<br>
        7. Cast invisibilty to animals, and regular invisibility at later levels. <br>
        8. Cast some of the BEST buffs in the game. <br>
        9. Cast good &quot;damage over time spells, and some of the BEST damage over time spells
        in the game at later levels.<br>
        10. Summon pets (wolf spirits) at later levels (34+).<br>
        11. Amazing regenerative powers at later levels, both for mana and for hit points!</small></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana"><small>There will be other and better Shaman
        guides written by others, I am sure. I am only level 19 right now, but as I rise into the
        upper ranks I will update this document further with new strategies for this awesome,
        well-balanced class!</small></font></p>
