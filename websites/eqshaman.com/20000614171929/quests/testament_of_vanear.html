      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the
      top floor of the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to
      fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or
      Vasty Deep Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The librarian tells you she doesn't have it
      but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it
      out.&nbsp; When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out
      the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for
      crimes against the state.&nbsp; He tells you to go talk to his sister who
      is in the Erudin Palace.&nbsp; Once there, she says to meet her just
      outside the hotel in town to talk to her.&nbsp; When you meet her, she
      explains that her brother is still alive.&nbsp; Her brother is at Crows&nbsp;
      (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.&nbsp; This is a
      side quest). <br>
      <br>
      <b>Here is where you start.</b><br>
      &nbsp;Ask him about The Testament of Vanear.&nbsp; He says yes he has it
      and will sell it to me for 2 gold.&nbsp; If you give him the 2 gold he
      gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in
      it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30
      and 34 and the book is worthless without them.&nbsp; He also says that the
      thief sold the pages to someone named Ran.&nbsp; If you then ask him who
      Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.&nbsp;
      If you go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you
      that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but
      that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard
      and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could &quot;feel
      it&quot;. He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell
      it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you
      will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you
      come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which
      is Dyllin Starsine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a
      sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).&nbsp;
      Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.&nbsp; Faction
      hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos,
      -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)&nbsp; The faction hits
      for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially slipping
      to KOS in Qeynos.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page
      34.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart
      of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I
      get it because the work is fiction anyway.&nbsp; He then offers to play a
      game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if
      that one card is a jester he will give you the page.&nbsp; Along with the
      jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island
      for a reward].&nbsp; Once the whole thing is combined you get the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics6/Testament_of_Vanear.html">Testament
      of Vanear</a>, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop
      lore item.&nbsp; You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
      the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. (NOTE:&nbsp;
      I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn
      2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot
      book of the testament of Vanear.&nbsp; Once you get the book, you can
      combine the page you get from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the
      other page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and you've got the book!&nbsp; No
      need to go to Erudia.&nbsp; And because Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one
      of the sewer entrances, evil races could sneak in and get the book, too.</font><small><font face="Verdana"><br>
