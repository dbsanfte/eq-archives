<b>The First Law:</b>  Know Thyself  (do your research - there are quite a few online resources for quests and strategies; save yourself the time and the embarassment of calling constantly in ooc where something is.  It's much easier and more satisfying to play the game this way)
<p>

By now, broodlings, if you have reached for 12 season relatively unscathed, you will have learned what will and will NOT work when it comes to hunting in our sacred lands.  There are myriad places to hunt and improve your skills, so I shall not detail those except in passing.
<p>
My advice is this:  find a young monk that knows what they are doing, and stick with them, as this will be your main damage dealer and puller.  It would also behoove you to find one of the dark necromancers who is also well schooled.  This is a quite effective trio, at least until you are wise enough in learning to explore beyond the near regions.  The monk is your main damage dealer and puller of monsters, the necromancer can bring a monster low with poison damage over time, fear any unwanted adds, and use their osseous pets, while you can buff, debuff, and add a disease DoT and heal as required.  I am lucky enough to have found this sort of trio, and I have managed to increase my knowledge and experience greatly in a short period of time.
<p>
In a group, your main responsibilities will be to buff, debuff, sow, heal (you can heal, but you are NOT a main healer, so unnecessary risks should be avoided), and med (of course!)  For the most part, your meleeing days are over, and your skills will start to reflect it (miss. miss.  miss.  miss.)  Don't try - it's more important that you sit and keep your main tank and group taken care of.  If there is another healer in your group, you should take it upon yourself to aid them when mobs tend to charge toward them - this will keep the healer from panicking, and let the tank handle anything else.  
<p>
To keep your main tank from suffering from any delusions of grandeur ('Oh look I have two healers: I am invincible!') you must now learn the art of 'selective information'.  If you're at 20 mana, tell the group you are OOM.  If you are at 40, you're at 20.  This will keep the tank from just rushing out in a haze of fast-levelling.  We are shaman, we deal with the spirit world, and can curse or bless as we see fit, but we are NOT wonderful healers.
<p>
<b>PLACES TO HUNT:</b>
<p>
There are a million other sources for places to raise experience, and therefore I will not go into this much, broodlings. I suggest Kurns Tower when you can manage - but keep in mind this place becomes quite crowded rather shortly with elves (why they dare come to our land, I do not know - I've removed a few of them myself *evil grin*).  Failing that, there is always the outer regions, namely behind the tower where monsters lurk (some of these are still yellow at level 17, and therefore decent experience), and you may also find your rogue shamans for cudgel quests hiding in this area.  I would stay in this region until level 20 before exploring LOIO.
<p>
For most people, LOIO is a nightmare; hard to get to, binding is a pain, and the corpse runs are a nightmare.  Not so for the Iksar, especially the shaman.  We can bind wherever we wish, and only the Iksar may bind in Cabalis itself.  However, I would NOT hunt LOIO without good, trusted friends - the Lake can be a rather unpleasant place to hunt otherwise, with hordes of unschooled broodlings and other interloping races running through you screaming with monsters close behind, bickering about hunting places, and doing most irritating things.  However, that aside, note that LOIO is one of the best places to go for 20-25 if you are on your own.  There are also quite a few quests to be done in this region, so at least go here to work on upgrading your cudgels.
<p>
There are surrounding regions which are completely abandoned, and thereofore ideal if you bring your own clan with you.  Swamp of No Hope is a great place to hunt, and you can raise your experience and wisdom in this region well up into the 30th season if you keep your head and explore.  The quests for shackles are also done in this area, and your monk will be well pleased, not to mention bone chips and creatures that are not very resistant to poison, which will make your necromancer friend happy.  Also note that this area is almost never claimed, as my own clan group have hunted here and had the entire region to ourselves.  Quite pleasant.
<p>
If soloing, I would suggest sticking to dark blue monsters as they will still hit quite hard, and it is always possible that your spells will not stick otherwise - and even on dark blue, they tend to resist.  I would suggest finding a relatively clear area, SoWing yourself, casting a slow, then a root, add your DoTs, nuke, then melee the last bits, healing yourself as required.  However, I have not put this much into practice, preferring to have someone else take the damage:  my shaman is wearing ornate chain at the moment, and those dark blue creatures STILL hurt quite a bit.
<p>
<b>A WORD ON SUMMONING:</b>
<p>
You will be a lifesaver to the monk in your group if you get your summon skills up.  Spirit bags are four slot, 100% weight reduction items that will make you monk very happy.  Remind your monk to empty bags before camping however, as the bags will disappear within 30 mins. If a disconnection occurs the bags will stay on for that log, and then will depart, taking everything with it. It is important that the monk remember this.
<p>
Since we can summon food and drink, a shaman should NEVER need to buy either item.  Remember to summon your food and drink before going out into the field.  Another useful habit to get into is fishing - the fish in Cabalis are large and keep for quite some time, always good to have on hand.  
<p>
Do not allow yourself to get behind on summoning items, as the conjuring skill is vital to a shaman.
<p>
<b>DIVINATION and EVOCATION:</b>
<p>
Many a foolish broodling forgets about these skills, considering them to be useless.  These same broodlings find out later in their experience (and to their dismay) that these skills are extremely effacious, and will find themselves turning red with embarassment as they cast invisibility again and again, fizzling all the while.  Do not allow these skills to fall behind.  There is a great way to get these skills up which I shall detail below.
<p>
<b>HOW TO RAISE SKILLS:</b>
<p>
A shaman must have their spells maximized as quickly as possible to prevent embarassing fizzling, and there are several ways to do this.  One, while fishing - as you increase your food stores for later explorations, cast as many spells as you can, draining your mana, and then sitting and fishing to raise meditation skill.  This is a great way to raise your divination skill (I suggest the 'sense animal' which will be helpful in your cudgel questing as well as for hunting - this raises divination nicely).  With evocation, if you sense something while fishing, toss a few bursts of fire upon the animal until it expires.  Cast your line, sense animal, cast line, nuke, rinse repeat.  Not only will you be collecting food as well as fish scales for enduring breath, you will be raising most of your skills at the same time.  You can also do the same while working pottery for your quests - cast while making items, then sit, and continue to combine.
<p>
<b>WHAT TO DO/WHAT TO WEAR:</b>
<p>
If mere camping is becoming tiresome, look into the cudgel quests that all iksar shaman must complete.  They are entertaining and educating, and have the potential for giving you one of the best items in the game to use.  You will need to train a few trade skills, but it would not be amiss to do so when time permits.
<p>
You are probably wearing some rather dull but servicable armour, but after 20 seasons it is time to consider an upgrade.  If you have any coin left after buying all your spells, consider getting chain if you can manage it.  I myself wear ornate chain, and I will upgrading to another type of ornate chain in future.  Do not be concerned with buying any armour with stats on them, as you may be able to find a jeweller who can make you a few things that will assist.  Whenever possible, go for items that possess extra wisdom, and perhaps extra hitpoints, though the latter is not too vital unless you solo often. Also note that with the addition of focus items, some of these pieces will have added effects; (the turtleshell helm increases effectiveness of your healing spell, and a polished bone bracer will cut your mana usage on DoTs, for example).  Seek these out when you can find them.  There is entirely too much equipment in the world for you to get it all, however, so do not try; merely get what will work for you at the time, and keep an eye out now and again for an upgrade when you can find them. 
<p>
<b>FACTION:</b>
<p>
Though the Iksar monk quest has changed so they no longer need to worry about working faction, the Iksar shaman does not have the luxury, and will have to go into some rather unpleasant areas if they wish to complete their epic quests.  Do not rely upon invisibility to save you - for Freeport and other regions, hunting and killing orcs would be ideal; work your faction until the measly humans or other inferior races only glower at you dubiously at you will be able to move about.  If all else fails, SoW, invis, and run.
<p>
This should do you for now.  Fight well, fight true!
