      sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great 
      nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you 
      have done, shaman. You say, 'Who are you?' a lesser spirit says 'What, or 
      who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know 
      more, shaman? <BR>

        <BR></STRONG>a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. 
      It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from 
      the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the 
      land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a 
      shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more 
      of the spirits. </FONT></P>
