      of Fate</STRONG><BR><BR><STRONG>Kirn's Ring<BR></STRONG>Return to the City 
      of Mist and give Kirn's Ring to Neh'Ashiir<BR>Neh`Ashiir says 'Nothing is 
      left to hide now. You shall have the truth. But truth is not won 
      easily<BR>and if you cannot defeat me, you have not the ability to see 
      that vengeance is served. Brace yourself!<BR>Your faction standing with 
      TrueSpirit got better<BR>You gain party experience!!<BR><BR>NOTE: Neh is 
      initially non-agro to all, but will AGRO IMMEDIATELY the<BR>instant you 
      hand her the Ring, so you may not see the above conversation fly by, 
      or<BR>it's possible the conversation has been removed. Just hand her the 
      Ring and kill<BR>then kill her. No conversation is 
      necessary.<BR><BR><STRONG>Neh's Diary</STRONG><BR>Kill Neh'Ashiir and loot 
      her Diary<BR><BR>Neh`Ashiir's Diary:<BR>..another bazaar.. I was asked to 
      judge..wrestling contest. It must have been<BR>the ten thousandth one... 
      .week. Oh how I grow weary of...political<BR>monotony. The earlier days 
      were much..exciting, crusades<BR>against..unworthy and smashing our 
      opposition. Kirn's life must be epic<BR>indeed. He.. at me again during.. 
      match. Hmmmm.<BR><BR><STRONG>Give Neh' Ashiir's Diary to the Spirit 
      Sentinel Wolf at loc: +3685, -640 in 
      Emerald<BR>Jungle</STRONG><BR><BR>NOTE: If you do not give Neh's Diary to 
      the Spirit Sentinel before proceeding to<BR>give the Child's Tear to Lord 
      Rak (see below), you may not have sufficient True<BR>Spirit faction to 
      trigger Lord Rak and may not receive the Iksar Scale needed to<BR>acquire 
      your Spear of Fate, requiring you to make another trip to the Plane 
      of<BR>Fear and secure another Child's Tear from the Golem-spawned 
      Broodling.<BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Rak 
      mourned over the loss of his child instead of<BR>relishing the blessing of 
      his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him 
      in<BR>disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to 
      turn his back on his faith. The<BR>child is the key! If we put the child 
      to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may<BR>be 
      lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take 
      proof of her passing to<BR>Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation 
      crumbling! Now, go!<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got 
      better<BR>You gain experience!!<BR><BR><STRONG>Iksar Child's 
      Tear</STRONG><BR>Proceed to the Plane of Fear and slay the Iksar 
      Child.<BR>The Iksar Child is a level one broodling. However, you must kill 
      a Golem to get the<BR>Child to spawn.<BR><BR>TIP: If your guild is not 
      Fear-ready, try to get into any Fear Raid offering your<BR>buffing 
      services, perhaps even foregoing looting rights in exchange for dibs on 
      the<BR>Tear.<BR><BR><STRONG>Lord Rak's Scale</STRONG><BR>Return to City of 
      Mist and give the Tear to Lord Rak' Ashiir.<BR>NOTE: If you do not give 
      Neh's Diary to the Spirit Sentinel before proceeding to<BR>give the 
      Child's Tear to Lord Rak (see above), you may not have sufficient 
      True<BR>Spirit faction to trigger Lord Rak's agro and may not receive the 
      Iksar Scale<BR>needed to acquire your Spear of Fate, requiring you to make 
      another trip to the<BR>Plane of Fear and secure another Child's Tear from 
      the Golem-spawned<BR>Broodling.<BR><BR>. . . . Lord Rak' Ashiir is 
      initially non-agro to all, but if you have sufficient True<BR>Spirit 
      faction he will AGRO IMMEDIATELY when you turn in the Child's Tear, 
      so<BR>be fully prepped and ready to fight!<BR><BR>IMPORTANT CAUTION: Lord 
      Rak hits with a 2000 hp area affect spell!<BR>Recommended 3 mage fire pets 
      works nicely. Once Rak has spawned from the<BR>Reaver:<BR>1) Park the 
      questing shaman and the mage fire pets around Lord Rak<BR>2) Move the rest 
      of the raiding party to the opposite side of the room.<BR>3) Questing 
      shaman hands Lord Rak the Tear. Rak will AGRO<BR>IMMEDIATELY, use his AOE 
      on you (likely killing you), but also<BR>agroing the Fire Pets on 
      him.<BR>4) Have party stay back and watch the show while healers keep 
      the<BR>Fire Pets healthy. If other mobs pop, the party can attack them, 
      but be<BR>sure you DO NOT use AOE on those mob pops to avoid agroing 
      Rak<BR>on the party.<BR>5) The quest shaman should not move toward raid 
      party, but rather<BR>stand there and try to heal yourself. You'll probably 
      die quickly from<BR>the AOE. Have a cleric resurrect you back as soon as 
      possible, loot the<BR>"Iksar Scale" and get party out. We fought our way 
      back to zone, but<BR>evac works as well of course.<BR><BR><STRONG>The 
      Spear of Fate<BR></STRONG><BR><STRONG>Take the "Iksar Scale" to the Spirit 
      Sentinel Wolf at loc: +3685, -640 in 
      Emerald<BR>Jungle.</STRONG><BR><BR>NOTE: The following conversation is not 
      necessary. You may, if you wish, simply<BR>hand the Iksar Scale to the 
      Spirit Sentinel and receive your Spear of Fate.<BR>Spirit Sentinel says 
      'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented 
      his<BR>mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, 
      then the mantle should have<BR>dissolved since he was the one who 
      initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could<BR>we 
      have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on 
      his hands but that is<BR>false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would 
      lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose<BR>to 
      follow.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What is lost?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit 
      Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless 
      individuals. Not the single<BR>shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now 
      truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the<BR>universe. Today 
      is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your 
      sacrifice and<BR>spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. 
      You have waited for us at the bottom of the<BR>ocean. You have rubbed out 
      a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis 
      and<BR>entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal 
      suffering. It is only fitting that we<BR>reward you with our greatest 
      treasure, the [Spear of Fate].<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What of the Spear 
      of Fate?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed 
      millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah.<BR>One of the most 
      destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been 
      traveling the<BR>world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he 
      discovered and experimented with all<BR>forms of dangerous magic. Most of 
      the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was<BR>capable of. 
      He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of 
      negative spiritual<BR>energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had 
      willed into existence one of these [black<BR>holes].<BR><BR>You say, 
      <STRONG>'What of these Black Holes?</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 
      'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in 
      solitude. It was<BR>here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for 
      the small tribes of men who made the northlands<BR>their home, this new 
      black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire 
      existence. The<BR>mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual 
      energy of everything within its gaze, it also<BR>drained the life force as 
      well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But 
      one<BR>[powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's 
      mantle.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What powerful 
      shaman?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first 
      to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We<BR>supplied him with 
      materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric 
      of the<BR>[cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient 
      lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a<BR>young sapling for the shaft and 
      shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his 
      fingernails.<BR>He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the 
      blade into place and bound them together with<BR>the tanned entrails of an 
      ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an 
      aviak<BR>elder.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What of the 
      cosmos?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was 
      strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force<BR>was 
      positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked 
      like a void, it was still<BR>created by an imposition of will. We figured 
      that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create<BR>enough 
      anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger 
      volunteered<BR>immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even 
      get close to it. In one act of devotion and<BR>singular purpose, Thalger 
      rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped 
      a<BR>[breach] across the planes.<BR><BR>You say,<STRONG> 'What of the 
      breach?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of 
      existence created enough negative material to cancel out<BR>Miragul's 
      abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough 
      planar material to<BR>destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, 
      Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that<BR>was left was the 
      spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We 
      have kept<BR>it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike 
      with it, you must have the same<BR>singularity of purpose as did Thalger 
      when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah.<BR>Congratulations, 
      Heyokah! You have received your Spear of Fate!: </FONT></P>
