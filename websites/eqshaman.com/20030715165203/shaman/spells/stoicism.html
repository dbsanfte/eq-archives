The quest begins with an impassive sea spirit in the Gulf of Gunthak, who is underwater in a sunken boat (location +700, -300, -150).
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, an impassive sea spirit'</b>
<p>
An impassive sea spirit sways back and forth, rocking with the gentle motions of the tide.  You are nearly mesmerized by its periodic fluctuation, when it suddenly speaks, 'I watch you as you watch me, and I wonder.  Do you realize how to become empty of wishes, of dreams, of hope and sorrow?  What do you know, strange one, about the virtue of null emotion?  Do you understand how to be as unwavering as the ocean itself?  Can you envision yourself as the pebble in the river?  Can you mute feeling?  Do you [dare to learn]?'
<p>
You say, <b>'I dare to learn.'</b>
<p>
An impassive sea spirit says, 'We will see, we will see. If you are a willing pupil then demonstrate that you have begun to comprehend.  Bring me something empty that previously numbed feeling and therefore brought emptiness to its possessor.  You should not have to travel far.'
<p>
Now, head to Dulak's Harbor. You need to find an "Empty Flask", which drops from a "drunken pirate". None of the inhabitants here see through invisbility, so you might want do some reconnaissance on where you will be killing. From the Gunthak zone, hug the right wall. You will pass by many shack like small buildings. Reaching the docks and open water, take a left and continue on. You will notice more shacks on your left which go on for quite a while. Inside of all these shacks will be a variety of things, including some drunken pirates. Slaughter everything in the shacks, as everything is a placeholder for the drunken pirates. Work your way up and down (and up) the lines of shacks. The empty flask is a rare drop from the drunken pirates and you may have to kill up to 100 to obtain one (if you are really, really unlucky). Once you have the flask, head back to the sea spirit.
<p>
Hail the spirit again and go through the conversation (to make sure the event initiates properly). Then give him the flask.
<p>
An impassive sea spirit says, 'Well done, strange one.  Your perception is admirable.'  The spirit hands you an incredibly heavy rock.  'Can you be as [impassive as the sea]?'
<p>
You recieve a large rock. Summon a pet, buff up, etc. When you are ready to begin the event, hand him back the rock. 
<p>
An impassive sea spirit melds with the murky ocean water, and two elements of the sea appear.
<p>
Two water elementals appear, named Flotsam and Jetsam, each level 40ish. They are not very strong for their level, only hitting for about 60 damage. You are able to single pull them and should pull with slow. Flotsam drops "Part of Flotsam" and Jetsam drops "Part of Jetsam". Hail the impassive sea spirit again, and then give him both items.
<p>
Now you comprehend.  This is the way things are, and the way they have always been. Your acceptance of these truths proves your worthiness.
<p>
Wholia - you recieve the spell, which is no drop.
