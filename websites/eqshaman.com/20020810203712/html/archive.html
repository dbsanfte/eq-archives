	  	From the <b>NEW IMPROVED</b> Whineplay...<br>
		I've had a few requests about two alchemy items.
The Field of Bone Gate potion does not yet have a 5 or 10 combination version. This is being added, and will hopefully be in the next patch. For now, don't try to combine these potions, since you will be trying to create an item that just doesn't exist yet.
<p>
Kilva's Skin of Flame has the same effect as Kilva's Blistering Flesh. This is also being looked at right now, and hopefully will be fixed for the next patch.

      Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or New Sebilis as
      some call it, is a great walled city located deep in the heart of Kunark. Long before you
      were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected a spark of great wisdom within your life
      force. It was then that your path was chosen. Having reached the season of rebirth you
      have been summoned to the Temple of Terror. It is there that you shall study the ways of
      the unholy shaman known as the Scaled Mystics. Through the Hierophants, ancient Iksar
      ancestors shall guide you through the stages of the Scaled Mystics so that one day you may
      become a vessel of great power. Together with the Crusaders of Greenmist you form the
      religious backbone of the Iksar empire. The Iksar Legion does not act without the aid of
      the Scaled Mystics. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar
      and cannot be trusted. Only within Cabilis are you truly safe.<br>

    <small><small><strong>Patch effects for Shaman </strong>- </small></small><br>
    <small><small>*Levitation Changed* </small></small><br>
    <small><small>Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code
    that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active is no longer
    necessary and has been backed out. The Levitate spell may now be refreshed while the spell
    is in use. </small></small><br>

    <small><small>Gordon made another post in response to the Shrink item issue on the
    official forums today. Here's the scoop: </small></small></font><ul>
      <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">Clarity is a defining spell for the Enchanter class.
      A clarity item was rejected becasue it would devaluate the Enchanter class. Than the item
      is supposed to shrink everywhere (dungeons and outdoorzones) making it better than the
      Shaman spell. Now there are 2 possibilities, its either an item thats been dropped or
      quested. Or its a potion that shaman can make with alchemy. In the last case how can a
      shaman get a spell in potion form thats more powerfull than the original spell ??? </font></small></small></p>
      <p><i><b><small><small><font face="Verdana">One of the reasons that the Shrink spell is
      dungeon only is that we wanted it to be a utility spell, not a &quot;look at me, I'm a
      miniture troll&quot; spell. By limiting it to dungeon only, we at least have it someplace
      where there is a context for it. </font></small></small></p>
      <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The new shrink item will be a potion that is created
      through alchemy. Since only shamans can do alchemy, there's no worry about taking
      something away from them. We went ahead and decided to make the potion &quot;shrink
      everywhere&quot;, since its cost will dissuade people from using it as a &quot;show
      off&quot; spell. </font></small></small></p>

    News - </b>I discovered last night while holding a PGT for a friend that they are no
    longer usable by Shamans.<br>
    I went to Dagnors Cauldron last night with some friends of mine and got a Cauldron shell,
    ghoul carrion, and a lancer swordfish fin. I didn't get a drop of experience since they
    were so much higher than me ( my friends) but I did end the night able to get my totemic
    arms, and almost my bracers ( </font><font face="arial" size="1">if I had a banded bracer
    ! </font><font face="arial" size="-1">).&nbsp;<b><br>

    </b>Added Totemic Armor to Equipment section.<b><br>
    <br>
    </b>I would first like to start by saying I did not gather all this information on my own.
    Many websites and players have contributed and I thank them for their help. Notably </font><a href="http://www.soerbaird.com/shaman/" target="_blank"><font face="arial" size="-1">The
    Shamans Crucible</font></a><font face="arial" size="-1">, <a href="http://eq.stratics.com">EQ
    Stratics</a>, </font><font face="arial" size="-1"><a href="http://www.everlore.com" target="_blank">Everlore</a>, and <a href="http://www.noble1.com/eqwdb/default.asp" target="_blank">EQWeapons Database</a>.<br>
    <br>
    This site is designed to be a one stop resource for all Shaman questions. What weapons
    should you use? What Spells will I be getting next? What can I do at my level for quests
    and experience? I hope to have the answers to these questions and&nbsp; more. <br>
    <br>
    I have linked to the Stratics Shaman message board in order to avoid having duplicate
    information and reducing the places we Shamans have to go to get answers. I highly
    recommend posting a message there if you have an unanswered question.&nbsp;<br>
