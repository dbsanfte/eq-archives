      High Scale Icon:<BR>WARNING: DO NOT use Form of the Great Bear while doing 
      this. Reports<BR>that handing Kirn the Icon in Bear Form will BUG the 
      quest causing him to NOT<BR>agro and NOT drop Neh's Promise 
      Ring!<BR><BR>High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a 
      long moment before speaking. 'Why did<BR>you bring me this? Are you here 
      to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles<BR>venomously 
      and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I 
      wish the truth<BR>to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it 
      from me, show it to the queen and she will<BR>remember. However, I will 
      not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!'<BR>Your faction standing 
      with Truespirit got better<BR>You gain party experience!!<BR><BR>NOTE: 
      Kirn is initially non-agro to all, but will AGRO IMMEDIATELY 
      the<BR>instant you hand him the Icon, so you may not see the above 
      conversation fly by,<BR>or it's possible the conversation has been 
      removed. Just hand him the Icon and<BR>then kill him. No conversation is 
      necessary.<BR><BR>After Killing High Scale Kirn, he drops:<BR>Engraved
