Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the northwestern part of town. A little ways in on the inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail, Bondl Felligan'</b>
<p>
Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.'
<p>
Give Bondl the "tiny gem".
<p>
Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now!'<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
<p>
Next, wait for him to move and follow him out of the sewers. There he will stop and speak to you.
<p>
Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze with this or not?'
<p>
You say, <b>'You can buy booze.'</b>
<p>
Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, please come with me.'
<p>
Follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater spirit waiting.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail a greater spirit'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]?
<p>
If you are a Barbarian, Vah Shir, or Froglok, choose justice. If you are an Ogre, choose war. If you are an Iksar, choose fear. If you are a Troll, choose hate. What follows is the Barbarian response:
<p>
You say, <b>'I follow justice.'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are, then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell.'
<p>
Go to the other room as instructed by a greater spirit.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail a greater spirit'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you. We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah].'
<p>
You say, <b>'What trust do you speak of?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What true spirits?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What very few?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to grasp our existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to you.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What wisps of consciousness?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What Heyokah?'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly.
<p>
The greater spirit should now give you another gem.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b> DO NOT say the following line until you have received the gem. The next line will cause the spirit to immediately disappear but will start the next part of the quest for you.
<p>
You say, <b>'I will walk the path of the Heyokah.'</b>
<p>
a greater spirit says 'That is good. You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust.
