      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>Head to North Freeport. Go in 
      the sewers in the northwestern part of town, a little<BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana  size=2>ways in on the inside of a colapsed wall 
      is Bondl Felligan. Give the gem to him.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana 
       size=2>You say, <STRONG>'hail Bondl 
      Felligan'<BR><BR></STRONG></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>Bondl Felligan burps 
      loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I 
      want<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>and I certainly have nothin' you 
      want.'<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Give Bondl the "tiny gem".</P></FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2>Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a 
      fortune! I could drink for a month after<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>sellin' 
      this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get 
      for it right now!<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Your faction standing with 
      TrueSpirit got better<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>You gain party 
      experience!!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the 
      sewers onto the land outside,<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>there he will stop 
      and speak to you.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' 
      some drinks with this gem? Who the<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>heck are you to 
      offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda 
      conditional <br></FONT><FONT size=2>kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy 
      some booze with this or not?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=2>You say, 
      <STRONG>'You can buy booze.'</STRONG><BR><BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Bondl 
      Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, 
      please come with<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>me.'</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>After this you can follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den or 
      just go there yourself.<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Head up to the third floor, 
      middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater<BR></FONT><FONT 
      size=2>spirit waiting.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to 
      him and saying "You<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>can buy booze" at anytime will 
      cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No need to<BR></FONT><FONT 
      size=2>travel back to Ocean of Tears, Field of Bones, Rathe Mountains or 
      Butcherblock<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>Mountains to initiate the quest 
      agai</FONT><FONT size=2>n.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Once you arrive at the Jade Tiger's Den . . .</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>You say, <STRONG>'Hail a greater 
      spirit'<BR></STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT size=2>a greater spirit says 
      'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow </FONT><FONT size=2>[Justice], 
      [War], [Fear], or [Hate]?<BR></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
       size=4><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>Answer

      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>What follows is the Barbarian 
      response . . .</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'I follow 
      justice'<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a 
      greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you 
      are, then. You would be best<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>served by speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell 
      .<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>Go to the other room 
      as instructed by a greater spirit.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana 
       size=2>You say, <STRONG>'Hail a greater

      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'It is 
      good to see you. We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what 
      was<BR></FONT><FONT ><FONT face=Verdana size=2>asked 
      regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the 
      </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>[true spirit</FONT><FONT face=Verdana

      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'What true 
      spirits?'</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'As a 
      shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them 
      homage<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>and respect the 
      world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful 
      enough. We<BR></FONT><FONT ><FONT face=Verdana size=2>are a 
      part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel 
      us. However </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>[very fe</FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana size=2>w]<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT ><FONT 
      face=Verdana size=2>know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, 
      </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>[wisps of consciousnes</FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana size=2>s] in an expanse of<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana  size=2>emptiness and as difficult to grasp as 
      breath in Everfrost.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'What trust do 
      you speak of?'</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'Trust is 
      the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, 
      it<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>allows them to focus 
      on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also 
      gives us<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>the confidence 
      to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one 
      becomes<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>dissatisfied 
      with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed 
      destroys the<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>glue of the 
      universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'What very 
      few?'</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'There 
      are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends 
      and,<BR></FONT><FONT ><FONT face=Verdana size=2>reluctantly, 
      masters. We call them the </FONT><FONT face=Verdana 
      size=2>[Heyoka</FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>h]. Bondl is one of them 
      and he helps to test those we<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana 
       size=2>believe might be able to grasp our existence. There 
      are many troubles that threaten us and our home.<BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana  size=2>We seek those with the wisdom, patience, 
      and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos.<BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana  size=2>Whether you seek balance or personal 
      power, this is important to you.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'What wisps of 
      consciousness?'</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'It is 
      difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that 
      can be<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>held or consumed. 
      We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives 
      to run<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>and hunt. When 
      you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. 
      The ox is the<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do 
      not become an ox, you become<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of 
      understanding.</FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman"  
size=4>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'What 
      heyokah?'</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>The greater spirit should give 
      you the gem after you say the above line.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'The 
      Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our friends who seek 
      to<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>help us in whatever 
      goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave 
      and<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>command us to do 
      their bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize 
      are<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>powerful enough to 
      accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have 
      prepared<BR></FONT><FONT ><FONT face=Verdana size=2>a test. 
      We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the 
      </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>[path of the Heyoka</FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana size=2>h].</FONT></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>We see you may be worthy. Will 
      you walk the path? You will be rewarded for your efforts, 
      albeit<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>grudgingly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2><STRONG>CAUTION: DO NOT say the 
      following line until you receive the gem by saying 
      the<BR></STRONG></FONT><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>above line. The next line will cause him to immediately despawn but 
      will start the<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>next 
      quest for you.</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>You say, <STRONG>'I will walk 
      the path of the Heyokah'</STRONG></FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
       size=4>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>a greater spirit says 'That is 
      good. You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of 
      the<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>Heyokah. The paths 
      of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this 
      gem<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  size=2>and go on a 
      pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's 
      Crossing. The Kerrans<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. 
      Give Ooglyn the gem and do what<BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana  
      size=2>she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about 
      trust.</FONT></P>
