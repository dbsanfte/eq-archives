    you to specialize in 1 type of magic which means less mana usage and faster casting
    spells. <b>Note:</b> Your stat for this skill <i><b>starts</b></i> at 30 with your first
    practice. Be careful when you put practices in this so that you don't hit 51 with a spell
    type you don't want to be your primary.</small></small><br>
    <br>
    <small><small><strong>Alteration</strong> - </small></small><br>
    <small><small>Our most expensive spells are con, yes. BUT, 4 are pets, which are going to
    be cast even less than buffs, so IMO a moot point. The other expensive ones are the high
    level poison and disease. Well, how many of these are you going to toss in a combat? 1
    disease, 1 or 2 poisons. So if you reduce the cost to cast those, how much does that
    really save? <br>
    <br>
    Know what else you're </small></small><small><small>going to</small></small>
    <small><small> be casting? Debuffs. The Malise line and the Drowsy line are
    both Alteration, as well a the healing line and the regen line. Me, I don't buff a huge
    amount before combat, mostly because it's really expensive and so spec would allow me to
    buff more, but our late buffs, which is what we are really looking at, last damn near
    forever. <br>
    <br>
    Con Lines Cast in combat- <br>
    Disease - 1 a fight (300) <br>
    Poison - 1 or 2 a fight (320-640) <br>
    <br>
    Alt Lines Cast in combat- <br>
    Drowsy - 1 to 2 a fight (175 - 350) <br>
    Malise - 1 a fight (175) <br>
    Healing - Tons (150 per) <br>
    Listless - maybe one (90 per) <br>
    Incapacitate - probably (150 per) <br>
    Regen - perhaps (200 per) <br>
    <br>
    Out of combat, it's our </small></small><small><small>bucket loads</small></small><small>
    <small> of stat, hp, ac, and attack speed buffs vs pets.</small> </small><br>
