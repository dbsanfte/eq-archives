<b>Paw of Opolla -</b> <br>
This is the quest for the Paw of Opolla. In the Fish Ale pub in South Qeynos there is a man named Micc Koter standing at the bar. His companion (whose name I forget) will occasionally mumble about someone "foolish going after the Paw of Opolla". When you ask the companion about it, he tells you to mind your own business, but Micc will tell him to behave. Ask Micc about the Paw of Opolla and he will tell you it is a magical item and it belongs to "some gnoll bitch". He will offer to tell you where to find it if you buy him a brandy. I had to buy 2 to get him to talk. He then says that someone calling himself Caninel went to find it in the Plains of Karana. 
<p>
Caniel is located in West Karana, along with two named gnolls, along the mountains near the border with North Karana. When you talk to Caninel, he will demand 3 gems before telling you about the Paw of Opolla (Moonstone, Bloodstone, and a Star Rose Quartz). He will then tell you about how when the humans from Everfrost first met the Blackburrow Gnolls, the Shaman Opolla greeted them warmly and had her hand cut off by Gynok Molter. She placed a curse upon the Molter descendants, the last of which can be found in under Qeynos. He tells you to ask him about the paw and also about the rings on the paw. 
<p>
When you find him (Vin Molter), he will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a rat meat pie for the paw. He will deny any knowledge of the rings and say that his father probably sold them, mentioning his father's travels in Odus. You can get the pie through a quest in Qeynos Hills, or you can kill him to get the paw container. This is not the actual item, since it seems it is the rings that activate its magic. 
<p>
<b>There are four rings that need to be put in the paw container and combined to get the true paw: platinum, gold, silver and copper. Look for rings with a +1 xx, -1 char stat. 
</b><p>
The platinum ring is on a mummy in befallen named Gynok Moltar. 
<p>
The other three rings are found through the shiny rings quest in Kerra Ridge (which involves camping the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk). The silver ring also appears in the lake in Blackburrow. 
<p>
<b>Rat Ear Pie -</b> <br>
Rephas is a crazed hermit who lives near the lake in the Qeynos Hills, with a penchant for rat ears. If you give him regular rat ears he will grill them for you, and you get a lore item 'Grilled Rat Ears' which are also edible. Give that back to him and you get a minor item and some faction and experience. If you give him 3 giant rat ears he will give you a recipe for Rat Ear Pie which does not require a clump of dough (Giant Rat Ears + Baking Spirits + Cup of Four in a mixing bowl, then bake result in an oven). This rat ear pie can then be used in the Paw of Oppola quest. You get the following faction adjustments for giving him rat ears or giant rat ears: + Arcane Scientists + Knights of Truth, - Freeport Militia - Opal Darkbriar.
<p>
<b>Kerra Ridge - Shiney Rings Quest</b><br>
This is to get 3 of the rings for the Paw of Opolla Quest. Melixis is a merchant that sells supplies for shaman-made potions. When you hail her she claims to have three [shiny tings] that she found all over the world. These shiny tings are [a dull ring] (the copper ring) a [kinda shiny ring] (the silver ring) and a [really shiny ring] (the gold ring). For the dull ring she wants a bracket mildew. For the kinda shiny ring she wants faerix spores. And for the really shiny ring shen wants degenerated guk weed. All of these items drop off the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk.
