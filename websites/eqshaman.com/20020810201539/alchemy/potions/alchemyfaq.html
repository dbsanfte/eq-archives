<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>Do the recipes 
      for "Old Alchemy" still work?</STRONG></FONT>       </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Yes...with a few 
      exceptions. Most Old Alchemy recipes were removed in the long ago alchemy 
      revamp, when vendor herbs changed completely. Those original herbs are now 
      again available in Luclin and many of those recipes have been tested and 
      found working. A few, however, seem to be buggy.</FONT>

      face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>What are the best potions to make in order to 
      gain and/or improve my alchemy skill?</STRONG></FONT>         </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Try to find a balance 
      between "potion difficulty" (ie, trivial level) and "cost to make" as per 
      our Trivial Chart, taking into consideration those potions that sell best 
      to players (Blood of Wolf, Invisibility to Undead and Shrink in the 
      pre-100 skill area . . . Greater Aura potions to boost the appropriate 
      resists for dragon raids, Stingwort and Gate potions in the post-100 skill 
      area). </FONT>            
             
              
              
            
 </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Keep in mind that while 
      Titan potions have a high trivial, they cost only half as much per 
      attempt. It has not yet been determined for sure whether or not 
      improvements in skill come faster if you work on something with a lower 
      trivial. So, if you are finding it very hard to fund your alchemy but want 
      to continue trying, consider working on Growth potions for a while. You 
      will succeed less often, but as most potions sell back to a vendor for 
      only a tiny faction of the cost of the components anyway, you may still 
      come out ahead in the long run. </FONT>

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Balm Leaf, Dragonwart,

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>First and formost, from 
      killing the giants and looting their toes. Some vendors (especially those 
      near giant spawn points) may carry giant toes from time to time as a 
      result of other players selling their looted giant toes to that vendor. 
      There is no known vendor that commonly stocks giant toes in their regular 
      inventory. See the bottom of our Herb Prices page for more 
      details.</FONT>
