      <p><small><font face="Verdana"><small>About the built-in SOW for Shaman pets, no plans for

      <p><small><font face="Verdana"><small>I forwarded the information to one of the Live guys,
      and just brought it up again. We'll look into it, but it's too early to say whether or not
      the issue is a bug. If there are any quests associated with the Halas Banker (something
      that we are checking), he'll need to retain his faction. If not, we can probably change
      him. </small></font></small></p>

        <small><small><small>We just got out of our tuning meeting for this week. I did want to
        talk a bit about the Shaman changes that occurred on Test last week, and let you know
        about our plans for the production servers: </small></small></small></p>
        <p><small><small><small>Strength: Last week we changed this spell on test to limit its
        effect and bring it in line with other 49th level shaman stat buffs. However, today we
        decided to leave it as it is on the production servers. </small></small></small></p>
        <p><small><small><small>Togor's Insects: Despite the fact that information was changed in
        the spdat.eff file, the maximum effectiveness of the spell didn't change. This is another
        case where something that was previously controlled in code was moved to the spell
        database. Those parsers really only show half the picture. </small></small></small></p>

      <small><small>It has been reported on the crucible that the <a href="../images/shrink.jpg">potion
      for Shrink</a> is Celandine plus Sumbul. The first is in Halas/Grobb, the second is in

      Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or New Sebilis as
      some call it, is a great walled city located deep in the heart of Kunark. Long before you
      were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected a spark of great wisdom within your life
      force. It was then that your path was chosen. Having reached the season of rebirth you
      have been summoned to the Temple of Terror. It is there that you shall study the ways of
      the unholy shaman known as the Scaled Mystics. Through the Hierophants, ancient Iksar
      ancestors shall guide you through the stages of the Scaled Mystics so that one day you may
      become a vessel of great power. Together with the Crusaders of Greenmist you form the
      religious backbone of the Iksar empire. The Iksar Legion does not act without the aid of
      the Scaled Mystics. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar
      and cannot be trusted. Only within Cabilis are you truly safe.<br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
      This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY <br>
