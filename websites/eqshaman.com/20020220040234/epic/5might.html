      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><STRONG>The Test of 
      Might<BR></STRONG><BR>Head to loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle. There 
      you'll find the Sentinel Spirit.<BR>Hail him and give him the gem you 
      received from the wandering spirit.<BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you 
      live, shaman! I am glad the beasts of this jungle haven't torn 
      your<BR>body asunder. Tell me, do you still walk the path? Are you willing 
      to [continue what you have<BR>started]?<BR>Your faction standing with 
      TrueSpirit got better<BR><BR>You say,<STRONG> 'I will continue what i have 
      started'<BR></STRONG><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'This brings happiness to 
      our hearts and we are grateful. However, we must ask<BR>you to walk one 
      more path before you can become a true Heyokah. With trust, one can focus 
      on<BR>what is important. With patience, one can perceive what is harmful. 
      With wisdom, one can know<BR>what must be done. These, you have learned, 
      yet without the might to carry out what must be done,<BR>all is for 
      naught. Are you [prepared to walk the path of might]?<BR><BR>You say, 
      <STRONG>'I am prepared to walk the path of might'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit 
      Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest? 
      The wasichu call it<BR>the Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the 
      terrible place. Where there is no spirituality, we are<BR>weak. The lost 
      city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of belief not only 
      absent of spirituality,<BR>but actually draining it from others. We are 
      here to neutralize that void. The void is like the sky, and<BR>nothing 
      escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us away and sometimes it 
      turns our minds,<BR>making us [like the wasichu], crazy for things with no 
      meaning.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What like the 
      wasichu?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us 
      who have turned their backs on our world and struggle<BR>for possesions 
      and power over others. These lost ones are our brothers and we cry for 
      them. Our<BR>hearts are in pain like bleeding wounds when we think of 
      them. The path of might will lead you to<BR>one of our lost brothers. We 
      are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now, so you 
      must<BR>eliminate him when you [find him].<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'How do 
      i find him?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and 
      walked the land for ages. He soon met a man, one of the<BR>pointy-ears 
      that live underground. This man was like a void just liike the one over 
      that terrible place<BR>now. Our Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's 
      desire and ambition. He no doubt thought that<BR>he could get what he 
      wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his own 
      creator.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What dark point 
      ear?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began 
      traveling with this point-ear, they became shrouded in a<BR>darkness we 
      could not peer through. The point-ear was a powerful being and we soon 
      lost their trail.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>We have no idea where he could be now. 
      Although, after all these centuries, he has no doubt been<BR>gathering and 
      cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly influential 
      being at this<BR>point. Find this point-ear and draw our brother out, then 
      destroy him and bring us proof. We await<BR>your return in somber 
      mourning.<BR><BR>Head to Mistmoore. Find the wolf spirit, Black Dire. He 
      is STRONG and he has 4<BR>slighty weaker wolves as his four guardians. 
      Black Dire hits hard and fast for up to<BR>200 HP per swipe, so use 
      extreme caution.<BR>Black Dire is not a timed spawn, but you can kill the 
      Advisor in the general<BR>vicinity of the Library (location 19 on EQAtlas 
      map) and Black Dire will repop<BR>each time you do so.<BR>Black Dire is by 
      the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp.<BR>Instead, 
      head all the way up the canyon that passes under the bridge. At base 
      of<BR>cliff you will see 4 wolfs and Black Dire in the middle. In order to 
      get a response<BR>from the wolf you have to con Warmly. He is truespirit 
      faction. When you walk up<BR>to him and hail him this is what he 
      says:<BR><BR>Black Dire says 'So, you've come. I suppose my brothers have 
      sent you to lead me back to their<BR>flock. Those fools are so blinded by 
      their devotion they know nothing of life. If they only knew the<BR>power 
      I've become, the luxuries I've amassed, the pleasures I've known, they too 
      would leave that<BR>sour and unrewarding existence in seconds. You know, 
      you could come to know what I have,<BR>shaman. You found me, which speaks 
      of your intelligence; we could use you. What do you say,<BR>Waring ? [Will 
      you join] my master Mayong Mistmoore?<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'I will NOT 
      join you'</STRONG><BR><BR>Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck 
      that I may show our master your devotion in<BR>death. The more blood you 
      spill upon the grass, the more impressed our Lord Mistmoore will 
      be.<BR>Then maybe, just maybe, you will be allowed to scour our kitchen 
      floors in the eternity of unlife.<BR>TEAR him to pieces, my 
      wolves!<BR>Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<BR>Black Dire 
      bashes YOU for 60 points of damage.<BR>Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points 
      of damage.<BR>Black Dire bites YOU for 200 points of damage.<BR>Black Dire 
      begins to cast a spell.<BR>YOU writhe in the grip of agony.<BR>Ah well, no 
      easy task killing Black Dire and his friends. It has also been 
      reported<BR>that conversation with Black Dire is not necessary. Killing 
      him outright will work<BR>just as well. Also, if the accompanying wolf 
      guardians are green to all in the party,<BR>it is reported that Black Dire 
      can be pulled without agroing his guardians.<BR><BR>Once you kill Black 
      Dire, loot his pelt.<BR>Return to the Sentinel Spirit in Emerald Jungle, 
      loc +1250, +300.<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'Hail Spirit 
      Sentinel'<BR></STRONG><BR>Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees 
      the pelt, battered and bloody. After a few moments,<BR>he says, 'We can 
      only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was powerful and 
      yet you<BR>overcame him. Always remember that when you became [Heyokah], 
      it was the passing of a noble,<BR>yet misguided being that allowed you to 
      do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him<BR>and what 
      he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a 
      pair of boots and<BR>give them to you.<BR>With every step you take, you 
      must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.'<BR>Your 
      faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>You gain party 
      experience!!<BR>Congratulations! You have now 
      receieved:<BR><BR><STRONG>Black Fur Boots<BR>AC 9, Str+3 Sta+3 Wis+3 
      Agil+3<BR>SV Dis +3 Sv Mag+5 sv Poi+3<BR>Effect: Instantaneous, Manaless, 
      Self-SoW</STRONG><BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'What is 
      heyokah?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the 
      Path of the Heyokah to its end. You have become<BR>what few have and we 
      will now call to you as Heyokah Duhara . From now on, you are a direct 
      link<BR>between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to help us or 
      master us, you are welcomed.<BR>Though there is little time for 
      celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To 
      eyes<BR>not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any 
      other forest. But you know, as do<BR>we, of the mantle over the city 
      threatening all of us. We must [rub it out].<BR><BR>You say, <STRONG>'How 
      can we rub it out?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many 
      such mantles scarring the universe and each is very different<BR>from the 
      last. Removing them requires that we learn how they were created and go 
      about reversing<BR>the damage done. We cannot enter under the mantle for 
      long which is why we search out Heyokah<BR>such as yourself. We need you 
      to enter the city and find out what you can about the [city's 
      demise].<BR>We hope you will do this for the cause of balance but if you 
      desire none but your own power, we<BR>shall grant that as well<BR><BR>You 
      say, <STRONG>'What about the city's demise?'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit 
      Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed great 
      wealth and power yet<BR>it eventually crumbled. No one understands what 
      happened. The men of the world ask themselves<BR>how a nation as 
      successful as Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague, internal unrest, 
      the constant<BR>encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of 
      monsters but we alone know what happened.<BR>Just as Tabien and Glaron 
      lost sight of their spiritual paths, so did Torsis. Without the awe 
      and<BR>inspiration of that which was greater than themselves, they 
      eventually withered away. The mantle<BR>was born long before the last 
      days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it all began].<BR><BR>You 
      say, <STRONG>'Tell me how it all began'</STRONG><BR><BR>Spirit Sentinel 
      says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you can. The 
      ghosts who<BR>still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will 
      aid us. Take this booklet and combine<BR>what you find in it. Then bring 
      me the completed report. From there, we will know where to look<BR>next.
