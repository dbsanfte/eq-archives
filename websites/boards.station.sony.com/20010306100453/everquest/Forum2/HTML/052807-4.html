</FONT><HR>Kaeria's post at the beginning summed up everything most crucial. I feel the need to add one thing I haven't seen, even though it isn't balance-related - fix the drum graphic or not, but make us stop waddling when running with a drum. No new animation, just remove the drum animation entirely. Standing/running with a flute in your hand while playing instead of a drum is better than standing/running while using a lute animation on it.<P>Second, although it's been mentioned, a plea to do something about twisting. I've basically had to quit my bard because demanding that my attention and hands be that focused (doing something at least every 3 seconds) 80-90% of the time I'm actively playing, even during downtime, is simply unfair. Give us macro abilities, something, anything, to relieve this pain in my wrist and my eyes. Please. This isn't going to infringe on balance with other classes in any way whatsoever. It'll just spare the health of the player at the keyboard. As I've recently discovered going from a good game machine to a laptop with minimal game abilities, as well, it's not fair to make computer/graphics/connection speed a factor in how well a player can do his job, and it would balance bards with each other, not just other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The point of these talks are overall class balancing. I think we need to make a point of defining the class before balancing it against other classes.  A paladin is a cleric/warrior.  A Ranger is a Druid/warrior.  A shadow knight is a necro/warrior.  These are easy distinctions and the necro does not complain that the sk can darkness. Nor does the Cleric complain that the Pally can cast symbol.  So what is a bard?  I think a bard is overall an Enchanter/Rogue though not as clear cut as the others, obviously.  Many Bard songs have been nerfed or just never have worked properly because of bards stepping on enchanter toes.  Why is this even an issue?  If bards are part enchanter just like rangers are part druid then they need to be balanced as such.  Enchanters complaining because their armored version shares a handful of the same skills should not be listened to anymore than clerics complaining that Paladins can revive.  If you take away the enchanter part of the bard then you are left with a very bad rogue with a couple of useful songs but not many.  Instead, strengthen the enchanter part of the bard.  The ability to AE mez should be given back to the bard in higher levels and please please please do not take away the enchanter abilities they do have when you balance.  And do NOT take away any illusion items that drop, you will only be removing the fun of a very complicated and misunderstood class.<P>Many have also stated in these threads that bards should be able to tank more. I strongly disagree.  Please define the bard and then have integrity when you balance. If bards are enchanter/rogues then taking damage is not their job.  Some can make an argument for dealing damage with this definition, and I will let them do it. But above this hybrid definition, a bard has the distinction of having songs and instruments.  Strengthen these tools.  I will not repeat the posts that discuss all of the songs that are not increased by instruments where they should.  But it is obvious that a lot of details have been ignored in completing the bard class in favor of fixing other parts of the game.  But now is the time to work on the details.  Fix the songs that don't work, have instruments increase songs where they should and make available instruments at the midlevels.  Keep the class complicated, we like the challenge -- just realize that you are working with a flawed class that needs to be fixed before it can be "balanced".<P>Eponyne Halcyon<BR>48th Level Songtart</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I may not know as much of Bard-dom as others (only level 18, eheheh) I can say a couple of things:<P>We are considered a hybrid class.  ...Why?<P>There are lots and lots of good things I can say about the special instruments I've heard about.  The problem is, up to the mid-twenties, we're still using lutes and hand drums.  maybe some slightly lower level instruments with lower song boosts?<P>My friend is new to the game, he is now a level 8 paladin equipped with Sarnak Pitchtaka.  I've seen him hit for 21 damage on occasion. At level 18, the usual damage with MY pitchtaka is 14. Tops.<P>Wood Elf bards.  Cannot use bows. no further comment...<P>We reaaaally need some kind of hotkey or something to make it easier to switch from an instrument to a shield/weapon.  When we're trying to twist our songs and have to stop, open up our bags or inventory, and so on.... it can get aggravating<P>There's my little thoughts for the day...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here is my take on bard issues to date.<BR>Let me preface this by saying that I have not gotten my bard up to the 'uber' levels and from reading the descriptions I dont want to.  He may eventually go the way of my Wizard, gathering dust because he was also just not useful from 1 to 28 compared to most other classes.<P>1)Fix the drum.  This hasnt been reinforced enough in my opinion.  Its a small issue and most of us have gotten used to it, but it is silly to be seen strumming a flute when we should be playing a drum.  In many ways this typifies what we percieve as Verants attitude towards bards.  They just dont care about fixing our issues.<BR>2)More low and mid-level instruments.  The first upgrade instruments available to bards are in mistmoore, on a mid-30's mob.  And about half to 2/3 of our isntruments are on planes mobs or dragons.  Other classes get armor, weapons, and shields in the teens and twenties which increase their abilities (PGT, Skull of Jhen Tra, Langseax, etc).  I would like to see more magic isntruments.  I didnt say more POWERFUL instruments.  I think if the verant staff were to brainstorm even a little bit they could come up with ways that instruments could be made better without rendering the battle drums/gypsy lute obsolete.  Some suggestions:<BR>*)Stat/AC increases.  Bonuses to Str, Agil, Cha, HP, or AC could be scaled.<BR>*)Less powerful versions of the Lute Of The Howler, which granted weak special abilities: true north, a 2pt damage shield, serpent sight (though that is not that weak)<BR>*)Instruments that improved specific songs rather than all of the instruments songs: a lute that worked only for Lament, a wind instrument that increased the range on mellifluous motion, etc.<BR>*)Instruments whose colors were unusual.  The gloves of the gatecaller leap to mind here, with hopefully a little more utility.  But an otherwise normal lute which was red, or a horn which was translucent would be great.<BR>*)Optimally many of these instruments would be quest available.<P>I would like to see lambent made NO DROP, just like the components.  It irks me to see people in their teens and early twenties wearing a full suit.  Hand in hand with this, I would also like to see the components drop from more than one mob. When the quest was first developed, no expansions were out. I think we can make the pieces uncommon/rare drops on 3 or 4 different mobs rather than being dropped from only one mob.<P>Please de-nerf Chains.  Its no more powerful than the darkness + fear abilities of necros and SK's, and it is one of our few abilities that is useful with shamans and enchanters.<P>The power level of bards does not appear to be maintaining parity with other classes.  As crowd controllers, as tanks, as buffers, we are lagging far behind our compatriots.  Particularly at higher levels.  <BR>A suggested solution is haste stacking. I dont foresee this being adopted as I think it would be too powerful, but its a nice idea.  <BR>Debuff stacking I think would be a lot more viable.<BR>Another solution is to return the potpourri element to our songs.  We are supposed to be the jacks of all trades.  Let our songs reflect this.  Rather than just a haste buff, why not add other elements, like AC/agil/str or MR.  Rather than making our songs more deeply effective in a specific effect, why not make them broader, incorporating other, balance-maintaining, effects.<BR>Fufil's and Tuyens typify this attitude. Broaden it.  For offensive effects, include dex/agil/str/ac debuffs.<P>Finally, nobody expects bards to be the best tanks.  They shouldnt really even be GOOD tanks. But they should at least be DECENT tanks.  This is not the case.  One thing I would like to see is an uprgrade to the whistling warsong, which helps to bring bards tanking/melee abilities up to 70 or 80% of those of their brethren (perhaps a substantial STR/AC/DEX/AGIL buff and 35%haste.)<BR>This should come in the mid-20's and no later, or bard weapon skills will have atrophied to the point that it will be worthless).<P>Thank you for your time and consideration.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thanks for replying and be understanding with us. A lot of Bards did spend a whole week trying to get that main article done and ready for you.<P>Here is my little take on a couple of your comments, nothing major.<P>&gt;Absor said:<BR>The groups that are asking you exclusively to play the mana song, they are your fault, at least in part. You need to educate these groups about all of the other things you can do. There is little doubt in my mind that just playing the mana song is not the best use of a bard's skills. You need to show these groups the value of a bard.&lt;<P>I wish this were that easy. The mana use, and situation, all the way up to Level 32, is BEG FOR BREEZE AND CLARITY, and not a Bard thing. After 32, you will find a lot of players that "demand" mana ... and almost in all of the cases, what I hace run up against, were twinks that are interested in levelling and not the average player. Yes, this is a general statement, but no one argued with me, when I pulled out the big brass horn, and fried picklaws in the Keep ... and I was seriously embarassed when one day a Cleric was fired so they could add me and tell me "Play Dah Bomb!" ... Ok. We did both rooms, four people levelled and no one ever got under 80%, because I could twist and move to Lute and Restoration.<P>Generally, and this is an issue at very high levels, since I left the Keep, in three levels, all I have been told to play is the mana song, and nothing but. And since all the players are higher than you, guess what happens ... up yours Bard, and you're outta there! I have been dismissed from two groups in Guk (no invis to undead either, thank you!) for that reason, and in one, we were doing better the other way, but the wanker didn't like it!<P>I need you to tell me, how I am going to educate people that are in a power levelling server that do not care about half the classes in your game? The only viable option, and I think much of this is about that, is how can you help us be EFFECTIVE, and participate in the game.<P>You tend to think that many of each song "effects" are efficient, but they are not. In Chains, at least one component is not active and working, and then you tell me that the song is unbalacing things? And then there are songs that get resisted so much, that the mere "idea" of being able to use it is lost in the shuffle. This, saddly enough, is what drives a Bard to play weapons and a mere whiff of a song, and the mana song is not as important at level 45 anymore. I've had two Enchanters in a row (one in Keepers of Life, the other in Celestial Tomb) to play whatever I wanted but not bother with the mana song! At level 39, how do you think this is gonna sit, when you are trying to tell a level 42 and a level 45 that they are wrong, and they are leading the group? We get thrown out.<P>&gt;Absor said:<BR>From what I'm hearing, bards, paladins and shadow knights are all 'defensive' hybrids. I'll add a suggestion to increase the defense caps of all three to the lists.&lt;<P>This would be nice. Basically, I would love to see a REAL song with AC in it, or equivalent. Almost everything in this game is DAMAGE, and attack oriented, and can you plz make a suggestion that we need to do something about Defense? At least for a class or two so they are in demand in the high dances, instead of the customary Wellingtonian strategy?<P>&gt; It was said:<BR>The entire bard epic is great up to the point where we have to kill 3 dragons. I dont<BR>believe any other class has to do this in addition to everything else we do. Also we must<BR>compete with paladins and warriors, (possibly others) for a shot at the scales."&lt;<P>Correct me, but I think that SK's have to kill 3 Gods, and they have to hope that something drops!<P>&gt;Absor said:<BR>Bards, shadow knights and paladins are the defensive hybrids and they get the defensive stuff.&lt;<P>I wish this was true. It isn't. The improved armor for defense has no resistances of any kind that help the Bard, or a group. And the high level songs, are almost all offensive minded and not defensive minded. Add to this, that the majority of protections we can do are not usefull beyond a certain point, and quite often, we bump into the caps ... it's hard to get a Bard to add anything when the amount prevents it, and there is only a 10% left to fill. In most fights, the BArd might be told to play mana instead.<P>&gt;Absor said:<BR>They will not get both double attack AND dual wield. Rangers are the offensive hybrid, and they get both skills (I think…) and in exchange they lose out on the defensive skills.&lt;<P>I like the instruments. I only want the ability to be able to use them in a way that allows the group to survive and win. To me, this weapon idea is rather boring, but I disagree with other Bards on this issue. I would rather have the defensive skills, and be able to use them in a group (and not get resists!), than have to use two weapons, and hope to help to do damage!<P>I don't know, that there is much that Verant, or you, will be able to do to improve things. My position has been that the sheet of paper is not "optimized" for reality, but for an "ideal" situation, and that situation does not exist, since the song only works 50% of the time due to resists. You say that our healing can be superior, but you give an Enchanter a mana refresh spell that is very fast, and this makes the Cleric use one Greater heal (whatever) in one swell foop, but you do not consider that a "superior" thing or issue. Well, it should be, because in a way it is taking away the Bard's role, and if it endangers the usefullness of other classes in the game, then it should be addressed, and this is what I think you folks are not seeing at all. Maybe the solution is to make the Enchanter the Mez and Charm king, and the Bard the mana king ... and that's that! Now both classes are mandatory, and you have made use of them. Instead, everyone uses an Enchanter and tells the Bard to get lost, since we can't do much damage anyway, and a Ranger can easily double us up. Why even consider having a Bard, when you need damage to take down a biggie? <P>Plz check and reconsider these thoughts ... it's all we are really asking.<P>With care ...

</FONT><HR>Wow this thread is getting long but here's my 2cp.<P>Most of us think that our kunark armor stinks apart from the nice AC. You took away the stats and the effects are way more than unbalanced. Invigor on the vambraces and invigorate on the breastplate while rangers are getting a gate, clerics are getting Complete Heal. Shamans get a 250pt dd on their bracer. Hello? The stupid invigorate is pointless we have stamina effect in our lvl 55 song Cantana of Replenishment as well as our jiggy song. The same with the Plane of Growth armor. People are getting nice effects on their boots, do bards? No. The bard breastplate is 42AC with some stats and lvl 51 song. What do clerics get? A lvl 57 heal as well as 42 AC! Where is this balance?<P>So I would like to see our kunark and PoG armor revised and upgraded.<P>The other main grumble is that any caster/enchanter will tell you that we have stacking problems with our lvl 55 song Cantana of replenishment. While singing that song no one can cast clarity or any type of regen/chloropast spell on any member of the group. YET if the song is stopped and clarity and/or regen/chloro is cast and then restart the lvl 55 song. Yes it stacks that way. I advise you while you are doing your testing. Be a bard in a multi group hunt for one day and find out how annoying this is starting and stoping all the time. IF the song stacks one way it should stack the other way. It needs to be fixed.<P>Finally if enough bards haven't told you, that the drum graphic looks pathetic. Put us back to gliding if you want to. At least that looked more bardic than that rubbish.<P>Sephrenia Sweetawine<BR>60th song<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>I beg to differe, friend.  I could go through all our songs, and show you over 70% of our songs which *should*, as you suggest they do, be usefull for the entire life of my bard, but are not.  I don't wish, however, to bore you by listing that many songs, as I already listed all the songs I felt had 'issues', and I'm sure this thread will be extremely long already.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Again, I beg to differ.  Groups I'm in don't need an enchanter.  I have 181 charisma, and I know how to play my class well enough to keep things moving along very efficiently.<P>However, post 50 that will change, as things become more resistable, the amount of damage I do over time with dot's becomes less usefull, NPC's scale in hitpoints a lot faster than the amount of damage I can deal, and I'm forced into the role of swinging two weapons playing mana song, occasionally going up on my hind legs and panting like a puppy dog while someone pats me on the head and gives me a doggy treat =)<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that allows bards to change into werewolves. And if anything else comes up, I'll add it to my list. Right now, that's the only thing I have that I know of.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Just curious why?  It's a rare drop, off a rare spawn level 57 npc.  Post 50 on most servers, there isn't more than what, maybe 20 bards?  Post 55 on mine there's about 10-12.  Just how many people do you think this will effect?  From the sound of it, you won't get more than 1 howler lute dropping per month, and I believe it's no drop.  Granted chanters are jealous of their abilities, that's very evident in the nerfs on my class that they've had imposed in the past.  But the number of bards that will actually get a howler lute is so miniscule as to not even be considerable.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>I wanted to get this out of the way.<P>The groups that are asking you exclusively to play the mana song, they are your fault, at least in part.<P>You need to educate these groups about all of the other things you can do. There is little doubt in my mind that just playing the mana song is not the best use of a bard's skills. You need to show these groups the value of a bard.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>I'm sorry to keep debunking your arguments, Alan, but this simply is not true.  In one of your comments, which I didn't quote, you said ...<P>"Or look at the increased damage of that rogue when bard hasted, and the increased damage output of the wizard under the mana song AND whatever third song you want to sing"<P>Again, no one wants bard haste, they want chanter/shaman haste.  The nice thing pre-50 is that my haste songs typically stack with shaman haste spells, which makes melee's happy to SEE, but I'm fairly certain the haste component isn't truly stacking.  I think it's more a placebo to make people think that I'm actually doing something usefull.<P>Very few groups post 50 don't have either a shaman or chanter present, and if they don't, there's a decent chance that group is mostly casters.  When it's mostly casters, group haste effects just don't help.<P>My suggestion to this problem, make all our haste effects stack, and drop to ~30-50% efficiency, ie., versus of celerity would no longer give ~20-25% haste, it would give 10-13% haste, would stack, and still give the agi buff buff to the group.<P>As for what you said about the wizard (or other caster for that manner) dealing more damage with that extra bit of mana I'm twisting in ...<P>Let's take a level 60 bard, and a level 60 wizard.<P>At level 60, chorus of clarity increases mana regen by roughly 8 mana per tick, cantana of soothing by about 3-5 (not sure on this one, haven't gotten any timings from a level 60 bard yet), and cantana of replenishment by about 11.  Soothing and Replenishment do not stack with eachother, and are not a direct injection ala mana song.<P>For the wizard from your example, we'll be using the spell Ice Spear of the Solist, a 1200dd (assumedly low resistance) 300 mana cost spell.<P>At level 60, with say, 200 int and base int of 100, said wizard has 2520 mana, which means with a full bar of mana, he can cast ISotS 8 times without needing to meditate, dealing (assuming no resists) 9600 damage.  he then needs to meditate to regain roughly 180 mana (he was short by 60%).  The time it requires him to meditate that mana would be roughly speaking, 30 seconds.  During that time, said bard has now provided maybe 2 ticks of chorus of clarity (~16 mana), or 5 ticks of either soothing/replenishment (~15 or ~55 mana).<P>In order for said bard to be able to, by himself, replenish enough for the wizard to be able to deal another 1200 damage, he would need to twist in cantana of replenishment for ~28 ticks (168 seconds, or 2.8 minutes), for a rough figure of ~7.5 damage per second.<P>Now the bard has of course been helping out the rest of the casters (assuming he's in a caster heavy group) as well, but how much more damage could a bard be providing, if given say, just one SIMPLE boost ...<P>... allow charm song to be used on higher level NPC's.  Suddenly the bard is able to deal damage rivaling that of any warrior, at the cost of getting the crap kicked out of him when charm breaks.  As you should well know, getting a level ~56 npc off you once you've ultra taunted him (charm is probably the worste taunt I can thnk of) is extremely difficult.  I'd say the risk is definitely there, and if the bard is willing to try it, the reward is well worth it.<P>-Desbarolis -- 46th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Before anything else, I would like to say that some of the recent changes to bards have been quite positive most notably the xp penalty lifted and the Song of Twilight fix.  I have played a bard to lv 54 and as such feel that slowly the precious balance you guys are seeking is almost present in bards.<P>First off let's start with songs...<P>Damage Songs <BR>Chords of Dissonance, Brusco's Boa****l Bellow, Denon's Disruptive Discord, Denon's Desperate Dirge, Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Chant of Frost, Tuyen's Chant of Flame<P>These songs worked wonderfully pre 50+ and pre kunark.  With the release of the new expansions however, which saw mobs getting exponentially tougher the actual use of these songs greatly diminished.  The damage these songs can do now are quite laughable if you take the option of using these songs instead of party affecting songs.  For the chant line, the only times i pull them out is when solo, or when in a no tank pet group.  The only time I pull out the AE songs are for AE groups and even then the damage contribution from the songs are not exemplary.<P>Suggestions - damage songs need to do more damage.  I think the code of most of the songs should be rewritten for the 50+ game as the incremental increase we get in song preformance doesn't scale at all with the monsters we face.  Also, Brusco's Boa****l Bellow could really use an increase in range.  We understand that the idea behind this song is to give bards an extra attack similar to kick or bash, but the true value of this song is actually the opportunity to use it more like an arrow than as a kick.<P>Travel Songs<BR>Selo's Accelerando, Selo's Song of Movement, Melanie's Manifulous Motion, Tarrew's Aquatic Ayre, Ayria's Song of Eagles, Shauri's Sonorous Clouding<P>We love the run songs.  We love them so much we vehemently disagreed with you when you said that they were not integral to bard play when you decided not to put an emergency patch to fix them.<BR>For the most part I am happy with the selections of travel songs.<P>Suggestions - Only 2 songs i feel need a little work.  Selo's Song of Travel the problem with this song is that it's one buff that gives multiple benefits removing one benefit removes all.  This wouldn't be a problem if the z-axis aggro wasn't so buggy.  As it stands now mobs that can hit you when your thousands of feet in the air end up hitting you for 30k damage when you fall.  This also presents a problem when using this song in a group as if 1 member gets hit the rest of the group will end up moving way ahead of them.  Would it be possible to make 1 song produce multiple buffs that way individual components wouldn't break each other.  MMM is another song that befuddles most bards.  The difficulties of this song are very similar to the complaints other classes have been having with shadow step.  In a group situation it gets worse as the song randomly scatters the group in different directions. <P>Resist Songs<BR>Elemental Rhythms, Guardian Rhythms, Psalm of Mystic Shieldings, Psalm of Warmth, Psalm of Cooling, Purifying Rhythms, Psalm of Vitality, Psalm of Purity.<P>These resist songs have the potential to be awesome =)  When I first noticed how strong these resists could be when i first got a MM drum i was absolutely impressed.  The problem is that our resist songs have such minimal benefit given a properly equipped character and using non bard resist buffs.  Adding to this problem is the fact that most encounters that call for the type of resists a bard can produce are the same ones that call for characters to be properly equipped and properly buffed.<P>Suggestions - make extremely high resists mean something.  Allow the bard resist songs to be of precious value to groups that go on encounters needing resists.  Additionally, it would be awesome to put together themed dungeons that would make use of bard resist songs in dungeon situations rather than just big encounters. Case in point 2 dungeons that i have tons of fun in are kedge keep and the vampire bats area of the tower of frozen shadow, why?  Because these 2 dungeons allow me to use very specialized songs (jig o vigor and tarrew's aquatic ayre) and make them assets to a group.  For such temperature crazy places like Naggy's Lair, and Permafrost, resists only really matter once at the dragon inside.<P>Crowd Control Songs<BR>Crission's Pixie Strike, Solon's Bewitching Bravura, Kellin's Lugubrious Lament, Lullabye, Lower Level Charm Song (i forget the name), Song of Twilight and Song of Dawn<P>First a big thank you for fixing SoT.  This song is the song I"m having the most fun with since I got the early level charm.  First, the mez and charm level caps are a little unnecessary considering that it's possible to flag npcs as mezzable or charmable.  Bards have fun doing crowd control =).  Crowd control is the one time that a bard actually gets to strut his/her stuff in a profound and noticeable manner.<P>Suggestions - i know how hesitant you are at extending the crowd control powers a bard has.  I think it's time you define just exactly how much crowd control a bard should have, I personally believe that giving us a no-mana, refreshable, AE mez is a little too powerful.  I also understand though that it is not too powerful to give us some form of AE mez.  There is a compromise that can be achieved but i'm at a lost for a solution.  Lament (sad song) needs a little more range.  A song that reduces aggro radius is a little useless if it's range is within the aggro radius of mobs.  Song of Dawn, the main prolbem with song of dawn is that the aggro of bard songs have been greatly reduced (thank you =)) making this song a little on the useless side.  I'd suggest making this a mem blur but I think that may make it too powerful.<P>Haste and Slows<BR>Anthem de Arms, Berserker Crescendo, Jonathan's Whistling War Song, Verses of Celerity, Verses of Vitctory, Melody of Ervaj, Selo's Consonant Chain,  Largo's Melodic Binding, Selo's Chors of Cessation, Largo's Absonant Binding<P>The main problem with these songs are the stacking issues and the viability of bard play with an enc or shaman.  This is going to be the focus of many of a bard post here so I'm sure you guys know all about this.<P>Buff Songs<BR>Chant of Battle, Niv's Melody of Preservation, Int/Wis Buff, Jonathan's Provocation, Shield of Song, Nillipus March of the Wee<P>I think most of these songs are quite satisfactory save for a few problems.  First would be songs that have a rune component to them need to be looked at a little more thoroughly.  March of the Wee in particular between the 24-27 additional ac i can provide with it and the tiny rune component to it...the ac is much more beneficial.  The problem being that if the rune effect is used up the whole buff goes with it.  <P>Suggestions - i'd suggest upping the primary effect of the songs that have a rune component in exchange for eliminating the rune effect completely.  Song of Shields is another song that has to be looked at quite carefully.  a 40 pt. no mana, component free, instrument implemented rune. Personally i think that 40pts. is a little low.  I think that the rune should be allowed to go as high as 70pts. before it begins to even tread the waters of being unbalanced.  Also, this song should have some form of message returned to the bard when it's sung.   <P>Downtime Reduction Songs<BR>Hymn of Restoration, Cantana of Soothing, Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity.<P>Sadly, these songs have become the songs that bard have become most famous for.  Sad because these are also generally the songs that provide the least entertainment for the bard =(.   <P>Suggestion - i think hymn of restoration was done perfectly...it's a decent 12 second hp regenerator.  Mana regenerators however work in bursts meaning every 3 second burst adds mana so for a bard to use these songs at optimum he would have to dedicate his entire twist to 1 song.  Mana song as well as soothing should provide increased mana regeneration for the same 12 second span that most bard songs do.<BR>  <BR>Utility Songs<P>Jig of Vigor, Lyssa's Locating Lyric, Anstlich's Appaling Screech, Lyssa's Veracious Concord, Lyssa's Solidarity of Vision, Identify Song, Aiena's Disenchanting Melody, Sylvenia's Anti-Magic Aura, Cinda's Charismatic Carillion<P>As a whole i think these songs do what they were intended to do.  And for the times that i have had the need to use them they have served their purpose well.<P>Suggestions - it would be nice to have some party/fun songs.  Ideas that come to mind are group spin the bottle and group group fire works. Or some similar songs that bards can use in town or just goofing around.<P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My one complaint about the bard concerns right-clickable items.<P>They are becoming more and more important in everquest, as well as more common (With the Various new armor sets).<P>Bards are the only "Caster" that has no channeling skill, so a Gnoll Pup that takes a swing at a 60th level bard (and misses) will interupt a clicked item that is being activated.  <P>Like all other spell classes, though, we also are <BR>limited in that we cannot play songs while activating an item.  This hits bards harder then the rest, because they are ALWAYS casting.  If we take 5 seconds to use a crystalized pumice, thats 1 song out of 3 songs we cannot provide our group, while other casters buffs are uneffected.<BR> <BR>It would be nice if bards at least got a token channeling skill, so using them is not so difficult.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greet's Absor,<P>Unsure if you'll get around to this post, but if you do... you've got a lot of patience.<P>Anyway, I'll be honest: I didn't read all of posts prior to mine... no matter how much I love the bard class, I don't want to read multiple equations that say how bad we are, and also read on how bad we are post-50.  I've personally never made it post-45, and have never been on a dragon or plane run, so I'm unsure on everything these guys say.  So if I repeat something that has already been said on this chat, please forgive me and my lack of attention.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>However, your first summary of bard talk caught my eye, and it was this section that did it:<P>[b]Absor wrote:[/b]<P>[i]Here's how it goes.<P>Bards, shadow knights and paladins are the defensive hybrids and they get the defensive stuff. They will not get both double attack AND dual wield. Rangers are the offensive hybrid, and they get both skills (I think…) and in exchange they lose out on the defensive skills.[/i]<P>I'd have to respectfully disagree with you when you say that Bards are a defensive hybrid.  I've got some ideas that have been bogglin' around in my head to back up my opinion:<P>First of all, Bards are the product of a Rogue father and an Enchanter mother, not a Warrior father.  Since the rogue class is mainly an offensive class (I don't see how they can be classified anywhere as a defensive class), and the Enchanter is tie between offense and defense, I don't see why Bards can't be considered the weaker offensive hybrid.<P>Take for instance our skills.  Probably the only defensive skill most of us bards will ever see will be dodge, which we get at our 10th level.  The rest of our defensive skills (I.E. Parry and Riposite) we get post-50.  You guys at Verant added those in during the Kunark Era as a sort-of present for us bards who made it so far.  However, the skills stop at 75, far too low for them to do any good.  Anyway, it's common knowledge that bards shouldn't be in the melee at that level anyway... but if we really were defensive hybrids, we should be, huh?<P>Now take a look at our offensive side.  We don't get any special attack (That is, Kick or Bash), but we do get Dual Wield, one of the four classes in the game to get it.  This is a heavily offensive skill, no?  Plus, a large portion of our songs are very offensive.  We have numerous DoT and DD songs, along with haste songs, which are used for offensive purposes.  It's pretty clear to most of us bards that we can dish out a lot more damage than we can absorb.  With this in mind, I don't see how you can say that we're a defensive hybrid.<P>My solutions to problems are never really good, but if I point out a problem and not provide a solution, I'm just a part of the problem.  So I'd propose that you could remove a couple of the Bard's skills and add on a few more offensive skills.  Double Attack would really be nice, but it may be a little too much.  Bard weapons as nice as a Ranger's are rare, if they even exist.  Also, our weapon skills and offensive skills max out far lower than any Ranger's, so it is also clear that we could never out-damage any Ranger when it came to melee.  I think it'd be safe for the game if you added something for melee bards.  Say you added Double Attack, and removed... I don't know, Riposite and Sense Traps/Disarm Traps.  Put a cap for Double Attack at about 100, or 150.<P>Actually, I think it'd be better if you guys would remove Dual Wield entirely and replace it with Double Attack.  Therefore, us melee bards could have the same attack chances, but have a slot open for a shield.  I don't know if this would be unbalancing, though, but isn't it strange that the defensive hybrids are usually the ones using the shields?  If bards really are defensive hybrids, we should be able to use our main attack skill while using a shield.<P>I'm just repeating myself now, I notice.  Must be late...<P>Anyway, I'll move on to one more subject before I head to bed.  If you actually read this far in my post, Absor, you've more patience than I thought most would have.<P>The Despirate Dirge really is a waste of a spell slot/mana.  I actually got high enough to try out this song, and only used it once.  As a young bard, I looked up this song, saw what it did, and thought that it'd be great as a last-resort lifesaver.  Once I got it, I joined a group in my second home, Lower Guk.  I told all the members that if we got a pull that was out of hand, I'd handle it.  Just happens we got one of those, so I cue up the dirge (What I used to call my, excuse my french, "OH $#!T Song"), and hit all the froggies for a good 320 damage each.  I smile to myself, excited that I kinda nuked like a wizard for a moment, and hit for 1280 damage on one song.  Then I noticed that everything was still over half life and was concentrating on me.  Thats all I remembered as I blacked out.<P>Anyway, my suggestion to fix the dirge (Since it really is useless, I'd have to honestly say) is to set it on a timer.  However, I'd add in something to make the song a little more fun.  Say that the lower the bard's health is, the faster the song becomes castable.  This fits in with the song's name: It's a despiration tactic, use it when times are despirate.  A bard with 100 health left would be in a very despirate situation, indeed.<P>Better yet, make it so that this song does more damage proportionate to the bard's health.  If the bard is down to 20% life, have the song do 180% normal damage.  If down to 50% health, have the song do 150% damage.  And if the bard is at full health, just have it do its regular 100% damage.<P>I think these are some fun ideas to play with dirge, but may be a bit unbalancing and perhaps too difficult to code.  However, if any of you other bards could think of some other solution, I'd love to hear it to improve on mine.<P>Well... the bed calls, g'night bardic brothers.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ensis Arament<BR>Drunken Bard of Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>1) Selo's and SoW don't work together. A player will need to click off SoW to get the benefit of Selo's, which is almost always faster.  Selo's should supress, not overwrite it.  I like to help with corpse recoveries and having people turn off their SoW so they can get the benefits I can give them is cumbersome.<P>2) Illusions on Bards (ie: mask of deception) can't be turned off except for zoning.  This should a click off effect.<P>3) Fear songs should overwrite each other.  When grouping with my enchanter friend we've found that if my bard fear is on a mob, his fear will be resisted. This is bad when we're going for the zone and his longer lasting fear is blocked by my 'bouncing' fear. ('bouncing' fear because it's short and you can leave it on causing mobs to act like paddleballs.)<P>4) The levitate song needs to supress, not overwite, existing levitates on people.  Currently if I levitate an enchanter in air elemental form they lose their levi when I stop.  Not realizing this they'll sometimes plummet off bridges or over cliffs...sad...or funny. =)<P>5) In regards to the comment that it's probably not common for the 'song overlap' bug to occur, that would be wrong.  I have it happen to me constantly.  Either when I'm fearing or snaring mobs and they break out immediately after it's cast or when selo's doesn't stick properly and needs to be re-pulsed to stick. The reason the problem is more common than it may seem is because of how frequently bards need to recast songs that overlap themsleves to stay 'fresh'.<P>I don't have any 'debate team' logic to apply to this but I enjoy having items with illusions that bards can use.  They're cool, they're fun and I don't see how they unbalance the class.  They're great to hunt for.  It's a real feeling of accomplishment to have one.<P>Personally, I would like to see bards raised to HUGE heights of power!...but realistically I just want to be able to group with my enchie pal and have our songs/spells work well together.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My two cents from the perspective of a 46 bard.<P>Balance - Up to 46, I feel like our class is balanced (with one exception mentioned below).  Not overpowered, not underpowered.  The power of a bard is subtle and not always obvious.<P>Role and "The Vision" - Bards were designed to be the ultimate groupers.  Our songs are not meant for individual glory, but rather to inspire others to greater heights.  We should be always welcome in a group.  Unfortunately, the claim to the most group friendly class has to go to the enchanter.  This changing of the guard took place when enchanters got clarity and everyone figured out just how darn good enchanters were.  Not saying we are totally useless, but with an enchanter in the group we really don't have much of a role and are not needed.  Their group friendly mez, haste, slow, clarity are far superior to ours.  <P>Balance suggestions - 1. Nerf enchanters! (just kidding)  2. Make our haste/slow songs stack with enchanters/shamans.  This would give a group a reason to take a bard even with an enchanter in the group.  This also goes along well with our role, a bards song should stack with everything.<P>Any changes to the bard class should be made with the following in mind.  Don't make us stronger, make us make our group stronger!<P>Other Important Issues<P>CARPAL TUNNEL - any high level bard has this.  Make it so we can do some downtime twisting automatically.  Bards will still be twisting in combat to better manage being bashed, stunned, and missed notes.  This won't effect balance in the least but will keep customers pain free. <P>Bard Particle effects -  Can't turn em off.  They can be very laggy, not to mention annoying.  Give users the option to turn them off.<P>Bard Icons - Anyone grouped with a bard has these icons constantly blinking while they are solid for the bard.  This is annoying as all heck, like to be able to turn the icons off or have them stay solid as they do for the bard.<P>Mana Regeneration - Our clarity songs should affect ourselves.  All our other songs do.  Also, we should have full mana when we die, it does take THAT long to get it back at present.<P>Finally, kudos to Verant for the bard class.  We are a totally unique class that is a blast to play.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just thought of a fun lil' thing before I went to the realm of dreams.  Bards are usually jesters, fools, so forth... they should be fun, no?  Why not give them some songs and skills to play around with?  Maybe a skill that had voice graft?  I mean, we could call it 'Throwing Our Voices', or something.  This is a want, not a need, though.  But it'd be fun and could help with RPing experiences.  Make it useable on players, too!

</FONT><HR>1st off, I would like to say this post might very well anger alot of bards, I myself dont play a bard, but I know quite a few people, ranging from played since the game started to newbies.  2nd off, keeping in mind of this post, a bard is very hard to play well, and there seem to be hardware limits on how good a bard can be, twisting of songs comes to mind, and after saying that, I have met a great number of good bards, and a great number of bad bards..  This variance is much larger than other classes, where a warrior that doesnt taunt and protect casters is not all that terrible, but not the greatest warrior. <P>  The main difference in bards that I can see is soloing ability. I will not argue that bards are the 3rd best soloer, mages and necros being above them. ( I have a mage and necro so I see the ability of soloing in these classes.. ). Mages and Necros can solos reds sometimes, where I dont think bards can, though I might be wrong about this. But, what bards have over mages and necros is the very low down time after soloing things ( twinking aside in this discussion.)  Bards have little down time when soloing and also have very little risk of death because of Selo's song..  This makes soloing very efficient for them and VERY low risk. This seems out of place when Verant wants to encourage grouping.. <BR>Mainly what I see and hear is the charm combos that exist.. Charm one mob, have it attack another, kill the 2nd mob, and finish off what is left of the badly damaged mob.. And lets say a bunch of resists come about during this? Well, fire up Selos and zone... We all know that bards outrun just about anything in the game, and they have the AC to back up the melee damage that they will take if stuff goes bad. The second main tactic, DoT the target and kite them around the whole zone... Another very popular tactic.. The reason I say there is a large gap between good bards and bad bards is because all the good bards I have talked to know of these tactics, and know of twisting 3 sometimes 4 songs.. All the bad bards have not even touched on these tactics.. I have met bards that have solo'ed up to 40th and beyond, when the only threat of dying was when they were in a group and they felt they should stay around and try to help the group out of a bad situation.. Other than that, I have met bards that have a zero,( and they actually say zero) risk of death when they solo..<BR> <BR>Now, that I have said that, if you do change it so that bards' soloing capacity is lowered, you should re-evaluate the grouping potential for bards.. Give them a appreciable lvl of melee damage to do in melee.. Lets say get them ranked like 4th or 5th.. Seeing as the contribute to the group in other ways, this wont be too boring for them.. I dont know how to go about this for bards, because all the good bards I talk to dont group, all the bad ones never get to 20th lvl.. *grin  Hope this post did not anger too many people, and that it helped give another insight into problems that help bards..<P>-Curufinn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Fix our drums. Waving a flute around is stupid and really makes us bards feel left out of the little cool stuff that gets tweaked for other classes. The tambourine was a very nice touch. I would rather all drums looked like that then a flute.<P>2. Do not take away duel weild. (I know you didnt suggest this, but other bards seem to be, I just wanted to let you know that some bards like duel weild) I would much rather be holding 2 cool weapons than 1 cool weapon and hitting twice. Without being able to weild 2HB or 2HS weapons double attack isn't doing us a whole lot of good anyway.<P>3. The werewolf effect item. If you are going to take away an effect that enchanters feel they should monopolize, what about monk effects that summon, and other right click effects that belong to a different class? I've never seen you say that those items deserve a nerf (Yet you yourself had said that items that have other classes effects on them aren't cool), but a bard item that very few are ever going to get (NO DROP at that) is not infringing on chanters (I'll leave the mana regen argument alone). <P>Absor you have a really good chance to make some bard friends here. But most (not all) of the things I have seen you agree on for us are bugs that shouldn't exist anyways. And maybe its a little late and you need some coffee  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> but your attitude seems to be more of "OK I'm listening, but only cause I have to." <P>If you think bards are balanced, or need to be decreased in effectiveness then you should watch how hard a bard works to add to a group, and then tell me that we dont need any enhancements. I've heard it many times where a person says bards are the only class that depend more on the skill of the person playing them than the equipment they wear. I like that. I like to know that a group wants me beause they know "I'M" effective, not because I'm a one trick pony. <P>Styrbjorn Dangerhorn<BR>Lv 34 Bard of Prexus<BR>Member and Officer of &lt; Alliance of the Blade&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>   I'd like to start off by stating that I *LOVE* the bard class.  Even the songs which duplicate skills/spells of other class are unique in their execution (songs, rather than spells).<P>   It's a complicated class.  Played skillfully, I think it's the most powerful class in the game.  Played poorly, it's a wandering ball of suckitude =)<P>   I can't speak on high-level bard issues, because I keep starting on new servers (but always play bards), though I'm pretty qualified to comment on the pre-level 30 issues.<P>** Melee Offense: Bards frequently complain that their combat skills aren't up to par with the other hybrids.  I think they forget about the 25% haste that warsong gives.  If you translate that into a skill, it means that bards have double attack that goes off once in every 4 swings.  Combined with dual wield, it means that bards are still capabale of doing decent damage.  Less than all other hybrids, but still more than any non melee/hybrid character.  With stronger magic than other hybrids receive, and the ability to use it while moving, I think their offensive output in melee damage is pretty well balanced.<P>** Melee Defense: The ability to wear platemail gives bards a decent AC.  Their HP are the equivalent of a rogue's, which I don't deem to inappropriate.  Problems most frequently occur when in a group, fighting multiple mobs.  Efficiency dictates that everyone target the same mob, to bring it down faster.  This results in all mobs not being targetted going agro on the bard.  Even when it's just 2 or 3 mobs, it's 2 or 3 mobs continuously ganged up on, and bashing the bard.  They don't have the defense skills to withstand this punishment for too long.  My big issue isn't the damage I take, it's the BASHING.  Bash cancels my singing, whether I get stunned or not.  Possible counter-balance: bard songs interrupted by stuns, but not bashes.<P>** Song issues: (again, this is just pre-30 experience).  The mez song, level 15.  The big problem I have with this song is that the mez effect is cancelled if you move at ALL.  So if 4 mobs jump the party, and you successfully mez 3, and the one remaining one bashes you or has a melee attack that pushes you back, it CANCELS the mez on all the other targets.  This effectively makes the song useless, because unless you're fighting stuff that can't bash, you can't keep anything mezzed.  Possible fix: make it so that mobs stay mezzed unless you move a more significant distance away.  Also, I believe the duration of the mezz is only 6 seconds.  Increasing it to 8 or so might help some too, for those bards with laggy internet connections.<P>   Guardian Rythms (Level 18 song).  Can someone double check the magic absorption on this song?  It doesn't seem very significant, and I'm hard pressed to ever use it in lieu of the lower level elemental/purifying rythms.  I'm of the opinion that it's higher level, so it should be better, but that doesn't seem to be the case.<P>   Mellifluous motion (Level 21 song).  Can the group please all go to the same place?  Currently, every member of a group teleports randomly.  It's a great spell for getting away from mean PvP people, or getting a head-start when a fight goes bad, but when trying to use it in a group situation it gets nasty when the cleric teleports 300 meters north, and the warrior 200 meters southwest.  <P>   Selo's accelerando (level 5 song).  Currently can be used outdoors only (by design).  Can a somewhat slower indoor variant song be added to the game, or can the current one be tweaked to work indoors at a slower speed increase?  Spirit of wolf can be cast outdoors, and remains active when you zone into an indoor area.  It would add to our attractiveness in a group if we could speed things up a little bit in a dungeon w/o having to zone out every 45 mins to recast.<P>** Other Races: It's a wierd issue to bring up, but some of the other races would seem well suited to the bard class (most notably: halflings (their creator IS the patron diety of bards) and barbarians (Skalds, anyone?).  Even ogre war-drummers wouldn't be too unimaginable (although pretty funny =).  It would also help spread members of this class around a bit more on the team pvp servers (currently only 2 teams have access to them).  Yes, some races have high str, but most of the bard's ability lies in their songs, and those big races have low dex / cha that they'd need to dump most of their starting points into to be reasonably effective.  <P>** Religion: Except for Zixx Nenixx (who used to spawn inside Paw before it was changed), I haven't seen ANY Npc's on Antonica/Odus/Faydwyr. who belong to Ring of Scale (Veeshan Religion).  The gypsy fortune teller in Qeynos says that there's someone in the city, but I haven't seen anyone.  Would be nice to have a couple dragon cultists floating around SOMEWHERE =)  Likewise, on the trade skill scene, need an imbue setup for Veeshan worshippers (this may be in the works for next trade patch though).<P>** Items: Guise series - these are SOOOOO cool.  Every bard / rogue I know who has one of the masks adores it =)  Might look at more of these, for either other races, or for zone specific monsters (like a guise of the Fey that works outdoors-only and turns you into pixies in Faydark, mermaids in Oot/crossing, wisp in commonlands/tox, etc).  <P>** Skills: A skill to assemble those instrument pieces would be great.  Would also generate a possible cultural niche for half-elves (all bards can make intruments, half-elves could make cultural magic ones or colored ones or something).<P>** Bugs: If you're on a slow internet connection (dial-up), it's possible to receive a &lt;song effect wore off&gt; message immediately after receiving a &lt;song effect generated&gt; message.  This mainly occurs when twisting.  As an example, you might be twisting accelerando (run fast) and restoration (regen).  You sing accelerando, then restoration twice (two song pulses).  You go to sing accelerando again, receive the "your feet move faster" message, and then immediately receive "you slow down" and you start running slow again.  I never have this problem when playing from work (T3 lines) but it happens frequently at home (56K dialup).  <P>** Serious balance issue: Bard NPC's fight like pieces of poop.  Seriously, make a test character, and go beat on Misty storyswapper in West Karana, or Vhalen Nostrolo in South Karana.  They do like no melee damage (compared to a monster of the same level) because they don't have double attack, and they don't sing any of their songs.  NPC bards should twist selo's accelerando and something else (maybe hymn of restoration, or one of the anti-magic songs, or johnathan's whistling warsong, etc) at all times.  I mean seriously, it's embarassing, and it gives bards a bad reputation when every NPC in the game with the same class as you can't fight their way out of a wet sack.  People end up camping them 24/7 because they're such easy XP.<P>** Overall analysis: GREAT class. Songs DRASTICALLY reduce downtime, whether playing solo, or in a group.  Songs enable the option to play effectively solo, or in a group.  Travel songs help make up for lack of gates / teleports.  Combat skills are strong enough to warrant involvement in fights, but not so strong as to encroach upon the turf of pure melee / hybrid characters.  Faction changing songs enable participation in a HUGE variety of quests (my half-elf can walk around inside Neriak WITHOUT her guise of deception on), which helps keep the class fun to play, even when not in pursuit of all-consuming levelling.  A couple songs need some fine-tuning (especially the mez song, which could be REALLY useful if it worked right, and didn't get cancelled on all mobs every time you get bashed), but overall I -LOVE- the songs we get.  We get to do a little of everything all the other classes do (wear the best looking armor, use the coolest weapons, dual wield, run fast, weave magic, heal, etc), but not so much that we're ever better at the classes to whom the skill belongs (except for running fast, of course.  But we ARE the messengers of Norrath).<P>- Syll<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just off the top of my head, some issues:<P>1) Bards are a plate class. Your responses seem to be full of contradictions regarding this issue. You state that we are a plate class, yet we can't wear a number of generic-class plate armors (Royal Frosted, Jasarth, all of the plate class shields from Sky, VP, and all of Velious, etc.) You state that we are supposed to be a defensive hybrid, yet we aren't even supposed to get the same AC from a piece of armor that a cleric does. You state that you want to increase the Defense caps for us, but you're unwilling to change our armor pieces to match the AC that the other plate hybrids get.<BR>I do realize that going through the item database and fixing all of these sets of armor is not a trivial task, but VI incorrectly giving bard armor chain AC is a long term problem. In fact, VI viewing bards as a chain class isn't limited to just item creation, but NPC creation as well - there isn't a single bard NPC in the game dressed in plate.<P>2) Bards are an int based mana class. Yet the imbured armor set from Hate has 14 points of Wisdom attached to it, even though Wisdom has no effect on bards. Change the Wisdom to Int, or if that would result in too much Int on the set, change the wisdom to Int & Cha or Int & Cha & Str.<P>3) Fironia Vie trainer. Bards are the only class that do not have a trainer in Kunark, even though we are the only class that gets abilities post-50 that must be trained. I realize the trainers were left in on accident, but the present-day reality is that we are the only class without a trainer when we arguably need it the most. <P>4) Temple of Sol Ro weapon quest. Since the day the Temple of Sol Ro zone opened, one of the bard quest NPCs has stated something to the effect of "Check back later for information on a special bard only weapon." It's been over a year since the zone opened and this hasn't changed. Please remove the text from the NPC. <P>5) Fironia Vie instrument vendor. Since the release of Kunark, there has not been an instrument vendor in FV - instead, there is an instrument parts vendor. However, since instrument crafting was never implemented, the vendor is useless. Please switch the instrument parts vendor to an instrument vendor.<BR>Similarly, why are there no instrument vendors in Velious? I am not positive if there are other class specific vendors (such as gem merchants, alchemy component vendors,etc) in those three towns, but if there are, why do bards not get vendors in Velious as well?<P>6) Possible spell creation error - all of the Velious songs are instrument REQUIRED, not instrument OPTIONAL. Was this really intended to be the case? Considering how we already have to drop a song out of our 3 song rotation to put them in, plus the fact that they are dropped, not sold, unlike every other bard song, the instrument REQUIRED tag makes them far less useful to us than they could be (this is not mentioning whether the songs are even useful in and of themselves, which others have pointed out).<BR>Also, our 49 song, Shield of Songs, has a casting sound and does not display a text message to anyone in the group, unlike every other bard song.<P>7) High end Kunark songs. Many of the high end bard songs are very weak (both for their level and in terms of their opportunity cost (we have to drop a song out of our 3 song rotation to use them)). For instance, one of our 59 songs is +45 charisma. A bard dealing with a NPC can get far better price adjustment by using his faction song (acquired at only level 11), and a bard in combat would see only slightly lower resist rates for mes, but at a cost of 1/3rd of his song capacity - leading to the song having very little utility. Many of the other threads here also detail other underpowered songs acquired at the high end.<P>Granted, most of the points in this post are far less important than the points raised in previous posts (except for the plate class AC issue), but they are pending (some of which are very long term) issues. <P>-Kaeln</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One other note:<P>** Testing: Please either assign someone at Verant to familiarize themself with the class and test the effect of any new patches on the bard class, or find a couple reliable test-server playing bards who can provide you with feedback.  It's become an all too common scenario that a patch unintentionally screws up a bard song, and has to be repaired in the following patch (like when drums stopped working, or when levitate wouldn't take effect and bards fell out of the sky, etc).  I'll admit that the class is wierd (that's why I love it), but bugs keep slipping by that are always related to bards =P  You could even add a /bardbug command to the test server, so that bards could report any new issues in the most efficient manner, hehe.<P>- Syll</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a lvl 50 bard, I love the class, but I've been playing less and less becuse my carpal tunnel is killing me, I have been playing a monk, warrior and necro, and not liking it half as much, being a bard is challenging and exciting.<P>Judging by the 'just because bards are plate class they shouldn't  have the same AC as other plate classes'.  We don't want warrior AC, but plate AC should be higher than chain AC, if an equal drop (i.e. hate or fear drop) is Chain it should never have more AC than the plate, unless its pathetic plate.  <P>On a side note, its a riot to Roleplay a bard, I love making people laugh and I love when I'm introduced as "the funniest guy on the server".  Bards can be tricksters, so instead of backstab, could we trade one of our worthless songs, (or an additional one) for some humorous ones, like the lvl 51 travel song, but make us appear to levitate upsidedown (would be a good PoM drop eh?).  I like the summon party stuff Mages got.  Heck if you replaced the SS BP's effect with summon Kalish I think bards would appreciate it more.<P>One last note, Mana, I've never run out, even when charm kiting, the only time I use mana is when I'm killed during a raid (bound in Gfay), I run over to the bandits and Dirge all 3, and split the coin with group members so we'll have something on our corpse.<P>Even if I'm walking C2, I still enjoy being a bard, but you gotta do something to make it require less keystrokes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many things i wanted to bring up has been brought up so I wont go in detail on them.<P>aoe mez<P>desprate derge--never have memed because it takes all mana --put on timer or no timeer and reduce power take out the aoe component<P>ss effects--what were you thinking? Every class has awsome effects but bards summon food whater invigor eye of zom etc does anyone at the station play a bard?????<P>In 48 levs ive never had anyone ask me for any certain buff "can you play dex for me" why because a lev 1 shaman has compareble buffs to a 48 bard. All of our songs the buffs speed, stat etc are very low, granted they stack with shamans but no one cares because most times you not grouped with one. And if you have lag you can not hit all the stats or if you have to stop to mez or give extra clarity the tanks are no longer buffed.<P>Give us meditate at a respectable lev. And have a couple spells that will last the same as other classes such as Self only invis and levitate ( lag hits and you are in dungeon or over some gorge guess what you dead, go ld in same places you dead)  Also i think we should get a few other such as snare and root. <P>Root is more effective crowd control than a single target mez that lasts 8 seconds ( against non casting mobs)<P>OUR DEFENSE IS A JOKE--need more defense, more dodge, parry at lower lev and have it top out higher than 75!!<P>Taunts on songs are more than any group of other tanks can keep off me ( with dots ) and singing just buffs one taunting tank cannt keep mob off the weak defense bard.<P>Ping or lag is what allows bards to juggle NOT EVERONE lives in city with DSL or CABLE  which means some bards can get 3 songs or have lag and be down to 2 songs and in raids be down to 1 song because of how many people are around us, in zone, spells goin off etc.  -- how to change this  make songs last longer from 12 seconds to 30 seconds put a cap on how many songs can be sung at once. So all bards can juggle as well no matter your connection all parties can benifit as much and a bard might even be able to return tells given to him instead of constantly juggling for hours on end---Or do as was posted above and put in a auto juggler ( which i would prefer at least on party buffs )<P>I dont know what you think you should "nerf" except possible Desprate Durge to make it actually usable.<P>I'M TIRED OF BEING A WALKING MANA BATTERY!! GIVE SOME REASONS TO BE INVITED BESIDES CLARITY. SONGS SO WEEK COMPARED TO OTHER CLASSES WE NOT INVITED FOR BUFFS. ROOT WORKS BETTER THAN MEZ SO WHY HAVE BARD MEZ? JUST ROOT IT. DONT PLAY BUFFS GIVE MANA SO SHAMAN CAN BUFF THEN WE WILL WAIT SO HE CAN HEAL US. <P>Basically bards are weak weak weak shamans with very short mez and charm. Help us while you can.<BR>I play my bard as my main because i love the concept so plz take this oppertunity to make the calss as great as the concept.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good my lord Absor,<BR>Its late, I'm tired, and I'm stuck in roleplay mode, so bear with me a moment.  Please consider 1st those items mentioned as coming from the Concert Hall.  We bards all post there regularly on issues important to us and it is the most respected place I know on the www that discusses valid issues relating to bards.  The fact that som many posted ideas pre-discussion should give you some idea as to how important we feel it is that you are giving us this opportunity to speak to you.<P>I am a 27th level bard.  My bard is my main character and my most beloved.  All my opinions should be viewed in this context of my (still) limited experience and level of play.<P>The issues I would stress and suggestions I would make would be as follows:<P>1. melee: please look into increasing our ability to melee.  Currently, we fight about as well as casters.  Even rogues, themselves not a melee class, are better in combat than we are.  I know this is supposed to be balance by our songs, but at my present level, I should be better than I am in combat.  I'm not asking to be as good as warriors, but something close to rangers or paladins, both of whom I'll add get to use ranged weapons, would be nice.  Others have suggested giving us double attack, or lowering the level we get parry/riposte.  The post I thought made sense suggested giving us evade, perhaps as early as 30-35.  We bards are supposed to be nimble, after all....why not let us be nimble.<P>2. Let me add my voice to the MANY that think that drums should look like drums.  I have seen some terrific graphics, even before Velious (soulfire comes to mind, and the shaman spear)  I cannot believe that it would be so difficult to alter the drum graphic that it cannot be done.<P>3.  Unlike others who have praised our 27 Charm song, I think it needs work.  I tried it out for the 1st time against some very green mobs to practice.  The song is a target only, pulse song that cannot be renewed until the effect has worn off.  Okay, I don't mind that its target only (so I can't charm all the children of Hamlin, just that little git that threw the rock at me), I don't even mind that its a pulse song (so is Chains) But what really irritates me is that I cannot renew it until AFTER the effects have vanished.  That is ridiculous.  I would even prefer you to make it a "instrument required" song to fix that problem.<P>4. It would be nice on all our fingers if our songs lasted just a little bit longer than 3-6 seconds.  Adding 3 seconds to the effect would be very nice, and I don't think it would unbalance bards as to other casters or classes.<P>5.  Singing Steel is both an ugly color and has silly effects.  My recommendation would be to alter the stats of SS along the lines suggested in this thread.  If you really NEED to have boots you can pour water out of, may I suggest a questable low-mid (teens, 20s) level armor, AC like leather or slightly better, that has some of these effects?  Call it Fenster's Pointy shoes, Belled Cap, Motley Sleeves, Jester's Jerkin, Colorful Pantaloons, and use that cool Velious graphics stuff to make it cool looking rather than just another color of leather/chain/plate (my only issue with Lambent which I otherwise love).<P>By the time I'll be able to hunt for SS, I'll already be able to heal the whole party better than the BP can heal just me.  I have already maxed out forrage, and so getting no rent food just seems silly.  If the bracer works like the fishbone earring, then thats cool, but the other effects I have heard of sound ridiculous when you consider what SS is supposed to be: our uber armor.<P>6.  I'd like to see more low-mid level bardic quests.  You guys did a great job with low level quests (drums in Gfaydark, the postal system, etc) but once you get to about 8th level, there are really no good quests for bards to do.  The next group comes with the lambent quests, which is 22 levels away.<P>I'm too tired to think of anything else that I would suggest.  But Absor, many Verant employees have either flat-out stated that they don't understand bards, or have demonstrated that they don't through their posts.  Please, listen to use who have the experience in playing this class, when we tell you what changes need to be made.  There is a reason that bards are a complicated class; you've made them that way.  But while I happen to like a challenge and have a penchant for picking underdogs, the complications often become too much, which is why many people wash their bards out in their teens.  <P>I have not seen anything in this thread that I have felt was a complete whine, or was not a good suggestion to balance the class.  Please listen to us.<P>Bright Journey,<P>Odwyn Stormsong<BR>Bard of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, I'd like to say that I had *zero* problems with anything that my bard could do before the addition of Kunark.  I now currently have tossed him aside after gaining two levels into the 50s.<P>I have 56 enchanter, 52 bard and 42 warrior.  I pretty much equiped my warrior by trading all my bard's equipment and moving it over due to the *power curve* they get post 50. Not only from playing my own bard but from grouping with other bards and talking to them, have i made this choice.<P>Here is something that should be able to test quite easily.  Take a level 50 shaman before kunark, and level 50 bard before kunark and give them the class armor/weapons they could have gotten, use a 2hb for shamman.  Use shamans best 3 buffs vs bards best 3 songs.  Then do the same for level 60 up-to-date items/buffs/songs/weapons(don't forget they can use these new spiffy 2hb that are 32/36 and other weapons of that power). I would like to know the difference in damage output just from melee.<P>Bard's shouldn't do as much damage as any *normal* melee but they should be a lot closer to the end of the melee side than to priests.<P>Bard's dual Wield is low, their normal melee abilities are lower than most, 1hs pierce etc etc.  Parry and Riposte cap at....level 14 capabilities?  Guess that might come in handy if a group of 20's need a tank eh =).  Get rid of some of the useless skills, picklock, disarm traps, instill doubt and raise the good ones some, not to normal hybrid standard but at least close behind.   Ranger has the lowest parry besides bards which they get at 18 and caps 110 points higher, 185 compared to 75skill at level 53....<P>Suggestions:<BR>*Let bard's use a weapon in primary hand with instrument at higher levels<BR>*Let them dual weild punching/weapon with instrument at higher levels<BR>*Let them double attack with either both hands or primary only<BR>*Increase the amount of damage hand to hand can do from non-monks, making hands a 7 damage weapon or so wouldn't make them worth using but at least before you can afford to keep weapons for backup, that are worth using, and allow you to hit for more than 15 damage at 100 skill in hand to hand at level 52.<BR>*Increase the amount of weapons bards can use, maybe make focus weapons that add to singing or certain types of instrument based songs but not quite as much as using an instrument.<P><BR>Granted I know this sounds like i mean to make them a normal melee class that can tank like a warrior and damage like a monk but i understand the caps need to be lower and the damage output lower.  I don't expect any of what i said to be implimented but i'm asking at least to give a couple a shot, some are either/or and not both or, that would overpower the class.  But, there is behind the pack and WAY BEHIND THE PACK, i think bards are currently the later. <P>P.S.  I think my bard is one of the 10-15 bards that are 50+ on the server, i believe there is a little more than class difficulty in people's decisions on new characters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;waaaaa&gt;  <P>Sorry, but I find playing my bard so pathetically frustrating that I try to avoid playing him a lot. I have taken an amazingly long time to get to level 30 with my bard because bards are severely underpowered at low to mid levels.  I have a Necromancer that has leveled to 27 in about 1/4 the time and can do amazingly more damage than my bard.  I play my Necromancer to have fun, I play my bard because my friends want me to.  At high levels I cannot give any input yet on my bard...only at level 30 so far.  <P>I realize bards are the only class that can solo a Sand Giant at level 29 (maybe earlier) but to do so you need two be able to find 2 low level Sand Giants and charm one, then find another and recharm.  Make them fight each other and keep an eye on which is winning and make sure to recharm that one next.  This all sounds good in theory but I have only been able to find the needed 2 SG and kill one of them.  I was not even able to loot because of a Lag spike caused me to lose my Selos effect and the SG caught me and killed me really fast.  This is a lot of power for a single class to have but very few bards go out hunting like this.  I think that once your bard hits the low 20 range it is on the average playing field, severely outclassed in almost every way.<P>I know that for the most part people say bards are strong...many of my friends tell me this when they group with me but I KNOW for a fact that I do very little damage in a group.  Just tonight I was grouped with a level 21 enchanter and 21 druid with my 30 bard...when we had 2 MOBs on us they had one killed while I had the other down to a whooping 85% HP (meaning I had only done 15% Damage max.)  I know bards can charm and run and kite forever but like it was said above, that is boring (not to mention it takes forever to do).  I may just be playing the class wrong but I find that by the time I have kited something to low enough health I can melee it to death, there are at least 1 or 2 other mobs chasing me down.  <P>I think we need a guaranteed amount of time on our snare type song.  I am very often in GUK at the bedroom and I am the one responsible for snaring the creatures as they flee...only to be resisted a lot (if I get 2 resist the creature is really close to the point I cannot follow for fear of aggroing more stuff).  I am conning most of the things I fight as blue there at level 30 and I still get resisted about 60% of the time (yes, my skills are maxed) and often when I do not get resisted the snare effect wears off in under one-second.  Please check and adjust this song so it is not resisted so much.  As where my necromancer uses a darkness line of spell and he is getting resisted very little, and his darkness line does both a set amount of Damage AND snares for a set amount of time.  I can cast darkness, cast a set number of spells and know when I need to cast it again because I know how long it last.  <P>The drums were broken recently in a patch...I can understand not doing an emergency patch for that since we could still run fairly fast, but another patch has come and gone and our drums still do not work with Selos.  I feel like I am running around with a low level SOW.  Selos speed is a bards trademark when traveling but we are severely hindered without the use of the drums (plus I cannot run past Druids and Shaman and say "Beep beep!" as I go flying past them....8)  this was something I have come to really love...LOL<P>Bards Lullaby song, it is pretty much useless to me.  I do not use it anymore because it has such a high amount of taunt when it is resisted (which is often)  I can be in the middle of a crowd of XXX mob and sing this song and 3 of the 4 creatures will get mezzed maybe if I am lucky, so I continue singing and it seems that the ones that are mezzed get another saving throw when I pulse the song again, so the first one is attacking me that did not get mezzed, and by the time I get them all mezzed I am almost dead.....then a few seconds later they break again.  This song is resisted way too much since it seems to be a suicide song when it is played.  <P>Our charm song: Works great for what I use it for...saving my warrior when he is getting trashed.  I charm one mob and attack the other...(or to just charm it and give him a small break because when it breaks it will leave him alone for a while) gets one creature off of him and we have assistance in the fight, but when the charm breaks, even though he is about 6 levels above the creature with his taunt skill maxed, he cannot taunt the MOB off me for at least 3 tries usually.  Please lower the taunt on this song....and maybe make it last longer in dungeon settings.  Just a wish there, but it seems that this song will get me killed more than it will help me.<P>Damage output is next to pitiful (who am I trying to kid, it is pitiful).  My warrior friend is often double attacking for 150 or so HP at level 33 with an Exe. Axe.  I am lucky to do 10-15% of the damage he can do with my duel wield and fast weapons.  I miss quite a bit and hit weak when I do hit.  When I add my DD songs in I do a little more damage, but the only song that my group wants me to play at my level is my Anthem song for Str/Haste buff for everyone and Healing after battle....which brings me to my next item.<P>Hymn of Restoration.  This is a wonderful song until about level 18 or 20, then it really falls by the wayside when you factor in the amount of damage a creature does.  At level 18 in a group of 6 (my bard and 5 melee classes) I sang this song nonstop with my lute equipped and we were able to keep the orc spawn broken up enough to hold the spawn without anyone backing out of the fray to heal very often....now that I am at level 30 and my warrior friend is level 33, this song takes forever to regen any real amount of hitpoints.  This song seems to regen 2 HP more per tick every 6 levels, and at level 30 it regens 14 HP every 3 seconds to everyone in the group.  My warrior friend has about 1200 HP and it takes a long time to heal him.  I am not wanting cleric strength healing here, but at level 30 I think 20 HP per tick would be more in line when people are sitting...I think it would be fair to regen that amount when sitting per tick because it is not making a difference in battle...but to maybe have it balanced do less than 14 HP per tick when in melee.  As is I cannot do any real healing with this song unless I have a long time to sit and sing.  <P>Monks are a great class, they get awesome weapons that are fairly available, and the same goes for most other melee classes.  I seem to have trouble finding any weapons I can do any damage with at my level.  I do not twink my bard and if I use the weapons I can acquire in battle then I cannot even go toe to toe with a high green mob.  The cure here is to maybe put some weapons in the game that are bard only weapons so we can actually do more damage in combat.  <P>Bard have very low HP.  I did not think it was all that low until I started playing my Necromancer again.  My necromancer has less HP than an equal level enchanter and other pure casters, and is not very far behind my bard.  Considering that in battle your bard will almost always be at the front line doing battle, a few more HP would be nice.  Having about 15-20% more HP than a pure caster is nuts because if a MOB focuses on me in battle I get hit so often and hard that I will go down fast...almost as fast as a pure caster that sits far behind the melee classes.  <P>I know the lag is a problem for all casters but when I hit a spell hotkey I know the spell will begin to cast, it just may take a second or two at times.  With my bard it seems that I often have to hit a hotkey multiple times to end or start a song so my ability to sing 3 songs at once is SEVERELY hindered.  I would like somethign put in place that will allow me to sing 3 songs at once without needing to start one song, stop it, start the next, stop it, start the third, stop it, start the first....as you see, every three seconds doing this can get old and irritating.  The only solution I can think of to implement this is if I press a key to start a song, then press another key to start a second song, and press a key to start a third song, make these three songs sing back to back, none stop until I stop them.  If I want a song to stop I will hit that key again.  <P>I would also like a change in the bards greying out of the entire song list as we sing one song.  I think I keep my songs in an order but I am not always sure where the next song is I want to sing and I cannot see the spell icons until I stop singing.  What I would suggest to fix this is to gray out JUST the one song that is currently being sang, this way we could easily see what song is where so we know what to sing next.  <P>AOE damage songs.  Could you please make sure that all these songs are showing some kind of icon, preferably flashing on our screens as well.  I have had problems with not seeing icons and having aggroed some real high level NPC to attack me because I failed to realize my song was still in effect.  <P>Selos...I know I spoke of it above but I do have another suggestion...during lag spikes Druids and Shaman classes (and the rest that get SOW [rangers)? When they are running and get hit by a lag spike their SOW if unaffected and they continue to run fast.  When a bard using Selos Accel is hit with a lag spike we have only a few seconds of speed left before we are slowed to the point most things can catch us and beat us down fast.  Is there a way to make the Selos Accel continue nonstop until the song hotkey is pressed again?  Give this song a flag the is "0" for on and active when pressed the first time and a flag of "1" for off when pressed a second time?  This would alleviate the problem of losing your speed in tight spot and dying.  <P>Bards in general have too high a Taunt effect on things.  When in a group our attacks and singing often aggro things on us so much that I am told to stop singing or back off on my attacking because the warrior types are having a hard time keeping things from attacking me.  I do not like sitting in a corner not doing what I can to pull my weight in a melee as best I can, but it is so bad I often need to use slower weapons and often stop singing just to stay alive.  There is a rumor that bards are SuperConducting High Powered MOB Magnets...and I would have to say it is true.  <P>For the most part I think the class is underpowered for the level of difficulty once you hit level 20, which is why there are a ton of bards running around the newbie areas and very few above level 20.  When I do a /who all bard listing about 90% of them are under level 20 because that is when the amount of fun seems to decrease in playing the class.  Once I get to level 32 I will have a use again but for now, my friends are just playing with me from friendship, not because my bard can contribute a lot to the party but because they now once I get to level 32 I can regen mana faster and it still currently stacks with other mana regen spells.  It seems that this SINGLE skill is the defining song for the entire class.  <P>Ionas the Traveling Bard<BR>Level 30<BR>Mithaniel Marr Server<P>PS, was there ever anything done to thank the 3000 people that were chosen for the closed Beta Testing or the ones that did the open beta testing?  I think each char on the persons account should have some mark or item to give them credit for assisting in the development of the game.  Such as a Baldric or an ability to make a title, or a little note in the BIO for recognition.  In another Mud I played, the Beta testers got Plaques on the outside of their homes saying thank you for the help....(everyone had houses, but the Beta testers had a plaque, as stated above.)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok even though I REALLY SHOULD BE GETTING TO BED (memo to self!), I just read Absor's 1st response to us and I have some thoughts (shock! Amazement!)<P>Re: the rogue skills.  I couldn't agree with you more.  I don't want them, have never used them and will not miss them when they are gone.  They are there, IMHO, because some game designer read too much AD & D and decided that bards were a subset of rogue.<P>Re: the "defensive class" issue.  Okay, I can understand that, but how is it that my attack ability pales so badly compared to Paladins/SKs?  If we are going to be grouped with these classes, we should be able to fight as well as them.  However, a similar level paladin can easily kick my blue armored butt in combat.<P>Re: Lute of the Howler.  Oh, give me a @#$%^*! break, Absor!  (mean face on Odwyn) The lute brings to, what, 3 illusions that bards can partake of?  How does that unbalance us AT ALL?  Especially since to get it, we have be of such high level that the effect is merely quaint rather than useful.  Sorry for the rant, but I like the Lute of the Howler, even if I'm 20 levels away from possessing one!  PS: bards are supposed to be masters of legerdemain, so it even works in the class concept, in my opinion.  Its mot like we're suddenly immune to normal attacks!<P>Re: mana discussions, various.  We all realize that we don't use mana much, but it does seem a little ridiculous that our ability to regain mana, when we get to the level that we need to use it, is rank 1 (max).  It would be nice to see that skill increase at the time we get the 1st mana using song, even with a lower cap than other "defensive hybrids" (is that our official designation?).  It also makes sense, IMHO, that mana regeneratove spells work on bards.<P>Re: SS effects.  They just suck, Absor.  Really.  They suck.  SS is an ugly color, and the effects suck.  I know I should elucidate (I'm impressed I could even spell that!), but I've never owned any and I'm too tired.  See my previous suggestion.  Please.  Before I suck too.<P>Re: "Maybe everyone should just wait util I have played every class to 60..."  Yes I know, quote isn't right, but I just wanted to direct you to the point in your posting I'm talking about.  Bottom line, Absor, you scared the @#$%^&*! out of all of us when you started the thread off hinting that we might get nerfed.  When we heard that you started ALL your threads off that way (although someone said that the warrior and another one never mentioned nerfing), we calmed down considerably.  Please don't get more defensive due to our defensiveness! :-)<P>I think though, our posts suggest that, rather than flaming you or Verant for not playing bards and therefore understanding them (shrug, like I'd know) I think we are all just saying, listen to us because we know what we're talking about.  And to a certain degree, if we come off as personal, its because it is.  I'm sure similar things have been said in other class threads.  Please take these comments in this manner, rather than an some flame against you that we DON'T intend.  We all know you didn't have to start the balancing threads.  Thanks for doing it!<P>I am still forgetting to mention something.  I can't think of what.  Hopefully, it will come to me after sleep and work!<P>Bright Journey,<P>Odwyn Stormsong<BR>Bard of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok... I don't pipe up too much but here goes. I have put a lot of thought into this but I'm sure there are more then a few holes in my ideas. In general addressing overall balance for the bard here in the high level game. There are a some bugs (ac, song messages, song effects) that have been laid out very nicely by some of my bretheren here and I didn't want ot get into those.<BR> <BR>Elloden Notespinner &lt;Talionis&gt;<BR>"Level 55 and 110 days played... but hey I'm a master fisher!"<P>1) We don't use mana (in general) TIME is our mana. Seeing as a 'average' bard weaves 3 songs, the time for each song is 1/3 of our 'mana.' It seems many people sometimes makes the mistake of looking at a song by itself and not as each song/effect takes 1/3 of our 'mana.'<BR>-a. In relation to songs this means that to balance a song you have look at it in the context of a weave. For instance weaving level 55 mana song, 47 Nivs, 32 mana song is roughly 45hp a tick, clarity1, clarity2, and STA regen. All that for no mana sounds great. Now combine all that, give it as a single spell to a cleric that costs no mana to cast, lasts 3 ticks. But ALL other buffs they have cast on anyone fade halfway through the first pulse.<BR>-b. In relation to items the cast time must be based on the effect in how much 'mana' (time) it takes from us. One solution in my opinion is to make pieces that cast songs we would normally weave with the same cast time as a regular song. Little if any balance problems and efectively allow us to have a larger selection of songs up at once. Bards have no 'down' time. If a group member needs water or food it takes so long to cast it (time with mana song off) that it's all but unusable even in down time in a group.<P>2. Balancing high level crowd control. Song of Twilight has done great things for us in its current form. Now we want a low resist aoe mez to balance us at high levels as a lesser but viable replacement to an enchanter. Verdant is rightfully worried about the abuse of a manaless aoe mez.<BR>-a. Prefered solution: Compromise with a level 50 or 52 aoe mez (levels chosen because other hybrids got new spells at 50 and 52 is the only post-50 level we get one song) with low to no resist and a duration just slightly longer then Song of Twilight. Make the song a 3 minute recast. This gives a bard the time to mez a pull and start locking down as many mobs as he can with the shorter duration Song of Twilight. The breathing space would allow bard to more effectively utilize Song of Twilight even with poor lag/video card that makes targeting hard with all the mobs moving but not increase the number of mobs we can keep locked down overall. Also with a 3 minute refresh and a 20 second duration it would take at least 10 bards (acounting for a little overlap of mez casting) with great timing to work in tandem to lock down a group of mobs indefinately for no mana. Any server with 10 bards level 53 or higher that can coordinate like that would not evenneed the song  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>3. Balancing damage output in the 51-60 game. Melee classes (including us to a lesser extent) get new damage tables in these levels providing a drastic increase to damage for pure melee. Casters get better ratio damage to mana spells and a larger pool of mana to draw from. As a hybrid we righfully get a smaller increase to melee tables. Unfortunately as time is our 'mana' the increasing mana to damge scale for casters (and as is appropriate to hybrids to a lesser extent) does not apply to us. And the increase to hybrid mana pools did nothing for us in terms of damge we can inflict through songs.<BR>-a. Complicated fix: Rescale our songs at 51, 55, and 60. Example, Chant of Frost does 1+(level/2) damage for a total of 26 at level 51, 28 at level 55, and 31 at level 60. Change the base formula so for bards level 51-54 the bards level is multiplied by 1.2 then the effect for any level based song is resolved. Add a 1.4 multiplier at 55-59, and a 1.5 multiplier at level 60. Now we get the following numbers for Chant of Frost, 31 at level 51, 39 at level 51, and 46 at level 60. An end result of a increase of 50% to damage output by level 60 without increasing our avalible 'mana' (time). An approprate halfway increase to one side of our damage output and balancing us with other hybrids that recieve melee AND spell increases (better cast ratio/more mana) post 50.<BR>-b. Easist but less effective fix: Make all songs level 51-60 last 4 ticks. A bard would then be balanced with a portion of the melee increase other hybrids get post 50 and by making a song last 4 ticks we can have 4 songs not 3 up at once effectively increasing our 'mana' (time) by 33%. In order for this method to be truely effective our level 51-60 songs need to be tuned and made more useful as this solution does no good if the level 51-60 songs are less useful then the sub-50 songs.<BR>-c. A possible happy medium. Increase the duration of all 3 tick songs to 4 ticks when a bard reaches level 51. Same benefit as above while removing some of the need to retune high level songs to make them something a bard will sing more.<P>4. Balancing our snare: Our current single target snare songs (Selo's Constant Chain-23 and Largo`s Absonant Binding-51) have a random duration. In order for a bard to have a mob reliably snared he must sing one of the two snare songs non-stop as it could break as fast as 1 second after sticking. By refering back to point one you can see that this effectively causes a bard to use all his 'mana' (time) to provide the same ability to stop a mob fleeing that a druid can provide with a 15 mana snare. Once again not asking to be as good as a pure caster but using all of our 'mana' to snare a mob seems unreasonable.<BR>-a. Solution: Make the level 26 and 51 snare songs have a fixed duration of 3 ticks. Even with no resists a bard will be using 1/3 his total 'mana' (time) to emulate a spell that others can cast for 15 mana. Due to the very real posibility of multiple resists with this song the bard is still not as good as snaring classes but we will once again be a viable, if lesser, alternative when no other snaring class is avalible. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all,<P>The only defensive roll bards are good at is resistances and in the upper levels this resistance roll isnt near what it was in the 40-50 naggy/vox days<P>If this is Verant's vision for bards, you really have alot of work to do balancing us.  Can I quantify the defensive ability of bards. No, I dont sniff packets,,,, I can certainly give a good qualitative opinion of the value and uses of bards learned over 116 days of hard playing time.<P>Bards arent as group friendly as you planned, our group area radius songs can kill group members often times more than help them.<P>ex selos travel: lag can cause someone who normally would keep up with bard to lose song and fall to their deaths, several other ways also<P>Underwater breath and invis are much the same<BR>distance in this game is hard to judge, and once you wander too far away, with no warning you are in trouble, and the time it takes to keep everyone in range is generaly unacceptable, so those skills are rarely called upon.<P>non bards are driven nuts by the way our song symbols are placed and the way they blink<P>Bards dont do defensive work, what they do imo are three things<P>1 provide mana/hitpoints/stamina enough to keep the group figthing longer than a non-bard group could (with a shaman in a bards place you wont be fighting that long though)<P>2 emergency crowd control in two ways<P>    a if snarer is resisted or asleep, you chain<BR>    b  linkdead or afk chanter, and  low enuf level mobs and you mez with twilight song<P>3 and resistance songs for uber mob raids, with the "soft caps" possible roll overs and lack of resists in the post 50 era, this power is waning rapidly as stated above<P>Pali, sk, and Bard damage output need to be upped to balance them in my opinion.  They all have problems finding work in eq due to sad damage.  The flip side of this is that Rangers need better defense.<P>It may not fit your set ideas of the verant vision, but the reality of post fifty play often times doesnt match your vision.  Until you admit this you will continue to see small populations of Bards, Palidans, Shadowknights, and Rangers at the higher levels.  Removing the exp penalty was a good step.  The hybrids were weaker than the melee/casters, and had an exp penalty,this was unsettling to say the least.  Now as things stand, they are weaker and have no exp penalty.  Yes weaker, they arent sought after for groups, or for large raids.<P>This imo won't be acknowledged, there are preconcieved notions you have walked into this discussion with, on one hand you admit ignorance of bards, and then on the other you says things like bards are a defensive class, and having no large need for mana is worth the the way songs work (patently not true,we are incredibly weak casters see Thalott's comments.)<P>Mana replentishment is our biggest all round duty, followed by resistances on raids, and then as emergency crowd control either thru chain, mez, or charm.  That is what bards currently have to offer at higher levels.  We or other hybrids are rarely sought after for groups or raids.<P>The key to experience grouping is killing fast, and often.  Bards abilities are contrary to this, and to ignore this or belittle this, is to keep them unbalanced along with the other hybrids (in the ranger's case, to just die too fast)in post 50 situations.<P><BR>Trelane Trebleclef 59 bard of Xev<P>ps and what on earth does Verant have against Clerics? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
