</FONT><HR>Christ this is a novel in the process or beeing authored i see....<P>However EQs main problem is the timesinks and the HUGE time commitment everything takes. One would think spending 4h a nite on a game would be alot but in EQ its hardly enough time for a exp group.<P>This decrease the amount of time spent doing "fun" stuff in the game and adds to the players feeling of beeing stuck doing the same old exp killing.<BR>Make it a game, meaning fun and not a life commitment.<P>Having fun, doing new things and feeling that you are progressing are the main force that keeps people playing this kind of games. In EQ at the early leaves this feeling is sound but the higher you get the slower you advance, the relatively weaker you get compared to your adversaries etc.<P>I left the game for a while due to the fact that it felt stale and tedious. This was due to the fact that to do anything worthwhile you either need a exeptional group or up to 24 players. These players have to commit at least 10 hours and for this they maybe a fifth of them will return with a item that gives them a mediokre improvement of relative strength.<BR>This is what i feel is the main problem with EQ today, useless stats and unbalanced classes are minor problems compared to the basic design of the game.<P>That beeing said Brad more downtime = more time until reaching 60. The more time spend until reaching max level the longer people stay and pay their monthly fee. Many a player quit when they have reached 60 and gotten their epic etc. If this make some hardcore players eat your bandwidth then ill just have to say that you seem to make profit from it anyways.<P>On the other hand I always group i never realy feel any downtime, other than the time spent waiting for a group.<P>I do realise the basic game design will never change in EQ, but keep this in mind when designing the next game.<P>Aelorn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow.. I just had a great idea!!!!!!<P>The big talk seems to be about the death penalty.<P>First of all, when you die to far away, or on a weird spot, it can be impossible to get your body back on your own. So to encourage exploring, I would say let everyone keep the equipment they where wearing.<BR>Now here is the thing.. let them lose the experience! But when you retrieve your body, add the lost experience to a LOST MEMORY bar.<BR>Now add a pray option (or something) so that you could pray to your god, and then you would slowly remember everything again, effectively adding the lost experience to your experience again! You could regain all experience this way!<P>So instead of losing all experience you worked for all week long, you could choose to have half an hour down-time to regain all lost experience!<P><BR>On the transport notes:<BR>I think you should be able to portal/teleport ONLY to places that you have visited via normal transport first. It only seems logical that you need to know the lay of the lands, before you can quick-transport there.<P><BR>and on a non related topic:<BR>I've not played much yet (30 hours orso), but I've had it happen on several occasions that after zone'ing, I immediatly zoned again.<P>A solution to this would be to let zone's overlap a bit. Take the Qeynos north-south passage ways for an example. If the zone overlapped the tunnels could be comepletely in both zones, but zone'ing to nort would be at the start of the tunnel, and zone'ing to south would be at the end of the tunnel. (like in quake/half-life)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>(if I missed this same idea in the above posts and posted the same idea again... oops! its late!)<P>In an online text based mud I used to play, you could regen hit points similar to as you do now (sitting). The melee types however, could recline (little bit faster regen of hit points) and also sleep (even faster). How about implementing something like this for melee types to reduce their downtime. To clarify, anybody could do this, but it would not let you memorize spells while reclined/sleeping, so keeping the idea similar here, it would not increase mana regen while recling/sleeping.<P>Lexli, eating soup at 3 am</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello.  <P>Downtime has never been too much of a problem for me until the release of Kunark and now even more so with the release of Velious.  In Kunark you needed to be in a Kunark dungeon to teleport to EJ or SF...  Why?  Do you think its "fun" to have to run to a dungeon for a simple port to another zone where you want to go hunt or meet people?  It seemed senseless to me to cause unnessecary downtime..<P>With the Velious release that problem is even more obvious.  Lets say we want to direct the guild toward Dragon Necropolis.  Ok well its going to take hours to accomplish.. hours.  Why not put a portal in WW?  Why do I need to go through the hassle of navigating Sirens Grotto EVERY time?  And since 1% of the wizard/druid population has a CS portal spell we're forced to run through Skyshrine and potentially from Iceclad if Wuoshi is up.<P>These are the types of things that get annoying and cause unneeded downtime.  Don't get me wrong, i dont expect to be instantly teleported to my destination and I enjoy a challenge but it was fun the first time (and maybe the 2nd).  I have a few hours a night to enjoy the game and the majority of that time can be consumed JUST traveling to a destination. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Imho the game ist best from 16 to 30. The advance rate is fast enough to bring joy and fun and keep you going . Maybe the game 50+ should be like the level 35 to 45 then. That would still be somewhat tedious but not like it is today.<P>I stoped playing my chars after 30, it wasnt a game anymore but work.

</FONT><HR>(I didn't read every single post previous to this, so some of this may have been repeated)<P>Ill go back to the main post and respond to a few problems, and not just the downtime subject which the majority of the posts seem to be geared toward.<P>My solution would be to add more adventuring and excitement to the trips.  I do not believe it still can be done in EQ, just because of the way the game works, because the game is geared toward wasting as much time as possible.  So here it is. <P> You used the example of Frodo travelling to Mount Doom.  Well let me ask you this.  How many times during his trip did he end up fighting monsters? How many times did he end up exploring?  Without exacts, the answer would be plenty.  Now how many times on your way from Freeport to Qeynos, (not counting teleports) did you fight monsters and how many times did you end up exploring? You either a) didn't fight at all, because the monsters you came across were green and didn't attack you, and didn't explore because the maps are designed for easy access from point a to b, or b) you did fight something but you died because it was entirely to strong to take out by yourself and you didn't explore because the maps have nothing to explore but plains and little hills.  Now neither of these ways are fun.  There are 2 ways I can think of to improve this.  <P>First, there needs to be more monsters to fight, and monsters that don't completely destroy you if you do happen to encounter them.  Id say double or even triple the spawn rate of monsters, make them twice as easy, but cut the exp they give in half.  This way you level the same, but fight more.  And when your running around, the increased monster spawn will increase your chance of fighting, and when/if you do fight, you have pretty good chances to win even if your alone.  But like I said earlier, this isn't possible in the current eq, because of the soloing taboo and for you to solo a monster, it would have to be low low green (if your high level) which offers no exp or any good loot whatsoever, so it is avoided because it just wastes time.  Now if the monsters were to actually give exp (but not enough to effectively level off of) and have the rare, super rare, uber rare chance of dropping half way decent items, I believe it would feel more exciting.  Of course there should be some tough monsters that should be avoided such as hill giants and the such, but don't penalize us with all the other mobs (because if wasting time is the penalty, then fighting monsters that give no exp or loot is wasting time, therefore its a penalty).<P>But this goes against the "if its green you get no exp" rule, which I think should be done away with. You COULD level to lvl 60 off of lvl 1 rats, but it would take you years, so no one would camp rats to 60. But if every time you came back to town, you killed some rats or wolves or bears on your trip, through the course of a month or 2 (real time) you might actually gain a bar or 2 of exp.  Now this is pretty minimal, but yet, it isn't a complete waste of time. No one would level off of stuff that gives 1 bar every 2 months, but through the traveling process of a year you might actually gain something instead of just wasting the time running. As for loot, I think normal mobs should have a super rare chance of dropping good items.  This way you want to fight everything and anything hoping it will drop some really nice item, instead of avoiding all the spawns and looking for 1 specific monster.  <P>Second, and as far as exploring, this I believe is due to poor map design.  There needs to be more obstacles on the maps.  90% of the outdoor (non dungeon) maps are just squares with hills.  The zonelines are on the edge of the squares, so to get from point a to b you just follow the zoneline wall and your there with 0 fights. Doing this over and over again gets very boring.  The maps need to be designed differently.  More like Rathe Mountains or beholders maze.  Maps that force you to wander INTO the map instead of following the zoneline around. Another idea are maps that require you to go through another zone or dungeon to get to another part of the same map.  For example, maybe 1 map has a HUGE cliff.  Unclimbable by any other means but entering the cave at the foot of it.  This takes you into a dungeon where you fight your way up to the top of the cliff, where theres another zoneline that takes you out the top of the cliff of the zone you were just in, where you can continue on your way. Or maybe you don't even need a zoneline, make it like the goblin maze in the lake of ill omen, but REQUIRE that you HAVE to pass through the cave to continue to another part of the map.  Another example would be a map where there is a giant river running through the middle of the map, and only 1 bridge, located in the middle or somewhat centered on the map.  If you fall into the river, the only way out is to swim to the end of the river at the edge of the map, which would be a zoneline to another zone.  Like what was done in warsilk woods, but to an extreme.  And when you fall into the river, the river is full of piranhas and other nasty fish that attack you. Or if some maps must be designed in the square fashion, make sure to load up the zoneline with monsters, so if you do want to follow the wall, you'll be in for some fighting.  What about using paths like in the commons and places like kithicor woods, but make the pathing of monsters mostly away from the path.  That way the safest, shortest path actually is through the map and not running along the edge.  But of course have some monsters roaming through the path for the adventuring purpose, just not as many as following the walls would be. <P>This is what I believe one of the core problems with eq is.  The game is designed to waste as much time as it possibly can.  You said that downtime is used as a penalty, but the reward system is more based off of reducing the penalty instead of gaining anything. To put it simply, the game wastes your time and the goal of the game is to avoid wasting as much time as you can. But you will always be forced to waste some time; therefore you are always being penalized no matter what you do.  I think of games like diablo2, where you relentlessly fight hordes of mobs that cover the whole screen as you tear through them, hacking and slashing, casting and exploding monsters, and when its done you say, "wow! That was intense!"  Then you come to EQ, and you fight 1 monster, for about 5 min, sit for 2 min, pull 1 more monster, and repeat.  Oops, pulled 3 monsters, were dead!  That is dull.  Now imagine that you could actually pull 3 monsters, and fight 3 monsters without mezing or rooting them, and still win.  Or maybe be able to pull 5+ monsters and fight them all at the same time and win.  That would be more intense and exciting.  I think the key here is "dead time."  There needs to be something to do during these times instead of just waiting.<P>Lastly, one of the last posts I just read mentioned about having the zones overlap a little bit, and this is a great idea not only for normal servers, but also for pvp servers.  Iv been playing this game a long time, and I still sometimes end up rezoning because I hit the wrong move key or was knocked back into the zone by a mob.  This would solve many problems.  First you would never zone right into a train if one was on the other side, this would stop people from ping ponging or zone dancing on pvp servers to avoid death, and you wouldn't be knocked back into the zone by a mob or another player (like the infamous qeynos hills/karanas problem).<P>Zuuljin Bloodsabre<BR>Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few thoughts about downtime and challenge:<P>As Verant claimed, downtime is the way to put challenge into the game. As there are rewards to gain for investing energy (which is time in this context) you need to invest your game time to get them. That's the simple concept of challenge inside and that's the reason why anybody can become a Lvl 60 superhero, even if he isn't a clever gamer at all.<P>What people mainly want to see nowadays is to decrease downtime, and I've got a feeling they simply want the game to be even less difficult.<P>My opinion is:<BR>I highly disagree with the idea of making this game even more simple. Taking time to group, regenerate, find places, travel, making plans and all these things is the only challenge (left?) this game has. Since the day I began to play I've missed a factor of competition and the possibility of getting "stuck" in the development of my character because I can't play better. These are two things which can make a game challenging and exciting too (for example: what is the challenge of a racing game?).<P>What I want to say is: If you start to decrease downtime and don't care about other effects which would provide a little more risk and challenge you will soon end up in a kind of work, only usable for killing your time and unable to let you make satisfying achievements. I think this would get very very boring.<P>There were at least two posts already on the wishlist, which asked for a die hard server, on which there's only one char allowed which is deleted when dieing. I think this would be a real challenge and people would have a legitime reason to be proud of their Lvl 60 char, at least I'd be...<P>PS: Sorry about the bad english.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad, I would like to suggest you now step away and read your response as if you were a customer. What I got from your response was a defensive and semi argumentative post.  Alot of excellent ideas that would only increase my enjoyment of a game that is slowly getting to be more work than fun were shot down.  Many of these ideas may not be ready for implementation but may given some time and thought a lead to something that could be added.<P>Despite liking and appreciating the chance to give feed back on this issue, I feel that very little info was actually taken in.<P>This post is different than just about any other, honestly I think you responded to it like you would normal when you should have gone about it another way.  Ask more questions to understand what is being said, clarify, and look at ways to adapt and don't be so dead set on some of your ideas of challenge.  Like ours they are not always right nor the best.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 52 Wood Elf Minstrel on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If it hasn't come up already, I'm gonna bring it up...melee binding.  It really is bad design that tanks are REQUIRED to have another player do them the service of a bind in order to play.  Ever moved your Warrior to Qeynos early in the morning?  Log off and hope some casters are on later in the day so you can play!  You simply can not play the game without a bind, period.<BR>Now let's look at the casters of binds.  From a roleplaying point of view, they have studied magic and learned a way to bind to any locale (except for nerfed zones like Tim Deep *boggle*) and they have learned how to perform this service for others, yet they can only do this in a city??  What kind of RP sense does that make?  None at all I say.<P>Class interdependancy should refer to group encounters.  ie "Let's take the Ghoul Lord!" *gathers competent group*, *whacks Ghoul Lord*.  Class interdependancy JUST TO PLAY THE GAME is silly.  What if any caster could only cast their spells if an Enchanter cast Clarity on them each time before they cast a spell?  That would be just as ridiculous as non casters being required to be bound by other players who 99% of the time aren't grouped with them, aren't their level and don't know them at all and frankly might have other things to do while they're in town.<P>Just because Druids and Wizards can GG and bind themselves outside dungeons (well, some anyway) doesn't mean they aren't explorers and thay they don't enjoy the scenery around Norrath.  Heck, Druids are likely to be the most traveled characters!  So what does all this mean, you ask?<P>First, set up clickable bind points FOR EVERYONE!  There isn't a caster worth his Robe that would say "You've taken away my uniqueness, since anyone can bind!"  Second, reduce the price of Gate potions.  There is no excuse for selling them at 1000p, THIS IS A 4th LEVEL SPELL for most casters!  10p is more appropriate.  Please don't tell me that this would imballance the game because half or more of the player population can already do this at will.  Third create bind points throughout the world.  A small square platform with a clickable effect BIND AFFINITY.  You make the platform flagged as a city and when the melee type stands on it and clicks, viola!  They can play the game without having to hope that some other player can give them the ability to do so!  Oh, and for goodness sake don't place the platform where Trak spawns, remember naked people will be popping in there!  Put the platform some place out of the way of wandering mobs paths and spawn points.<P>Guess what happens when you do this?  All players have an equal opportunity to play the game without having to rely on other players.  All players have the ability to reduce downtime accrued by senseless travel (If you've ever made the naked streak from Freeport to Lower Guk without SoW you know what I'm talking about).  But remember this is only a reduction!  Players can only be bound to one spot, so it's not like Warriors armed with a backpack full of REASONABLY priced Gate Potions could travel across the world at will and hunt where ever they please.  What it does do is make corpse recovery more palatable for everyone.  Tanks would still continue to send me tells asking "GG plz?" &lt;- My favorite tells! LOL  But at least I wouldn't be sitting at the bottom of Guk waiting on the Warrior to get back so the rest of the group can resume playing.  That's right, all those casters have to wait on the tank, just cause they were bound close by doesn't mean they get to resume playing faster.<P>-Z</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And thanks for agreeing with what I thought, that downtime doesn't keep people playing but just irritates them. Someone quits and feels the need to post why all the time on your board. Many, probably a very large percentage of your subscribers, are like me. They saw that EQ was seruiously flawed with its purposefully designed load o' downtime and thought "okay I will just play it until a better mmorpg comes along. The problem is that one never has.<P>By the way, there is too much downtime, we are just desperate for a viable mmorpg and this is the only one. It won't always be that way though.<P>So, in other words, You purposely designed an MMORPG where the challenge was "to avoid downtime." Which brings to mind a question; why?<BR>I've been thinking about this a lot lately:<P>Downtime has no place in a game.<P>It should not be part of the "challenge."<P>Single player games don't have downtime, at least not like this. The reasons why single player games don't is because THE DESIGNERS KNOW THAT WOULD NOT MAKE A GOOD GAME. They are not eliminating "challenge" by not having downtime.<P>What on earth made you think this would be a good idea for a game?<P>I think this:<P>"If people thought there was too much downtime and that the majority of their experience playing wasn't any fun, they'd leave. "<P>would be more valid as this:<P>"Since we think there is too much downtime and that often the majority of our experience palying isn't any fun, we should leave. Alas though, we are just too desperate."<P>Do you have any idea how much of a players 4 hour or so playing session is actually not fun? Its easily the majority which is spent doing mundane repetitive tasks just to get to a place to do something. Some of you guys who designed this game spend too much time in a glass tower of high ideals instead of actually playing to see if it really works this way.<P>Yeah I know some people at Verant "really" play the game through a characters life even up to the high level point. I think though that the people who really NEED to be playing it to see what its REALLY like are most often the ones who are not. <P>Just how likely is it that some people who work at verant and REALLY play the game also are going to write long documents to you about how the fundamental design of your game is flawed? Just how likely are they to be totally honest?

</FONT><HR>Brad, here is something about EverQuest that would lead people to believe that downtime is about money.<P>When you start the game, your downtime is almost nil. This makes sense. You start out small and everything is proportional to that.<P>Level 10. Here you can start to feel that downtime in a tangible way, e.g., man I have been sitting here for *two* minutes. It is a contrast to how you were playing, but it is negligible. Why? Because the uptime is just about the same as it always has been. You are well matched with your opponents and are in great balance with the environment.<P>As the levels get higher- so does that downtime commitment. AND you get weaker versus the environment. When you are weaker versus the environment- risk is much higher and therefore downtime is more likely to be encountered.<P>At this point, if a player can realize what is happening, he or she has two choices. Quit. Or keep playing. By the time a player is seasoned enough to realize just how weak he or she is versus the environment, understands how the hell he or she landed in such a trap, and perchance decides that the reward is no longer worth the effort, he or she is probably level 35 or greater.<P>It is at this point when this player will say, "I can't just throw away all the time I have invested into this." And they play a little more in hopes that it can get better; that their investment can still be worthwhile on a day to day basis. But as many high level players can swear, this just isn't so. Players get weaker- the bang is gone, and the game just gets HARD. However, they'd be damned if they would just toss away 90 days of play time.<P>That is why so many people come to these boards so frustrated that they are viscious and ready to attack anyone that says G'day.<P>I love my character- I love this game. But if I knew what it would turn into when I first heard about it, I sure as hell would have never played it. I got stuck in that cycle described above. A lot of people did. Those are the people that post here the most. The people that accidentally got caught with their pants down and started playing a revolutionary game. Why is it revolutionary? This game actually preys on hope to keep people playing.<P>Downtime is just one of the frustrating things we put up with as we either:<P>A) Hope it gets better one day down the line.<BR>B) Refuse to throw away what we have done so far until a viable alternate product is produced.<P>That is why you hear complaining about everything under the Norrathian sun. We won't just toss away our played time, so we sit here and are so intimate with every little detail of the in game experience that we get sick and tired of this or that. It truely is a paradox of the mind.<P>I can walk away from all this and feel foolish for having wasted so much of my time. OR I can foolishly stick around and hope it gets better. 8 out of 10 will stick around- nobody wants to feel as though they lose something. That's just human nature.<P>People actually think that they are being heard on these boards, that they are HELPING to make it better! But the track record shows that's pretty rare (and understandably so- the game is frickin HUGE). Heh, as I write this I assume I am being heard. The logical half of me knows that would be rare. The human half of me made the assumption.<P>For all the time people spend hoping that it gets better tomorrow- EverQuest will be remembered as a game that *could* have been an all-time great but never seemed to get there.<P>Good god it's depressing to stand back and look at this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Frustration.<BR>Brad your response was "inside the box."<BR>I can understand it though.  Brad you have faith in down time.  It's a religion.<P>I know I can't change your mind but the reason for down time isn't to provide a sense of size to the world or provide a sense of accomplishment, down times only real purpose is to prevent the customer from using up content to quickly.  <P>A simple alternative is to move this down time outside the game.  Simply limit the amount of time a customer can play in any given time period.  I get the feeling you think I'm an idiot but why should that "content limiting" down time be in game?  Just because a customer isn't playing the game while playing the game doesn't make not playing the game any less not playing the game.  Ouch that was wordy.  The content limiting down time is easy to spot.  That down time has alternatives in game to avoid it.  Simply give customers the option to move that down time outside the game via limited play time.  <P><BR>I hope you hear me.  Converting a man's religion is a hard thing to do and I'm probably to big of a jerk to do it.  Can someone help me convert Brad?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That's like saying a casual gamer is somehow unable to use good tactics and operate efficiently in a group - I don't buy it..."<P>No problemo in disagreeing with me Brad.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I don't think I made my point clear. I am a casual gamer, actually--and indeed, I have learned these tactics and I have found myself in the most efficient groups, sometimes. But that is not the reason I want to play this game. My class (the one I've chosen to spend all my limited time playing) is the Magician, just for perspective.<P>Downtime for my class is recovery from multi-summons when we first log in (and subsequent recoveries if we go LD) plus all the other downtime sinks others experience with the exception of long corpse runs. Travel is a time sink, grouping is a time sink, and so forth. <P>Trying to find a group (competent or otherwise) is becoming almost impossible UNLESS I spend the bulk of an offday (from work) and spend upwards of an hour shouting in my current zone---to walking/running to adjacent zones. Surely you can see why I said this is NOT what I want to do in your game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It just isn't fun, Brad.<P>Why are there no other activities in EQ which I can pursue during my limited time that can yield me progression without hunting/camping for exp or loot? And by progression, I mean meaningful. Let's not split-hairs: I mean good exp raising activities. Why not? If I can't find an immediate group, then I could immediately engage in these other, non-kill-camp-loot activities and still see meaningful progression of my character and possibly even have an opportunity to RP. I wouldn't encounter the huge waste of my limited time that I currently experience.<P>Now, I realize your original question was aimed more clearly at downtime while engaging in the hack-n-slash aspect of the game. I think we're discussing more than one issue here, Brad. Downtime in the context of combat and in the context of non-combat. That is: combat: mana/death recovery; non-combat: travel/group realization.<P>What I find the most interesting about this entire issue is that you have chosen the ONE thing in all of modern society most people can ill-afford to waste as the primary obstacle in Everquest: time. Knowing this, how can you be astonished that we accuse you of doing so for no good reason other than generating more profit for your company?

</FONT><HR>I think one of the major problems in EQ is that Verant considers the "rewards" to be at one level and thus have scaled the "punishment/risk" factor to what they see as being at the same level.  But the reality is that the reward for the actual players isn't as high as what Verant sees it and that makes the punishment/risk to high also.<P>But Verant doesn't seem to see this and continues along using the same equations so to speak (rish vs reward) everytime they implement new content.<P>The result has been IMO an increasing gap has formed between Verant and players with little understanding of why.  Verant says their risk vs reward is comparable and players say you must be joking.  So who's right?  <P>Well IMO if it's something players find much more frustrating then enjoyable in accomplishing then that balance of risk/punishment vs reward needs to be adjusted because obviously it's not balanced.<P>And honestly I think overall your ideas of risk vs reward -should- be geared to what players find rewarding.  If the risk/punishment begins to negate the fun a player has in accomplishing something then there is no balance between the two.<P>But you honestly don't know if any of this is happening because you don't ask your players (and I'm talking about the entire player base).  You don't make use of one of the most powerful tools you have for gaining a good idea of how your player base -really- feels about issues like this... in game polls.  And since you don't do this you give the impression that you don't care what your players think about something.  And then when you're called out on player discontent about anything you're more then willing to spout your subscription numbers and how that indicates that players love what you're doing... actually to me in simply illustrates the fact that no other game compares to EQ at the moment and by compare I don't mean compare in greatness I mean compare to it's theme and target audience.<P>You'd do a much better job IMO if you used i game polls much more and actually made results availabe to players AND actually gave serious consideration to the results.<P>EQ is a great game but it could be so much more.  Your tradeskills simply cause more of what players say they don't want to do... camp.  Your epics cause much much more of what players say they don't want to do... camp.  You're new content appears to causes more of what players say they don't want to do... camp. (I say appears because I haven't bothered to even go there yet cause I'm very close to quitting.)<P>So just out of curiosity who are you listenting to?<P>And for the record I do agree with you on tactics and such and when I grouped I loved finding the best most efficient way to hunt.  I hated grouping with players who had no purpose other then to camp experience so that's one reason why I quit grouping.  But I still feel your risk/punishment far outweigh the reward factor and often negate it.<P>Just my opinion<P>Morgian<P>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On boats - personally I think the world has become too large now. Ports at 50+ are almost a neccesity now. As an example I was wandering without anything to do in Eastern Wastes and got a tell asking if I'd like to go to Sebilis. I replied sure but will take a while. Well the group going was mostly made up of good friends but even the time to get a port (10 minutes), run to Karnors, get evac'd by a druid and run to Sebilis was already strecthing the group's patience to breaking point. Just waiting for 1 person had meant they'd had to sit around for 20-30 minutes, some of them with only a couple of hours to play. Pre-Kunark boats were fine, I usually just ran (especially after acquiring jboots courtesy of Drelzna, when it was still almost enjoyable  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">). After RoK it was still viable to run most places, usually only Sebilis was a big chore. But now with SoV, especially if you play a melee char, the times involved are so huge that it becomes impractical. I'm not a casual gamer but I play at GMT times so have a limited window when enough players are on to do Sebilis, PoG etc - the sheer size of the world drastically reduces that window and I don't think that's good design.<P>I propose self TP's at docks (like Orbs to some zones) that require a quested key (for 50+ range) and maybe even a payment per use. That way you could still take to boat but if you needed to get somewhere fast you had an alternative.<P>More items like the Worker Sledgemallet (sp?) should be introduced as well. I loved that item until the ridiculous VS faction made it worthless to me. Playing with friends (who being non-evil were mostly in Karnors) or having a quick method of getting to a soloing spot (Skyfire) was a no brainer for me - I destroyed the mallet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Morg, good points man.<P>Rising to a bit o' defense for the VI guys and gals (heh): However much I want to doubt their qualifications as game designers (the why of this I'll attempt to explain below), the fact is they ARE game designers and GOOD game designers. Everquest does have many great points which I think we tend to 'take for granted'. Thus, they actually do know how to design gameplay based on the internal logic of any given game. My objections have been the 'kind' of gameplay they chose to develop, only rarely(see below) their ability to do so.<P><BR>I tend to doubt VI's qualifications based on some of the points brought up in this thread: the: 'we're right because the sheer number of subscribers tells us we are' response. The: 'gameplay is fun, we know what fun is, trust us: you are having fun', response. Etc. This makes me think: er, wait a minute! We just told you otherwise. Why aren't you listening? <P>Back to time: it really, really does make me angry when I feel something or someone is purposefully wasting my time--even with all the justification you can think of. It makes me a very unreasonable person to try to talk to  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>thanks<BR>Alc<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regarding downtime...<P>I just want to ask one question...<P>"How many people play a gameboy/watch TV/cards/surf the net on another PC & etc... while PLAYING EQ?"<P>I know I now watch TV, I know my room mate watches TV and I know my best friend plays a GameBoy.  All three of us has actually bought or moved the "downtime" items for the sole purpose to PLAY EQ!<P>How !!!SAD!!! is that?<P>I used to laugh at my friend for needing to play a Gameboy while playing.  My observation was.."You play a game, while playing a game to make the game you want to be playing more enjoyable?!?"<P>Then last week, I bought 9" TV and stuck it in my room.  WOW!  Downtime is less boring now!  I can keep up to date on the news, watch my favorite shows, etc and still get exp.  WIsh I had done that sooner now, I'd be a few levels highier if I hadn't been so bored with solo play in the past.<P>Luckily, I waited until I was 48th before I broke down and did that.  I have some friends I can group with as a result of solo play driving me bonkers and forcing me to find groups.  But having the TV, sure helps now when I'm waiting for my friends to log these days.  It has allowed me to be picky with who I group with now.  <P>It shouldn't "need" to be this way though...that is the main point I am trying to make.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If anyone complaining about downtime (in the sense of nothing to do when say medding or rideing the boat) actually "PLAYED" EQ, they would realize how stupid they sounded.  There are SO many things that can be done in "downtime" Look at all the skills in the game. Granted some of them require you to be in a city (ie. brewing, pottery, etc) but there are many others that do not require this.  As far as downtime cause by death, I can see a *few* valid arguments.  But most of you are only complaining because you are playing EQ for the wrong reasons.  The purpose of playing isn't to see who can get to lvl 60 the fastest, it's to roleplay.  Yes, I admitt that not many people actually do this, but that is our fault as players.  WE are the ones who decide if the game is fun or not by how we play.  EQ isn't a fast-paced game.  If you want that go play Quake.  But don't blame Verent for your short comings on game-play.  They have created an awesome game.  It is you who take the fun out of it.  If you were actually roleplaying, hitting lvl 60 would not be your goal, having a good time would.  YOU are the only person who can make this game fun.  Verent changing it won't help.  /em steps down off his soapbox.<P>       Warlar on Xegony<P>~~ Ask me about microwaving ~~<BR>~~ cats for fun and profit. ~~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad:<P>&lt;&lt;Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time. Also, mana regeneration and other spells are introduced to compensate for the increased mana costs and total mana a character may have.&gt;&gt;<P>The problem with the above is(to quote another post):<P>"The game is designed to waste as much time as it possibly can. You said that downtime is used as a penalty, but the reward system is more based off of reducing the penalty instead of gaining anything. To put it simply, the game wastes your time and the goal of the game is to avoid wasting as much time as you can."<P>By designing the game around requiring certain buffs/spells you're in effect punishing players just because they don't have access to them, NOT rewarding players that have access to them.<P>That and there can be considerable downtime just to get access to those spells. Downtime both for the person receiving the spell/buff and downtime involved for the person giving the spell.<P>This is obviously a problem your playerbase is concerned about, but you just don't seem to be listening.<P>Eryl_Flynn:<P>&lt;&lt;Brad, I would like to suggest you now step away and read your response as if you were a customer.

</FONT><HR>Bulldog101: thanks for pointing that Magician's get a spell similar to what I was proposing, what I was suggesting is a spell that will summon a party member from any place on Norrath as long as that person is a party member. So if you a melee type and your bound in FV but die in Veeshan's Peek which would be a 5 zone run this would eleminate a big part of the down time. Heck make this spell cost 700 mana and have a 3 min refresh time on it. It would speed up some of the downtime.<P>How about making the baking skill worth while? Make it so that by having a stack of Sushi in your 1st inventory slot you regain mana at x times and if you have a stack of Liver canapes in the same slot you regain hps at x times. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think I've seen them in High Hold Keep, in the gambling area, a tavern in Qeynos, and one in FreePort somewhere.  You, and most people, may very well not know them, they're incredibly underused because of being in out-of-the-way areas.  I was just curious, since trying to put interesting NPCs on boats would probably be a coding nightmare, how hard would it be to try to add these message boards onto the boats?  It would, at the very least, be something to do to read other people's posts while waiting to get to FreePort or Firiona Vie.  Since it is a static object, I would assume it would be a reasonable task to simply add it in to the boat's geometry, though I'm not entirely sure how you have it coded for the storage of the messages.  (Are all of the messages on these boards lost when the zone is repopped?  When the servers go down?  When the boats zone, would all the messages be lost?  Never paid enough attention to them to find out.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It really cuts down on a player's ability to experience the entirety of Norrath.  I have been playing over a year, have characters in mid-50's, and yet I have never even been to Howling Stones, for example.  I have never "done" Perm except in passing on dragon raids.  I have never hunted in Everfrost or been inside whatever that ranger city is in Q.

</FONT><HR>Brad - regarding two of your points:<P>"Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment."<P>You see trees, but there's a forest here...  Think about it.   You've already got downtime here, regardless of corpse recovery, you've got an overly harsh death penalty in the experience penalty (look at AC, they get this soooo much better with their vitae penalty) - the corpse recovery is just adding insult to injury.  You lose more than your corpse when your group gets slaughtered deep in a dungeon - you lose your position, deep in that dungeon.  Something which could have taken a LONG time to achieve, especially at higher levels.  You've already included sufficient downtime with the bind locale penalty for melee-ers, the time it takes to get the slaughtered group back together, the time it takes to fight one's way back to where the misfortune occurred.  Even without corpse recoveries, dying is NOT fun, Add in the whole corpse recovery dilemma, the loss of equipment risk most notably, and it becomes a miserable experience, something not appropriate for a game, the G in RPG...<P>You've already got the variable!  The depths of a dungeon ARE scarier, ARE more risky.  They are DEEP in the dungeon.  They require time and risk to get to.  You die, all that work getting to them is lost.. there's your variable.  The monsters there are tougher, stronger, meaner, more likely to kill you.. there's your variable again.  The distance between you and safety (the zone) is probably respawned, filled with more nasty monsters, so escape is more difficult.. your variable again, the situation turns ugly, you gate out, the time and risk involved in getting back is far greater than if you fled a hairy situation outdoors or at a dungeon zone, there's your variable.<P>I hate to say it, but you do appear to be thinking within the box here..  The problem here is that while there already IS a well done set of variables with respect to risk in deep dungeons versus "safe" outdoor areas you don't see it.  As a result, you have a death penalty becoming much more, a bravery penalty.  You make death too time consuming, too miserable an experience, and as a result promote something none of us are really thrilled about, camping, in "safe" places, instead of working deep into risky places.<P>What I would suggest here, is simple.  Do not tie equipment to corpses.  Keep the experience penalty with death, keep the forcing back to bind point, they are the penalties for dying.  Keep the corpses where they lie.  You still have to get back to your corpses (or have a filthy necromancer bring them to you) to resurrect them, and regain the experience(time investment) lost from the death.  You KNOW the value of equipment in EQ really steps over the border of excessiveness, especially for tanks (who already are hammered with the limited binding penalty).  If you allow equipment to travel back to the poor dead adventurer to his bind point, he still has to face the experience penalty, OR face the downtime penalty of getting back to the dungeon, getting the group back together, and fighting way back to corpse - something which can add MANY MANY MANY hours onto a gaming session unto itself, but at least if he chooses to do it, he has the tools to do so, and should things get ugly, and he cannot, he need not be crucified with the loss of what could be over a year of work with respect to his gear.<P>Think about it, please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My biggest problem with downtime is the problem that I have with EQ in general. That is the time involved to do everything results in VERY limited playing potential for many customers. I will explain...<P>First, let me say that I really do love EQ, I think it is a great game and a great concept. Perhaps too great because my problem is that I want to do and see EVERYTHING. I want to start a character of every race, I want to play every class and see what it is like to do so. Unfortunately, this is impossible. The way the game is currently constructed, there is no time to take this leisurely, 'fun' approach to playing if you ever want to see some of the higher level zones. The game encourages a person to focus all of their time and energy into 1 character because that is what it takes to advance in the game. <P>I am a casual gamer and as such I have a limited amount of time every day to play. I play a shaman as my primary and am in my mid-thirties now. I would say that in a good group, or in a good soloing zone, I probably average about half a bub an hour in exp. That isn't too bad... sometime's it's better and sometimes it's worse. Bear in mind that this is a character that has never been twinked in any way and to say that I have appropriate equipment for my level is an understatement. At this rate, with 2 hours a day playing time, I average a little over a level a week (not including hell levels). So, in order to make it to the magical realm of 50+ I'm looking at 7 to 10 months of playing minimum. Looking back, I'd say that I'm about on schedule.<P>So, when do I get to play an Enchanter? Or try a Monk? When do I get to see the inside of Cabalis or Paineel? Is Rivervale a cool place to start as a newbie? Who knows? I am forced to stick with 1 character for most of my playing time just so I have the potential to make it to the higher levels of the game and see what it is like to fight a dragon or raid a plane. <P>So here is my quandry... how do I get the most out of a game that seems to be structured to limit what players can and can't do because of all of the time involved. Well, I'm struggling through and sometimes I bounce between different characters, though none but my Shaman will probably ever see 30 much less 50 or 60. And you actually wonder why people have such a problem with boat rides, and long runs, and corpse recovery, and exp loss. At least for some of us, just leveling is penalty enough, it keeps us from seeing and experiencing much of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Brad - Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time. Also, mana regeneration and other spells are introduced to compensate for the increased mana costs and total mana a character may have.&gt;&gt;<P>See.. you're still assuming we all have the ability to play in well balanced groups a majority of the time.  For MOST of us this is not the case.  When we CAN get a balanced group, yea it's great.  But the rest of the time (a good 80%+) We are either forced into a group without a rezzer (and frequently without even a healer) or we have to solo.  The chances of a high enough level cleric being in a zone near your corpse is rare...  the chance of him not being busy is even rarer.  While mana regeneration IS helpful (I don't even really care about the spell-book thing) it is not enough to compensate and your mana regen spells go the same way of your rezzes... the chances one is available is RARE.  Now there are the exceptions - Uber-guilds will usually have one or two high level people that will run around with lower-level people and cast for them (aka power-leveling) and other people have RL groups they game with.  The rest of us have to suffer with the luck of the draw and face your punishment for not falling into one of these two groups... unless you're here to say the game is only for those two kinds of people.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - One of our many plans in the future to improve EQ is to attempt to get zone size 'just right' - not too big, not too small. And, of course, this also relates to where the teleport points are.&gt;&gt;<P>But zone size itself isn't the whole issue and unless you're a member of one of the two previous groups teleports are NOT that readily available.  SoW potions are expensive and actually harder to come by than a SoW caster....  getting a SoW is not even that easy and, once again, reduces those of us not belonging to the two groups to resort to a demeaning round of begging and luck.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - We've really tried to get the boats running smoothly and as fast as is reasonable, but they ARE there as a means by which we make the world larger. We feel it should be time consuming to travel from one continent to another. If it was a similar trip from one zone in one continent to another as it was from one zone to another across the ocean well, I really think that would diminish the immersive nature of a virtual world.&gt;&gt;<P>Perhaps so - but at what cost.  Is player boredom worth it?  Imagine you're reading a book and the characters get on a boat to travel someplace... do you have to read several long chapters where ethey sit there and describe the waves?  In a movie or on tv, do you watch for 30 minutes as the character sits on the deck of a boat looking at water (and the occasional flying shark)?  No?  And why is that?  Because it's supposed to be entertainment.  An MMOG has two goals - Entertainment and Emmersion.. by this staement you are saying that by your vision Emmersion is much more important than Entertainment.  And no - Emmersion is NOT directly relative to Entertainment; otherwise you would have perma-death and a much more realistic combat system and it would take months or years for us to heal.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Since launch, we've:<BR>1. Halved the experience lost due to death.&gt;&gt;<P>Our complaint is not how much experience we loose - it's that exp loss is not really a good death penalty.<P>&lt;&lt;2. Increased boat speeds&gt;&gt;<P>Apparently they still aren't fast enough<P>&lt;&lt;3. Increased range for evac and teleport spells&gt;&gt;<P>Great if you're lucky enough to be in a group wwith a wizzy who happens to have that.<P>&lt;&lt;4. Added a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock&gt;&gt;<P>Apparently that's not enough.<P>&lt;&lt;5. Increased treasure and experience gain rewards for many older quests&gt;&gt;<P>Either these quests used to give you absolutley nothing or the person who said he did this lied to you.  Or - you apparently didn't take the in-game economy into consideration.  For 90% of the quests that actually give you a weapon or piece of armor, by the time you are strong enough to complete the quest (with or without a group) you will have long since looted enough scrap and saved enough money to buy the same or better.  Some examples?  Grobb Cleaver... it's a nice weapon but you have to kill a level 20 NPC to get one piece.. by level 15 I had scrounged enough plat to buy an Axe of the Ironback... a weapon much better than the cleaver.  Cutthroat ring quest in S Ro... the reward: a very minor amount of XP only a level one could appreciate and normal cloth armor a level one character usually wouldn't wear and maybe a couple of silver.. level to complete quest - 12.  Thusly the ONLY benefit form this quest is Soulsek Ro faction.  <P>&lt;&lt;6. Implemented Specialization&gt;&gt;<P>Great for high level characters, but many of us casual gamers may never reach that level.<P>&lt;&lt;7. Enhanced High Level (35+) Meditation&gt;&gt;<P>Same deal<P>&lt;&lt;8. Reduced many spells' mana costs&gt;&gt;<P>Yea!<P>&lt;&lt;9. Added Summon Corpse&gt;&gt;<P>Do you mena the spell or the /corpse command?  The spell is great IF you can find a necro and IF he happens to have a coffin and IF you can compensate him for his time and materials.<P>&lt;&lt;10. Added Call of the Hero&gt;&gt;<P>?? Haven't seen this one yet... must be another high-level only thing<P>&lt;&lt;11. Given more classes resurrection family spells&gt;&gt;<P>Only three that I know of.<P>&lt;&lt;12. Added more resurrection family spells&gt;&gt;<P>Yea!<P>&lt;&lt;13. Improved Tracking&gt;&gt;<P>Yea!<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - I think I agree with the losing level part, and I'm going to debate it a bit with the designers (although even if we all agree, I'm not sure such a change to EQ would be practical).&gt;&gt;<P>Yea!<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - As for your other point, as mentioned, we do expect the majority of high level deaths to be mitigated by resurrection family spells.&gt;&gt;<P>Again - an incorrect assumption.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - I definitely agree with you, but honestly, it's easier said than done. I think going forward this is a very real goal: provide other activities when downtime is incurred - the player should never be doing 'nothing' (btw, though, I don't consider socializing 'nothing').&gt;&gt;<P>Yea!  Except socializing is not always an option.  Some of us find the majority of the player base immature and annoying and if those few friends we have made aren't on we sit there minding our business (ie. watching tv, reading a book)<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes.&gt;&gt;<P>So "live as a gorup die as a group"?  Interesting concept but, again, you are punishing those of us NOT in a group (for whatever reason) and you are punishing those groups who couldn't get a good balance of members.  Are you now saying we shouldn't play unless we can get in a well balanced group?  Or should we just sit on our duff's until we find a balanced group (aka more downtime)?  One solution might be to offer an area in each city adjacent zone that's good for soloing for each level (Like Overthere but with more vendors and trainers and NPC's that sell buffss).<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment.&gt;&gt;<P>I'll grant you that.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Because we expect the majority of time the ratio of NPCs killed to you dying to an NPC to be significantly in your favor. In other words, many more NPCs die than players in most adventures, and so a single death needs to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs.&gt;&gt;<P>You make it sound like we should be slicing through NPC's like butter.  Well.. maybe if you're one of a few casters.  But us melee's and hybrids get the short end of the stick.  By level 15-20 we can maybe solo a blue (due to the con shift) and get ok xp but there are times when a blue will still kill us.  Oh yes, this must be ANOTHER penalty for not being able to find a well balanced group.  Suggestion&gt;&gt;  Make it so low greens still give SOME exp to people not in groups.  But if in a group low greens give no xp.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - I don't know for sure why this is the only mechanism people have come up with, but it seems to be (at least for MMOGs). I sure don't like to 'think in a box', which is one of the very reasons I created this thread (to get feedback and hopefully new ideas for the future). But the other advancement mechanisms used so far in games (pure luck, actual real life skill and dexterity ('twitch'), puzzles, etc.) don't seem to be what RPG players want and/or simply don't work in an online persistent environment. I'm all ears if you can think of a better one that would really work - heck, if you can, please email me and we'll definitely talk&gt;&gt;<P>I may do that... or I may just go about making my own game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;Brad - With all due respect, I totally disagree. Discovering effective tactics, playing smart, and being efficient don't make someone a 'powergamer'. That's like saying a casual gamer is somehow unable to use good tactics and operate efficiently in a group - I don't buy it.&gt;&gt;<P>I agree.  However your "punsihment" system isn't for not using good tactics... since after a certain point the ONLY good tactics are only functional in balanced groups - you are actually punishing us for being unable to find a group.  What might that be like in RL?  Imagine everyone is required to play the daily lottery. Everyone who wins gets a small prize.  Everyone who loses, however, has to pay a fine twice that of what the winners recieve.  Very nice.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Oh come on, many, many designers have played multiple race/class combinations to high levels, without twinking, and by making friends with players who don't work here. And yes, we ask players for binds and SoWs, and yes we often find clerics for our groups, and yes we wait for boats at times (although I prefer to make friends with people who can teleport me). Hrm, and no, I doubt we run 12 zones to get our bodies unless we have a brain fart and forget to bind where we should&gt;&gt;<P>So you and your designers *enjoy* begging for spells and making friends for the sole purpose of using them for their abilities?  12 zones was an exaggeration.... but how do you get these binds?  Play a caster?  Beg?  Sit around until someone is nice enough to pop in and offer you one?  Make another "friend"?  I like grouping, I like making friends, but I (and many others) would also like to have at least some form of self-reliance.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad -  I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls.&gt;&gt;<P>Subscription rates are NOT a way to gauge player happiness.  You still haven't grasped the addictive nature of MMOG's... until theres is an equal or better game to go to EQ is the only choice we have.  Think of Old Europe - Many people were unhappy there... but until the U.S. came about there was no place else for them to go. Yes - poll the players, PLEASE.  And more importantly LISTEN to the results.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself.&gt;&gt;<P>I think the point was that your penalties are to severe as they are for the meager rewards we recieve.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - Regardless of how effective or not that system is for our distinguished competition, I really don't feel it would work for EQ. First, EverQuest is more group oriented, and coming back after death with significant stat penalties would make you unattractive for a time (even after you'd looted your corpse). Also, EverQuest is a VERY item-centric game, and significantly increasing the chance of item-loss would turn out to be a much harsher penalty than what currently exists.&gt;&gt;<P>I agree, AC's death system would not really work in EQ (though the loss in skill was never enough to get you kicked out of a group in AC)... but the current death system is still way to harsh.  Maybe EQ's flaw is FORCING people to group and punishing those who can't or don't want to.  It may be a bit to late to change that though... depends on the skill and dedication of your designers.<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - I think that definitely depends on the guild. Guilds for me have had the opposite effect and have definitely helped me decrease downtime. They've provided people to group with me, they've helped me recover corpses, they've teleported me, they've resurrected me, they've given me advise on where to hunt, etc.&gt;&gt;<P>AH HA! So this game IS just for uber-guilds!<P>&lt;&lt;Brad - I think you've got a good point there. The majority of content in EQ should definitely be targeted at a solid group (4-6 players). Then should come the really difficult stuff, requiring multiple groups, as well as content for people who prefer soloing. Recently, as we've focused quite a bit on higher levels and very difficult challenges, we've also added a lot of multiple group content. And while this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, in the future we'll make sure more single group challenges are added, as well as content for all level ranges, more playing styles, etc.&gt;&gt;<P>There are PLENTY of single group challenges (IE ANY static camp and most dungeons).  NOW is the time for focusing on adding things for the solo-player.  We just want the same love everyone else gets.. is that so wrong? (giving you puppy-dog eyes)<P>As a final note - we all know it's not easy trying to cater to the demands of a fickle player base with MANY different points of view and many different play styles.  We appreciate all the hard work you and the designers do and whole-heartedly thank you for taking the time to enage in this lively debate with us.  Hopefully what you learn here will translate into making EQ a better game (hopefully WITHOUT mroe expansion packs) and maybe even make future games (yours and others) better as well.<P>-- Run</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since there is 8 pages already on this, I don't know if this has been covered. <P>One big disadvantage to melee is the lack og bind/gate.  Running 10 minutes through West Karanas gets old real quick.  I realize that this is to balance out that spell casters need to re-mem spells, but in most situations its much worse.<P>How about this.  Create a stone (Lore, No rent)summonable by any class that can bind.  The target of the spell is a group member, and it appears in that members inventory.  When you right click on the stone, it summons you to the caster.<P>So, you start fighting in a group, a magic user summons a stone for each meleer.  When a tank dies, he waits for the group to give the ok, then *poof* back to the group.  No more running to the corpse and causing the whole group to wait for you to get back.<P>Also allows a melee to "gate".  Just let the magic user gate, then use the stone.<P>Make bank runs.  Have 2 casters, one creates a stone for the other which is bound at the bank.  Gate to bank, sell stuff, convert money, stone back.<P>Any thoughts?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/em agrees with the last poster:<P>Exploring new lands in a game that you pay for monthly should not be fearful in the extreme sense.  Why not keep the exp penalty, but return the equipment to the player?  Why should 1 death potentially cost the player their entire equipment base?<P>I have played AC, and concur that the vitae penalties work much better, along with losing the most valuable item on you.  You have to go back and loot that item off your corpse.<P>But with EQ, the exp penalty is much greater.  <P>Not only do you potentially lose hours/days/weeks worth of work, but you can also lose equipment that you've earned/bought/traded for permanently.<P>I agree that death should be penalized, but should there be a risk of permanently penalizing the player in terms of equipment loss? I've always thought that thinking to be a little extremist.<P>I know many players that are able to devote hours to one raid, accounting for the possibility of CR.  I, on the other hand, do not have that time.  It's not because I don't have time to go exploring and dungeon delving.  It's because I don't have the time to pad into the equation to account for possible CR for myself and everyone else.<P>While clerics are a necessity for high-level raids, they must also contend with these issues.<P>In conclusion, the post-50 game has generally been disappointing for me for these very reasons. <P>Design issues surrounding the death penalty, that have haunted EQ since release, have manifested themselves into "Time vs. Survival" beasts.<P>I apologize if this is a representation of my slanted opinion.<P>To me, death should penalize the gamer, but should not pose the risk of permanently wiping away that player's entire equipment list.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do agree with the need of having something set you back when you die. Loosing items maybe a bit strong, because it takes so long to get some items. So, about the only thing left is the loss of exp. What I would like to see is this. The ability to "pick up" your corpse. Make it weigh a lot 80 stones or something like that. So that you can take your corpse and have it res'ed. There would still be the time and effort of getting your corpse res'ed. But being able to take it across a zone line would make life much easier.<BR>Also if you are thinking about doing this. You might want to make it so that the corpse is a "Lore" item. And, it can only be picked up by the owner of the corpse.<P>Hope ya guys/gals read this.
