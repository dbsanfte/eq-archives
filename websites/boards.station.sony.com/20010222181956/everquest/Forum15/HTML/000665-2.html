</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I'm surprised the following was not directly on the list:<P>Two of our newest songs (L50 and L60 Velious drops) will not be played by any Bard.  The fact that Melody of Ervaj and Composition of Ervaj REQUIRE an instrument for such a small haste bonus means that no nard will ever use them.  The damage output of the group is likely to be less if a bard plays these songs. =(<P>I suppose that this loosely fits under the haste stacking issue which is on the list, but I fear that if haste stacking is deemed "working as intended", then it will be forgotten that these songs should be evaluated for usefulness.<P>Lorekeeper - L54 Bard Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Note about the auto twisting ... Im a lvl 40 bard. I could twist up to four songs in low lag situations. I have recently moved and no longer have a DSL connection (DSL and Cable neither one available in this neighborhood).  Im really doing good to keep 2 songs going all the time now.  I fully support autotwisting.  Casters get a cool bonus of medding while sitting at 35.  Why shouldnt we get something that doesnt really affect game balance, but sure makes things convenient.  And when you want to go back to twisting 4, you can turn off autotwist and do it.  Yes it was fun to impress the heck out of my party and keep four songs up for 15 -20 min... but the twitch factor is terrible.<P>It seems to me that this is just a nice bonus for when you are higher level and have already learned how to do it the hard way. (just like i didnt get to use a calculator on math till i was in 7th grade)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>   I think you did a great job regarding the list so far, covering most of the song issues in detail, but I think there are a few very important items that need to be added.  Most of these items relate to melee type abilities...if we are indeed a "defensive" tank, riposte and parry post 50 AND capping at 75 is far too low.  Why can these abilities not be given to the bard more on par with the other hybrids in the level 20-30 range?  Why are the caps so low?  All the other hybrids have caps more than double ours, even the "offensive" hybrids.<BR>   Personally, I do not believe the bard is a defensive hybrid or an offensive hybrid but should be somewhere in between both.  Currently we have the lowest offense and the lowest defense, this does not seem right...<BR>   Another issue related to our "titles" as the jack of all trades, but Masters of none...at higher levels no one cares how many skills you have at 50-75...these are pretty much *all* useless.  Picklock was mentioned in the list, but what about hide/sneak (useless at the caps, especially since we have an invisibility song, I don't know any bards that use it), forage (nice ability, but wood elves get higher caps than us for just being elves), riposte, parry, etc.  (I can't really include track or safe fall because they are still somewhat useful even with their low caps, although being able to reach 100 in all of these skills would be nice...)  The high level game in Everquest is *all* about specialization and everyone having 1 job to do.  The monks pull, the warriors tank, rogue dishes damage, enchanters keep crowds under control, clerics heal, etc...what should bards do?  Watered down versions of abilities others possess at higher levels are useless in 90% of the hunting scenarios (this problem is magnified because our songs don't stack with much of anything and/or people cap haste/resistances easily without us).  Having versitility is great at lower levels, but not all that useful past the 25 range.  No good high level group does any serious hunting without a "balanced" party (ie tanks, healers, damage dealers, buffed, debuffers).  Where does the bard fit into this schema?  Anyways I've gone on for long enough, thank you for your time and listening to some of our issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>man, i cant take anyone that would list the Lute of the Howler as a needed nerf seriously.  I doubt anything positive will come of all this stuff.  Its just a way for VI to say 'sorry all classes are final, we cant fix anymore broken/useless songs,items,abilities,quests'<P>Bards could use some work, much of whats listed there are things that have been talked about for over a year.  You think we're gonna believe you will fix any of it all of a sudden?  Yeah sure. Heck, half the stuff listed is stuff you guys broke that used to work. <P>As far as the lute goes, May as well remove the other 1 or 2 bard specific items from Velious while youre at it Absor.<P>Once again, to summarize the thought put into bard songs/items just take a look at the PoG/Quest Breastplate effect:  Selos Song of Travel.  If that isnt enough of a laugh check out the Singing Steel Breastplate effect: Invigorate.  Brilliant. ROFL.<P>There are currently no other rewards besides the Lute of the Howler that a been-60-for-months bard gets excited about.  Put some more items in the game for us, dont make them cheesy like SS and Melodic BP.<P>also, melody and composition of erjav are *bugged* on many occasions it will cause players to have a rediculous delay (ie: swing once every 40 seconds).  not that i would use them anyway.<P>oh and bards should have taunt at a decent skill cap.<P>final note:  any changes you make...

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First of all let me thank you for the time you've spent addressing some of these important issues for bards.  Secondly, I am surprised that this did not make your list, for most bards post 50, there are two MAJOR issues that come into play:<P>1.  This is the lesser of the two.  Bards become less useful the more balanced a group gets.  If we are in a group that includes a primary tank, shaman, cleric, and enchanter, about 80% of the songs we would normally play are useless on our playlist.  The things I do 95% of the time in a group is either Mez, Charm, Haste, Slow, Heal, and Mana regen.  Once we have an enchanter, shaman, and cleric...the only thing that's needed is mana regeneration.  Its hard to feel useful when you are playing Manasong while melee'ing (And listening to the shaman cackle about outmelee'ing you).  Now, there are other songs that we can play in situations, Song of Shields, Nivs, etc.  But our effectiveness and usefullness in the group is greatly reduced.  I would like to see a song or two added that can stack on top of these things that are all the sudden rendered useless by the presence of these classes.  Some ideas is a better stackable haste song (that stacks with ench, shaman hastes) that is something lik 10% without instrument equipped.  Currently we have a song that does 5% haste stackable, but you have to actually equip an instrument.  Saying that 5% may cause more damage than we would without instruments equipped is just a testament to our horrible melee.<P>2.  Now this is the major problem.  As detailed nicely by Thott (Guild leader of Afterlife), Bards really have no role in big raids.  Pre-Kunark, bards were somewhat essential on big raids of mobs like Nagafen, and Vox.  Now, with the resists added to kunark and velious armor, as well as resist spells and potions...it is quite easy to reach 200+ resists without the assistance of bardsong.  Therefore, bard usefullness on raids has been reduced to sitting in a corner with the casters singing manasong.  Now, again, I will offer some solutions:  Obviously its too late to take back all of the too generous resists that have been put on items.  That was a mistake in my opinion.  So we are assuming that resists won't be that role for bards (assuming that it would be too hard to raise the effectivness of resists post 255).  So, some other things are still very viable for big raids on large mob encounters.  One is increase the effectiveness of bard mana drain songs.  Currently they do no good against large mobs.  Two is again to make the stackable hastes more prominent.  A larger percentage or such.  Third, is what a bard should really do.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT MAKES SENSE.  Music is an inspiration.  It heightens our sense of emotion, and ability.  So.  Give post 53 or so bards a special song.  Song of Inspiration.  This song has a 10 minute duration, and no other songs can be sung during this time.  While singing this song, group haste is increased 15%, Resists improved 20%, Mana Regeneration doubled (as if singing Cantata).  This actually has a chance at making a bard useful in these high lvl encounters.  Anyhow, these are not the only options for making Bards viable for high lvl encounters.  But it has been very clear that Verant makes it their goal to make all classes viable at these types of encounters, but Bards seem to be left behind.  <P>Please consider this point.  I know the post 50 bard community is fully supporting our lack of roles post-50.<P>Megdailie Hornblower<BR>Bardess of the 55th Song<BR>Illuminati Sancti</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Melodic Breastplate is even worse than the SS one.  It cancels itself each time its refreshed.<P>  I think bard armour effects need to look at things that the bard can ALREADY do and give them an appropriate, stacking spell effect that will augment the songs.  IE Bracer damage shield stacks with psalm of warmth/cooling, bringing out damage shield up to 19.  No bard complains, because this is a SOLID ABILITY that augments the class.<P>  Something like "regeneration" or even chloro, maybe a small AC buff (level 20s cleric one), a spell in the shielding line (mr/ac/hp that casters and most other classes get on their kunark armour) etc.  Root would be nice but WAY overpowering, considering our ability to cast effects while moving.<P>  Think about augmenting what we have with our armour if you can't add reasonable decent effects.<P><BR>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>51 bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Aria of Eagles levitate also has two annoying bugs (aside from duration and its short range causing me to nearly kill group member in lag).<P>It not only doesn't "stack" with ther forms of levitation, but appears to permanenly override and *remove* levitation effects on party members.  This is esp. noticable with air elementals (both pets and the illusion).<P>For example:<BR>Party consists of several members an enchanter and a Bard who come to a location where you want to levitate across something.  The. enchanter is in illusion air elemental.  The Bard sings aria and the party (if close) levitates.  The enchanter thinking they are fine moves out of song range and falls.  As well .. after the bard *stops* singing aria the enchanter will NEVER levitate again unless they cancel and recast thier illusion.  Mage air pets as well, the pet must be killed and a new one summoned to get it to levitate again.<P>This has been bugged.<P>But it also is a stacking issue.  It becomes a song that I cannot use with members that have lev effects or levitating pets in the group - as it cancels that effect for them permanenty.<P>Menuette<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick note to my bard friends (which includes myself, as I'm leveling a bard now).  <P>Although I *personally* don't begrudge you the Werewolf Lute, please let me explain the thinking so there's no resentment.<P>Enchanters are supposed to be "Illusionists" -- we're even called that at later levels.  Yet effective with this item, the *only* unique form we have was removed.  Enchanters have been asking for additional illusions from the beginning, being told there was no additional memory for this.  Since then other forms have been added but enchanters were denied these forms because "It's something unique for that class."<P>So what enchanters are asking for, as the supposed "Masters of Illusion", is a unique form of their own.  We *used* to have this with the Werewolf Illusion, now we don't.<P>I ***personally*** would prefer to see a completely new illusion myself -- as stated, I don't begrudge bards the Werewolf form myself.<P>Does that make a little more sense than the way Alan put it?<P>Either way, Ahjah is 14th so it's Happy Dervish Killing time...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not here to talk about post-50 problems. I've been playing my bard for about a year and a half now, enjoying him, and playing slowly so as not to burn myself out, and have reached lvl 39. There are a few things I would like to discuss.<P>Problem: Bard damage output vastly underpowered.<P>Description: It's blatantly obvious that bards can't stand toe-to-toe with casters for spell damage, and that's ok. It's also fine that we can't dish damage like a ranger/warrior/monk/ranger. But, what does bother me is that I cannot even outdamage a paladin, who from all evidence I've seen, has the role of damage absorber/healer. Against normal mobs, the paladin will outdamage the bard because of bash, or becuase of the nice ratio on most 2h slash weapons, and against undead, forget about it...<P>Solution: Either give bards some songs that put our damage output somewhere in between paladin and SK, or boost our meelee skills (dual wield, backstab, something), for the same effect, and put it in  before level 50.<P>Problem: I'm supposed to be a *defensive* hybrid, but even with higher AC and similar HP as a ranger (the *offensive* hybrid) I find myself getting whacked when something turns on me. <P>Solution: Move parry and ripostle down to level 30 or so, and make the cap at least equivalent to ranger caps, if not closer to Paladin/SK caps.<P>Problem: I'm supposed to be *jack-of-all-trades*, yet in lower guk, I'm no more maneuverable than your average warrior.<P>Solution: Give us some sort of invis vs. undead song, perhaps entwined with the song that gives ultravision/see invis, so as not to require placement of a new song somewhere in Norrath, or let us hide/sneak as per rogue ability, so we could sneak by the undead.<P>Other than that, I think the list is perfect pre-50. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of those are fluff, or bugs of which there should be no question about fixing. Heres what you need to repeat over and over again, and paint on the office walls. Bards want something that makes them needed against big raid mobs.<P>As I see it, there are two possible solutions to this. There either make resists in the 250+ range mean something. As is most people against the Trak and harder mobs settle for just using gear and Shaman/Ench/Druid buffs to get up to around 175-200 and figure thats as good as it gets, and that 250+ means nothing. Make 250+ mean something for real, thats the Bards roll against the big mobs.<P>Other possible solution, Serious manadrains. If we  can't make 250+ resist mean something, change Insipid Ditty to this; An unresistable 150-200ish mana drain, nothing else. No debuffs, no duration, 10 less wis does not make ther song better, it just means that 1 bard is fixed on a raid, and the rest arn't.<P>If you have any other ideas for big raids, lets here em. But please don't confusing minor stuff like the SS Boots with the real issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also, one other thing, and this may be better posted on a thread about general game balance.<P>After killing Mangler in Rivervale, because he aggroed on me, and it was either kill him, die, or zone, I received bad rivervale faction. I petitioned to have my faction restored, and was told that Everquest players are not allowed to use roleplaying or other non-bug related issues to justify faction restoration, resurrections, etc.<P>I have two examples where Verant has violated this policy, if the GM I talked to wasn't lying to me in the first place:<P>1. I remember a post a while back by someone at Verant explaining why some NPC's attack people when they are not KOS. In it, this person said that any NPC has a chance of aggroing anyone, based on their "mood". A good example of this are the centaurs of South Karana. They occasionally just start attacking you, even though they are not KOS. It's a bug, and VI explained it away with RP excuses.<P>2 (and more applicable to bards). I recently petitioned because I didn't understand why Selo's Accelerando didn't work indoors, since I have no God or Nature problems. I was told essentially that it was a game balance thing, and that if we had sow indoors, shamans/druids/rangers would pitch a fit.<P>Even more recently, I saw a froglok shaman cast SoW on itself, and that got me to thinking: Why can this frog cast SoW, when players can't. So I petitioned.<P>The response I received was that the frogloks can SoW indoors because they were born there, and have spent a great deal of time there, so they learn to cast it indoors.<P>What I'm saying is this: If I am supposed to accept their Roleplaying explanation of why frog shamen can cast movement increasing spells on themselves, shouldn't my roleplaying explanation of why my bard should be able to sing Selo's indoors be accepted?<P>Bottom line: No Selo's, No player SoW, NO MOB SOW.<P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that an autotwist feature should be implemented.  Repeated motions in the hands like that with the fingers over and over and over just to be "useful" or "good" isn't exactly my idea of ergonomic.  I'm currently level 40, I will twist a few different songs now and then, and I used to make those silly hotkeys that did the twist for me.  Lag situations killed that, rememming killed that, dying and rememming killed that, you get the point.<P>The AC on armor is horrid, the effects are laughable.  Oh, it would not be so bad if laughable added to our (and everyone else's) enjoyment of our company.  We do have a few songs that seem to be a bit out of place and the melee related riposte and parry are so high level that they may as well not be there at that point.<P>Illusions, now that is a touchy subject.  Enchanters have the illusions, bards get a couple from items.  I would think that our magical manipulation of song, word and our charisma could induce an illusion, and that enchanters should get a few more related illusions (or at least Monster illusion - duplicating the same visionary effect the summon monster does for mages) (considering mages can summon pets that mimic the forms of other mobs in the zone).  This still limits the bard to racial and/or itemized illusions while the enchanter gets to keep the personal illusions.  Anyway, the idea is there, no sense getting a club to the head.<P>Midrange instrumentation.  If songs (in their entirety - including haste) were to benefit from the use of instruments as well as effected by different instruments - then yes, more more more!  Give a bit of customization to the jesters and entertainers that wander the world.  Strumming a flute has been a long time irritation as well.<P>Cultural stuff doesn't sit well with me, unless the bards of all orientation get access to the same items - perhaps with different names.<P>Quests.  I think a few more useful songs should be quested instead of bought.  Replace the ones that are busted with some neat little quest that is easy, but requires a trip to various cities and/or continents - but then.  The tambourine was an awesome quest, but a bard could not do it on their own & that was rather disheartening to me.<P>Usefulness when in balanced groups, people are buffed to the extreme, and/or presence of very powerful specialized classes:  Well, we're a jack of all trades, master of none.  Put us in a situation where you've got the masters of our trades, of course we lose effectiveness.  That is indeed a problem.  Why have a bard if you can get an enchanter who will supply clarity and haste?  Why a bard if you can get a cleric to supplement the shaman in the party?  More unique and stackable abilities that add to the party would be great!<P>Invis to undead song idea:  The undead areas should hate our joyous music and our celebration of existance.  This is one area it should be difficult for a bard!  However, I would presume that under many levels of training, the bard would eventually (40 + ) gain a song that allows them to avert the senses of the dead - a sort of numbing chant.  Sounds like a great quest to me ... <P>A few thoughts, a few drinks, and a few more coppers on the table.<P>Artistic Impression<BR>40th bard<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No, I dont play a bard.<P>No, I have never played a Bard.<P>But these are the things that I have seen that are wrong with the bard just by grouping with them.<P>Bards have a HARD time mezzing monsters. All abilities in Everquest that arent there for flavor have at least 2 classes that can do that ability. The mez line is the one area that bards USED to be able to back up Enchanters in but can no longer do so. (No Necromancers dont count, their mez is supposed to be a fear with a memblur component). Please allow bards to stick their mez on 1 monster with almost positive certainty of locking that one monster down, allow them to control 2 monsters if they are actual bards, and 3 if they are really good. This gives groups a back up mezzer or SOMEONE who can mez in the all too common situation that an otherwise good group cant find an enchanter.<P>The second suggestion is that Bards are the masters of resistances. They can buff resistances better than ANY other classes, but with the introduction of newer items this ability has lost almost ALL use. A way for Top end bards to see use again, and regain their titles of king of resistances is to give them a song a 55 that makes their group immune to Dragon Roar (Mayhap 52 so that they would be useful on Vox and Nagafen raids again?), and another at 60 that makes their group immune to the effects of Deathtouches. Make the bards the masters of SOUND, much as Enchanters are the masters of Mind and Necromancers of Death. An extension of this idea is to have bards, at 55th or 60th become PERSONALLY immune to the silence spell.<P>The next suggestion is to have Bard haste act as ITEM haste, this allows a bard to take the place of rare drop items from Gods and Dragons and allows more than the top 10% of EQ players to hit the magical Haste caps if they are grouped with a Shaman or Enchanter and a Bard. (Quick note, The Augmentation and Haste lines of Enchanters and Shamen will also not stack when cast over bard haste songs, but will stack under them).<P>A suggestion for the Bard Kunark Breastplate to replace their current underpowered effect would be to have a silence effect cast out of it, mayhap with a 30 second casting time, and a duration of 2 minutes. This would allow bards to stop monsters from gating away from combat, or maybe an irrisistable effect that prevents monsters from gating, while they retain all other spell casting capabilities?<P>Replace the effect of the boots with See invisible. And replace the effect of the pants with Improved Invisibility to Undead, or Gate...<P>Finally, allow bards to positively alter the factions of others through their songs while grouped, nothing to big, but a 200 to 300 point faction adjustment would allow a Bard to fill a niche that no other class can do (Others can play with personal factions, but no class can help others with faction)<P>These are just some suggestions from someone who used to group with a bard, but now doesnt because there are so few of them out there.<P>Sassnik Dreameweaver, Level 53 High Elven Illusionist, Tunare (Krieger)<BR>SkillsMistress of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>These are my concerns as a 33 lvl bard . 1/ Bards need an evade skill ..songs are a supper taunt 2/ Bards songs are resisted far to much 3/ We are the only melee class that does not get DOUBLE ATTACK this needs to be addressed 4/ Bards hps are very low for a melee class 5 / Animations for bard drum ...needs to be fixed , this looks very dumb 6/Magic bard instruments should list the % increase to the song and anything extra that item adds 7/ Bards should get the PARRY skill again we are the only melee class that does not get this skill 8/ With these fixes you could take away our sneak skill (have invis song) , take away hide (have invis song) , take away instill doubt (have fear song) . There are some other issues but these are the main ones for me and i think most other bards ....please post and let me know if you other bards agree .

</FONT><HR>Well this all seems like some very good argument going on, but I fully agree with the notion that Bards are a jack of all trades, and masters of none.<P>I'm looking at this argument from an AD&D Perspective as well as an EQ persepective.  And don't tell me I have no clue what I'm talking about, I have the nickname Bard because I play them so often in any game that has them.  (Bard's Tale was an awesome game :P )  Anyhow my point is, two good points were raised, Bards do seem to be a melee version of an enchanter, so why not at least give them an increase in some songs.  Granted my bard isn't very high in EQ, but in a huge train situation Kellin's Lucid Lullaby has a small use, but it's resisted enough that the only way to make it useful is to not twist songs with it while running away so it stays up, this often results in the bard being the straggler of the group and ends up being tooled by the train.<P>Now to bring up the AD&D argument.  In D&D and not that EQ should copy, a Bard is more of a mix between a Wizard, and a Rouge. Bringing up issuses, bards get spells in D&D second edition such as Burning Hands that does a goodly ammount of dammage to a small range of creatures at a lower level.  But in contrast to this when the bard recieves the ability to cast spells, the Wizard is well on his way to gettings several more useful spells.  Thats where the bardsd inspiration ability makes up to balance out.  Bards recieve the ability to boost party Morale at low level, in a sense making them once again useful if a Wizard joins the party.  When a rouge joins the party the Bard is once again outclassed in his melee ability because Rouges get sneak attack (Back Stab, bards should not get this D&D or EQ) and Rouges also get use magic device.  Granted rouges will always be better at picking locks, they are thieves it's what they do.<P>Lastly in the case in D&D where a rouge joins the group a bard is balanced out once again by his ability to cast spells.  The final things I disagree with on a roleplaying sense is, since when could you sneak/hide/play an instrument in plate armor.  In D&D (this is unrelated to EQ) it is impossible to cast, even for a Bard in such heavy, movement restricting armor.<P>Now that I'm rambling I guess I should simply put this in.  I'm not a high level bard, but reading some things discourages me from high level, because so far all I keep hearing is "I can't wait till you get your mana song."  I don't want to level up just to become a Mana battery.  Bards should have more abilities that allow them to solo more effectively. In a roleplaying sense Bards Travel alot, so they have to know self defense out on the dangerous roads, (Hence they should recieve Parry and Riposte at earlier levels, or even hide which lets them duck away from combat like rouges, and granted that is not much of a useful ability, but in a heavy comba situation wouldn't it be neat to duck away from combat and seem to appear elsewhere, ie make the ability to duck away from combat work like a small fade, this would give rouges the advanatge to move away during combat and backstab, where a bard could move away just enough to get a song off, even melifluious motion which also has a group fade effect) Street smarts often saves a traveler, and kowing how to duck out of a fight is just as important as being able to take one.  And the Caps for those melee abilities is way to low, but I also don't think that they should be as high as other hybrids either.  Limit to maybe 100 or 120 somwhere in there would make the skill useful enough for a bard to tank when he is needed as a tank, or sit back and cast when he is needed to cast.<P>Which brings up my last argument, I fully support giving bards a meditate ability for the obvious reason of lowering memerisation and scribe time.  And if you want a roleplaying argument on that, everyone has to sit and think about a performance before they actually give it.<P>Just my two cents...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see many items on that list that fall just short of important.  I hope they focus on balance over drum animations/casting animations/slot placement/NPC Bard attacks/Solusek Ro Quest... None of these affect our ability to play the game any more balanced.  <P>Illusions are easily workable into a bard class and werewolf falls along those lines.  Throw that issue out.  Add more illusion of give us a much better charm or mez.  The very idea of a bard is someone that can play music and charm/mez/lull... the crowd/mob.  I really don't see how we can effectivly charm/mez/lull multiple mobs let alone a single without completely focusing on that single task therefor negating other use in the group since all twisting will focus around the target.  So yes, that will hopefully be addressed<P>I think automatic twisting(since it is largely based on computer speed(price)/lag/connection speed) is a good idea.<P>And I think that if we are in the Hybrid group, they should focus on making us balanced to the other hybrids.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>He he he,  I was just reading that again and thinking on my argument of a bard being a mix of a wizard and rouge in D&D.  <P>Bards are performers, so they recieve spells that are flashy and could add to a performance.  Bards in D&D get acess to the spell audible glammer in D&D which allows them to produce a distracting sound abywhere within a cretain radius, and the sound can be any pitch at any distance.  At higher levels this allows them to produce a sound of a small crowd of people, or small group of monsters.  As for flash, they get dancing lights which dazzles a creature, but abards ability to mez is based on his ability to perform, not on magic.<P>So why not give bards a perform ability that would allow them to mesmerize a crowd.  This would greatly be unfair to an Enchanter, but to balance this out, a performing bard certainly would not mesmerize a group of undead, or an animal.  This is probably an idea which will be dismissed, but if you can't perform to mes somthing, why not perform for townsfolk to earn money as a supplement to the beg skill, or even replace it.  A good performer could colllect a few silver or copper, this woudl be useful for lower level, and add a nice roleplaying sense, and in that light, just like begging, a bad performance being repeated over and over is annoying and could anger some.  just another side thought, and obviously I'm just posting these as I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This would greatly be unfair to an Enchanter, but to balance this out, a performing bard certainly would not mesmerize a group of undead, or an animal.[\quote]<BR>I still think that the bards main ability is  largely mes/charm related and at current, we suck at it when there is more than one mob.  If there is one or two, we have to focus heavily on keeping that target busy.<P>[quote]I'm sorry but I cannot support the clamoring for increased OFFENSE skills for bards.<BR>To me it is obvious that a bards skills are his songs and instruments and is mainly to enhance the performance of his group. We do that nicely.<P>I get frustrated when I see bards "playing" a tank. I was playing my mage last night and we had a bard join us. What a putz. He insisted on only playing one song and kept wielding weapons.<P>Nope ... I fully support the definition of the Bard as a Defensive Hybrid.

Is that the price for being a jack of all trade?  I think we should get a better deal.<P>[quote]No, I dont play a bard.<BR>No, I have never played a Bard.<P>But these are the things that I have seen that are wrong with the bard just by grouping with them.<P>Bards have a HARD time mezzing monsters. All abilities in Everquest that arent there for flavor have at least 2 classes that can do that ability. The mez line is the one area that bards USED to be able to back up Enchanters in but can no longer do so. (No Necromancers dont count, their mez is supposed to be a fear with a memblur component). Please allow bards to stick their mez on 1 monster with almost positive certainty of locking that one monster down, allow them to control 2 monsters if they are actual bards, and 3 if they are really good. This gives groups a back up mezzer or SOMEONE who can mez in the all too common situation that an otherwise good group cant find an enchanter.<BR>[\quote]<BR>EXACTLY, Mez a single mob as effectively as an enchanter can do several.  That would be fair.  And none of this constant twisting of a song on that mob.  Targeting is terrible for that.<P><BR>Song Effectiveness should be comparable to its respective class if an instrument is used.  If I stand there with an instrument and cast Chain, it had better work as good as the level 1 druid snare.<P>Singing Steel armor effects are humorous/embarassing/useless.  The AC is not much better.<P>Since we are DEFENSIVE hybrids I don't expect to see songs increased to a level to rival DAMAGE output of SKs/Rangers/Paladins/ but we should get Defense that puts us above them.<P>Jack of All Trades.  Almost every class has a Caster and a Melee Version (Druid/Ranger)  We are close to Rogues and close to Enchanters.  We should not get so shorted on ability just because we can play a feeble song version of that classes ability.  Maybe specialization is a good idea for the bard.  Give us a choice of Instrument to specialize in.  That skill would produce better results for "Wind" songs and the others (string, percussion,...) would cap lower.  That way we could choose a path to define our jack of all trades role.  Specialization could increase ability in that instrument 10% and the other instruments would be lower 10%.  So Percussion specialization would increase "resistance" songs 10% but "denon's songs" would lower 10% because they are brass.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fangarr, you are wrong in your assumption.  The level 60 stackable with all haste song requires brass.  The bard epic weapon is a brass instrument as well as all other instruments.  I find this song quite nice in situations where everyone in my group has an uber haste item, and shissar...this song brings a lot of people that have an RBG etc, closer to the cap and to the haste that those with uber 40% haste items from SoV have (ie: gaunts of dragonslaying, etc).  It's a good song, and does not need to be looked into.<P>Also, the auto-twisting idea is almost as rediculous as the levels listed at which it would become available.  If any auto twisting was made available, it would not be at 19, 39 or any of the levels you listed.  Even put at level 60, an auto twisting ability would create stacking issues and simply would not work.  You can't cast two things at once.  If you really are worried about repetetive motion damage to your wrists, make a juggling macro, they work fine.  I don't use them because it is a terrible idea to set what you are playing in stone, and you can do a much better job without the macro, but if your wrists are really giving out, by all means make a macro.<P>I do agree with what others have said about our defensive skills and possibly hps more along the lines of what "hybrids" have.  I agree with the haste stacking idea, but not that the old songs should stack, just that there should be a L55+ addition of stacking haste song(s) since high level play is where the trivial haste percentages come up big or even matter at all.  Giving 4% more haste may make or break an epic fight, but it's just another grain of sand on the beach killing Dervish Cutthroats.<P>Anyway, the boots and legs summoning single food and drink should be upped to abundant(4), this will in no way unbalance the class, and if you're that worried about it, make the food no drop as well.  SS bp effect is useless, and so is melodic.  Melodic BP effect : Selos Song of Travel, has zero usefulness.  The song NEEDS to stay on when you click the BP, otherwise since this song stops after 3 rounds or on a reclick or song cast, the BP's effect is 100% moot and has no purpose.  Suggestion : instant invis (real invis).<P>Also, the song has ended message is not a problem.  The "you are about to fall" message is not a problem.  The blinking icons are not a problem because they represent a fading buff as bard buffs are essentially regular buffs with 3 round durations (in all party based instaces).  The deleted message on Sheild of Songs should be changed to a single message as it was spam before (not that anyone has bard songs on anyway right? heh).  Don't take the small stuff like the animations of mesed people into consideration, not that I need to say that.  You guys have never changed the old animations, and really since it does not effect gameplay, you should focus on the issues that actualy hinder the game.<P>Siabot Valkteraz<BR>L60 Element of Darkness<BR>TOT2 Sexy Dress-wearing Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great work Absor!! Bearing in mind that you've had to filter & compile such lists for all the other classes, you deserve a medal! Whatever the development team do with the list, you'll always have my respect for the amount of work that you've obviously put into this.<P>My 55 bard is into her 2-month countdown to oblivion but this list gives me hope that I might take up EQ again & bring her back to Norrath.<P>Having said that, however, I do have a few points to add and contest (typical huh?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>1) Drum-playing & casting animations<BR> Personally, I think these should have low priority. They have nothing to do with class balance and I actually like the mix of animations for songs. As for the drum, I read somewhere, long ago, that this was difficult to implement properly. As a compromise, why not swap the flute for a tambourine? Nostrolo's Tambourine looks fine when strummed (IMO)<P>2) Increasing the damage from our damage songs from 50 to 60 to keep in line with other spells would be great. However, it will be uselss unless the resist rate is lowered also. I last tried using the 3 chants at level 52 or 53 (heck, we still have to try soloing, even at that level  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ) and the resist rate was usually 100%, else very close to it.<P>3) Song effects on items<BR> Firstly, there aren't "tons" (however many that is  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) of battle-useful song effects. I can only think of Niv's on Breath of Harmony and the epic song effect (but then, I'm not a walking EQ item catalogue). Additional songs such as those on Singing Steel BP (Travel Song) aren't going to unbalance the game, however many there are.<BR>Secondly, they are only available at higher levels because of the minimum level required to use them. As things currently stand, post-50 bards need all the help they can get.<P>4) Kelin's Lucid Lullaby<BR> Re. this song's redundancy after about level 30, you say "....if this is intentional then that's fine" No it's not! Not unless we get an upgrade at higher levels. Song of Twilight is spot-on now, until the need to pin-down 3 or 4 mobs coincides with the ubiquitous lag-spike. We need an AE mez, even if it's only of short duration, to recover from such situations. As it stands, bards are more liability than asset when it comes to crowd control at higher levels.<P>5) Song Twisting<BR> Just to say that introducing auto-twist in increments seems to be a great idea. Manually twisting at lower levels requires skill. To keep it going for 8 hours plus on a long raid at higher levels requires a brain-dead player with forearms like Popeye (anchor tatooes help but are not necessary). Plus it becomes very anti-social and many of us play bards because we wanted (in the beginning) to be sociable.<P>6) Fulfil's Curtailing Chant<BR> I think your description of Fulfil's Curtailing Chant is incorrect. Correct me if I am wrong, anyone, but Fulfil's Curtailing Chant is only a DoT, despite the fact that some lists also claim that it also lowers magic resistance. Having it lower MR would keep it in line with the other chants, however.<P>7) New songs cancelling old songs<BR> "...this is annoying the heck out of bards." No kidding!! This bug alone will stop me from playing my bard again. Every time I get the "perfect" twist I am penalised by a bug!<P>8) Slow/snare songs<BR> I've not seen this mentioned directly here, but it was on the original list. The high level slow/snare songs are just that - slow AND snare. Therefore, if a group needs slow only, we are limited to using Largo's melodic Binding (level 20) which slows without snaring. However, this is an AE song and therefore potentially limited. If a group needs snare only, the bard is uselss as any slow spells will cancel the bard snare & vice versa.  We need ONE targeted slow/snare song and separate, targeted, slow and snare songs to increase our usefulness. The 54 song is fine as it is, being great for AE groups.<P>9) Increase in melee potential<BR> This has been mentioned a few times in this thread, but my *personal* opinion is that bards are about their songs, not melee. From a balance point of view, our melee skills should just a be a bonus to our songs, assuming we are not using instruments. Certainly at higher levels (from my level 55 perspective), some form of taunt would probably be welcomed, as our songs just don't have the same aggro effect that they had at lower levels and we can take much more damage.<P>10) Post level-50 role<BR> The list doesn't really address our non-existent role post-level 50 (especially post-54). Making haste songs stackable won't have a great effect when any decent group's tanks are already maxed from a combination of items and enchanter haste. Same applies to resists, with a shaman and other buffing classes. Xeg-Megdailie's (sp.?) post covers this and has some good suggestions, so I won't repeat them here.<P>Whew, that was an epic post for me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It's good to see that at least one person from the powers-that-be has paid us bards some attention and I'll be watching this board in anticipation over the next few weeks. Like most bard-players, I have invested a lot of time and patience into my bard and would hate to see her gone for good because she has outlived her usefulness.<P>PS That's Brusco's Boa****l Bellow BTW  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Starling Silvertongue<BR>55 Troubador<BR>Bristlebane<BR>(Now StarlYng with a Y since someone managed to duplicate my original name  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> )<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, back into the fray of discussion, and Absor I agree you do deserve a major medal, but I also agree anything to do with the looks of the class (ie animations etc.) should be very low priority.<P>This post for me is to argue the auto-twisting idea. Granted it would be a great balance, but I despise the idea for several reasons.<P>1) Though this is meant to help balance and make playing a bard easier, it is simply unrealistic.  Look at this from a role-playing perspective for a moment.  One of EQ's priorities has been a realism effect. (hence the reason the drum animation issue made the list.)  If you show me any person who can sing two songs at the exact same time, I'll pay that person money.  I even brought this up in Guild chat among the shadowhunters on the Eci server.  Our high level bard agreed that it would be a help, but doesn't think this will happen simply because it is unrealistic. Song twisting however is because you are therby singing a medly.<P>2) Though being able to sing two songs at once, the proposed level to do this is proposterous, but not infeasable.  By the time you have hit 19 you have maybe one or two songs you want to keep going at the same time as the others. Specifically I could think Hymn and Selo's for running, or Selo's and then several Brusco's Bellows for pulling, but that is about it. And maybe it would help with Tarew's Aquatic Ayre and another song of choice.<P>3) Finally, the idea of auto-twisting would be a great help I admit again, but it simply kills the uniquness of being able to play a bard.  As it has been said, the ability to twist songs seperates the goo from the bad, but it's not just song twisting that makes a great bard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
