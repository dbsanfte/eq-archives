</FONT><HR>My turn- <P>From a sheer single group standpoint we are not too bad, pack chloro/regrowth, strength when a shaman isn't around, and some healing....the problem that arises here is the the same issue, superior heal fizzles...ALOT, and the lack of an alternative. <P>Solution: Drop the level of Superior Heal to drop the fizzle rate and possibly add a heal for shamans and druids to help clerics. (similar to Remedy or Divine Light)<P>I will NEVER be a primary healer, I even have all my heal messages (to inform the group who is getting healed) say that my heal is a patch heal, to keep them fighting, while the cleric finishes that 10 sec casting of complete heal on the warrior with 5k hp. <P><BR>I also need to add that the single group game isn't the only one we are playing, and with the addition of Velious, high level encounters are more and more prominant, with less and less for druids to do at these high level encounter. Can Superior heal do much when something is double attacking for 400? no thats more then the heal actually does, which is why it requires so many people and its impossible to do without a cleric. <P>Someone suggested a lure line of dot's while a good idea, I don't think its a very viable idea, on big raids there is a good possibilty that you are going to die on that raid, if you cast a DoT on a mob and that dot kills it and you are dead (likely to happen), guess what? POOF, no corpse, hence why most of us don't use dots on the bigger mobs. <P>Debuff, I think is the way to go, either a fire/cold debuff (maliose line), so that our spells can at least hit for something. Or a melee Debuff similar to fixation of ro. <P>Fixation of Ro is a nice idea, but I don't honestly think it makes that much of a difference the damage taken from a mob(if you have 1000 for your attack and it drops 50 points, it wont make a significant difference, same with the MoBs), I would think that with this spell I would go from getting hit for 145 consistantly to getting hit for say 110, so it would cut out a percentage of the damage done by a mob....would this help make the druid more of a solo class? nope not at the level 55+ that it would be required, would it definately give a group a reason to bring a druid on a raid, I believe so. <P>So to recap<P>1) Drop Superior heal a few levels to drop the fizzle rate.<P>2) Debuff for raids either melee debuff(lure type debuff), or a fire/cold debuff(maybe ro's fiery sundering but I can't find the spell)<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Wishlist - Just what would be nice<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Armor that doesn't suck, come on look at the weight of Verm armor (and the drop rates for that matter been to fear over 10 times I have the....drum roll ARMPLATES!), even the weight of the new quest armor from velious is outragous, you would think that for having crap ac being only able to wear leather that at least the weight wouldn't be abominable.<P>Thank you for reading<P>Aadon Irontree <BR>57th level Druid Erollisi Marr <BR>The Grey Legion<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, still everyone asking for more.<P>Fera, how would changing snare to be fragile hurt mages and wizards more than druids?  I'm interested to hear your reasoning.<P>I don't think that enhancing every class is the way to make things balanced.  Each class can afford to give up something.  What do druids think they should give up?  Should druids lose some DD efficiency?  Maybe some DoT capabilities?  I'm still looking for someone to come up with a reduction in power they can live with.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Superior fizzle needs some attention.<P>2. Druids are fine in groups, even in dungeons if played right. However, If I cast almost any 2 of my best spells on the same mob I am sure to expend all of my clerics mana. Snare+anything will do it. Druids can debuff a mob for up to 47ac, druids can also debuff attack thx to SoV, (if the spell still drops)unfortunately doing it means certain attempted death upon the mobs part. So I would say please examine agro on mobs in relation to druid spells. last night I cast snare on a sebilite juggernaut on a trak raid and then cast scoriae once on it for 14 damage after it's resists, it was at less than 50% health and still turned around and beat the snot out of me.<P>3. I'm lvl 56. There is virtually nothing loot-wise from most dungeons and most mobs. An example zone is chardok, the best I can hope for is a rare golem tear ring and a rare sarnak battle shield. Both are all/all. Why is there virtually no DRU only items. People equate druids to the shaman class, I see tons of great shaman only gear in game. Why is it that even though druids wear leather, it can't have decent statitics? Is leather somehow unable to be imbued with mystical properties equal to steel and such? I don't wear a tunic just to have it decorate my corpse.<P>Boss mob gear..It's even worse on the boss mobs, I do not need another staff, thx info....<P>Vermiculated gear.. Verant gave me a strength spell so I could wear it. Getting it however is difficult since no one is motivated to make their druid guildmates uber... A verm BP won't make me group teleport any faster..<P>Elder spiritist gear is not worth owning IMHO... Lvl 30 spells and no stats except the BP.<P>SoV gear.... did you make ANYTHING a halfling druid could wear outside of quests that require whole guilds to complete??? (I mean to wear for it's stat's, not it's looks like ulthork stuff.)<P><BR>4. Quad kiting... I saw a shadow knight moan about not being able to kill 4 raptors at once.. However I'll bet a shadow knight could use engulging darkness and fear to kill those same 4 raptors in less time than it takes a druid to quad-kite them. It's a 12 minute repop and it takes like 2 minutes to get 4 raptors all aligned and close enuf to AE and another 3 mins at least to kill since they have to expend their whole mana bar to do it. It's not that efficient, it just looks unfair. If I'm lucky I can kill 16 raptors in an hour and that depends on them not resisting, which at least one usually does forcing me to meditate enough to DD it before sitting to meditate to full again (fortunately at lvl 54 I get a wolf form that gives me a 2 mana per tick regen.. "Pffftt"). So get over quad-kiting, it's not as cracked up as people think it to be.. Mostly it just gives druids something to get some self-worth from after being totally useless on a real raid until people want to leave.<P>P.S. I would much rather spend the whole day in a exp grp, but getting in one can be a challenge and I doubt it's the kind of challenge VI had in mind for our class.<P>P.S.S. I will also resort back to whomever it was that said you don't see a Trak raid not happening because there aren't enough druids. Druids aren't balanced because they are not an essential class to anything a group/raid may do.<P><BR>Littelricky Thickets<BR>Nightmares Asylum<BR>lvl 56 Druid of Povar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, okies, here goes.  From an old school druid, and a new school druid.  (Played the class from 1 up quite aways 2x).<P>Part of why I play a halfling druid (the LARGEST part) is summed in one word.  Fun.<P>Druid is a "Fun" class.  Its not the most powerful nuker, the best fighter (haha) the most effective crowd controller, or the most versatile healer, but it is a little of all of those.<P>However, it is the class that can be the most "Fun" to play.<P>With that in mind, most of my suggestions, are based on "fun", not on "power".<P>Here they are.  BTW&lt; this is 100% serious.<P>1.  Random Animal Based Illusions:  Give us a spell (like monster summoning) that picks a mob in the zone (that is an animal) and gives us that form.  ONLY mobs that the "charm animal" line of spell would work on.  I cant imagine much more fun out of a spell than this.  Oh yeah, make it outdoor only.<P>2.  Skins.  Plain and simple, we look like newbies at lvl 50.  Please, give a texture to some of the old skins.  Such as lockjaw tunic, foremans tunic, etc.  Also, please stop restricting halflings from so much gear (see tree weave etc..)<P>3.  Group Gates to more spots.  I am not one who wants them in every zone, but my goodness, a 20 minute run to get to Surefall glade from the nearest gate, is retarded.<P>4.  Replace the Sap Sheen Staff and Solvedi Scimitar with items/quests that a druid would actually want to have and use.<P>5.  Illusion Mask:  Please, if you cant change our textures, add us to the Mask of Deception, or put our own in that gives us Illusion Barbarian, or actually, this might be a way to implement the random illusion animal.  However, make it so druids of alot of levels can obtain this, since its not a class unbalancing thing, just a fun thing.<P>6.  Treeform Movement.  Come on, this cant be hard, and god would it be fun.<P>7.  Animal Friendship.  Hey, we are druids, the keepers of nature.  Either make ALL regular animals friendly to us, or none.  Not this, "well, this bear here likes me, that lion hates me, this wolf likes me, that griffin hates me...."<P>Verant, you have a great game, and druids are a great class.  If you want to do something for druids, without "unbalancing" their power in any way, use some of these suggestions just to add more "fun factor" to the class.  It would be appreciated!<P>Pinfold Uberhobbit<BR>Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, first off try to fix the inconsistancies between elf/human druid equipment and halfling druid equipment .... there's some great quests for druids on PoG but halflings can't use any of the equipment because they can't worship tunare ... i got pissed when i heard this so i went on a couple PoG raids and destroyed my faction ... but oh well ... <P>a lot of the cool equipment like gnome skin armor can't be equipped by halflings because it's medium race only ... you guys have something against small races ?? It is GNOME skin armor after all ...<P>Druids as a class are pretty balanced, getting superior heal at 44 would DEFINATLY make them more attractive to groups ... i only tried to be the only healer in a karnors group before i got sup heal, i coudnt chain cast greater healing as fast as drol's  did damage ...<P>give halflings cool stuff, that'd make me happy  8)<P>Carbo, 54th wanderer, Lanys<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a 45th level druid. I solo/group about 50/50 (depends on my temperment at the time)<P>Critical to look at: 40+ healing. No CH. I`d like to see SH (same cost/cast time) at 44 (preferably) or 49 (probable) and another heal spell at around 55 or so (900-1khp heal). <P>Major: Druid equipment needs to be reevaluated. There is almost NO druid only equipment, very little druid wearable wisdom armor and none of it quested. Mid range armor should be a bit better than imbued leather armor and hopefully look different.<P>Quests: mid level quests for decent items that are druid only. (armor, weapons, spells, fun stuff) that don`t require items from mobs that nost people have never seen in game (IE solvedi scim anyone) and where the reward is BETTER than the items gathered.<P><BR>Minor: more looks. Tired of looking like a level 4  when i`m 45!<P>Other: personally i`d like to see harmony work indoors as well. would add to grouping for young and old druids and other group buff type of spells that STACK with clerics/sham buffs. <P>Otherwise the druids is one of the best (read most fun) for me to play. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, 460 posts on the last thread...<P>A few things to update.<P>1) For those of you who think that Druids should get CHeal, even at level 60. If you think about it, CHeal is still a major part of a Cleric's arsenal at level 60, so giving us the same spell at that level would be taking something away from them. Though they get it at 39th, it inceases in effectiveness every level. And at level 60, Clerics should have MUCH more healing power that Druids. Keep this in mind when you consider ideas for a 55+ healing spell.<P>2. As for a component for AE nukes... I admit freely that I quad-kited from 39-44. I know ALL about quad-kiting. I did it because I'm weak, because when I saw the easy way out, I took it. I'd rather have grouped, but I got frustrated at the difficulty in getting a good group. What can I say, I wish the temptation wasn't there. But I don't think that it should be removed completely. As it is, most other spellcasters have component-based spells. Needing a component for quad-kiting isn't unbalancing. For all those who've qk'ed the Dwarfs in BB, you know that it can yield 30-40pp per shot. You can use THAT to pay for your vice. Not to mention that Druids can ALWAYS get money if they want to. I'd simply like to make quad-kiting not quite so EASY.<P>3) Another interesting idea would be to create a mod-rod of sorts for the Druid class. Call the spell something like Nature's Bounty. It would summon a Lore item, similar to the mod-rod that would have a one-time use of giving health to a player. Before an Epic battle, the Druid could summon them and pass them around, like Mages and mod-rods. They can be expensive/long to cast, but the item wouldn't actually have any adverse effects (like the mod-rod does). The healing effect doesn't have to be huge, maybe 500 HP or a slightly larger heal-over-time. They would be difficult to use correctly, since they would funk with the Cleric's knowing WHEN to heal a character, but hey, that's what strategy and tactics are for. Oh, and give it the icon from Kiola nuts. (Druid_01 walks amongst the tanks, "Here's a walnut for you, and one for you, and one for you..." :P)<P>4) I think that the Druid pet is fine where it is. It's not supposed to beal a very functional pet. It CERTAINLY is not supposed to compete with the Shaman pet, since they are a pet-having class.<P>5) Druids should not get a pure stun spell. That's the domain of Pallys, Clerics, and Enchanters. It's covered.<P>6) I kinda like the idea of a high-level heal-over-time spell that roots the target while it's in effect. That's a good kind of risk-reward spell for the Druid class.<P>7) I think the rain and point-blank AE spells are worthless. I think I cast Pogonip once, just to try it out, but I NEVER use those spells. Then again, I don't think they should be improved, and I think that taking them out completely would irk a very few people, so nevermind.<P>8) I don't think we need much more in the way of indoor power. Perhaps a LITTLE more ability would be in order, since most of the large battles are fought in indoor zones, but we are and should remain an outdoor class. <P>9) I like the "Web" idea about sharing damage. Perhaps there's something there? Just another possibility to put into the grab bag for Druids.<P>That's about it for now, I'm sure I'll come up with something else to say later.

</FONT><HR>"Fera, how would changing snare to be fragile hurt mages and wizards more than druids? I'm interested to hear your reasoning."<P>Ummm, that's easy. I snare a froglok illis knight in the jail. The wizard or mage nukes him, he runs away and gathers his ten best friends and we all die while my evac spell is running, then we can shout at the wizard and mage for nuking after I snared while we get our bodies summoned =)<P>That means the wizard or mage can't nuke after I snare, so they have to get their nukes in early (and THAT's a bad idea!) and I have to start trying to snare very late (that's a bad idea too!) and nobody can use weapons or buffs that have a nuke-like effect (firey avenger, firey defender, jagged blade of war, fluxbladed axe, sword of the night, divine might, boon of the garou, etc etc). Every single one of those weapons would turn into deathtraps just like the old ebony bladed swords used to be in my old Guk days. <P>"I don't think that enhancing every class is the way to make things balanced.

</FONT><HR>Hey Fera,<BR>Thanks for your reply.  I'd like to counter your argument that making snare fragile is a bad idea.  I agree that it would make most dungeon encounters more difficult.  Ideally, you would snare a MOB just before it started running and then have the casters stop nuking.  Anyone using a weapon that procs a DD might have to switch weapons to something more benign.  That takes some dexterity, but its certainly possible, especially with the larger hot key boxes.  Switching weapons seems to be an important skill for melee focused characters.  Overall, it would make things more difficult, but not impossible.  Alternatively, the casters could time their nukes to finish the MOB off at the end of the fight very quickly so it never gets a chance to run.  I trust that a creative player base would find a way to deal with a fragile snare.  Perhaps what you are really trying to say is that a reilable snare isn't something you are willing to give up.<P>Allow me to quote from the message that started this thread:<BR>"So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a ‘balanced’ class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that’s a valid question for any class –"<P>I've seen a lot of posts on what is lacking.  Few on what is over-powered.  I'm trying to address, what I feel, is the more important question in Absor's post.  I've played every class and can think of something every class can give up.  I don't have one class I call my own.  Since this is the druid talk, let's focus on what druids need and don't need.  We can talk about the other classes when those come up.<P>I had another thought on someways that druids are overpowered.  Currently the world of Norrath is feels small to me because of the availability of teleports.  I enjoy going to permafrost and having the feeling of being a long way from home (unless I'm playing a barbarian of course).  Perhaps the druid group teleport spells could all require a component.  Something to make travel a little more difficult and give parts of Norrath a more local feeling.  Right now, if I am playing with a druid (or playing my druid) I only go to the places with the best loot or XP.  It's so easy to get there.  If Karnor's is full, gate to S. Ro and check out Guk.  Guk full?  Gate to Lavastorm and try Nagafen's Lair.  All full?  Head over to the Hole, or Great Divide, or just sell teleports all night and make a killing.  It seems to me that travel should be more difficult than that.  Perhaps a scaled component cost.  A Jasper for WC, NK, Tox and BB.  Jade for Feerott, Lava, South Ro, Steamfont.  Peridot for any expansion zone.  I would recommend that evac spells not require components.<P>Again, I'm looking for thoughts on what is overpowered on druids and how to fix them.  I play a druid too, but I'm more interested in the health of EQ as a whole, not making sure the class I play is the best.<P>Cheers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics.  We’re looking for balance, but I’m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool…  And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won’t require a team of artists and programmers to create.<P>Here’s what I’ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas.<P>Healing:<P>Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing.  Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived ‘need’ for clerics at such times.  But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role.<P>So the proposal is this:<P>Move Superior Healing to 49th level.<P>Add a new healing spell at 55th level.  My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells.<P>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level – perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…)<P>Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level.<P>More Quests:  There have been repeated requests for more mid-level quests for druids.  Though this isn’t really a class balance thing, I’ll keep it on this list.<P>Charm Animals:  For a long time I’ve liked the idea of a druid being able to charm pets without making them angry.  But this also has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it.  Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is that aggro factor.  Taking it out would require some other serious drawbacks…  But I’ve also got that on my list.  It should make for some interesting discussions.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The idea of making them act like enchanter pets would certainly help.  &gt;” How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".”&lt;  Right, something like that…   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>New Druid Rings:  I’m not likely to advocate placing new rings, those require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them.  But some of these ideas might be feasible (I’m not saying that they are good ideas, just feasible…):<P>If we assume that trees themselves can work as foci for druid travel magics:<P>Surefall Glade<BR>Warslik Woods<BR>Greater Fay OR Lesser Fay<P>Form of the mouse!  (I’m only slightly kidding, I like the idea).<P>&gt;”Simple: Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages.”&lt;<P>Actually, I’ve always wondered why this damage wasn’t always credited to the caster…  I’ll ask.<P>&gt;”Any chance of treant form?”&lt;<P>Hmmm… just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile…  Interesting.<P>Other new forms aren’t gonna fly (heh, good pun).  As I’ve said before, I’d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms.<P>As for Spirit of Wolf - part II the revenge of the doggie:  I’ll suggest it, but I don’t anticipate it happening, and I’m not one that would vote for it.<P>Soloing:  And, as a note, I’m not inclined to suggest improvements to the druids ability to solo.  Keep in mind that we are encouraging grouping…<P>New looks:  this isn’t a balance issue.  But I’ll bring it up.  I wouldn’t expect any new armor looks to come out as a result.  Those kinds of things take a lot of resources to make. <P>Class specific armor is too heavy (Vermiculated):  This is also something I can ask about.  Heavier than warrior armor?<P>Elder Spiritist Boots:  no component should be needed.<P>Faydedar:  I’m pretty sure someone is looking into this beasty and his lifestyle.  I’ll follow up on it.<P>Quad Kiting:  My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should probably be reduced.  I will probably suggest changes that have that effect.  Though the only one I’ve seen (that wouldn’t also affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to reduce the range on AoE spells…<P>NO LURES!  Not gonna happen, I tells ya.<P>No resurrections either.  I don’t see a need for it at all.<P>I admit that after about seven pages I started scanning instead of reading.  But most of what I was seeing were repeats of the same requests.  I consider that a good sign, really.  But if I missed something that you don’t see above, let me know.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   The only things that would balance druids more would be to make is to Superior Heal will not fizzle so much.  The only other thing you could do is maybe make Ro's Fiery Sundering (FR debuff) be able to be bought when you get velious but at lvl 55 instead of 39.  That would make us much more usable at high end raids. <BR>    I have had party members die because Sup heal will fizzle 3+ times (and I am max alteration for 55.)

I am not an end-game person...  i figure the road there better be as fun as being there.<P>The choice of druids weapons and armour is laughable...  you basically have leather... leather... well... leather, then the all/all armour (which is not easy to get).  The weapons are not all that to speak of either, and everything they have, they share with Clerics.<P>Can Druids have some more content, some more ~things~ in the lower level spans (1-35) that actaully give the Druid a more Druid 'feel' and not just a newbie that can cast level 29 spells...<P>Hey, class quest armour would be wonderful!  Make it green leather or chain... brown... who cares?  Weapons... well, add some quest stuff there.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>You asked for what was overpowered with druids.  Do you have any other ideas for what can be reduced in power.  I would hate to have these talks turn into character inflation where everyone just gets more powerful.<P>A word in my defense:I'm not the mad nerfer.  It seemed to me that most people were asking for enhancments.  I thought I'd try to address the other half of Absor's request.<P>The ability to powerlevel others of druids is very strong.  Perhaps changing the damage shield damage to the caster would be sufficient, however, it would be fairly easy for the druid to zone and come back when needed.  If you want to reduce druids ability to powerlevel others, perhaps the damage shield should cost less but be shorter in duration.  That would make it more difficult to simply zone and come back to recast if you make damage shield damage come from the caster.  However, casting a damage shield may cause a druid to get aggroed if damage shield damage comes from the caster.  I don't think that is what is desired.  Perhaps you can limit the amount a damage a damage shield will do per cast?  I think that won't stop normal uses but will reduce it's usefulness in powerleveling others.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Druids complaining about fizzling Superior Heal?<P>Let me tell you about fizzling...<P>I'm a Level 60 Paladin.  I got Superior Heal at level 57.  I have less mana than Druids by default (my armor is not geared towards Wisdom, as much of the Druid-specific armor is).  I have a mana-penalty on all my spells.  I have no Specialization skill at all.  I spend most of my time standing up (to fight) rather than sitting (to Med), so I am perpetually low on mana.<P>That being said, I think the fizzle rate for me on Superior Heal is just fine.  I can't even imagine how much better it is for you guys, so it's hard for me to believe you guys are complaining.<P>I guess it's an indication of how well set up your class is, because on the long list of hihg-level Paladin woes, fizzle rate doesn't even make my top 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for responding. I personally find that as a class, we are of the more "balanced" there is but I do completly agree with the following:<P><BR>&gt;Move Superior Healing to 49th level.<P>I like this proposal. But I will mention that there does seem to be some sort of artifical fizzle rate attached to this spell (for DRU/SHM at least), which could be related to why it fizzles as much now (@60) than it did back @53, for me anyway.<P><BR>&gt;Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells.<P>Totally agree. I suggested Remedy as a reasonable solution that would not infringe on Clerics, but would at least help at high levels.<P><BR>&gt;Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level – perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…)<P>I like this idea.<P><BR>&gt;Form of the mouse!

</FONT><HR>I see a lot of folks posting about druid cosmetics (how the armor looks, how'd they'd like to look like some other kind of animal than a wolf) and while that'd be nice and fun, I don't think that those issues are the ones that are really going to make an impact on the playability of druids post-50.<P>I did forget to mention one thing in my long post and that is druid armor.  I have a level 45 cleric who is rapidly replacing my druid as my main character because she is just needed a whole lot more in groups than my cute little druid is.  She has 17 pieces of armor that have various resistances built into the armor.  That includes her quest armor, things found in Velious and in Kunark.  My druid has 3 pieces.   Druid armor is just awful.  Ok, the AC is bad, it's too heavy, but even worse is it doesn't usually have any sort of magic/cold/fire/poison resistance built into it. <P>I'm not even talking about planes gear here, this is all pre-50's or early 50's gear.  There's plenty of it for clerics (which is cool, don't take it away from them!) but there's almost nothing available for druids.  My cleric has a worse time getting dressed in the morning than I do her wardrobe is so huge.<P>More druid armor please!  Lighter with more resistances.  Druid quest armor please.  <P>Many 50+ druids are getting pretty depressed that their little bundles of fun are so useless to groups (just try joining a raid guild and you'll find out) that they are retiring them.  And better armor isn't the fix either, making them more useful to groups is.  I'd happily live with my lame armor if groups thought they needed more for something other than evac.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well maybe we can agree in a point that goes through all class discussions. The problem is that people are selfish so they will always cry if other classes get enhancements instead of being happy that it makes life easier. With the few enhancements mentioned the Druid would be a powerful char, fun to play but still not overpowered. So just enhance abilities of all other classes too to make them more fun to play and all will have a better time. I hope Verant gets a feeling that most of the players are a bit sad because XP 54+ is so slow. I personally think that the XP changes and enhancing all classes a bit will help to keep the game fun. For the Uber players they should better add some more dangerous areas even harder than VP so they will have still a thrill and normal players can level their char without having no RL.<P>I personally think that clerics could use a kind of better divine light too because CH has such a long cast time. What if all 3 classes get that heal spell and clerics do heal more HPs with it and have a slightly lower cast time?<P>Also Clerics and chanters could use a non magic based high end dd or stun (kind of 800 Dam "holy fire" for clerics and 900 Dam "freeze" for enches)<P>After all: thx to listening to players  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And please take a look in that Good vs Evil Server post and make a statement what is possible from your side... thx  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure where half these jealous posts come from, but I don't see much to be jealous of when you consider this is a GROUPING game.<P>Druids don't do anything well enough to be wanted for a group. Many of us feel that they should get better healing, and that shaman should as well. <P>Shaman at least have slow to help the group and make up for alot of the damage that superior fizzle can't touch. Druid's have nothing like this. <P>I dont care if my druid can solo or not, if I wanted to solo all the time I'd be playing deathmatch's in half life. <P>Druid have a wide variety of abilities, which make them good for taking care of themselves, but leaves groups with little reason to want one.<P>I still belive that improved healing for both druid and shaman is really what is needed to not only balance those classes, but to actually balance the post 50 game in general. There are very few places that *require* a certain class in every group, but nearly EVERY place + 50 requires a cleric. <P>When looking for a healer, should a cleric be preferable BY FAR? YES! And in truth, res, the 15 % bonus, the variety of heals of differening speeds and efficiencies, ensure that will always be the case. But should entires raids come to a screeching halt because the cleric has logged out? I don't think so, and nor does anyone I speak to in game. <P>I dont care if you nerf my solo power to oblivion,  just give my class something that will give groups a compelling reason to want me. <P>Better healing is the best way to do it in my view, but there are other ways. Shaman heal basically the same as druid's but they are still wanted for slowing. Give druid a debuff that's as obviously useful to the group as slow is and we'll be set. (No I'm not asking for slow, but for something equally good). <P>I have never killed anything that wasn't evil. My character follows his role in many ways. He wants to be a priest class not a kiter dog. <P>Let us trade in lightning blast for a mega efficient celestial heal spell and noone can whine. Quad kiting would be gone, but groups would want us because we'd be able to keep them alive in a pinch when a cleric can't be there. <P><BR>Ask any guild that regularly does high level raids, they will flat out tell you druid's suck. <P>As a priest class made on the day the game was released this is more than unfair. I never signed up to be a solo-kewl-d0g i signed up to be a healer who gives up some efficiency for a bigger bag of tricks. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, to the people who are bugging Absor to discuss their class: can it. He already said he would address all of you, this is the Druid forum, so if you don't have a productive comment, go away.<P>Second of all, to the people who claim druids are balanced, go play one. From 1-50 we are overbalanced in soloing and well balanced in groups. From 50+ though, it is a joke. We don't have the healing power to even be a secondary healer (gheal is about a half bub on a warrior). Everyone now wants a Druid with sheal and so those of us who didn't get to 53 early got screwed. Spells like Legacy of Spike are the only reason we still even GET groups.<P>And finally, my thoughts on the druid class, ordered good, bad, and overpowered.<P>Good:<BR>Legacy of Spike. It's great for groups, saving us time and mana. The damage it can crank out since it hits the entire group is great. Good job on this one.<P>Ice: Thank you so much! Now we can finally do something other than heal/dot in SolB!<P>Ensnare: Best spell we ever get IMHO. Cheap, lasts long, and has excellent speed reduction.<P>Damage Roots: They work! Woot! Good job with this too!<P>Track: Great job on the update with it! I love it!<P>Bad:<BR>Group Chloro: While a great spell in theory, most Clerics I have played with are obsessed with using AE heals until the whole group is almost full, making this spell almost completely worthless in a group with a Cleric, IMHO.<P>Gheal: This spell is great when we get it...but seriously, after 20 levels could we please get something else? With the damage mobs deal out at 50+ there is no way this spell can keep even a warrior alive for too long.<P>Scale of Wolf: Glad you took out how it would fall off if you got hit, but not so great that it falls off if you get cast on. This spell stays in the back of the book for most druids I know.<P>Immolate line: Damage is good, too bad it resists 9 times out of 10. Fix it? Please?<P>Drifting Death: Good spell for the series, but still a bit underpowered. In the time it can do its damage the mob is usually dead. I understand why you wouldn't want to tweak this spell much as many druids still solo with it, but it still is an issue at 50+. It is almost pointless in a group.<P>Druid buffs: 99% of groups I'm in nowadays have a cleric. That makes our druidic ac/hp buffs worthless. Maybe you could lower the ac/hp effects of these and give a slight increase in attack speed? Heck, lower the ac/hp down even more and make it stackable with the cleric buffs, maybe?<P>Overpowered:<BR>Lightning Strike: I think that's the name of the spell...anyways its the one that does 180-odd damage to 3 targets within its radius. It's an incredibly easy way to get from 39-47 in about half a week. This could use some serious toning-down. Maybe make the casting time a bit longer and the distance a bit shorter?<P>Snare + Root stacking: Yeah I'm probably gonna get yelled at for this, but I think it is overpowered. Druid can snare then root a mob, then dot it and wait for root to break. Now instead of being in trouble when it breaks, the druid can just back up a few feet and lazily click the root button again, ad infinitum. Aah I remember the good old days when I jammed down the root button so I didn't get the brains knocked out of me =) Just a thought.<P>That's all I feel inclined to post, so in summary, we're a great class that's fairly well rounded for most of the game, but after 50...we suck, to put it bluntly. Some spells are nice, but the bad is just terrible since they are the ones mainly used in groups. I realize that changing all of these may unbalance the class more, but atleast a few of them could change things for the better for a 50+ druid.

</FONT><HR>Phread28... Dam-shields are already useless on mobs that that hit for 150+ 4 times in a row, such as those found in velious. A set amount of damage added into it would make it totlly useless. Point being 3 mobs are hitting you, you are hitting 1 but other 2 are still taking damage. <P>If you're that worried about powerleveling, just make it so higher level people can't cast on anyone that would not get exp if they were grouped with them, in other words a level 60 druid would not be able to cast on a level 39 or less. I bet you would not get many more ports that way either would you? But that's ok, cause porting people all over the world is also a form of powerleveling, so let's nerf that too. While we are at it, let's disable trades on the same lines.. only within 20 levels of other.. No more twinks too. let's make platinum nodrop too.. can't go giving money to noobs either now can we.<P>I've got an idea.. let's discuss how to balance druids for gameplay, not nerf them for having alternate aspects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
