</FONT><HR>Two Words... Magic Resistance.  <P>The absurd degree of Magic resistance on mobs in SOV (and other high-end places) combined with the giant-sized "you can't mez me" flag and the "you can't stun me either, so there" flag makes Enchanters pez dispensers at the high end.  Please re-evaluate this... or give a Super-Tashania that reduces the foe MR by a BIG chunk (like 100).<P>The illusion issue affects the "fun" of the class.  The MR problem affects balance... and MUST be fixed if you intend for enchanters to participate (other than on a 1 pez dispenser/raid basis).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please, please, please... tuning is for _gameplay_ issues. As far as 'ooh, that'd be cool', etc., this is neither the time or the place. This should be obvious by reading all the other threads. Therefore... i won't say a thing about illusions except don't waste the tuning boards time talking about them.<P>Having said that, I think it's hard being an enchanter pre-16, very hard, and i won't complain about that (it makes us have to learn to be cunning rather than use brute force, which is required to play an enchanter). In the mid-levels, a well-played enchanter is very powerful. At higher levels, we appear to lose our defining abilities in terms of so many mobs being unmezzable and unaffectable by other spells.<P>I'd therefore say that since Glamor of Kintaz and Dazzle are so limited in other ways (essentially can only keep one mob mezzed), they should be more effective on high level Velious mobs.<P>We know that most classes on high-level raids are going to be able to do nothing more than buff or support, and that tanks and clerics are what raids are all about. fine. but i want to be able to experience a decent variety of high-level encounters in dungeons post-50 without being stuck in this 'raid' mentality.<P>So my one request is to reconsider unmezzability and general Magic Resist on high-level encounters. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I'd like to see in order of importance:<P>Make the Tash- series be much more devastating to MR, this would help higher level encounters specifically in Velious and in PvP.<P>The Whirl till you Hurl line should at *least* stun similarly to a cleric spell. As it stands these spells last for a pathetic (as in hardly exhistant) duration; they are not worth the mana, taunt factor, casting time, or the spell slot in any situation. If the idea of the spin/root thing simply cannot work properly just make the spell freaking stun spells! Other nice options would be to make it a combined stun/root such that the root has a chance of holding longer then the stun or to make the "unstunnable" mobs stunnable with this line only.<P>Illusions for others would be nice as well and put the "illusionist" back into the game for us. Call them Polymorph: (Race) that we start to accumulate at 29th level, working up just as the self only ones did but starting at 29th (Human and Half-Elf). At 49th level we'd get the final additions to this line, Polymorph: Troll and Ogre. We have the power to turn people to werewolves now, why not the mundane? These would need to be group only, obviously.<P>I never use lull, because it's worthless, but probably wouldn't use it much even if it worked properly. Having it not aggro the target when it's resisted would seem to work.  The most absurd of these spells is the Necromancer version that eats bone chips as well as being no better then a standard lull; undead targets only.  That spell just makes me laugh.<P>-Todd (39th enchanter, Tallon Zek)<P>PS- Get a PvP server thread going Absor! We want GvsE!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mezzmo in the third post in this thread summed up a lot of what I see as problematic for the Enchanter.<P>I also have found the green 'yard trash' in the very front of Skyshrine being harder to stick magic based attacks to than old world Dragons, somewhat annoying.  It seems like the basic magic resistance in Velious is about twice that of Kunark or Antonica.  Was this intended?  And if so, did the person who coded these critters realize that it would leave several classes, such as Clerics and Enchanters, completely helpless against these utterly magic-resistant mobs, since ALL of their attacks are magic based?<P>Things I would like to see;<P>1) Spirit Wolf form include a minor Spirit of the Wolf component, perhaps only equal to Journeyman Boots in speed.  Since the other 'illusions' generally come with a fairly logical natural power as well (regardless of what I think of *that*), it only makes sense that this form should include a movement buff.<P>2) Insanely high mana costs on post-50 spells.  This would make sense if the spells where any sort of upgrade over previous spells in the line, but in many cases they cost three times the mana of a spell they show NO improvement over.  I am having '55th level Shaman pet' flashbacks...<P>That math thing rears it's ugly head again.<P>3) Boon of the Garou.  At the moment it has stacking and reagent issues, as well as being kinda...  odd.  When did Werewolves become Necromancers?  I have killed lots of them and never noticed this...  A massive ATK bonus I would expect, perhaps a decent Str, Dex, Sta and perhaps even Agi buff would make sense, Regeneration might also fit in with the Werewolf motif.  But Lifetap?  What were they thinking?<P>And they worked so hard pre-expansion to not cross various lines of class interdependence and uniqueness.<P>Now Enchanters can cast one illusion on others, despite the can of worms this ability suggests (why is one illusion different from others?  Can one make my Ogre into a Gnome so I can go to Ak'Anon?  And why is self-illusion Werewolf one way and Illusion: Werewolf-other completely different?), Mages can cast an Illusion on their pets, Shamen can cast an Illusion on themselves, Druids and Clerics and Wizards get pets, Cleric and Mages got DOTs, the various Melee classes got utility spells like Invisibility, Shrink and Gate: Faydark on various armor pieces, etc.  It doesn't matter if some of these things are all of dubious or no utility (like the Cleric pets), they still pretty much wreck the idea of class diversity.<P>I'll know you people have lost it completely when Necromancers learn to Teleport...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4) Enchantments.  There really needs to be more spells involving the enchantment of spells into items (and not just the 'enchantment' of gems and metals and vials of mana for tradeskill use, I am not referring to *permanent* magical items.  The game already has a bewildering overabundance of those...).<P>A standard example I have used for the last year, a Levitate variant spell for an Enchantment-based caster would require a special tailored cloak (add a Griffon Feather in with the pattern and silks) and would replace the tailored cloak with the 'Winged Cloak' which would have the always on effect of Levitation when equipped and would <BR>'lose it's enchantment' when the user had to zone or log (just like an illusion spell) and be replaced in inventory with the non-enchanted tailored cloak again.<P>Other utility spells or buffs or even attacks could be 'enchanted' into special items in this manner as well.  Just as the Magician uses a different means to cast 'Levitate' and 'Enduring Breath' (via Rings of Flight and Waterstones) so too would the Enchanter place these effects into items for a time, creating magical items of these effects instead of just casting the spell like a Wizard or Druid would.<P>One spell could have several effects as well via this means.  If an Enchanter cast 'Enchant Weapon' while holding a special rod he smithed out of 'shaped driftwood' and 'an aquagoblin gemmed eye,' it would be coded to replace that rod with a Water Crystal Staff.  Like the cloak above, that Staff would remain until the user zoned or logged, at which point it would <BR>'disenchant' back into the rod.  If the Enchanter cast the exact same Enchant Weapon spell while holding on his cursor an axe smithed from a <BR>'charred haft' and 'fire-forged granite' from Lavastorm, it would be replaced by a Polished Granite Tomohawk for the time.  If he cast this same spell with nothing on his cursor, it would fail.  If he cast it while holding a Rusty Longsword on his cursor, he would get a fail message, since the spell wouldn't be coded to respond to this 'ingredient.'<P>The downside to this sort of 'Enchantment' idea is that the Enchanter already has a plethora of spells that work just like anybody elses, so it would seem pointless at this late date to add a spell that confers (for example) a Water Breathing enchantment on a special tailored Fishscale Mask when the Enchanter can just as easily cast Enduring Breath at 12th level anyway.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I can't really complain about being an enchanter, we're fun to play.  A few things though, and sorry that I didn't have time to read through all the other responses:<P>1)Taunt factor of spells - Charm is the big offender, when charm breaks, you will get eaten.  I've had warriors 3 levels higher than me unable to taunt the mob off of me for up to 30 seconds.  The same things apply to Tashania and the mesmerize line.  Both of those spells are supposed to be used early in a fight, so we can't wait too long to cast them or we're not doing our job.  If we're the masters of mind control, you'd think we could mess with a mob without them knowing we're doing it.<P>2)Mem blur effect on Mesmerize line - As an enchanter, probably the only thing I find annoying on a raid is people breaking my mezes.  Dazzle and beyond have a pretty good chance to mem blur a target if they last the full duration, why doesn't this work if someone breaks mez early?  It would be really handy if the mem blur effect occured when mez was first cast instead of at the end.<P>3)Too many spells - This has always been an issue, not sure what there is to do about it, but the first 6 pages in my spellbook are all spells that I cast on an atleast semi-regular basis.  30 spells, 8 spell slots.  I guess I'd really like to see some more 'right-clickable' items from the Thurgadin quests etc... like the melee people get from Kunark.  Anything to free up some spell slots.<P>As for illusions etc... I would like to see more, but they are a lower priority than some combat enhancements.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have never really agreed with any of the reasons as to why enchanters are not a pet class... to say you are not a pet class is not a reason... it is a blanket statement that does not address the question.  <P>I will not argue that further because it is not productive.  I would like to argue that the pet we get is a defensive pet.  As such I see absolutely no reason why we cant treat it like a defensive pet. I think there should be two comands.  pet health and pet guard... since the enchanter pet is defensive (ie it only attacks when the caster is attacked) having a pet guard command makes sense and is consistant with thier nature.<P>Please consider this option.  I have thought about balance issues and frankly the only issues I can come up with is that they will make it slightly more desirable to have a pet if you can park it.  Does that make it more powerful?  Yes.  However it does make it so unbalanced unless you want to see us die when we go peek around a corner for our group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>AC.  Enchanter's defense caps at 160.  Druid/Shaman/Cleric defense caps at 200.  One cleric I know, who is self buffed has over 1k AC.  Myself, with full PoH Insidious, and some AC rings, +10 ac belt, I have 605 AC when I buff myself with Augment (AGI).  The extremely low 160 defense causes me to get hit for MAX dmg almost every time when Mez is resisted.  Please up our defense cap.  Druids/Shaman tank way less then Enchanters do yet their AC is so much higher.  Enchanters probably tank more then Clerics also, sometimes.  Up our defense to 200ish.  If not, 180 at LEAST.  This is extrmeley low when you goto old seb and stuff hits upwards of 170 dmg.<P>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, TONS of messages about illusions. Here's my 2cp.<P>"Illusion: Gender Switch", won't stack with obvious gender-neutral illusions: skeleton, spirit wolf, werewolf, or elementals<P>I don't see a lot of point of making "Illusion: Male" or "Illusion: Female" as separate spells unless it alters our face...<P>Personally, I'd love to see a series of Illusion spells that alter our religious beliefs for a temporary benefit of talking to some NPC's:<P>"Illusion: Unbeliever" - switches to agnostic for those of us that didn't know any better when we started (I was 16 and had 100+ jewelcrafting skill before I found out not being agnostic was going to hamper my playability).<BR>"Illusion: Tree Hugger" - Tunare<BR>"Illusion: Death Warmed Over" - Cazic Thule<BR>etc<BR>Maybe make it wear off in 5 minutes, and stackable with all other illusions<P>"Illusion: Minor Animal" - pick a random animal from the zone, perhaps the lowest level mob,  and "Poof, you're a pixie trickster". Zone specific, which shouldn't be too difficult - just pick an animal at random from the current zone's character mapping.<P>I'd like to see "Illusion: Skeleton" switched to "Illusion: Undead" - you are randomly switched to a zombie, skeleton or ghoul. Leave the liche and spectres to the necros, I could care less. But only being a skeleton is kinda pointless. Mind you, the giggle is much better.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I love the "Major Illusion" idea above... being more (more, as in bigger) than a lamp post or chair would be kind of nice.<P>"Illusion: Minor Copycat", where you copy your target would be nice. At lower levels just copy their base character (Barbarian, Aviak, etc)<BR>"Illusion: Major Copycat", level 50+ perhaps, include gender, armor, and religious followings all in one shot.<P>"Illusion: NPC Merchant/Guard"<BR>Turns us into whatever the closest guard or merchant looks like. But we're unable to move. This would be great for sneaking around cities where we want the risk of being seen (no invis) as part of our role playing.<P>I also like the idea of armor illusions. Sure, maybe we want to load up on illusions to get into neriak: "Illusion: Dark Elf", "Illusion: Gender Switch", "Illusion: Death Warmed Over" - but who would want to attempt to convince someone they're a female dark elf at level 30 that's scantily dressed like a nekkid dark elf female? Even "Illusion: Robe" or "Illusion: Leather" would be enough to make us look like we're wearing SOMETHING.<P>I'm indifferent on whether illusions should stay during zoning. Sure, it'd be nice, but I agree with one poster who mentioned abuot gating back to be suddenly KOS because you're an Iksar in the Kelethin bank or something... Of course, if you bind out of populated areas, it'd be easy enough to drop the illusion once you gated.<P>I'm only level 31 with my enchanter, so I can't speak on SoV, but I was told rather rudely at level 30 to give up on my Enchanter and play a different class because I'd be totally useless in Velious. Things that make you go "Hmmm..."<P>I digress...<P>Some illusions grant us special powers. As a dark elf, I have ultravision. As an air elemental, I have levitate. From what I hear, "Illusion: Spirit Wolf" just makes us howl... even a lvl 9 SoW would be nice. C'mon, please? (secretly casts Benevolence) Pretty please?<P>Thanks,<BR>Yeamar of E'ci<BR>High Elf (or IS he?) Enchanter<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't really have much to add which hasn't already been said, but I'll try anyway.<P>Gift of Magic is largely pointless.  I use it, but on a 36th level druid with 151 WIS at full mana, upon casting this spell, the druid is down a mere two pixels of mana.  What is more disappointing, however, is the message, "Your thoughts begin to flow and race faster."  This suggests to me that my mana regen is improved, and yet, as far as we can tell, this is not the case.  Each of the spells in the Gift line should increase mana regen.  GoM should be +1; the others should be increased by 1.  Then Gift of Magic would be compelling to cast.<P>Alternately, the suggestion that Gift of Magic acts as a mana transfer is good.  If we can't do anything but buff in Velious, we might as well be able to give our excess mana to the wizards.<P>Being limited to magic as our only spell line (ignoring Tashan's "poison-based" nature), Enchanters should be the masters of magic and mana.  The only thing enchanters lack, mana-wise is a way to give mana, directly, to another.  Clarity is like a mana "DoT"; we could use a mana "DD".  But it's not all that vital.<P>There are already dozens of comments on the uselessness of various lines of spells, so I won't rehash them.  I got over it by simply pretending that the spells never existed.<P>Because of the level-based limits on the mez line of spells, high-level enchanters facing mobs which can span both sides of the dividing line but who cannot detect the level of the mob (i.e. because the mobs are all blue /cons) are at a severe disadvantage versus lower-level enchanters who themselves sit on the dividing line, level-wise -- once the spell hits the mob, the mob completely resists the spell, but, instead of ignoring the enchanter, the mob aggroes as if the spell were resisted normally.  (As an aside, does it really make sense for a creature to be concerned about something to which it is completely immune?)<P>Someone suggested that having notifications about whether or not a spell would be effective would be good (a la Theft of Thought).  This would be nice (quick and easy, actually), but there might be another way to address the issue which gives enchanters more to do (which may be good or bad, depending on the enchanter...).  Provide a spell, Evaluate, which characterizes the various resistances that a mob has.  When cast on a mob, the spell reports which kinds of things a mob is immune or highly resistant to.  In this way, an enchanter can know beforehand, when facing a mob which is questionable in his susceptibility to things, whether or not he can mez or charm the mob, or if the mob is highly resistant to magic.  Because Wizards are supposed to be the masters of knowledge, I would advise giving them a similar spell, but make it more general, across all the different resistance types (but it wouldn't report things that only an enchanter would be interested in, such as immunity to mez or charm).  Shamans might be another candidate for this type of spell.<P>Beyond this, the only thing which is of any real concern is the Velious anti-enchanter measures.  Either give us a way to make Clarity II and Haste potions in concert with Shamans, so that no one even bothers inviting us, since that's really the only thing we're needed for, anyway, or find some other way to make the area challenging that actually allows us to do something in a more proactive role.<P>Making the game harder is fine.  Changing us from being one of the most active classes to being one of the most inactive is disappointing.  Unfortunately, I don't have any good, easy suggestions on exactly how to do this.  The only ways I can imagine at this point would wind up completely altering Velious, and I know that won't happen.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep this simple:<P>-Lull resists are way too high to be remotely viable. This spell has the potential to be quite useful provided the resists are reasonably low.<P>-Please make group clarity overwrite normal clarity.<P>-Please scale up the duration, recast time, and mana cost of boon of the garou by a factor of 2. Also please make it so that being a werewolf doesn't effect the target's ability to slam (it currently still allows slamming, but the duration of the slam is virtually nil). It's just annoying to cast this spell so frequently and 55+ mobs need to be slammed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-It would be nice if bezerker spells didn't overwrite normal strength buffs, but stacked.<P>-It would be sweet to see if charmed mobs would have their name in yellow, and mezzed mobs would have their name in orange (or other colors).<P>-It would be nice to see some new illusions after level 44...<P>-PLEASE add messages if a mob is immune to mez or charm. We currently only have too high level to x messages. It's frustrating to cast the spell only to get the resist message and not knowing it's immune.<P>-When multigroup buffing, someone asks for a buff and you either have to click on them or type /tar(get) name then cast buff. I always thought it would be a huge time saver if there could be a new command such as "/replytarget" so when someone sends you a tell, you can hotkey this command and automatically select the last person that sent you a tell provided they are close to you such as target. Of course, this would be a global thing, not enchanter only  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-More of a wishlist, but it would be nice if higher mezzes would overwrite lesser mezzes.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for opening up these posts. I can think of a few things that are needed.<P>1) Currently our last illusions are at level 44, this makes no sense because of the title Illusionist we get post 50. I would love to see a few illusions added. Some of the ones that I can think of immediately that would not affect balance but might be fun are: Illusion Gender (reverses the gender of the Enchanter), Illusion Leather Armor (gives the appearance of the Enchanter wearing leather armor), Illusion Chain Armor (gives the appearance of the Enchanter wearing chain type armor), Illusion Plate Armor (gives the appearance of the Enchanter wearing plate type armor). (These should not be that difficult because each race that can be an enchanter can also be a paladin/shadow knight/warrior. I would love to see them give a slight AC increase per level but it is not necessary.)<P>2) Currently there are several things in Velious that are resistant to mezzes, which negates one of our primary abilities. Maybe you should have different flags like giant/dragon/deity (uber). Then have a higher level mez that will work on those that have the giant flag, another higher level mez that will work on those that have the dragon flag but not have a mez for the deity (uber) level.<P>3) Debuff line of spells. Currently the only debuffs we have that work in a non-PvP, no-duel situation are the Tashan line and the speed debuffs. That leaves our strength debuffs and melee debuffs that are worthless. Please have these spells actually do something other than taking a spot on the merchant and in our books.<P>4) Please increase the duration and/or decrease the refresh time on Boon of the Garou, even to the point where 2 people can have it at once instead of just one.<P>These are the immediate problems I can think of as of level 45 that I believe should be addressed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I went through and read all the posts like you asked and here is what I have to add:<P>- Whirl til you hurl is a useful spell, but wearing off when a target gets bashed is stupid.  Sure, you can tell a PC to stop bashing, but there is no way to make a pet stop bashing.  If you are grouped with a pet class, there is no point in using this spell.<P>- Collaboration doesn't seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal.  I'm assuming this is a bug.<P>- Change the look of the Ishva robe.  I am so tired of level 1 twinks wearing looking like they have one of the best enchanter robes in the game.<P>- Make tiny daggers more accessable on Velious.  They aren't sold in Thurgadin.  Qeynos also needs to be revamped.       Currently, there is no real enchanter guild.  Several spells are missing and there are no tiny daggers sold there.  It seems there was some coding problems there.  The building next to the Mage/Wiz guild seems to be a mix of a potion shop, general spells, and enchanter spells.<P>- Gift of Brilliance/Insight should have their names changed.  I am tired of having people tell me they don't need a wisdom buff.<P>- Illusion: Wolf needs to be brought back inside for enchanters (and not druids).  It was taken out b/c it placed us on a neutral faction and was making it easy to drag corpses from Vox.  This has been remedied by making the illusion KoS to everyone.  Wolf adds a cold resist buff which is very useful in Velious dungeons.<P>- Illusion: Target - Is it possible to add this?  If you cast the illusion on yourself you become KoS to everything.  (For example, if you turn into a suit of sentient armor in Wakening Lands, everything turns KoS to you - the price you pay).  I'm not really sure what the coding would entail though and if this is even possible.<P>- New illusions - Ok, I agree enchanters need a few more unique forms (STOP giving our illusions to bards!!!), but what about recycling the ones that are already in the game?  For example:  Illusion: Lava Elemental - uses the same form as fire elemental (but larger) but adds 20 to cold resist and a 20pt damage shield.  Illusion: Greater Werewolf - adds 50 to disease resist, 10ac, etc.  Also, does making an illusion transparent looking make you have to add a new global form?  How about Illusion: Spirit X<P>- Boon of the Garou - I'm assuming this spell was meant to only be cast on one person at a time since you can't have it on 2 people constantly.  Is there a way of making the spell last 30 minutes but making it so you can only have it on one target?  Also, Dex cannot currently go above 255.<P>- Religion:  Currently, religion seems to only affect enchanters.  I was unfortunate enough to decide to worship Karana.  To my knowledge, there are no religious items that enchanters can wear (no tailoring items nor smithing).  Would it be possible to give religion a BENEFIT?  (No, faction plusses is not a benefit, we have spells to do that!)<P>Thank you for your time,<BR>Sutatnac</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the pet command ideas, it would make them much more usable if they could be commanded to "guard me" and/or "back off".  "Report health" should work also, all that command does is save you from having to click all around everything to check you pet (targetting is a big pet peeve of mine, when mobs are all trained together it's a big pain to get control going without using Mesmerization, which isn't always memmed).<P>At least make enchanter pets default to "guard me" rather the "follow me", I think that would stop their annoying (and sometimes deadly) pacing.<P>-Todd (Tallon Zek)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would first like to help Absor understand the daily life and needs of Enchanters.<P>We die more than any other character<BR>(except for monks on planes raids)<P>Why because we are expected to cast upon unengaged mobs and get them under control. Other casters dont engage until after the tanks have built them selves solidly on the hate list.<P>My first few sugestions revolve around balancing this aspect.<P>The above suggestion of not letting us mez or charm something that is unmezzable or uncharmable by giving us a message before the casting happens is a great idea. Similar to trying to drain mana from a melee mob we get a message that says "Your target has no mana to effect" A message for uncharmable or un mezzable mobs would help alot in stoping enchanters from dying needlessly.<P>The hole is the biggest problem for enchanters in this area. Some golems can be mezzed and others cant yet they look exactly the same.(due to a coding bug of 53 plus mobs in the old world cant be mezzed)<P>Tank pulls three golems. Enc trys to mez one gets a this creature cannot be mezzed message and gets beaten down cuz it is treated as a resist.<P>A fast casting Memory blur that really works would be useful or if a ae memeblur could be tied to our  higher level pb ae stuns instead of mana drain(read useless)(our higher level memeblurs just waste mana like the other posts have mentioned)<P>Enchanter equipent similiar to flayed skin would be awesome. Currently I wear little enchanter only gear because the ac is too low. I mostly wear all /all eqipment like azure sleeves for the ac. We get cha and int buffs we dont need anymore int or cha equipment. We need ac and hp to avoid getting beaten down or to get that mez off while being swung at.<P>Make our ac buff stack with cleric ac buffs. We never cast it currently without soloing because you dont go anywhere without a cleric.(read we die too much above)(ac is same for 58 and 49 spell)<P>Whirl till you hurl line is useless give us a targeted stun like clerics that isnt broken by other stuns. If we do actually spin the mob then make it effective on non stunnable giant class mobs)(we are useless in Kael because we cant mezz them and root is ineffective)(and kael is where our class specific quest armour drops..oh joy)<P>Lull line is useless and always involves the enchanter dying horribly. Decrease the resist rate or remove it.<P>Make cha really make a difference. If we want to be effective at charming make having 200 cha mean something. Right now we can have  5 sec charms regardless. Tests have proven that 70 points of cha mean less than a 5% difference in actual resists in charm and mezz. <P>Mages now have all the fun of having a moster pet with none of the drawbacks.(there pet waking up and trying to kill them) Please reduce post charm aggro to balance this.<P>We cant effect mr mobs at all directly. Could gravity flux be the answer?(we never use it anyway) We dont effect the mob directly we effect gravity. Could it be given a lifetap style save?(if so give us its upgrade invert gravity as well)<P>Tashania is a necesary spell and one of the highest aggros in the game. Either reduce the aggro or increase the mr reduction so it is in line with the aggro.<P>We only use the berserker str line as a free damage absorber. we dont care about the str buff or agi debuff. Either make it stack with other str buffs(its useless if you have a shaman in the group) or remove the str buff part. The recast time is too long on it as well.<P>Boon of the clear mind(group clarity) is only usable for two levels.No one wants clarity when you can cast clarity 2. Please change it to 44th or so.<P>Make the mana cost of high end mezzes worth it.<BR>Glamour of Kinatz, Fascination and Rapture see little use because of the high mana cost. Either reduce the mana cost or give them lure style resists.<P>Dictate for 48 sec is crazy when regualar charms can last 5 min. Please increase the duration.<P>Try to make str debuffs have a noticable effect on monster damage output.<P>Illusions are nice, but we really need them for the ability to scout in enemy territory. We cant because they see through our religion. Why have the ability  to disguise ourselves at all?<BR>Illusion random monster would be great and wouldnt affect the global memory. We could recast till we get the faction we need to scout out an area. We are not effective at killing directly anyway so I dont think we would be overpowered with the ability to just look around.<P>Illusion corpse would make us die less..(read feign death)<P>Pretending your dead is more in line with our abilities then a necros its a mind trick<P><BR>Make our longer mezzes overwrite our shorter ones<BR>(this was called a bug from gz a year ago)<P>Give us some new trade skill items with the mana vial line of spells(relatively useless at this pint)(the promised ability to enchant weapons and items promised in the original game manual)<P>all I can think of for now....<P>Magiuos 55 enchanter Sol Ro<P>PS the ability to link groups to share xp would be very useful to enchanters. In multi group raids we dont get any xp becuase everyother group is doing damage with 6 people and we are doing crowd control and buffing.Our group never gets xp if we are doing our job.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why do I want to drain the mana from the target unless I can benefit from using it with ToT?

</FONT><HR>I have been an enchanter on both the blue and red servers (PvE and PvP).  Though most of my experience is on TZ.  The one thing I can tell you is that the experience is very different as an enchanter. Having said that I will wait for Alan's promised PvP thread to go into the "issues" I have with the PvP Enchanter.<P>Suggestions for balance:<P>- I agree that we need some sort of short-term stun.  Perhaps even a Colorflux at range type spell.  Enchanters the masters of crowd control don't have access to the Stun line of the clerics.  That has always boggled me.  It would seem far more logical to give us that line than Invis to Undead.<P>- More Illusions AS BUFFS.  Unlike most I LOVE BoG while I would like to see a longer lasting more expensive version it has given me something to do in a fight in Velious.<P>- Add a one shot pet that acts like the cleric hammer (with stats like our normal pet) that comes out with two swords attacking the target of the spell.  Alan's dancing blades or the like.  This would give us some contribution to the battles at high level since our magic based attacks are for the most part not effective (not that they should be anywhere close to a DD dealing class) and help with the "Paper Tank" syndrome.<P>- Please give us a tash with a chance of a memory wipe.  That would be a much better tool than the Winds of Tashinia (AE Tash) for us.  Malosi does not make monsters angry and debuffs twice what Tash does.  I understand that unresistable = lower  debuff which is fine but that should be the cost not Tash = Summoned = Dead.  Clerics shouldn't need to have a heal hot key for the enchanter in the group.<P>- In the days before Kunark and Velious we understood that there were certain monsters that we would not be able to crowd control.  Now it seems that the ratio is about 50% of the monsters in the post 50 game can be mezzed.  It would be much better to give those monsters a better chance of BREAKING mez than no chance of being put under to start.  It would allow us to still do crowd control but have to be on top of our game.  Enchanters are the reason (for the most part) that the game is not all charge blindly in do damage to what you can wait for a rez and repeat.  With an enchanter you can use strategy and accomplish things that you would in other circumstances be unable to do.  In the post 50 game that is becoming less and less the case.  While I understand that our effectiveness at crowd control might be reduced it should not (and in many cases is) be eliminated.  I have recently had runs where I didn't even have a mez spell in a slot (that would be like a wizard having no DD spells memed) because nothing in the zone can be put under.<P>- Cost of Rune IV is too high.  Rune V has same component.<P>- Please look at the lull line of spells.  All I know is that I don't know a single enchanter or cleric that uses them.   I have played EQ long enough to remember when druids thought that Harmony didn't do anything  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but this is different.  This spell is resisted by 4th level kobolds when cast by a 50+ level enchanter.  That is just wrong.  Fixed this spell could be an excellent tool to use as it stands it doesn't do anything useful.<P>- Enchantable items: 'Nuff said.<P><BR>I have enjoyed playing my enchanters, but I am not fighting with the disappointment of not being able to be anything more than a "speed and crack" dealer.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alot of good posts so far, so I'll just add a couple:<P>1.  Illusion: I could really careless that I don't get any post 50 illusions.  The only one that I'd like to see added is Illusion: Gender that stacks with our other racial illusions.  Lvl 52 seems appropriate for it (Same time as Mage's get the fun party spell Bristlebain's Bundle)<P>2.  Dodge:  There is no other non-melee caster type that gets hit and beat on nearly as much as the Enchanter does.  How about removing the low dodge cap of 75 and allowing it to keep going up?  Not as high as a melee's, but a higher dodge skill would be great, especially with are low HP's.<P>3.  Whirl/Dyn's Spells:  Next to useless<P>4.  Berserk/Rampage Line:  The Str bonus and damage absorbtion they give just isn't worth casting by the time we get them, especially if there is a Druid, Shaman, or Ranger around to give a long lasting Str buff.  Example - Bedlam (Lvl 58) gives +50 Str,  -25 Agi, and a 300 dmg absorbtion.  Any mob that is 45+ will drop this spell in 3 hits.  What's the point?  We don't have space for this in our line up since it's usefulness is next to nothing.<P>5.  Boon of Tranquility:  God I love this spell, makes life so much easier, but is it really necessary to make us wait till 52 to get it when we get C2 at 54?  This should be a 49th or 50th Lvl spell since all it does is save us time and a touch of mana.  Allowing it to overwrite normal Clarity would be nice too since I have to recast this on my group until all the single Clarity's are gone (gets annoying fast)<P>6.  Lull series:  High resist rates make this spell rarely used...and the AE version is commonly thought of as a "suicide" spell.<P>7.  DoT's line after Choke:  The amount of time these take to run their course makes limits their usefulness to using only on mobs where battles take more then 1.5 min...which isn't very often in a group.  Maybe allow the full damage to be dealt 30 seconds faster?  This shouldn't infringe on the other classes that use alot of DoT's (ie. Necro, Druid, Shaman) since we have just a single line and it doesn't stack with the Necro Splurt line.<P>8.  Reoccuring Amnesia:  Just doesn't seem to work right.  As well, other Mem Blur spells seem flakey...maybe if we saw a resist message for them?<P>9.  Pets:  I think our pets are decent despite having zero control over them.  (God knows how many times I've wished for just a /pet attack and /pet back off command)  But the damage they can deal makes up for even their low HP's.  If you can keep the mobs taunted off our pets, they help immensely, and since we are not a "pet class", I don't have any beefs with them.  Love'em or hate'em (personally, I change my thoughts of them every day..hehe)<P>10.  "Mana" series:  More uses would be great<P>11.  AC series:  The amount of AC they give doesn't seem scaled to our levels like Cleric and Shaman lines.  I definetly don't think they should be nearly as good, but the high levels one (Shadow and up) should be scaled a little better.  Maybe 5-10 less then an equivilant Shammy buff.<P>12.  Rune IV:  Component price seems out of place.  Not a very good upgrade with the 10pp increase in components.  Rune V costing a Peridot seems right. but maybe a Jade, Pearl, or Topaz instead?<P>Julrindara<BR>53rd Enchanter<BR>Dwarec Mercs<BR>Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not gunna waste any time here talking about any additions to the class. But I will go into detail what needs to be tweaked with the class.<P>From levels 1-50 there are no problems. Low levels were very hard for me, but that was before the invent of breeze etc. I have been playing an enchanter since the beginning as it was my first and is my main character. Since I was a lowbie there have already been numerous changes to improve low level life, and although I missed them, they were appreciated.<P>When Kunark came out I started having a lot of fun, and got level 53 before I knew it..things were all fine until I started to realize the new fate of the enchanter class.<P>When it became time to take on high level dungeons or Raids, my usefullness in a group got crushed. When the "defining ability" to me was crowd control, it was a sad day when it became impossible to do.<P>Looking at the new lines of spells we got, there was only a select 2 or 3 that impressed me. Clarity 2, Aanys Quick/Aug 2, and Theft of Thought were nice.<P>The rest of the new spells were pretty much useless as even with them, there is no way to mes a lot of mobs.<P>On the MOB's that you CAN mes with the new Kunark spells, I waste an entire bar of mana messing ONE mob during a couple minute fight...<P>When Velious came out, things got worse. More zones added with mobs containing the "Giant Flag" and less and less opportunity to mes. More mobs came out with ridiculously high Magic Resist, and since 95% of our spells our magic based, there is simply no way to touch a mob. No debuffing (which stats reduction is useless anyhow), no Slowing (big hit here), no DD (Can't even do damage), and no Messing...<P>I got very depressed at this, and my play time has cut more than one half, as there is little fun left if all I am there for is Clarity 2/Haste. All my friends have since passed me, and Warriors in particular are having a ball as melee is superior against these new mobs.<P>Against any Boss mob, or the new anti-enchanter mobs, all we do is C2/Haste. It's something I could log on and off to do every half hour, and not take the huge risk I have of dying when trying to get one of my spells to stick (which never happens because of impossibility on some mobs).<P>And the velious spells come out, dissapointment once again. Not only are they very costly and inefficient for their level, but they are all in the same spell line. When I hit level 60, I will really have only gained one of the "Gift" series, then improved invis, and the new Theft of Thought like spell which is useless at my level.<P>My suggestions are:<P>-Remove some of the Giant Flags on MoBs (which I doubt will happen)<P>-Make the new mes spells less resisted on the select few mobs that you spared the giant flag.<P>-Make the new mes spells more efficient (last longer/lower mana costs)<P>-Perhaps make some of our debuffs usefull (but if they were usefull against mobs, then they are killer in PvP, so maybe make non-PvP only?)<P>Thats really it, I just want to be able to do my job again. As of now my role in high level places is to cast C2/Haste. I cant do damage, I cant mes, I cant slow the mob, I cant debuff the mob. The one thing I AM good at, is dying.<P>Thanks,<P>-Twinzipose</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Color Slant - The spell does the same thing as Color Skew but also drains mana from the target. The spell costs more than twice what Color Skew does. I could see this spell being a LOT more useful if it caused memory blur to all the targets instead of mana drain. Why do I want to drain the mana from the target unless I can benefit from using it with ToT? Several times after using Color Slant I cannot drain the full 400 mana from a target.<P>Thanks for reminding me... it's not slant that does it, it's Theft of Thought combined with the mobs level.<P>Theft of Thought...<BR>This is a 51 level enchanter spell that drains mana from the target to the enchanter.<P>This spell currently drains less mana on mobs 51+.  Why?  It's against high level mobs that we need mana the most.  What's the point of giving us a spell at 51 when it's best used against sub-50 critters?  It should drain an equal amount regardless of level.<P>I drain a sub 50 mob, I get 3/4ths of a bub.  I drain a 51+ and I get 1/4th.  This is wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's somewhat of a tradition for I and my guild's senior shaman to argue about my usage of Recant Magic.  Lag, preoccupation with other mobs, and many other factors cause me to dispell late and subsequently dispell the slow he just put on the mob.

</FONT><HR>First of all, to clear this up<BR>someone said:<BR>WANDERING MIND Spell:<BR>What a stupid spell. This spell is similar to Theft of Thought but is much, much less useful. It takes 5 mana to cast and taps 120 mana over a period of 2 minutes. 2 Minutes? Most MoBs are dead by the end of 2 minutes. Heck, most are dead after 30 seconds.<P>This spell acts like the necro's Leach spell.  As in saying, if you can get the icon on yourself, it will keep draining mana even though the mob is dead.

</FONT><HR>Crowd Control in Velious.<P>That's my issue. We're enchanters. Crowd control is what we ARE. Not buff dispensers. Certainly not illusionists. I don't want illusions. I want to do my job.<P>The liberal use of giant flags and high resist/immune npcs absolutely trivializes us. If you can't change the problem npcs (say, just about every mob in Siren's Grotto) then consider giving us irresistable mez spells, entirely eliminate the recast time on dictate (balanced by its extreme mana cost already), mez spells that work on giant-flagged critters, stuns that work on giant-flagged critters, a charm with a higher level cap other than the absurd dictate, give rapture a similar check in resists to lure, or the like.<P>Notice I didn't mention buffs or illusions anywhere in there. It's because I really, truly, honestly could not care less about those.

</FONT><HR>Again, Enchanters (and any other class that uses AE spells) are crippled on Zeks.  Especially Color series, this is one of our best traits and yet it cant not be used at all on PvP.  If you are soloing it aggros your pet, and if you are grouped, all your tanks get stunned as well.<P>AE mez is the same thing.  I try to stop the big group we just pulled, the players get mezed and the mobs resist.  Guess who is going to get HIS butt chewed out?<P>Illusions are great fun, but I like them better for their allowing me to infiltrate other cities.  As a Dark Elf this is much more fun than turning into a mage pet or a wolf.  However, as a follower of Innoruuk for roleplaying reasons I find it extremely hard as the population of the city seem to be able to literally tell what religion I follow through walls.  As a non-programer I don't know how hard it would be to do any of these, but one or the other would be appreciated, especially for those of us who aren't agnositc (all 2 of you guys out there =D)<P>1. Make it so mobs cant tell Religion and base your faction on race UNLESS you are wearing an item that requires you to be of a certain religion<P>2. Start a Religion illusion series at around 29-34.  Make these spells no-drop and only available in the city where the god's main temple is located.  (Hall of Truth, Necro guild in Neriak, etc)  Make them stack with your racial illusion and make it seem that you follow the god of the illusion to npcs.<P>3. Make it so the general populance cannot tell what religion you are from 100 feet.  Maybe people of another religion (Paladins, Necros, Clerics NPCs in guildhalls) can tell, not Joe Blow merchant.<P>4. Simply remove the ability for their religion to be detected for Enchanters.<P>This would allow more illusions without taking valuble space up in the Global file, and would stop the very unrealistic practice of woodelves not selling to me in woodelf form because of my "beliefs".<P>Everything else has been covered wonderfully above so I wont say anything more.

"oh that guy in purple can make my job 600hp's harder, and that's fine, but that fruity guy in the robes? oh hell no, he's gotta go!"<P>disconcerting scenario #2: in the plane of growth. i've been toying around with where my aggro barriers are, how long i have to wait before casting a tash, how long after THAT before i can lay on some dd, and so on. we get into an area of gaters, and they are calling for stun. well marvel of all marvels, an amazing amount of mobs in pog are susceptible to magic, but i don't want the uber aggro of casting dementia when all i wanted to do was stun, so i load chaotic feedback. for 48 dmg per, i got equivalent aggro as if i was nuking the jesus out this mob. i doubled up 48dd as soon as it became available to cast and nearly died for it. is that intended? call it a bug question, but when aggro is a major beef amongst us, it bears looking at.<P>another point in this thread i'm all about. we have the capability to generate inordinate amounts of aggro in a relatively short time, and only a marginal ability to do anything about it. as we increase in levels, our ability to participate in crowd control dwindles and we become raw buffers, as the number of unmezzable mobs increases. is that how it's intended?<P>"here's your clar, here's your speed, i'll be over here cybering if you need a dispell or anything, good luck guys."

</FONT><HR>The above posts are excellent, but are mostly about fixing/balancing things within the class, without much talk of how the class is balanced in the game...<P>It seems to me that balancing the enchanter class has a lot to do with the power of the traditional "ideal" fighting group - enchanter, cleric, tanks. People perceive the enchanter and cleric classes as overpowered because everyone wants their group to include them. Few people realize that clerics and enchanters are heavily dependant on good groups, and tend to die a lot in bad groups or when soloing. The price we pay for being wanted in groups is being extremely vulnerable without them. How many level 50+ enchanters want to risk losing weeks of play time to go solo? How many want to risk death by playing in a less than optimal group? If you make us less wanted make sure you leave us something we can do... Velious is a good example of how *not* to do this; the insane MR of MoBs means enchanters can't do much of anything there, with or without a group.<P>You can reduce the dependence on clerics by making the enchanters more robust (more AC items, less aggro on Tash, debuffs, resists..). Groups would probably be happier with having a shaman or druid for healing if the enchanter wasn't so fragile. If you want to reduce reliance on enchanters, make places where people can get good experience without them -- make more spots people can camp that provide a steady stream of single or double MoBs(no tediously long spawn times, no train danger), make haste potions that stack with haste items, and make clarity potions like SoW potions. Let's face it, most players enjoy danger and excitement once in a while, but want to be safe and successful most of the time. <P>My 2cp worth<P>Tintari<BR>33rd level enchantress<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great posts that cover almost everything I've had problems with.<P>I have a few other lingering concerns that I wanted to bring up in no particular order.<P>Enchanter DDs:  To start out with, they are hugely mana inefficient, have a big cast time and a bigger recast time.  Then, they have a double resist thanks to the little 0 sec stun that was tacked on.  Then, they go against MR, which is what the majority of creatures have in spades.  To top it all off, it also have a taunt so bad that I can pull a mob out of two groups that have been beating on it for minutes with just a single nuke.  I don't mind most of it, but the mega-taunt is really not necessary when you look at everything else which makes the nukes less than perfect.  Any changes that helped with the SoV problem would also help with the boss mob problems mentioned in other posts.<P>Enchanter DoTs: I can only assume that the minimal amount of damage over a huge amount of time was because of the debuffing effects.  As has been shown, these debuffing effects do absolutely nothing to monsters.  Please re-evaluate these if its not possible to make non-slowing debuffs useful.<P>Religions: Enchanters are the only class heavily penalized for choosing a religion.  Since people realized this, most don't choose religion, but those of us who were trying to roleplay when EQ first came out still suffer from this problem.  There is NO benefit to religions for enchanters.  None.  Make illusions ignore religion and we're all good again.<P>Tash line: In general, the tash line of spells is pretty good.  But, they have to be since all of our spells resist against magic and if you don't lead with a tash, you aren't going to be sticking many spells.  That being said, tash fails in comparision to the malosi line of spells post 50.  The malosi line of spells lowers several resists by considerably more than tash lowers just magic resistance and the malosi line of spells doesn't have the trademarked uber-taunt of the tash line.  Tash has one thing going for it...its nearly unresistable.  Post 50, though, the MR of monsters is so high that dropping it by 33 does next to nothing.  I'd like to see tash's effectiveness upped and have the mega taunt reduced to the level of malosi.  Another note, we get tashani at 20.  The next upgrade is tashania at 49.  Since its so key to our success, an interim spell is definitely warranted.<P>Gear: This is a big one.  Since GZ left, its been readily apparent that whoever is designing gear has very little idea of what an enchanter really needs.  He's the tip...an enchanter is the only caster class that has to tank almost as much as a warrior AND has to have 2 stats above 200 for maximum effectiveness.  This means that enchanters need HP and AC just as much as we need Int and Charisma.  The game world is becoming littered with items that would have been good, but have massive negative charisma on them.  It's like we're being taunted.  Specific examples of equipment issues have already been stated, so I'll leave them alone.  I just ask that who ever is making caster and enchanter items be given a briefing by someone who has played an enchanter for the last two years.  We're significantly different from every other class out there including int casters.  We have our own needs and they are not being met by a longshot.<P>The post 50 mana nerf: I understand the reasoning behind negating mez post 55 and introducing a highly mana inefficient spell in its place.  What I don't understand is also hitting us from the other side as well.  Theft of Thought loses its effectiveness when used against mobs 55+.  At level 54, ToT would give you a full bubble of mana when used on any mob 54th level or less.  A 55 mob would give a quarter bubble...above that the increase isn't even noticeable.  You already crippled the effectiveness of mez with the original mana hit, please don't compound it.  We need all the mana we can get to function in your post 50 environment as it is.<P>SoV: It's been gone over but is a very, very, very large problem.  Since reducing the MR of all the mobs in SoV isn't feasible, I recommend either shifting GoK to a lure style resist or add in a few spells that don't save vs magic.  Enchanters do not have a single spell that works on any resist but magic.  We're completely ineffective against any mob with high MR.  Completely.<P>Mez stacking and multiple enchanters:  Besides the problems with high level mezzes not overwriting low level mezzes like practically every other spell line in the game, the same mez cast by different level enchanters also will not overwrite.  There is no difference between Dazzle cast by a 49 enchanter and one cast by a 60 enchanter.  Allowing the same mez cast by different level enchanters to overwrite each other would nearly negate the current problems of multilple enchanters tripping over each other when working on the same pull.<P>Rashere Al'Ayahd<BR>Bunnies of Chaos<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> I find myself playing my Enchanter less and less. I breeze which most people like, I enchanter metals for people. I try to de-buff but most NPCs resist and then when I do get the de-buff to take affect, it has no visible Effect. Most of the groups I used to run with really prefer a Cleric or a Paladin in my place not that Im a bad enchanter they just dont need the control or de-buffs.<BR> Enchanters cant fight worth beans. Enchanters cant nuke to save their own lives. Enchanters cant heal. Enchanters can Mezz so long as the Mobs arent red. Enchanters take up a slot that could be filled by a more useful PC. (These are comment from other players).<BR> So if I am nearly worthless in hunting, unless I was Umberd out, why should a Group want an enchanter? So they can get Clarity? And if my melee skills are really bad how do I complete my quests that required Mobs to be destroyed? Group? You need to be wanted for that. Most people still dont know what to do with an Enchanter in a group. I know you say teach them, and I try, I show them what I can do like hold a MOB and they fight Many vs. One NPC. But this only works on mobs that may be 2 levels higher then that Enchanter. If you have a group of 4 warriors they want a healer not an Enchanter. The healer may want you for a Breeze/Clarity and to stop the Mobs from Agro-ing the healer but the warriors will win. Throw a Shaman/Druid in to the Mix and there is no need for an Enchanter. <BR> Balance  When you gave other classes the ability, even a little bit, to do some things that was Enchanter only. You balanced their classes and made Enchanter less needed, I didnt say worthless, just less needed. The fact that Enchanter had these abilities, you read your message boards you know the list, made a group want them more then today. If you travel the many zones of EverQuest you here shouts for Breezes/Clarity but not to add you to their group. Most shouts are for Tanks or Cleric types that they would like to add to their group. There is no easy answer on how to make an Enchanter more useful. You cant take away something you have already given to other Classes. Ill just have to hope you (Variant) does something to make Enchanter (mostly Lower Level &lt;50) worth having in a Group. I now have 3 other 20th level PCs that will pass up my Enchanter, Cleric, Warrior, and Wizard. I have an almost 20th level Necro but Im not a Soloist I prefer to group. I enjoy these other classes as well as I enjoy the Enchanter, but I would prefer to play an Enchanter 100% of the time.<BR> Questing  Quick Note, I have Completed in the last 3 weeks or the Stein of Moggok Quest 19 times, Level 24 through Level 25. I have made a few Platinum and some Guild Mates happy by giving them the Stein. The Experience you get from Quests, or the Lack of, makes it so you have to Hunt Mobs. There are Quests that require you to Hunt Mobs to Complete the Quests, and again not get much Experience worth doing the Quest. Then there are Quests that require camping a Mob that may spawn in the next 8 real days or X hours. In any case there should be an option to not have to kill the Mob for you required Quest Item. Example: Stein of Moggok requires the Holy Fish from the Lake or Frostbite. If I do a Sub-Quest for the Regurgatonic I dont have to kill the Fish in the Pond or Kill the Wolf for the Fish he may drop. And it would be nice if these Quests would give Experience so you could try to do it 20 times and make a bubble or two. But anyway it just a though that has come up since grouping has gotten Harder for my Enchanter. And since I refuse to sit and camp a Mob that takes to long to spawn, there is no fun in just sitting. Mezzmo has done a good job of covering the rest.<P>Thank you for the White Space,<P>Gaeaddar Dreamweaver<BR>Level 25 Enchanter<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Dont know if someone else posted it already, but I made a little survey on the castersrealms boards and this is what most people thought was important:<P>1 Crowd control (at higher levels)<P>Velious high level (50+) zones and inability to mez even with GoK and Rapture, GoK and Rapture should work always (if the level requirement is met) except on god mobs. Okay we understand the inability to mez with dazzle or lower, but GoK/Rapture was *already* balanced by the huge mana requirement, aggro (things summon you when it wears off and you die) and the recast time (only one mob). So we see no reason to make anything except the gods themselves immune to this if they meet the level requirement for the spell. You usually get a message "this mob cannot be mesmerised with this spell" that message should mean you cant use dazzle and lower, but you can use either GoK or if the mob is 54+ Rapture. No zones should be filled with mobs that are immune to those, only some boss mobs (gods)should be.<P>Fix targetting on stacks of mobs. Add a cycle nearest, or something. Add a way to Identify your target on mobs with no names above their heads. Targetting is and enchanter staple, and as it stands, it is not good.<BR>It's too hard to target particular creatures when there are several crowded together. We need more targeting features. For a start, perhaps you could show the _01 number at the end of a mob name so we know which one we're aimed it. This actually is an enchanter issue... everyone else can use /assist.<P>Another gripe on targeting is how many times have you had a MoB targeted and started to cast and someone cast on you (like a Bard's song) and your target is switched before you can complete casting? Once you target something it shouldn't switch automatically.<P>Either higher level mez spells should overwrite the lower level mesmerizes no matter what level the caster of the spell (except the AE mesmerization spells because that would be too powerful). This would be great on raids and such where unability to do this leads to great frustration and only makes people use less enchanters. Or other enchanters should be able to overwrite the same (or lower level) mez spell another enc cast on the MOB.<P>Add a client-side check for the mesmerize/charm level/mob type restrictions that gives you the message BEFORE the spell request is sent to the server. Right now, you have to waste the mana and suffer the taunt even if the spell can't take effect. The client knows if your target is too high a level for the spell, however at the higher levels it's impossible to tell since everything is just generic blue.<P><BR>2 Buffing concerns<P>Buffing tedium is a big issue with enchanters. In general we would like to have the duration of the more commonly used buffs increased. It is extremely tedious to have to recast haste every 20 minutes on every tank, or clarity for that matter. We would even favor a mana cost increase proportional with the duration increase if necessary.<P>Group haste buffs (or augment buffs) might be useful here.<P>Group buffs hitting pets too would be nice.<P>Combined buffs might be nice too, like a haste+clarity buff that lasts one hour, no matter what the mana cost.<P>Another game mechanic thing is on the bard class. Playing with Bards can really be annoying because their songs always overwrite or screw up our spells. You have to ask them to stop mana song to cast clarity, you have to be careful when traveling with them over hilly terrain if you are in Air Ele form and they are using Lev song. Ever ran across the DL from the Ice Tunnel to KC and while in Air Ele form and had the Bard run out of range from you?<P>Group clarity, needs to be moved to a lower level like 44th, at 52 is usable for 2 levels then moved to end of book.<P>Clarity 2 duration needs to be LONGER, one hour at least.<P>Lower the cost to cast RuneIV, peridot is to costly compared to rune 5 that has the same component, lower them to 5pp gems<P>Resplendent Robe. Rune IV is the worst of the Rune series and is highly overpriced. Either change the effect or reduce the casting cost of Rune IV. Also, the casting time can be reduced some. 25 seconds is far too long, save perhaps in a group raid when you are buffing for an uber boss.<P>Lower the level requirement for Boon of the clear mind (group Clarity).<P>Gift Spells give you +50 Mana for a way too high cost. Increase the bonus provided and maybe make it like those Cleric HP buffs which also heal when adding HPs. The Gift series of spells cost too much mana. Especially when compared to the druid mask lines and PotG. Cut the costs by 1/3 to 1/2 to make it more reasonable (100/200/300 or 75/150/225). Or make it a group buff for the current amount of mana. The main advantage of these spells is the added regen. The +mana pool is negligible.<P>Fix the level 60 Visions of Grandeur. Why is there a 15 second recast time on this spell? And why is the haste value LESS than the level 49 haste spell? This spell should be a long-lasting alternative to the epic quest item that also offers DEX and ATK. The haste value should be increased to 66% to match it at least.<P>Remove the 15 buff limit that was implemented over a year ago, or at least increase it to 20. With the ever growing list of essential buffs, running out of buff space is becoming a real problem for many classes.<P>Recast time of some spells like Boon of the garou is too much, we already have too few spell slots. Okay it is clear that you are trying to limit it to only 2 persons in the group, why not do that in another way, increase the mana cost or otherwise just give it a longer duration or a shorter recast.<P>Bard cantana song is not working well. I've given up trying to figure out when I can cast over it. Decide if Cantana and C1/C2 are supposed to stack. If so, let us cast over Cantana at any time. If not, then don't let them stack at all (yes, this would be a rather large nerf IMO).<P>Staff of the Serpent. The duration for Speed of the Shissar is a little short, so buffing becomes annoying.<P><BR>3 Armor class and aggro<P>Umbra AC is too low, same as a spell 8 levels ago. Make it self only and increase the AC to 30 or so to balance out the lack of good AC equipment, and the fact that the enchanter is the only tank that cant wear good armor.<P>Enchanter equipment should focus WAY more on AC (and HP) we are hit often, so AC (and HP) are considered more important then int or cha or mana by most people playing this class. Human/eru necros get flayed skin with good AC, but they dont need it. Enchanters would definitely like such high AC equipment.<P>Reoccurring amnesia does not work as intended, either fix this spell or  give us feign death illusion, enchanters have more trouble with aggro then any other class.<P>Memory blur needs to have a failure message.<P>The level 55 memory blur needs to work on creatures over level 50. I haven't found an instance of this yet. Of course there's no message...but when I get summoned I can figure out it failed. Blanket of Forgetfulness. This spell is supposed to be unresistable, but it's not. This also will allow me to continue to be Super Aggro Chanter!<P>Higher Defense (or dodge) skill caps. Enchanters are in a sense tanks.<P>4 Debuffs, stunning and damage dealing<P>Lower the taunt on tashanian so we can cast it on high end NPCs without having to /wave goodbye to everyone first. I don't understand why mala is unresistable, nearly no aggro, AND it does far more than tash. Common tactic is to mala to get resists down and then malo. And chaining those two massive debuffs doesn't get the mage or shaman torn apart like a single tash or a slow (from either ench or shaman) does. Either increase the debuff value a lot to balance it with the incredible taunt and help us with MR concerns in velious, or decrease the taunt factor. Perhaps change it into a  MR percentage debuff, that works better on high MR targets.<P>Resists taunt way more than spells that hold. This gets real ugly when the mobs get to be about level 57.<P>Our already bad dots do not stick with necro dots, please fix this. It is already frustrating to be able to do nothing on some encounters, at least give us some way of contributing damage in those cases.<P>Change whirl and the upgrade to work like tishans clash and the upgrade or stun and holy might, from wizards and clerics spell line ups respectively.<P>Either that or make whirl work like a *random duration* 12 second max? mesmerise like spell on giant flagged creatures (so you cant refresh it reliably yet you still have an option to do non root crowd control on them). Maybe make the refresh time so that you can only 'mesmerise' 1 or 2 giants this way. The spell as it stands now is useless after it got nerfed.<P>Unstunnable creatures should say they resist stun. The bashing me while they are stunned that giants do is just wrong.<P>Weakness spell lines. They just aren't powerful enough. When we talk about stat buffs and debuffs we always end up talking about shamans more than enchanters, and that's only proper. But still... these spells are too weak as is. Languid Pace and the other attack-slowing spells are so much better. Enchanters need to get a SERIOUS stat debuff around level 55...something like Cripple x 2 to separate us from the shamen. Shamen get the best slow near that level, so why can't enchanters have a high level class defining debuff?<P>Our pet spells at 34 and 39 are too weak. The pets at other levels may or may not be balanced, but these two are worse than the rest.<P>Taper Enchantment. Not the whole line, just this one particular spell. Its only purpose it to confuse the young enchanters. Don't improve it, don't fix it, don't replace it, just delete it from the game. Please.<P>Immobilize should work significantly better than Root. Minimum duration, or something. I also think enchanters should get an better root than any other class. In mesmerize disabled environments, druids and clerics are better at enchanting than enchanters. Don't tell the druids, please.<P>Fear needs a minimum duration, even if its 1 second. I get 'Your Fear spell wore off' before 'blah is afraid' sometimes.<P>Wind of Tishian. This is the ultimate death wish next to wake of tranquility. Maybe change it so that it doesn't aggro those affected or change Blanket of Forgetfulness.<P>Crystal Crown/Wand ot Confusion. They are nice pieces. But please. What are stuns for? We can't afford HUGE casting times on these things for them to be effective. You have a limited amount of time to get a stun off. Either reduce the casting time, or give it a different effect.<P>5 Charm in groups<P><BR>Could the level 60 fixed duration charm spell last a bit longer? 1 minute isn't too much to ask if you ask me, if the situation is bad enough you need to get that sort of aggro on you, the fight is probably going to last more than 1 minute anyway. Dictate is a bit of a disappointment, I can see why this is for balance issues.<P>Why not put an interim spell between Boltrans and Dictate. A level capped (50?) charm that would hold for a promised amount of time. Like, I wouldn't mind being able to charm a mob below level 50 or 51, for 1 min or two. Promised charm. <P>Charm is usable when soloing, in groups it has not that much use because of several reasons, these can be easily solved and since this is a group game that would be really nice.<P>Changing the name colour of a charmed pet or prefixing it with the Enchanter's name would be would be a big help.<P>Charm spells should have a minimum duration. This one little change might transform charm from a soloing spell to a grouping spell. Really consider this.<P>Not to make the spell more powerful per se, just a little more convenient. How many seconds does a pet class have to wait after issuing /pet back off before he can issue the next /pet attack command? It should take just as long for a charmed mob to get its bearings when charm wears off.<P>Yet another charm change: There should be a /pet command that ends the charm, so we can stop casting invisibility on ourselves to break charms.<P>Charm should give a message on success, for everyone in range to see.<P>Charmed creatures should forget their aggro list temporarily while charmed, and not attack party members continually.<P>Also often commands are not relayed well to a charmed pet, like giants in Kael. Bad pathing in some places (like Karnors entrance) also makes charming impossible.<P><BR>6 Religion, faction and illusions<P>Religion should be able to be masked (temporarily agnostic) with a spell with an expensive component. Right now you are just stupid to choose other then agnostic. Why not create religious armour with better stats? Better yet, make them quest items. It would add a lot to the game, solve the armour problem and throw those of us who didn't have the sense to be agnostic a bone. Religion faction adjustment can never be hidden, not even by illusion. Seems like it should be possible... then maybe enchanters wouldn't have to be 99% agnostic.<P>Like there is an opportunity to change your class specialization (alteration, evoke, conjuration, abjuration, etc), I believe there should be a way to change your deity through the Temple of Soulsek Ro. <P>New illusions are always fun, Evil eye for example self travel spell with sow built in, long cast time to prevent kiting or whatever minor effects instead. Gender, wisp or monster without faction benefits *just the illusion for looks* we dont use the faction benefits of spells except the racial illusions anyways, because religion and hunting in someplace a lot wont hide the faction anyways.<P>Illusions should stay up when you zone or go linkdead.<P><BR>7 General concerns<P>Recant magic does not work as intended (though the way it works now is better then what intended). Maybe make this spell dispell everything or make it dispell non magic buffs/debuffs too.<P>Tiny daggers still aren't sold at the magic guild(s) in Qeynos.<P>Lull line is useless, Lull and its friends should have less of a chance to fail if you ask me, I only rarely got it to work properly versus Dervishes in NRo way back when, and haven't used it since. Agreed that such a thing could be abused in a dungeon situation, but perhaps it could be made outdoor only. Druids get Harmony, which is not only an area affect spell but unresistable to boot, and never fails as far as I know. Or if it does fail, the whole camp isn't on you while you run to zone wishing you had a SoW. This might need some tweaking so it doesnt approach the power of the level 6 druid spell.<P>Sentinel. Do something with it. Right now it is useless except for making people go linkdead on purpose in PvP. Possibly change it to an eye of  type spell, or a bind sight type spell bound to an area.<P>8 PvP specific concerns<P>Racial illusions on PvP servers still drop when casting an offensive spell, please fix the bug and remove this 'temporary solution'.<P>As an enchanter in pvp you just run or in group encounters at higher lvl - there are just 3 kinds of spells that stick other then tash on any kind of player with a decent mr which is more or less prepared opponent - dispells, mana sieve spells and the occasional mezz - which will be broken if by the oppenent is grouped with another team (BUG)or by selfdotting Why can druids/necros still do dot/dd hits with reduce damage on dds and full unnerfed damage on dots (!) --- even if i am buffed with dmf and equipment up too 170poison resist / 150 Fireresist / 170magic resist and i cant land a single damage spell even after tash if the are above 100mr. Give us a Low resist partial resist nuke, for example swap out dementia for this new nuke. Enchanters cant do much anything else in PvP combat because of the insane MR of others.<P>PvP faction hits on coin only servers make enchanter quests impossible, please fix this. PvP faction hits do hurts Enchanter extremly.<P>Make Charm work on pets.<P>Dispelling on *players* should be done in another way then on MOBs. If you dispel yourself or someone from your team or a current partymember, the dispel should remove the effects that arent clickable away first (that is the bad effects most of the time), only then after it has worked down the entire list of nonclickables it should dispell the usual ones. Dispelling on an enemy team should do it the other way (dispel the good buffs first then the bad ones). This will balance unresistable dots like splurt and winged death by a LOT and will remove the really annoying trying to keep the first buff slot open when you have 14 buffs up. This is one of the more important changes.<P>9 Wishlist<P>Enchanters should get Improved Invis vs Undead at 60. We get the regular one appreciably later than necro/cleric, and it'd just be a nice (but not heavily useful) spell to have.<P>Similarly, I don't know why we didn't get Invert Gravity. We get Gravity Flux 10 levels before wizards do, but never get the upgrade (yes, another toy spell at best).<P>Our ability to enchant items. Enchanter were promised that one day we would be able to enchant objects. This has never really happened. Maybe it would make us too over balanced if they gave us the ability to enchant weapons or armor and make them have have uber stats but what about the ability to recharge certain items (Wand of mana tapping, the charm wand, other wands or rod)? Maybe we have to use a component (like the mana batteries in Sky - what are those things used for anyway? Or the thicken mana potions). Anything like this would be nice.<P>Give warriors an AE taunt at some point. "Battle Yell" or whatever to boost them on the aggro list of that stack of Golems you've just fascinated. Strangly I think giving them a non-damaging way to AE aggro would help us immeasurably.<P>Faster, (mini) healing spells for Druid and Shamen is a good thing. I don't intend on replacing a Cleric with a shaman, but I'd like a shaman or druid to be more able to heal me when 2/4 Ilis Knights just resisted AE Mes. (or the hasted bok knight resisted a stun)<P>The ability to both give and take mana from groupmates. It seems like some class ought to be able to 'heal' mana in the same sense that clerics heal health. Currently necromancers do that better than enchanters... just seems wrong. This might reduce the role of necromancers in raids even more so it might be wrong, but still it is suited to the enchanters role.<P>Targeted AE clarity and haste with extreme casting costs would be nice for raids.<P>Manashield spell. Take damage to mana first (with a bad ratio), then HP. Big payoff (more HP) with Big Penalty (no mana left if its used up).<P>How about a combo MR/Int/Mana debuff akin to what malo does for melee skills?<P>How about a short duration DOT type stun spell? Say 2 sec stun every tic for 5 tics<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Few Notes:<P>On Illusionists: Our Epic Quest Givers are all disguised as another race, or even robots, yet, we lack any ability to acheive that??? <P>All these Enchanters who are masters can turn into anything it seems, but a level 60 phantasmist cannot.<P>Jeb-Snarnak<BR>Mizzle-Clockwork<BR>Modani-Scorpion<P>Freeport Enchanter Guild Master is an Aviak<P>Phantasmists in Plane of Growth are multi-colored wisps<P>So why is it that we can never become as good as our masters? and if not whats the point? <P>I like the gender illusion, but thats more fun, then anything.<P>Illusion Summon, just like the monster summmoning, I think this is great.<P>Why is our faction not changed with Vellious and Kunark anymore in Illusion, you removed it to make wolves kos, so when we change, we get almost NO, faction adjustment.<P>We are illusionists, look at our Coin Quest also, we have to go into every city, and retrieve a coin, a job for someone able to change faction and shape.<P><BR>You seemed to have defined the enchanter role by their quests and their guild leaders, but you wont make it so.<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Lull-COME ON, what is this? some sort of joke? was this a univerally funny thing at Verant, or you just felt you needed to give the enchanter class a spell, you might as well have given us a true south/west/east/and north spells over these. At least I thought Wake of Tranquality would be like harmony, but its an AOE aggro.<P>Runes-Love them, great, but buying Peirdots is just insane, yes its a money sink, but my god, how much do you think we are making???<P>And on the robe, if yer gonna put it on it, then remove the reagent.<P>The Dyn Dizzying Draught and Whirl Till You Hurl spells, they become useless at higher levels, it might as well go into the back of my book. Increase the power of this spell.<P>Gift line of spells, give the mana pool and mana regen a tad more, we should be contributing more to the group now that we have to sit on our butts with all the new MR mobs<P>Tash-even at chopping off 120Magic Resistance, the Mobs are set to resist anything you throw at them. Hecht, the guards in neriak resist me, and they have been green for some time. You have set them so magic resistant that any effect a chanter wishes to have is NULL.<P>Our Str altering spells-Seriously, we cannot affect an NPC's strength, at least the speed debuffs seem to work, but take the str down by 120 and what happens??? Nothing, the mob hits just as hard? <P>Our dots, the best benifit of the dot is the str and dex negatives mixed in, dont really see any dmg as the dots move too slowly, and the natural regen of alot of the mobs counteract this.<P>Wandering Mind-Okay, so you might of heard a little of what we requested, but somewhere it got twisted. We love THEFT of thought, its got a permanet slot, but not this, how in anyones mind did they do the math to figure out casting costs vs return costs??? Make it like a liche type spell that keeps going after the mob is good and dead.<P><BR>Boon of Garou-Why can I not make two or more of my party WWs? Its not super over powering.OH god that lifetap is gonna take down the vellious mob with a kajillion hps!!! <P>Shadow Line of Spells-why is the ac so low? is there so hidden beneifit to why anyone would want this spell over a cleric buff? Does it change the roll of the mob making it harder to hit you?<BR>That is what I always believed that with Shadow you are hit less, but with a cleric buff which cancels it, you are Hit more, but you now have the ac and hps to deal with it. Look into really defining the use of this spell.<P>Charm-why is it a bard can charm better then I can? Their charm is almost instant, where is I am standing watching my watch as the charm is being cast... and why this cap? It was once stated that Enchanters can charm any mob ( Wait another name for us is Beguiler ) and make it their pet, well not anymore. I am not saying let us charm CT, or Inny, but come one, some of these loser mobs who are high level who should be tottaly charmable.<BR>Also why do druids get a fixed charm??? How is that even close to working in a balance issue.<P>Gear for Enchanters-Enchanters are the only class that needs for two stats to reach 200, int and charisma, added to that, we use alot of jewelery which has NO AC, we have low hps, and our gear isnt set for AC, so when an enchanter starts to take a beating, s/he is gone. Review the gear, or help us with the Shadow line of spells.<P><BR>Sentinel Spells-unless it moves, you dont know its there, if something pops right near you with sentinel up, you never know. Change it to a monitor and not a lag maker.<P><BR>Our pets-we arent a pet class fine, I understand that, they dont respond to commands, which makes them tottaly unwanted. If they did respond enchanters would be asked to summon animations. Just know we understand the pet item, and keep reducing the amount of reagent daggers as you climb in levels.<P><BR>Our Mez/ColorStuns/and Dazzle, they are great, but with the Magic Resistance of Vellious Mobs, we have lost our role we just mana buff, our stuns just bounce off of everything. Why did you change this? You just unbalanced us out of groups.<P>--------------------------------------------------<P><BR>The thing I see for balancing esp with Vellious is that you just need tanks, rogues, and a cleric, and you are set, No other class can contribute. Why would you do this? You gave Wizards the power they wanted in Kunark then took it away in Vellious. Enchanters have always had balance issues, but with Vellious they have become much worse and now make it worthless to be the chanter.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, first of all, let me say I've been playing an enchanter since the game came out.  Although I enjoy playing my enchanter immensely, around level 34 I started to notice how resistable I was.  It got so bad that at 43 I was resisted at least once per fight by blues and experience giving greens.  <P>I have friends that play all 3 of the other pure caster classes, and normally (with the exception of necros) when they say something resisted, it's even to them, and it was a partial resist.  Since Enchanters are the only offensive spell casters whose spells ALL save against magic, you should consider either making enchanter spells inherently less resistant or increasing the effects of the Tashan line.  My idea of balancing would be that we should have strength versus magic resist, because unlike the other casters, we have nothing else to fall back on.  At least if I was a wizard and getting resisted with magic, I could switch to cold or fire.<P>The main problem with the resists is it reduces me to being a group buffer.  You know there is something wrong with a class when I can get up, take a shower, order some pizza, and come back 30 minutes later without anyone knowing I was gone.  At least now, with boon of Garou, I have to come back every 6 minutes, but I'm still not doing anything except letting other people fight better.  Sure, it's great to walk into a group and start buffing and have everyone all happy and everything, but I'd like to have a more active roll in groups.  No one else seems to have a problem that over half of their spell lines are more likely to get you killed than help a group out at high levels.<P>After the resistance changes, I would suggest a few other changes:<P>1. Increase the duration of Sentinal.  I actually use this spell, and it's great if you're camping multiple rooms, but it wears off too quickly.  I think more people would use it if it lasted longer.<P>2. Change AE mes spells to Point Blank mes spells with the same radius.  Although this would reduce an enchanter's ability to pull, it would keep them from getting themselves killed by messing all except one target (including themselves) and subsequently getting plowed over.<P>3. Increase the effect of strength debuffs... I know it's been said, but I'm gonna say it again.  One novel way to do it would be to give NPC's a set weight based on their size, thus allowing strength debuffs to cause them to be encumbered.  Just a thought.<P>4. Make the falling damage from gravity flux and invert gravity marked as PvP damage rather than falling damage, but calculate it the same way.  As it stands, Enchanters really aren't allowed to use the spell in PvP because the falling damage causes exp loss if you die from it, and it's not nearly as useful in PvE since NPC's take no falling damage.<P>5. Having been an enchanter since the beginning of the game, I've been waiting on a thread of hope to be able to enchant things other than jewelry.  As it is right now, being an erudite enchanter, I can only enchant bars for other people to use to make things.  I myself cannot make enchanted anything unless it's jewelry.  Now there's the new tailoring stuff... well it can't be made WITHOUT enchanting it, so what's the fun in that?  If there were non enchanted versions, then I'd feel a little more accomplished and I could say "Hey, look what I made".  I still can't make enchanted weapons (which was why I made an enchanter in the first place) and I've posted numerous articles on how this could be implemented.<P>6. Illusions, Boon of Garou, etc.  I don't really need any more of these, they'd be nice, but they don't affect my ability to play very much.  If I had to choose illusions though, I'd choose Illusion Giant or Illusion Drake.  Perhaps Illusion Giant could change you to a random Giant within the zone.  Although this would be good for faction in some zones, you'd be KoS in 90% of the zones in the game.  Illusion Drake would be the same way.  Effects for Illusion Giant could include See invis, Strength bonus, Stamina Bonus, or HP Bonus.  The effects for Illusion Drake should be increased fire resistance, a fire based proc, or additional intelligence (since Dragonkin are supposed to be the most intelligent beings).  I'm sure there are some other choices out there as well.<P>That's really all I can think of.  Enchanters are either the most powerful class in the game or the weakest class in the game, depending on our resists.  More often than not, it's the latter rather than the former.  Bards suffer from the same fate, I think, but at least they don't lose mana for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Everyone (especially mezzmo) has expressed most of my primary concerns with my most beloved of classes.  Here's the things I didn't see covered, weren't covered enough, or ones that I'd just like to make sure get lots and lots of coverage.<P>1) MEZ STACKING - yes, I'm shouting, I apologize.  However, this is my number 1 concern.  Higher level mezzes should ALWAYS overwrite lower ones.  Period.  They do not.  Equal level mezzes from different enchanters should ALWAYS overwrite as well.  Makes stacking enchanters in a party MUCH more acceptable.  If you change NOTHING except this I'll be dancing in the aisles.<P>2) What is the DEAL with suddenly making everything uber magic resistant, giant-flagged, or both?  There are WAY too many giant-flagged creatures in the game, and WAY too many places where we are completely useless.  If you want to make things harder, it appears that you do three things... give it a bazillion hit points, giant flag it, and give it an MR of oh, around 3000.  How about not taking the easy road and designing things that require careful thought and planning, instead of just sending in a batallion of buffed tanks?  You guys did an INCREDIBLE job on kunark, you then turned around and dropped the ball big time in velious.  Bad verant, no biscuit.<P>3) Throw us a bone here, PLEASE give us some HP/AC gear.  Please?  Do I have to grovel?  I'm a battle mage, help me to stay alive just a TINY bit longer, ok?<P>4) Please revisit all our gear with right-clickable effects.  Some of it is laughable, and some is just plain stupid.  Other classes get really great effects on their stuff (ranging from nukes on wizzie gear to arrow summoning for rangers and everything in between).  The enchanters got screwed here, big time.<P>As for the rest, I am in pretty much complete unison with my brothers and sisters on nearly all the other issues... we are, for the most part, pretty well balanced but we DO need tweaking a bit and so does the environment around us.<P>-- Faenyar Mindweaver<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>A lot of really good suggestions here! Don't think we need anymore spells. We would need to have a better Tash spell though as the higher lvl mobs are quite resistant to it. Might wanna up the tashan effect of the 50+ lvl spells so the 50+ Enc's can be more effective. Many have already expounded on it here and i'm not as high a lvl as they are yet so i'm unable to give you a viewpoint.<P>Illusions,....not worried about them unless they make me more effective in certain places and allow me to move through. I don't need to look like everything in the game here, and especially don't care to have a female illusion....lets keep it moderate.<P>Weaken line series,.... definetely has to be fixed. Absor,....the wizards need to be king of DD but let the weaken line cripple the critters better than it does. Would make it easier for us solo some if we wanted. This is my spell line I use consistantly during battle at this lvl and wish it had more effect overall for the group.<P>Un-used spells,..... this would cover everyone, but tell the designers to implement a un-scribe button so we can sell back the spells we feel we don't need anymore. If we make a mistake on one we can always buy it back or research it,..whichever the case.<P>Haste line of spells,..... Most confusing and annoying line of spells we have Absor. Would be easier for us to have Augmentation bumped up quite a bit and to have the Bard's Celerity song bumped also,....make sure it wouldn't overwrite Augmenation. I know everyone probably will drop their jaw,.....but it saves us downtime if the Augmenation lasts longer and is not overwritten by anyone of the haste spells,.,...besides,...the Bard would be the better candidate for the haste line since they are up close and next to the tanks 90% of the time. In my opinion,....I would rather see the haste line removed in it's entirety and given to the bard class for usage. We are not suppose to just be a buff class. I'm starting to see this now that i'm 40 and don't like it at all,...this is an area where our class is not very well defined and has to have a look into. <P>Pets and Charm,....this too is quite weird how it's been designed. Enchanters should be the Masters of mind control but we are limited quite a lot in the game from what i've seen. I don't care for the animation line since i'm suppose to be able to charm something for my use. The charm line up to the 50 lvl spells are very unperdictable and not too fun when it backfires on you. Major suggestion,....let the Enc class charm things for pets for their usage instead of the animations. If i charm that Gnoll and use him let the charm last for quite a long time until it dies or suicides itself. But,....most of all,...for the fun factor we want in this game,.....we can't have critters breaking charm and killing us,..its no fun here at all,...period! I've been asked by groups to not use charm at times cause of this fact. Let us charm something and the charm last for a determined amount of time then the charmed pet dies or suicides without being able to loot it. That last part about the looting thing is for the ones who would abuse the charming ability for KS,...we are dealing with human nature here,..i'm quite aware of that.<P>Mana regeneration,.....I'm acutally happy other classes are being given some form of mana generation since they are casters also. I would look into the regen rates and make sure we are ahead of the power curve on breeze, clarity,..and such,...no need for other classes to be stepping onto our spell line,...that bard mana song and clarity if just great though,..can't wait to see it in the upper lvls! :-) Clerics need some form of mana regen also.    I'll step out on a limb here ( i'm going to bat for you clerics here, better appreciate this!) I have a great suggestion for the line if i may take an opportunity. This will be rough since it's been nerfed cause of wrong-doers in the game before i came along,..ok, here goes,... make a quested item for the clerics that is ONLY for clerics and can ONLY be quested by clerics. This item would only be used as such by clerics for their mana regen as other casters have spells in the game. My suggestion,....would be the mana stones that were once in the game. They would have to be balanced for the cleric but would definetely give them a nice item for mana regen and would accent the class greatly, giving them the quick resource they need at critcal times for the whole of the group. Let me reiterate:<P>1) Quested for Clerics only!<BR>2) Used by Clerics only!<P>There,..one for the clerics :-) ok back to business here.<P>Epic weapon,.....Many have expounded on the drop thing about the weapon but i see something different. I'm not sure how to do this and give you the ammo to present to the team as important but here goes again: ok,...stats,..by far the greatest!!!,....effect,.....of no use to me :-( why,....strickly a buff effect that corners us into the buff mold again. Suggestion,....different effect or as there is a quest to change specializations,....let me quest to change to effect to something different that is more class specific and aids in battle better. Effect Suggestion,.......hmmmm,.....2 suggestions: <P>1) Maybe a serious upgrade to the color flux color skew line,...an effect that is right clickable that has a majorly quick recast time and would allow us to keep high lvl mobs stunned when we can't mezz them,..then the tanks and such can defeat these things one at a time. I know this might not always be a great effect in some instances as it might draw major attention from other mobs within dungeons but is one suggestion.<P>2) A high lvl Mezz effect that is quite unresistable and contains a slight mem blur within it. Maybe not conceivable by the development team as this might give us too much controlling ability but is a better effect than what we currently have for the epic, and better defines the class overall than the speed buff.<P>And by the way,....someone please change it's look,....very undesirable,..looks like a sawed off golf club,....sorry,..sad but true :-(<P>There you go Absor,.....hope this helps.<P>Ldar<BR>Tunare server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The chorus of disillusioned enchanters saying that the defining aspect of our class has been totally eliminated in high end Velious encounters has definately made it's point, and I add my voice to it's ranks. As far as a suggestion on providing some sort of remedy for this, expecting all or some of the high end areas of Velious to be reworked is very unrealistic. The only good idea I can come up with is to rethink the role of the spell Rapture, and its effects. By no means am I asking for the abilities of an enchanter to controll crowds in areas like Guk and Chardok to be applied to places like the top half of PoG or deep in Kael. What I do think needs to happen is use rapture as a tool to enable a number of enchanters to effect crowd controll to some degree in these encounters. Place a large number of restrictions on it, high mana, low duration, unable to be overwritten by itself like charm is, lengthy recast time so as to limit the number of mobs any given enchanter can control, anything. Just give the enchanter a crowd control tool that can be used on the general populace of SoV high level areas.<P>With regards to gear, I have come to the following conclusion. Either it is Verant's intention that the rewards enchanters are to get in no way adress the stats that they wish to improve on, and contain absolutely no right click effects that provide a gain in an enchanter's playing; or, the people who are designing these rewards have absolutely no concept of what constitutes a worthwhile item. No gear I've seen can help us on high level Velious raids, but that's because we do nothing on high level velious raids. The fact that no gear helps us in xp raids or otherwise is a totally different matter. The general trend on effects on gear has been to either provide a relatively weak bonus that a class does not otherwise have, such as gate for rangers, shielding for warriors and shadowknights, invisibility for warriors, etc. Or, the class is provided with a mana free way to do something that is central to their function, with added drawbacks of it either being a longer casting time, or one upgrade behind the best spell in the series. Following this trend, perhaps give enchanters legs with the effect of tepid deeds, for use in xp groups with no shaman when low mana. Or dazzle with a very long casting time. Or dispell. As for something outside the class's boundaries, anything adressing our desire to stay alive longer while trying to control a crowd. A very weak regen effect. If you could put long recast times on items, Divine Aura. Something rewarding.<P>There are a lot of really well expressed ideas above that I strongly agree with, not going to waste time listing them, but it is nice to see that many other people feel the same way about the game as I do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
