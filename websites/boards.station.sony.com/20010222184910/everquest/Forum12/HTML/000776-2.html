</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>You missed the single most important Mage issue, which is the scaling of power between 50 and 60.<P>Please review the power of the Voceration pets and particularly the power of the Greater Voceration pets.<P>A 5-15% increase in power between 50-60 is not acceptable, not when melees see over a 100% increase in power and mobs see 300%.<P>At 49, our class is great.  At 52, it's still great.  By 55, we are fairly mediocre, but still solid.  By 60 ... we are a waste of bandwidth.  Pets are too weak to merit summoning - the risk is too great.  Our DDs are resisted a solid 40-50% against trash on raids, and 90-100% against any remotely 'Uber' mob.  I'm lucky if I do 5% of the damage of a Warrior ... in a short fight.<P>AND THAT IS ALL I DO.  DAMAGE.  Mages are restricted moreso in this respect than any other class.  If we don't deal more damage than melee classes, what exactly is our point?  We come at tremendous risk and have no defensive skills - either to protect ourselves or our companions.  We have no meaningful buffs.  We have no mana regeneration or speed modifiers.  No form of crowd control.  Our pets can't tank because their taunt is insufficient.  Clearly, we were designed to be the best damage dealers in the game - and that's why we face these tremendous penalties.<P>Between 50 and 60, we lose none of our disadvantages, but slowly go from the #1 damage dealing class to #6 or 7.  Nix that.  Against mobs that are averagely MR in a situation where we can't summon a pet, we easily sink to #10 or 11 - and become the worst class in the game by a couple orders of magnitude.<P>Pet graphics?  Voice graft?  Pet names?  Huh?  C'mon.  What the Hell do these things have to do with balance?  Don't skirt the issue.<P>Utuno<BR>Level 59 Conjurer ... looking for an excuse to come out of retirement (but more inclined to believe these balance decisions are going to convince him to finally hit the cancel button)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Additional thoughts:<P>1) "Higher level pet healing spell"<P>I'v been reading that some mages wish that a parallel spell to this line would be basicly a complete pet heal, but with a cost ABOVE the cost of re-summoning, re-equipping, re-buffing the pet.<P>...tweak the cast time, recast time, mana-cost, regeant and other variables to make sure it can't be abused.<P>Basicly it could be considered usefull when you gotten a good pet and would hafta sped alot time getting a good pet again and getting it back into full fighting force - this would proberbly be a 60th level spell - as its the direct oppesit of the summoned kill spell at that level, but ask around.<P>2) "Shard of the Core"<BR>I might be wrong here, but did't alot of people question the No-drop label on this item?<P>3) "Pathing"<BR>As i remember(from prior statments), fixing bad pathing isn't easy, as just locating the problem<BR>can be difficult. (ofcause some zones, just generelly scream for a fix).<P>Therefor i must suggest that you consider launching an effort on the test-server for people to log in and de-bug and report specific problem areas - i'm sure TONS of people would be willing to log in on a specific "find-the-bad-pathing-weekend" if tools to report the nessesary information that will fix the problem was made available in that specific weekend.<P>(and a pet-using charecter was made available on every account without one and with a free slot, possibly already camped in the zone that needs debugging)<P>/rant on = absor, can ignore the rest with my permission  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>yes, i know i'm asking alot - but if Verant want people like me to help test their things they gotta expect the same hazzle that I get from my testers when i hand over the new pension calculation algorithem  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>= a sane array of tools to do the job with.<P>If Ester works with the same tools as the players on test i must admire her, i could't work like that  (the outcry on test at the wipe, did't supprise me, how could you expect people to think of it as a real test server when theres nothing special about it??)<P>/grumbles</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor's list didn't change much from the original because, guess what, the original list was the product of an earlier discussion with mages. 85% of the 6 pages of comments to the original list were for things that were already in it, 10% was regarding epics and spell resists which he pulled together in another thread, and the other 5% were stupid "gimme" requests from people who think they can con Verant into doubling the power of our class.<P>Having said that, there is a way to improve the main issue that Absor missed, that being pet control. <P>PROBLEM: The back off command doesn't work as intended - by the time the pet turns around and walks away, it gets hit again and rejoins the fray.<P>SOLUTION: For 5-10 seconds after the back off command is issued, do not add anything to the pet's aggro list, for any reason.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First and foremost, as pretty much every mid-to-high level magician, to see a new pet command added to the game, in the lines of "/pet noattackstance or /pet no aggro. As it was explained above /pet back off just doesn't cut it since you can only give so many pet commands in a given ammount of time due to the 2-3 seconds delay between pet commands. This would allow us a greater control over our pets which are the bane of the class in higher level dungeons where mezes must not be broken or else the whole group dies.<P>Second most important thing that got overlooked is the fact that pets dont benefit from group-spells such as our own boon of immolation, pack-regen, pack-sow, etc, etc, etc. Since a mage without a pet is virtually useless and defenseless, and that pets take a percentage of the total experience gained from a kill, I believe its only fair that they benefit from such spells as group-spells.<P>Now for the less important stuff:<P>I like most of the ideas that got into the list but quite a few good ones from the orignal mage talk thread are missing, like the scaling of pet power in relation to the scaling of the melee classes' power. Without boosting our pet's hp's or their damage input, perhaps a slight increase in level would be in order for the post-50 pets. A level 45ish pet (summoned at lvl51 until lvl57) just doesn't cut it damage-wise and defense-wise against 51+ mobs, which greatly reduces our effectiveness, more so since most of those mobs are in most cases highly magic resistant.<P>Give mages some kind of cold-based DD. Or change the way our dots are working so they are now Cold-based. As the so-called masters of the elements, I believe we should get at least one line of spells that isn't fire.<P>Give mages some kind of elemental-only fear or short-duration mez. We live with elementals at our sides for 55 levels of our potential EQ lives, why cant we influence the elementals that aren't our pets?<P>Elemental-form line of spells would be more appropriate given to the mages, but a bit too late to strip enchanters of it.<P>Fellow mages, please feel free to add your own thoughts. Alan and the rest of the Verant Interactive Live Team, please consider adding these things as they are obviously very much needed and requested by nearly every mage.<P>Cherrie Dawnblaze<BR>Witch of the 55th Elemental Circle<BR>Children of Virtue, Karana<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, forget all the other stuff, while it does need looking at, the single most important issue is damage.  We have NO escape, which is justified by being able to do incredible damage.  However, post 50, this breaks down, and we need to be compensated one way or another to avoid becoming inferior to the vast majority of other classes.  We either need a way to escape in sticky situations BESIDES GATE, or an increase in our damage output, whether that be through DD or pets.  However, i believe that escape spells do not fit with the mage class.  It makes more sense for us to do the DAMAGE.  Please, look at the damage we do post 50 and see if our lack of escapability of justified.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nice list.. BUT..<P>None of those changes will really shape the BALANCE of the Magician. You forgot some fundamental problems, and have a few errors..<P>First, the errors.<BR>Shard of the Core: It isn't the range slot, that's already there, it's the AMMO slot.. but due to programming, the ammo slot is UNABLE to grant any save bonues for any items, which is why the range slot was chosen.  The number one complaint with this spell is it's NO DROP.  Why have the ability to make an item, that we are the only ones who can use.. especially such a limited use item, which most mages of the appropriate level will never cast due to the availabilty of a better non-summoned item (teachers syllabus, students homework).<P>2nd Error- DoTs.  While we are wondering why we were given these, the problem is not why, but rather why give us such underpowered dots. Even by your own statement on the necromancer thread you state that dots are supposed to be some of the most manaefficient spells ingame and that's the drawback of having such a long duration.  Mage spells are neither mana efficient nor more powerful than a simular Nuke of the appropriate level.  The existance of these spells is nothing more than a placholder in the mages spellbook. They dont' do more damage, they do NOT reduce agro upon the magician any more than an experienced magician does by waiting a second or two before nuking, and they do not stack, meaning if another mage casts it, there is no way for a 2nd mage to know if he's going to waste his or her mana.<P>--<P>Ok now for the TWO biggest fundamental changes which you neglected to mention:<P>1) TAUNTING- Pet taunting is rediculous.  My epic pet is unable to taunt anything, even if the warriors,rogues, monks, etc.. aren't even taunting.  I did an experiment with all the tanks using SLOW 2 hander weapons, no haste etc.. very minimum damage at levels 55-58 (had 3 tanks of various level).  I'm level 59 and had my epic pet, without them taunting, the rogue was hit about 80% of the time with the warrior getting tapped every now and then.  My epic pet with taunt ON mind you was never touched!  What's the use of having taunt on a pet if it does not work!<P>2nd major problem-<BR>What is the role of magicians?? As we stated earlier, most of our best summons are given away to other classes with no regard for class interdependency.  Mages who do not have one of two spells are not wanted in the groups.  Call of the Hero, and Mala.  Without those spells there is NO REASON to have a mage around post level 50.  Thier tanks are so low level they do negligable damage to the Velous and upper Kunark mobs, thier liability due to pathing and fear you've addressed, our nuking abiltiy is 'nerfed' as that of wizards due to the HP of the new mobs vs our damage.  No one wants a magiican unless they can summon you down to a raid point (and only for the prep) or for one single spell , mala, which if there were more shamans, we'd be neglected all together.  <P>Ways to fix number 2 include: Stop giving our summons to other classes via armor!  Give US improved summon items via various items ingame.  <P>You mention the robe of conjuration vs necro robe.. even if you gave us the 56 damage shield, it'd rarely get used!!  Here's why.. I use the robe for one thing and one thing only, buffing newbies. If i want to buff my group, i use group shield, if it's individuals I can't wait the 10second casting time in battle to stand there doing nothing so i use the 4 second Cadeau of flame.  Changing our robe to Cadeau of Flame will make it UNUSABLE on newbies due to level restrictions and too long to use when needed.  <P>The appropriate spell to change this to , keeping it inline with the necromancer Conjure Corpse, is Call of the Hero! Both spells are 'downtime' spells, which require a component.  Both spells are not needed during combat situations so casting time is not a big issue.  That is the spell that shoudl be there, CALL OF THE HERO, not a cheap 10-12 second damage shield which won't ever get used.<P>Meraxes Glibilskym<BR>59th Conjurer of Fennin Ro.<P><BR>I've got so much more but don't have the energy to continue with my mage any longer, the game has turned into a melee game at upper levels, so I've made my warrior and she's gaining levels and friends nicely.  Amazing how Verant turned a Beta player who only played one character for the last 2 years away by screwing up the balance so bad  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor it is obvious you have no idea what game balance is for the high end game of EQ.  You don't understand how the classes interact and rely upon each other.  Mages have no identity now.  We do not out damage any tank class post 50.  Mana regen is so slow even with c2 ( clarity II since you probably won't recognize that) if we actually contribute in a fight by attempting to nuke (resistance vs our spells is off the wall) then we will spend the next 3 5 mins with no useful amount of mana.  VI has taken casters in general out of the high end game.  Wanna play post 50?  Better play a tank class of some type, a chanter or a cleric.  Wanna be useful on a raid vs. mobs like Trakk etc.  then dont play a mage or any other catser unless you just wanna buff.  Once again BRAVO Absor you have done a wonderful job in compiling our thoughts on what we feel needs changing.

</FONT><HR>To me the whole idea of balancing the classes is a little ridiculous. After all, how do you balance a cleric with a necro, or a druid with a monk? They have completely different roles and can't really be compared to each other as far as power and viability go. Can you balance a Cleric's heal with a necro's DoT?  Then it comes down to comparing classes within a specific area, like int casters for example.  Then you get discussions like the Tashani line is resisted less than the Malosi line, so could you lower our resist a little so that we're more useful?  This is how the classes get blurred.<P>I don't want blurred, the classes are supposed to be distinctive.  I don't want a pet class that can nuke like a Wizard, or that has the mana regen like an Enchanter.  I like my Magician and his unique abilities, the problem is whether the Mages positive distinctions are useful.<P>For example:<BR>Mages are supposed to be masters of summoning, but it is hardly unique to our class, and it's usefulness (especially at upper levels) is highly suspect, if downright nonexistant.  The weapons we summon aren't that great, Waterstone is useful pretty much only for Kedge Keep, I haven't summoned a Coldstone for anyone for 6 levels, Mod Rod is somewhat useful, but severly limited due to being Lore.<P>Mages are also supposed to be Masters of the Elements, but this distinction doesn't even exist, since we use only one element: Fire.  (2 if you count the Shock line as Earth)<P>Pets:  This, over all things, is what distinguishes us from all other classes. Yet, as other people have posted, due to the bad pathing in MANY high level zones, having a pet can be more of a hinderance than a boon, especially with all the other pet problems thrown in.   <P>OK, since you want to compare and balance classes, let's compare.<BR>A Warrior's distinction: Highest HP's and AC of any class<BR>Usefulness: 100% useful in every encounter you could think of<P>Cleric: Best healing spells in the game. Resurrection spells<BR>Usefulness: 100% useful in every encounter you could think of<P>Magician: Summoning type spells and best pets (arguably)<BR>Usefulness: Summoning (including CotH) useful in maybe 50% of encounters/camps/raids. Pets useful (as in desired and not a hinderance) in again maybe 50% of encounters/camps/raids.  This is for 50+ level encounters.<P>The problem I see is not with the Mage class, but with the encounters.  Each class is different and has it's own role, it's own area of expertise, but the encounters are all the same on a fundamental level.  That's the reason why Druids and Shaman are blurring toward Cleric, because Clerics are 100% useful in every encounter.  I like my Mage, but when does he ever get to shine?  Don't give us Necro spells, just make the spells we have useful (and unique)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I believe that not only is this a reasonable train of logic, but that it will also give us a 'group support' role that might make up for the fact that most of our summons are useless at the level at which we recieve them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>   First off, thanks Absor, for trying to do a professional collation of magician class balance concerns, presented fairly and objectively.  I only wish you were granted more time than you have, since it seems thoroughness isn't what it should be for a complete and final balancing.<P>   Second, I agree with the overall list....<P>   But I think that there is way too much attention paid to the high-level game.  The high level game approaches "being broken" for mages and needs tuning badly, but that doesn't mean that the low- and mid-level players should be largely ignored.  Most people will **never** play beyond 50, and even the 50+ people spend the majority of their careers at lower and middle levels.  And those levels definitely need some balancing.  See specific ideas below in my post.   :-&gt;<P>   Also, there are some details in your list that need further attention or I disagree with.  Details are what balancing is all about, so please don't sweep everything away with too broad a broom.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: Recently the way players log back into the servers after disconnect was changed.....fix this by making No Rent items disappear on log-in instead of log-out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   I'm pretty sure I was the first person who posted the suggestion to make the No Rent check at log-in rather than log-out.  At the time I suggested 60 minutes not 30 minutes.  The reason is that magician players out to be able to log out to eat dinner with their families just like other players.  Not many people can have a family dinner in less than 30 minutes.  The other 13 classes don't have to worry about this, and anyone who has logged a lot of /played time as a mage will tell you it's not trivial.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Rain Spells.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   -The single thing that makes area effect spells all but useless for both wizards and mages is:  enchanter mezzes.  Make it so rains don't break mez.<BR>   -The second biggest AE spell problem is resist rates for rain spells are definitely too high.  I have no idea whether the resistance checks are too high or there is an inadvertent bug in the code creating this.  Point blanks don't seem to be resisted as much, but still have some problem here.<BR>   -The third biggest AE spell problem is that that they damage a limited number of mobs instead of all mobs in their area, and that pets count against this number.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pathing.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Can we get an "Amen" here?  :-&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Notes: Plane of Hate, Chardok, Nurga, the Hole, Old Sebilis, Trakanon’s Lair were the zones suggested.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   The fact that the zones listed here are all high level zones reflects the bias among those who post here towards being high level.  Basically, every dungeon in the game has real problems, but much less so in the Kunark and Velious expansions.  Crushbone, Blackburrow, Befallen, Najena, Unrest, Sol A and B, L and U Guk, etc.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pets and AoE fear.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   That was a great suggestion about making pets respond to Fear spells by quivering useless in place instead of running away like crazy.  However don't make this the default pet behavior when Feared, only the behavior when their mage buffs them appropriately.  Either included in the Burnout buff, or as a separate, long-duration, low- to medium-mana-cost buff.  Reward those who plan carefully, don't punish us all by making us spend all our time and mana rebuffing our pets instead of contributing nukes, buffs, and debuffs on behalf of our groups.  It would be punishment to give us yet another short-duration buff.  (Fire shields being the short-duration buff we already have.)<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Hey, I am considered a high-level character by most people (almost 50th) and yet the Voceration spells are just too high level to have anything to do with my life.  Yes, I'm sure the pets are about as useless as described by many posters, but I wouldn't know from personal experience.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Spell Drops.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   This isn't just a problem at 54.  There is a broader problem with drop rates that has a major impact on mages.  Because we are forced into spell research and research requires a couple of dozen loot drops that are fairly rare.  Worse, things like aviak feathers, ice of velious, pearl shards, etc.--which are **required** for research--hardly matter whether they are rare or common drop, since most people who loot them just destroy them as useless and taking up a valuable inventory slot while out hunting.  They simply never make it into the player economy to begin with.  Either eliminate these things from mage research recipes to begin with, or add a tag onto each item's description in game that says "Magician", etc.  Although doing that to all item drops might tend to make some quests actually solvable by real people once they have that obvious clue in front of them, so it might be against the Vision.  Anyway, mages have a near-impossible time acquiring research components and this is partly due to drop rates, and partly due to other aspects of the design.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pet Names.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>:-&gt;<BR>   Sure, why not?  As long as it doesn't divert limited resources from important things.  N.B. the poster above who warns don't make things like Kizdean Gix, a hill giant, etc. permissible names.  Which starts to sound like more trouble than it's worth, but if you talk to the appropriate programmer on the team it might actually be easy for their name-filtering module to check against a list of existing mob names.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pet Graphics.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Like above.  Sure, why not?  As long as it doesn't divert resources from what's important.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Rage of Zomm.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Ditto.  It's a looks issue.  Substance remains most important.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: DoTs.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   I agree.  DoTs are nice, but so what?  I would MUCH rather have the attention paid to a line of spells for enhancing our pets.  Perhaps replace the DoT with a pet heal or regen spell or other pet buff?  Don't spend any resources or tweaking the DoT's casting time or mana cost or whatever, even though they are screwed up.  Just get rid of the spells.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Dyzil's Deafening Decoy.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   To me (a high-level mage by most folks' reckoning) this is an angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin argument.  Only affects the few people who are nearly at the end of their careers as mages.  The complaints are probably valid, but it is a minor spell for only the almost-maxed-out players.  It doesn't affect the vast majority of us.  We would MUCH rather have the utility summons throughout our careers that almost useless now be rebalanced to be attractive to groups, or have the conflict between mezz and pets resolved (or both).<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: By giving them a better pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels.....It’s a good spell line that really should be continued.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Agreed.  A heal spell at around 34th level, and another somewhere between 50 to 55.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Improved Invisibility.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Yeah!  It's kind of silly for some really high-level casters to have reliable invis but not others.<BR>   Also, I didn't keep records on this over the many months of playing EQ, but I'm pretty certain regular Invis is failing more frequently/sooner now than it has through most of EQ since commercial release.  Wassup with that?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: Two concerns here. The first is that it uses 4 components! That’s an awful lot of components to carry around.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Well, it only uses four cats eyes at levels 52 to 60.  For the rest of our lives, it requires less.  I'm currently using Phantom Plate (requiring three cats eyes) and find that two stacks of gems are enough to last between the times I'm forced to go sell at the vendors and bank my profits.  This issue is only a minor annoyance.  And, to the person who suggests a peridot is appropriate I rather disagree.  The cleric's Symbol line of spells uses a peridot at high levels, and our Phantom Armor line isn't a comparable buff.  My conclusion is the Live Team shouldn't divert resources into this that are better focused on tuning something truly important.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems logical that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also gives additional regen…&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Once again, the bias towards very high-legal characters is present in the posts here.  :-&gt;<BR>   Anyway, yes cleric/paladin/shaman/druid/ranger armor class buffs will overwrite the mage's self-only Phantom Armor buffs and this should be changed.  The Phantom Armor is truly valued by any mage familiar with the fact that it includes regen and its armor class is almost as good as the buff that overwrites it.  It is just salt in the wound when the cleric/shaman/paladin/druid/ranger doesn't require a reagent to overwrite your buff that you just consumed reagents for.  Doesn't sound balanced to me, heh.  Conclusion, this is a very important thing to fix.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Robe of Conjuration.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   "Please fix the uberloot."  Once again, I'm sure the uberhigh mages are right about this one, but it will never affect the majority of people playing magicians.  And will only affect the rest of us at the very ends of our time as mages.  My two coppers' is to make it summon a pet for no mana.  Which should be focused if mage is wielding a focus item.  It definitely should have a more valuable as well as more appropriate spell effect, but giving it a CotH or CotH2 would only make it a required piece of ubergear that groups would look for while excluding any mage without it.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pet Health Bars.<BR>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   I strongly agree with this being important.  It's also part of a broader issue:  pets should be treated as part of the group by bard songs and group spells, but are not.<BR>   I understand all to well the UI issues of how do you allocate the screen real estate for this, etc.  Rowyl has done an impressive job with fixing and improving client and interface issues, but I'm not sure this one can be resolved to everybody's satisfaction.<BR>   My humble suggestion occurred to me recently while clicking my /pet health report hotkey frequently.  Just have the pet's response ("I have 56% of my health, master" or some such) be changed to something that everyone hears in /groupsay?  or regular /say?  Couple that with a suggestion I've heard in the past which I really like, that is let the F2 through F6 keys that select group members toggle back and forth between each group member and their corresponding pet if they have one?  In other words, if the cleric would normally hit F4 to select me, he could do so and then hit F4 a second time to select my pet.  With /groupsay of pet health reports, and F-key selection for targeting group members' pets, I think this would go a long way to resolving what I consider a very important balancing issue.<BR>   And don't forget the broader related issue that is extremely important of making bard songs and group spells affect pets.  :-&gt;<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: There is no text message when summoning magician pets. Necromancers get a ‘rises from the dead’ emote. How about something for magician pets&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Sure, why not?  As long as it doesn't divert resources into this minor cosmetic issue and away from important balancing issues.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: Magician research is a little harsh compared to the others, with chain research and all. Perhaps this could be changed a bit.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   I already wrote above a couple of suggestions about this, under the 'spell drop rates' topic.  It is indeed a very important balancing issue.  Either eliminate the third component required for research recipes or make it a lot easier for non-magicians to recognize these components when they loot them.  I guess you could also greatly increase the prices vendors pay for them to discourage people from simply destroying them in the field.<BR>   Conclusion, this is a very important balancing issue and can fairly easily be fixed, although the fix probably wouldn't/shouldn't be subtle.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pet SoW.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   This is a very important balancing issue, and not just whining for freebie handouts from the Live Team either.  One of the bigger reasons groups mistrust even inviting a magician to begin with is that "pets always get lost".  One of the reasons pets get lost is that everyone in the group gets SoWed except pets and then take off running without a second thought.  This behavior is almost invariable.  Stupid, but unchangeable.  In a perfect Norrath, people would be smart to cast SoW on pets whenever they are SoWing the rest of the group, but for whatever obscure part of human nature is to blame, almost nobody ever does.  Just give the ability to mages.  Give a low-level version starting at 12th or 16th or 20th level, and one or two upgrades at later levels.  Make it shorter duration or higher mana cost or whatever if you are reluctant to "make it too easy" for mages, but mages who group with people who get SoW should be able to make their pets keep up with the group.  Also, it would be appropriate if bard songs like Selo's Accelerando affects pets.  This is an important balancing issue.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: It seems that these rings don’t always report the right number of charges left, often saying that there is one left when there are none.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   These rings ALWAYS say they have one charge left when they have none.  Always.  I'm surprised it made it past QA.  Especially for as long as it has.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Summoned Staves.<BR>DESCRIPTION: It might be nice if more of them were one-handed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   This worn-down nub of a enhancement request is all that is left of a very important balancing issue.  The real issue is that magician utility summons are almost valueless to Norrath and even most mages consider them of only limited value for their own personal use.  Sure, there is only one 1hand blunt that is summonable, and that isn't until level 44.  For that matter, there is only one 1hand slash, and that isn't until 29 (at least halfway through most mages' careers), and there aren't any 2hand slash at all.  On top of this, the stats on these weapons are too weak to be able to interest anybody in taking them.  Only pets.  The only utility summons that can be even faintly construed to be "popular" are coldstones, arrows, 1hand slash or 1hand blunt for pets only (available at higher levels only) and the occasional levitate ring.  Oh, the 1hand blunt is moderately popular for distributing on big raids in case of emergency, like mass rezzing casualties.  But again, that's high level.  And waterstones for people raiding Kedge or farming fishbone earrings.  Nobody wants summoned food, drink, bags, throwing daggers, spears, blah, blah, blah, ad nauseum.  Even a lot of mages don't want them and don't even bother to "waste the plat buying the spell".  There isn't any armor that can be summoned either.  The basic problem is twofold.  First, stats on weapons just are too anemic for the levels the summoning spell becomes available (with the possible exception of the 8 dmg and 26 delay on the 44th-level mod rod summons).  Second, people don't want to rely on summoned food, drink, containers, weapons, etc. that could poof out of existence subject to the vagaries of network and server latency.  It's kind of the ultimate extreme that summoning a bag full of food, drink, and bandages is considered a very high-level spell.  You literally cannot GIVE AWAY this stuff 99% of the time even you try hard.<BR>   Some suggested changes to utility summons.<BR>-Create a fairly complete complement of all types of 1hand and 2hand weapons at most spell ranks.<BR>-Improve the dmg/delay stats on these weapons by about 20%.  Probably include more procing weapons.  Summoned arrows are particularly poor stats right now.<BR>-See if it is feasible to make summoned weapons transform from droppable to No Drop once the summoner hands them to someone else.  Perhaps by summoning a weapon with one charge of "Summoned Weapon X".  Example, a summoned sword with one charge of "Sword of Runes" and the actual Sword of Runes is No Drop.  Then summoned weapons could be significantly more effective without becoming overbalanced in game power.<BR>-Make sure that more boring utility summons like food and drink become more attractive in groups.  Not everything has to be No Rent.  For instance, a summoned Horn of Plenty could have three charges of Cornucopia (summons a stack of food) and not be No Rent.  Relying on it as a food source even when in fear of link death now becomes practical.<BR>-More summoned items with charges or spells of Invis, See Invis, Fire Shield, etc.<BR>-Introduce either summoned armor or summoned items with one to five charges of armor buffs.  The Phantom Leather/Chain/Plate/Armor series would be well suited to this.<BR>-Do NOT give other classes armor or other gear that lets them summon things that are more properly "defining abilities" of magicians.  Even wield the dread nerf bat in some cases.<BR>   Conclusion.  It is a very important issue to make utility summons more balanced by making them more desirable.  It is a "defining ability" of the mage class even more than pets are, and it has been little more than useless for the last two years.  Magicians are very unpopular when trying to find groups, and this single issue and/or pet enhancements and fixes can and should be implemented to reverse this situation.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Shard of the Core.<BR>DESCRIPTION: How about letting the item summoned by this spell be equipable in the ranged slot, like the Coldstones and Heatstones.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Duh.  As others have already pointed out, it is already equippable in the Range slot, and only in the Range slot.  The item is a piece of junk anyway.  The presumed intent was to give an upgrade to the 16th- and 29th level heatstones and coldstones, respectively.  Those stones are equippable in the Neck slot but most importantly in the Ammo slot.  Replace Shard of the Core with an upgrade to coldstones that is equippable in the Ammo slot and some other (probably Neck) slot.  The upgrade probably should include ultravision effect just as coldstones give.  I suggest also resistances to magick/fire/cold/poison/disease, however if Meraxes' statement is correct that stat buffs don't work in the ammo slot then something else will have to be worked out.  Or perhaps make Shard of the Core be a dagger weapon as many people initially speculated it would be and have effect ultravision plus resistance buffs. Maybe even an int/wis buff?  The thing is No Rent after all.  Oh, and it definitely shouldn't be No Drop, what's the sense of that?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Aegis of Ro......STATUS: Spell scroll was never created. It is now dropping. Item fixed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Wow.  That's kind of a big oops there, folks.  Oh well, we're all human.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of Sword of Runes) it should now be possible to add new proc’ing summoned weapons for Magicians.<BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   Ummmm, guys?  Which future is this idea?  This balancing is being billed to us players as the last and final balancing that the classes will ever get!<BR>   Conclusion, I've already said at length above that improving the quality and selection of summoned weapons is a very important and necessary balancing change.<P>A couple of things that Alan/Absor didn't post that I think are very important.<P>   Level 12 balance problem.  There are a couple of great big holes in the list of bolt/DD spells that magicians get at each spell rank, especially at 12th level, magicians are woefully inadequate compared to wizards' or druids' nuke spells.<BR>   At level 16, mages get a DD spell that does 91 damage, but prior to that they just have to limp all the way from 8th level up with a nuke that is good for only 41 to 47 points of damage.  And that's a bolt spell, inherently less reliable because it depends on line of sight.  Mages get no DD or bolt at 12, but wizards get a DD doing 78 to 83 dmg--almost twice the damage mages can muster.<BR>   At almost every spell rank, mage nukes do roughly 80% to 90% of the wizard nukes from the same spell rank.  The lack of a bolt or DD mage spell at 12 seems to be a glaring oversight.  Maybe the original idea was that a rain spell at 12 would do the job, but in practice it hasn't worked out that way.  Mages do get a 12th-level rain spell, but even if the proposed fixes to rain spells are implemented, this falls well short of appropriately matching wizard and druid nukes.  Just as importantly, it makes mages too underpowered to either solo or get invited into groups from roughly 11th level until they reach 16th.<BR>   Mages get both a DD and a bolt spell at 8, then nothing until 16.  I would suggest deleting either the DD or the bolt spell at level 8, and adding it to level 12.  A level 12 DD should do roughly 65 dmg, or a level 12 bolt should do roughly 79 to 85 dmg.<BR>   There is a similar gap at level 39, but not nearly as severe.  Here is the comparison<P>34 Wizard:  nukes for 306 to 320<BR>34 Mage:  bolts for 319 to 33 or DDs for 276 to 295<P>39 Wizard:  nukes for 381 to 405<BR>39 Mage:  still relies on bolt spell for 333 dmg or Dd for 295<P>44 Wizard:  nukes for 606 to 625<BR>44 Mage:  nukes for 580 to 600<P><BR>PETS<BR>   Mages should probably get a pet spell at first level.  Necros, the other pet class, get first level pets.<BR>   At levels 4 through 8, and maybe even 12, the levels of summoned pets are pretty competitive with the mobs hunted.  Except that at the last level before gaining a new spell rank, the existing pets are noticeably anemic and lacking in usefulness.  So, an 11th-level mage is still using a pet from an 8th-level spell, and those pets don't keep up very well.  That last level before a new spell rank is tough all the way from 3 through 48, but worst in the younger seasons.<BR>   At level 34, mage pets suddenly start becoming dramatically more in line with the mage's own level of power.  But ONLY if the mage is using the appropriate focus item, of which there are four.  The quests for these focus items are kinda tough for a new level 34 mage to have completed, by the way.<BR>   With the new relative power of 34th- through 49th-level pets, mages have a more realistic shot at soloing than they did when they were younger.  I am going to talk about soloing for a minute, but only because soloing power is a very good measuring stick of power in a group, in this regard.  Younger mages who solo aren't being very smart, IMHO.  Their pets just aren't good enough.  At 34 through 49, it's feasible as long as you have the pet focus items, keep SoW going through purchased potions or whatever, and try to get Clarity whenever possible.  Even then, soloing mages will still die pretty frequently.  Even played by very smart and skilled players with all the jboots and Clarity in the world.  Lacking snare/root/fear spells, a soloing mage is always leading a very risky life.<BR>   Earth pets should snare instead of root.  Or at least change their root spell to include significant damage, or give them more hit points, or something.<BR>   Pets almost never take the hits from a mob and leave the group's tanks to take the entire beating.  Even when the tanks don't taunt and the pets do.  I think this was unintentional, and the game design is expecting pets to taunt more effectively than they do.  Certainly, groups would be much more interested in inviting mages if the pets could be counted on soak off some of the damage from the tanks--thus saving healing mana and downtime.  Pets in general are truly awful at taunting.  It appears the biggest reason for this is that they always melee from the maximum distance they can be from a mob and still melee it.  It's obvious that when mobs calculate who they most hate right now, distance is part of the calculation.  If pets were to move to minimum melee distance for whichever weapon they are equipping, their taunt factor would be increased.  Or, you could use brute force to improve pet taunt factors by increasing a number in a database.<BR>   Conclusions.  Pet taunting needs to be fixed/enhanced.  Pets prior to 34 aren't quite powerful enough.  34 to 49 pets are adequately powered, but only if the mage has quested for the necessary focus items.  There are various issues with 50 to 60 pets that other posters cover with more knowledge than mine.<P>CALL OF THE HERO<BR>   This spell is inappropriately biased to the very highest levels.  Levels that the vast majority of players will probably never achieve.  It isn't a powerful a spell, and needn't be such rare reward.  It really should be thought of as a "defining ability" of the magician class.<BR>   I suggest giving a much weaker version of this spell at a much lower level, and giving occasional upgrades every two to four spell ranks.  Perhaps start with a 12th-level CotH that has a range of 150 feet and casting time and mana cost that make it feasible in combat.  Used creatively and with skill, this could save the lives of tanks and also cut down on the number of runaway trains in many zones.  At 25 or 29, an upgrade with a range of 500 feet or so.  At 39, an upgrade with a range of anywhere in the same zone.  At 49, any zone on the same continent.  At 55 or 56, any zone in the world.  Possibly at 59 or 60, even the planes.  Only the most fearful designer would argue that this is an overpowering capability....but even their arguments should be satisfied when we remind people that CotH requires that the 'Hero' be grouped with the magician FIRST, before anything.<P>  Enough?  Trust me, I'm more tired of writing this than you are of reading it.  :-&gt;<P>   Still, we need a quick recap.<BR>-Give mages an appropriate 12th-level nuke spell<BR>-Changing graphics and other cosmetics should be a backburner priority.<BR>-The class' defining abilities are utility summons and pets, and also CotH.  Utility summons desperately need improvement in a variety of ways.  Pets need some minor tuning.  CotH should be expanded quite a bit.  Other classes should not be getting utility summons attached to their gear.<BR>-Check for No Rent upon log-in not upon log-out.  Have a 60-minute grace period (not 30-minute).  You could make it 120-minute and not unbalance anything but actually achieve humane treatment of the people behind the magician characters.<BR>-Spell drops and research requirements are too harsh and should be eased.<BR>-Area effect spells are resisted too much and should affect all mobs (but not pets) within their area, regardless of how many.  Or perhaps much higher resist for the pets and much lower for the mobs.<BR>-Area effect spells should not break mez.<BR>-DoTs are not necessary.<BR>-One or two spells should be added to the pet heal line.<BR>-Mages should be able to SoW their own pets.<BR>-Bard songs and group spells should affect pets.<BR>-Pets' health status should be easily available to group members, and healers should be able to target pets as easily as they target the other group members.<BR>-Many people have noted that pets should be able to be temporarily "muzzled" so that they aren't a threat for constantly breaking an enchanter's mezz.  The /pet back off command is extremely inadequate for this purpose.<BR>-Others have posted that uberhigh level magicians should be getting some kind of mana-regeneration enhancement.<BR>-Mobs at higher levels and Velious resist spells too much.  (I know, that's a different thread.  :-)<P>This is two years' of accumulated thought and about two hours' of writing.  Thanks for reading, but most important thanks for taking what you read to heart (please).<P>--talan<P>PS At least one of my suggestions will slightly loosen the stranglehold that enchanters are getting on how the game is played.  If area effects don't break mezzes, that would be all to the good.  I think the present game is very dominated by one hunting tactic that's dependent on enchanter in each group for mezzing.  This trend is worsening in an even more unhealthy direction for EQ overall.  Many classes in the game are actively being prevented from doing a lot of the things they're capable of in a hunting group, because it makes the enchanter's crowd control job too complicated.  Area effects and pets are two threats to the enchanter-based system of hunting that has squeezed the life out of everything else.  EQ needs more choice and variety.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello again<P>I also thing that Cal of the Hero should be reduced from lev 54 to lev 50 or 51 ..as the new mage defining spells, its a shame that you have to make it through half your post 50 life to get it. Its also a group friendly spell and since EQ wants to promote more grouping, this would be one way to do it.<P>The current post 50 summonings (save muzzle) can likely be dropped by 10 or 20 spell levels ...they 50+ summonings are hardly 50+ quality spells.<P>More summomings in general would be good,as the current summoned weapons have been outgrown by the huge amount of high lev gear on most every character...honestly, who needs a spear with +5 heat/cold resists. Ive shouted  offers for free summoned staves in the newbie area of Nektulos...no takers, not even for the lev 39 stave. Its a shame when lev 1's dont want the chance for lev 39 spells/abilities. My suggestion would have more summoned items with clickable effects (like mod rod or lev rings)<P><BR>Hope this helps<BR>Thanks<BR>Czzarre</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Add:<P>Modulating rods become increasingly less useful post 55. Their mana transfer is just not very large given some of the huge mana-hogging spells cast that these levels. Having improved modulating rods (better health-mana conversion) post 55 would help us be a bit more group-friendly at a time when our solo careers are essentially over. An upgrade would make this unique and useful item more worthwhile post 55.<P>Add:<P>Improve velious spell drops. I've given up trying to get them. Way to rare and hard to find. I'll just go without they are not worth the trouble.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   Oh yeah, I forgot about the Ward Summoned line of spells.  From the game-balance point of view, and also from the role-playing point of view, it doesn't make sense that druids get these well spells before mages do.  Most people would agree that pre-50 druids are far more powerful than mages as well as having a much easier time finding groups.  And magicians are supposed to be the masters of summoned things, so why do druids (the masters of nature/outdoors things) get a distinct advantage here?<P>   Yes, the mana efficiency or the total damage of the mage versions of these spells needs to be improved some.  By about 20%.  Right now, each spell in the Ward Summoned line is so comparable to the main DD spell that mages already have at that level, it just doesn't make sense for a mage to waste one of his/her eight spell gems on an extra, situational, antisummoned DD that is virtually identical in total dmg, casting time, and mana ratio to a regular DD.  Even when hunting an area dense with summoned critters, I just mem regular DD and bolt spells.<P>-talan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   I want to make sure that an idea prevalent from Alan's/Absor's previous Mage Talk thread is firmly put to rest in Verant's mind.  The idea that mages are balanced well in comparison to other classes throughout most (or even any) of our careers.<P>   It just isn't true.  Need I say Druid, Cleric, Enchanter, or Necromancer here?  Notice that mages have to compete pretty directly with both druids and necromancers for a role in somebody's group.<P>Quoting Alan/Absor from his last Mage Talk post:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome. &lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>   It's almost the opposite, and especially in all dungeons.  Because of their pets, mages are unwelcome enough in most groups that even the best and most popular players can be reduced to spending 30 to 90 minutes shouting for a group in even well populated dungeons.  Mages will never compete effectively a slot until pets are made considerably more welcome combined with enchanter mezzes, have pathing problems dealt with, and are made attractive otherwise to groups by some kind of buffing ability besides the fire shields that are too short duration, cost too much mana, and do insufficient damage.<P>   Discussing the pre=50 game here.  Until the higher levels, necros are almost always preferred because their pet is widely perceived to be actually more effective than a mage pet, plus they have the valuable snare capability, plus Fear for emergency situations.  Druids actually have the same or slightly better nuking ability as mages throughout most of their careers, can acts as the group healer just as well as a cleric pre-30, have valuable strength and armor class buffs, have a damage shield 95% as powerful as a mage's but longer duration, valuable Snare (as well as Root), regeneration buffs, group evac for battle emergencies as well as making profits from others, and the single most important spell in the game is still SoW because it saves so many lives.  Magicians cannot compete.  Wizards and mages compete about on a par with each other, except that mage pets and their reputed unpredictability, especially in dungeons, put mages at a disadvantage.  Until pets lose their reputations for unpredictability and uncontrollably breaking chanters' mezzes, and the 'class-defining abilities' of mages can compete on a par with druids, etc. "because of their pets, they are..." still going to be UNwelcome enough in any group.<P>   Reduce the mana cost of fire shields to about 60% to 75% of current costs, and/or triple their duration.  Make sure that mage fire shields do at least 20% greater damage than druid damage shields.<P>   Give individuals in groups a selfish reason for wanting to invite a mage.  An obvious buff that each group member can benefit from.  I suggest summoned items with two charges of the Phantom Armor series of spells, and change Phantom Armor to stack with other buffs.  The tiny AC buff is welcome, but the Regeneration component of Phantom Armor would be even more welcome.  This would be a start to competing evenly with other classes for a group invite.  Mages would still lack emergency-type spells, or any speed-restricting spells like Snare, but it would be a start.<P>   Transform the current list of utility summons that mages get into something that has value to others, instead of their nearly-complete valuelessness they have now.<P>   Make pets more reliable and less in conflict with enchanters.  Someone's suggestion of /pet back off causing the pet to just not attack for 10 seconds would help, but isn't quite sufficient.  Because the pet would still wait 10 seconds then attack the now-mezzed mob it was backed off from.  Make it so that once a pet is backed off, that clears its hate list like a memory blur would.  Or it will now treat a mezzed mob with the response of "That is not a legal target, master."<P>   If pets get more than ten or twenty feet away from their owners, make them say "Where are you, master?" for everyone to hear.<P>   Make pets report their health to the entire group, and group healers able to easily target pets for heals.<P>--talan (yeah, me again  :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The one cosmetic change I really would like to see.  This affects all pet classes.<P>When the magician gives a pet command, and the magician is female, Jebeker should respond, "Guarding with my life, mistress."  Or maybe, "Guarding with my life, milady."<P>Currently pets always address their owners as male, regardless of the actual gender of the owner.  All players now have the capability for macro scripts to determine target's gender and use the appropriate pronoun, so this shouldn't be too hard at all to implement for pets.<P>:-)<P>--talan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>At the very least could you make it so /pet attack places the targeted mob permenantly at the top of the pet's hate list.<P>I suppose it makes some little sense that warrior mobs can taunt pets off the enemy casters, but I think we sacrifice enough pet power to make up for this AI disadvantage.<P>Absor, while your list is a good one, it missed a lot of concerns in the magician talk thread.  Not all of them were 'gimme' requests.  Some issues, such as the scaling of pet power, had been discussed with Abashi.  He did not address farming our class abilities on items.  He did not address any concerns with the post 50 summoning spells.<P>He did not even mention pet control.  Whether or not magicians get a /pet no attack or a /pet only attack THAT mob command isn't the issue.  I highly doubt that magicians in the high level game would suddenly become overpowered because they got a couple more pet commands.<P>As for my take on pet commands, I think that at some level 40-50 magicians should get a command to completely stop pet agro for 10 or 20 seconds, and a command that places the targeted mob permanently at the top of the pet's hate list.<P>Yes, pet control is the challenge of the magician class.  However sometimes, and far too often in my opinion, the only option is to kill the pet and summon another.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000776&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000776&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
