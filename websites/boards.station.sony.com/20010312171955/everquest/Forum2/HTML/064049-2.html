</FONT><HR>This guy is so right on the money it's scary. A Council 0f Fourteen. A most excellent idea! How about something like this as opposed to the "lets implement this because it's what WE think is best for the players". The players know what is best for us. You most assuredly do not. As I have said over and over again and will continue to say....it's all about the "fun factor". You are making this game less fun all the time VI.

</FONT><HR>Bravo! Wonderful post. Well thought out and brilliant. (Don't mind the trolls, spewers and flamers who seem to come out of the woodwork...they've ruined their own lands...)<P>To expand on your post, I think Absor can't possible represent all of the classes here and he most certainly can't represent us 300,000 plus players properly to Verant.<P>We need a "Council of Norrath", an advisory board of 14 players each representing one of the 14 classes. Verant could set up a mechanism where players could be nominated on a special EQ msg board and each class would get to elect a representative. Terms of office could be for 3 months at a time. The council could meet on a private IRC channel once a month and present the concerns of the class they represent to the live/dev team during the session.<P>Frankly, using Verant employees to represent players would never work because as we have seen on this very board the current player rep. Absor is unnaccountable to the players and is in a conflict of interest because he works for Verant/Sony. He has no choice but to relay the Verant corporate line to all of us. Verant pays his salary--what else can we expect? He who pays the piper calls the tune.<P>Until Verant/Sony decides to implement a player elected council the current system will remain a sham and the players will feel like they have no voice. Currently they have no problem getting volunteers to do the bulk of their customer service in the guide program, so I don't forsee any problem with the creation of a player elected "Council of Norrath".<P>Brad, Abashi, et al, you want to get some real credibility with the players? Then dare to implement this and bring a hint of democracy to the dictatorship you call Norrath. If you don't do it, your competitors most certainly will. One visionary game designer Raph Koster (one of your employees) has already drafted a document called "Declaring The Rights Of Players". I'm sure he would agree that this would be a step in the right direction.<P>http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/playerrights.html<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings, Euro!<P>Loved the post; very well thought out, excellent structure, laced with a multitude of salient points and wisdom gleaned from real "in-game" experience...<P>...Verant will NEVER respond to it.<P>I recently wrote a very similar post to the one you provided, located at &lt;http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062643-2.html&gt;. While not nearly as polished as your posting, it had many of the same elememnts as yours - asking for two way communication with The Powers That Be at Verant, advising them that ignoring their customer base was a Very Bad Thing(tm), etc. It languished on the sever for four days, waiting for the tender attention of a Verant 'Blue-Name', before I abandoned it.<P>My post was not the first of its kind. As evidenced by your brilliant missive, it wasn't the last of it's kind, either. However, I strongly believe that your post is doomed to suffer the same fate that mind did, the same fate that virtually all the others like it before have; it will be studiously ignored by those for whom it was intended.<P>Verant chooses very carefully which posts its representitives respond to. Usually, the responses are limited to zippy one-liners or gushing approval for a post in which the author expresses exactly a viewpoint that Verant shares (check out the thread at &lt;http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063132.html&gt;, where the original author makes the premise that Verant should never have put these very boards into operation, and Brad is the very first person out of the gate to respond to it). <P>Now, Verant has stated that they will not respond to any post that contains vulgar or abusive language, makes personal attacks ('flames', 'trolls', et al), is 'bumped', etc. However, in practice, Verant will ALSO never respond to a thoughtful, insightful, logical post which contains NONE of the offensive material that is so troubling to Verant's delicate sensibilities but which happens to run contrary to their own interests or conduct, as it currently exists at the time of the posting. If your post casts Verant in an unflattering light in ANY way, you can expect it to be treated like it is a buzzing, ripe pile of slaughterhouse refuse.<P>Is your post 'civilized'? You bet. Is your post legitimate? Absolutely. Does your post make logical points? Of course it does. Should Verant take the time to answer it? Without a doubt...<P>...will Verant respond to it in an open forum in any meaningful way? The answer lies somewhere between '*extremely* doubtful' and 'no chance in all of creation'. I'd love to be proved wrong; I'd love to have to eat my words - but Verant, unfortunately, just does not operate that way. This viewpoint isn't based on angry supposition; this belief is based on the actions (and inactions!) over a long length of time on the part of The Powers That Be at Verant.<P>I applaud your attempt and your delivery, and I feel your pain when you realize that an answer given in the spirit in which you wrote your post will not be forthcoming.<P>Best wishes - </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is truly a great post.  However, if you've ever studied 'group think' in psychology...  I think there's a lot of that going on at Verant these days.  They'll probably just glaze over this post, or focus on an entirely irrelevant part like one of the posters did about the account sharing in guilds.  I really don't think they want to face the effort it would take to make the game GREAT, which is a shame, because its got such a wonderful foundation.  Oh well, as always I invite them to prove me wrong!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some folks were looking for a "reader's digest" version of my rather long post.<P>It really boils down to my hypothesis that there are currently significant issues with the game ranging from class balance to epic items.  I futher hypothesized that most, if not all, of these issues could have been avoided if Verant invsted in a structured and vibrant discussion with its customers.<P>Specific recommendations were:<BR>1) Verant employed, class specific, advocates whose mission is to truly understand the wants and needs of their advocacy group.<BR>2) Such advocates are either members of, or have significant input to, the tuning team.<BR>3) All issues managed by advocates are communicated and over-communicated to the interested community via class specific, verant managed, web pages.<BR>4) Time lines for resolution to issues are published and any slippage communicated in a timely manner.<P>Thats the best digest version i can do.  There are some other reasonable useful datapoints in the orginal post; if, or when, you have the inclination, give it a read.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a great, well thought out post.  Considerate too.  Sadly, as I read it, I knew it wouldn't be answered.  My view on these boards is very jaded.  I used to post like this, and know what?  Verant ignores thoughtful, intelligent posts.  After seeing this go on for a long time, I have come to the conclusion that VI only has these boards here as a diversion, a place for people to scream and whine.  They only pay atention to the troublemakers and the ones who cry the loudest.  Any sort of reason is ignored.<P>I agree with you 100%, and I'm sad that neither of our opinions will ever make a difference in this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, maybe what i'm about to say is only obvious to me and is not what is really going on at verant but i'll say it anyways.<P>EuroEQ, what you are suggesting is wonderfull and should go by itself. Unfortunatly, Verant now belongs to Sony blah blagh blah inc. and I belive they have absolutly no control on what they do anymore. They have been reduced to the level of the middle man whos only job is to tell the lower guy what the upper guy wants and pretend its his idea in case is doesnt work.<P>In short, what I belive the senario is, is there is Sony blah blah blah inc. who hired some specialist to lay down the lines for what the game should be in order to bring in the big bucks (or maybe they have their own resident specialist). So this guy issues a memo to the verant team telling them what to do PERIOD. All the workers at verant has received strict instructions as to what they can and cant say or do. If they dont follow the guid lines they lose their job. If the project drops for some reason Sony is not going to bend down and ask the costumer what happened, they are going to fire the specialist, close the project and start on something new. Trying to salvage project is way more expensive than its worth. Sony does not trust Verant to make the game succesfull, they dont want some programmers playing around with their money risking it when they can have their own "trust worthy" guy make the decisions for them.<P>To recap, we are talking to the middle man, no wonder we do not get results...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great post.<P>Little fact here - I started playing a rogue a while back when the original necromancer got a bit tiring. So, untwinked, I walked into the new dawn. Occasionally, a high level player would swoop down, to say hi, chat a bit with one of the rare newbies not wearing at least mid-level gear, and check if I had an alt. This could go 2 ways.<P>Überplayer: So, you have an alt?<BR>Measanoob: One or two higher levels, but this seems most fun.<BR>Überplayer: Great, here, have a large amount of platinum, a good piercing weapon and some 40+ buffs.<P>Or...<P>Überplayer: So, you have an alt?<BR>Measanoob: Yep, a necro is my main, but this is most fun.<BR>Überplayer: OK, cya then.<P>Oh the difference, the difference to me...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That time is now up and has been for some time. I haven't played in over 2 weeks (2 days was unheard of for me) and find myself looking for a reason to come back but just seeing more reasons not to.<P>Asherons Call was a fairly poor attempt but they have a much better record of listening and especially not falling into the "mudwimping" slump that EQ is in. I can't post a link to the mudwimping article here because they'd delete the thread, if you haven't read it then use a search engine and find it.

</FONT><HR>One variation on the idea would be for "Members of council" to play several different classes so that they're familar with what makes that class unique. For example, somewhat might represent the "healer" classes; playing cleric, shaman and druid. Ideally, they'd strive to keep all of these classes unique and useful. Same with casters, melees, and hybrids. Might not be a bad idea for them to also play at least one chatacter outside their speciality. Offhand, I'd think they'd be able to find a couple of high-quality folks willing to do this for fairly minimal wages (heck, some of those dot-com millionares who were smart enough to cash in their stock options before the market tanked &lt;grin&gt; ).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its nothing to do with necros or the other things that illustrate the points being made, its about listening and communicating.<P>David Allen has spent the last 2 years doing both those things at Horizons, Origin have also done so at Ultima Online, other games are in beta now and you bet their designers are listening to their testers. The really puzzling thing is that its not really hard to do, especially now Gordon "Vision" Wrinn has handed over the boards to Absor who is at least making an attempt to do it.
