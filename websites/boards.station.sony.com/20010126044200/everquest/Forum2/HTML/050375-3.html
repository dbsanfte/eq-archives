</FONT><HR>Airtreader:  Just keep with the "put-downs" by claiming I'm like Cochran.  I'm not.  I'm not near as good a lawyer as he is.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  Sad how you think it's necessary to keep throwing that crap in there, in order to try and drum up support from the legions that hate lawyers.  Typical of your style.<P>As for the Shaman debate, why do you assert I wasn't there?  Do you have any basis for that?  Answer:  No.  I've been around these boards for a very long time.  At no time did Verant claim you folks were fools or liars.  They believed you to be mistaken on certain things, and disagreed with other subjective points.  You can make the immature leap that disagreement is always pejorative, but you'd be wrong to do so.<P>And what "facts" do you claim I don't have right?  The only "fact" I've mentioned is that no one ever called you a fool or a liar.  That is correct.  You can spin it as much as you like, but it will still point in the same direction.<P>BloodSage:  Amen brother.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aduro:<P>Did I get murdered every time I logged in to UO?  You bet I did.  I think I had, oh, maybe half a dozen sessions in six months where I wasn't killed and robbed at least once.  It happened in the country side.  It happened in dungeons.  I was robbed in cities.  I was blown up by traps in the country.  <P>I ended up wandering around in the rattiest junk armour I could find, and still people would kill me for my reagents.  The only way to survive would have been to form bigger gangs to fight the PvP gangs.  It sucked.  <P>I was there right through all the "karma" changes they implemented (in fact, I was part of the original discussion thread that prompted the karma additions).  And then the PvP players just switched over to having buddies in their gangs who never murdered ("mules" some people might call them) who could go into town and buy/bank for them.  <P>I don't doubt that someone will invent a PvP mechanism that works (for me) one day.  To me, it basically needs to be an opt in mechanism.  The Duel approach is as close as I've seen thus far.<P>But, make no bones about it, Raph knows his stuff  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  He just has a blind spot when it comes to self-policing on line communities: he actually thinks they can work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune as a customer I appreciate your "attempt" to be candid with your customers.<P>That said I have to disagree with you about costs.<P>If your buisness plan was based around the idea of a continually paying customer than a formula could be derived from expected costs/projected sales.<P>Ill illustrate.<P>If it costs 10 million dollars to "develop" a product and I expect to sell 100,000 units then the cost per box is 10 million/100K or $100 dollars per unit.<P>See how easy it is.  However if you sold Everquest for $100 a unit you could imagine how what would have happend.  Less units sold.  HOWEVER this could be a baseline and most definatly modified as production costs were more determined.  I am betting it didnt cost 10 million to make EQ but I will stay with that number.  Aradune, feel free to use "real" numbers instead of browbeating around the details like some politician.<P>As for operating expenses I agree with everything you mentioned but again your costs are either very inflated or you dont have a "dealmaker" in your company.<P>Lets start with Bandwith.<BR>The addage is the more you buy, the less per unit it is going to cost.  So if you were calculating your expenses for bandwith on TOTAL active subscribers units, you would be expecting 1k x 335k or 335mb of bandwith.  Ever heard of a gigaswitch?   I think they have units that do upto 100gbps so if you kept upto date thats 4 units needed, if you wanted to have enough bandwith for ALL players playing at the same time.  Your peak numbers dont support this. Approx 65k players out of your 335k play during "peak" times.  So Bandwith can be solved with a mere 1 gigbit solution.  Cost 50k for unit and installation (not reoccurring so in your 10million deleopment cost).  10k for an OC3 connection (per month:45mb bandwith) the acutal bandwith of 1gb to a provider 30k (rounded up).<P>So 30-40k per month of Bandwith not bad when your pulling in over 3 million a month.<P>Of course there are personel but if you have 100 people involved (thats HW techs, SW techs and CS support) all making an average of 50k a year thats ONLY 400k a month.<P>Your hardware maintenance shouldnt be that hefty either but lets just go with 50k a month.<P>So a little math here<BR>50K for bandwith (inflated)<BR>400k for people (prob real close per 100people on the project)<BR>50k for HW maint.<P>500k a month and you rake in 3 mil and complain your profit margin is low?  Please who are you kidding?  Anyone with an inkling in this buisness knows you are making great money, and you should, you made a great product that should last quite a time but dont try to say your not making money or not making "good" money. You are. We know it, you know it (mabie your in denial I dont know)<P>as for the original 10 mil in costs even if you took a loss at 100 per unit base, you intially sold it for 40 bucks a unit expecting a loss but sold WAY more than 100k in the first 6 months I believe you were over the 250k unit mark which equals  TADA 10 mil.  So you are making profit.<P>You know all this talk about profit reminds me of that underpants gnomes episode in Southpark.<P>Step 1. Collect Underpants (build EQ)<P>Step 2.                    (deny profitability)<P>Step 3. Collect Profit     (still deny profitability and sell company to big corporation i.e. Sony)<P>I love you all!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Glad to hear that the rumors were wrong on the *one* point, but you still have never bothered to share the unique numbers.<P>If you're insinuating that a sizable portion of the EQ player base has multiple accounts, you're way off base. Multiple accounts are a thing that only extreme hardcore players have. (These are the same types of players that tend to frequent message boards, giving the illusion that a greater portion of the playerbase has multiple accounts than actually do)<P>The numbers of EQ may not be readily available, but they would probably be similar to EA's numbers for Ultima Online. G.Bob from EA recently stated only 2%-5% of the player base had more than one account, and this was after their "buy a second account" promotion. (That figure came off the top of my head and may not be exact, but the point is that the percent is EXTREMELY low)<P>-----------------<BR>Drysart<BR>www.evercrest.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having some experience working on an ORPG, which could've grown to MMORPG status but got stuck at MORG, had the producing company not bailed out in the last phase, I can't help but agree with the most of original post.<P>Considering the producing company -did- bail out, we were left with relatively high debts, and an unfunded and unfinished product. Instead of giving up (as so many companies have in the past), we looked for alternatives, and found a place to host the game. Sadly enough, most of the team decided to resign from the project, and to work for -money- instead of the -possibility- of monetary compensation for time. Which is only natural.<P>We managed to finish the game and release it, and run it without too much problems. That was, until we had to create bugfixes and patches. Lacking programmers, there was only one option left to us. It's the same option we're still using after two and a half years, with moderate success. The entire team; GMs, DEV, Support, you name it... All dedicated volunteers.<P>The money which is generated with the game (subscription fee of approximately $10/month), almost all goes into bandwidth and periodic maintenance. Anything that's left is saved for emergencies.<P>So, games can be run for a relatively low cost. The people involved are enormously motivated and passionate, often pouring more time into game related issues than into their jobs. You'll find extremely talented DBA's, sysadmins, engineers, artists, (network-)programmers and testers who are willing to help out, and who continue to make such a game a success. All because they care for the game.<P>However, because there's no "leftover" money, it's increasingly hard to compete with the "eye candy" games, where there's funding in abundance, where one nifty 3D engine after another is created, and where the most fantastic game concepts are thought up. <P>People seem to forget that a lot of money also goes into upgrading a game, or into creating a new game.. and it's that aspect that's lacking with companies which manage to release and host a game despite funding, and with companies which fail to release a game alltogether. Not because they don't want to, but simply because the funds run out for whatever reason.<P>-M<BR>(Wonder if I stayed on topic  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL....   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Some people are just plainly.... Imature.<P>1st.  This is a "GAME"... yup...  a "GAME".<BR>2nd.  No one forces us to pay $10, it's our decision.<BR>3rd.  $10 a month is a darn good price, same as UO and AC and also will be the same as others to come.<P>Those whining that AC doesn't not charge for add-on's...  THINK!  Who's behind AC...  Who ?  Microsoft...   Microsoft wants to Annihilate competition everywhere they can...  Cut-throat company...  They've got more money then God and Knows it.<P>And if Verant is reading this in any way...  Please do BAN those that are no longuer players, and come here to just bring out Negatism.  If they don't want to Play EQ, fine...  If all they want to do is Bash Verant and EQ...  Fine, but make them do it ELSEWHERE.<P>I had a problem at first with the $10 a month... but it took me 2 weeks to figure out how much it was worth the investment... hehe  Now that it has callmed down (And my wife has been battling over the computer and won)...  I'm playing less than 10 hours a week...  well.... probably 15 hours since Christmas...  Had to find out something else to do.  And even though I'm not "As" hooked in EQ as I was a few months back, I still think this is a great game and worth $10 a month... even if it end's up costing me 50 Cents an hour cause I turned out to be VERY Casual.  No game has kept me this long considering the amount of time I put in originally.<P>Great job guys...  I do voice my opinion when Verant's in the wrong and I believe so... but in general...  They are no Worse or Better than what was there or what is to come as Support goes.  People will realize when there are 10 companies out there with games like EQ... that all of them will have the same issues.  Hey...  I worked in Support for Microsoft and Lotus...  And as support went back then...  It wasn't who was best... it was who Sucked less...   And I worked with Very smart people...  Customer get more and more demanding, and don't understand that Support CAN'T hold your hand forever and fix EVERYTHING.<P>Oh well...  I can't wait for the Competition to come. Not because I want Verant to get hurt... but because I want the Whiners and Complainers to go elsewhere... and leave us alone...  And can't wait to have them come back (But they have too much pride for that... hehe) and say it's the same problem everywhere else....   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You'd have less kids as you say, cause parents won't pay the additional $5 for no extras.  Have those servers with population half of what the Regular servers are now...

I remember those days when you got an hourly charge for a MUD from those online services.  <P>I think flat monthly fees are the way to go.

It's one thing to plan on spending an hour to get where you want to go, it's another if you to do that knowing you're being charged by the minute to do it.<P>I pay $20 a month for my Internet access of which most of that time is spent playing EQ lately.

</FONT><HR>Hmmm. I keep hearing what a terrible company Verant is in the BB's , yet you people are still playing the game. As with any other industry, customer satifaction will decide if a particular buisness venture will will be a success or a failure. I mean, if you aren't getting what you are paying for, then you can stop paying, right? So, if you want to complain about why you are being ripped off because you aren't getting the customer service you paid for, then send a message every buisness person hears loud and clear: STOP PAYING. It's just a game. Sure, if you quit, your character will be deleted. Or maybe you can sell it on Ebay and recover your playing costs. HAHAHAHA.

</FONT><HR>I think the fault of the business model is making the payments MONTHLY. A person playing 10 hours a month is paying $1 per hour. A person playing 100 hours a month is paying on 10 cents per hour. And I know that some people play up to 500 hours a month for only 2 cents per hour. But their demands of expensive bandwith is the same PER HOUR. The guy playing 500 hours per month is using 50 times MORE bandwith than the guy playing only 10 hours. The guy playing less is thereby paying for the guy playing more.<P>I think that in a game in which you gain more rewards for every hour you are online, you should also be charged for every hour you are online. Not much, maybe 10 cents. But then the guy using less bandwith would also pay for less.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To the earlier post by Oxymoron,<BR> <BR>have you ever played a game by Lucasarts?? Try it some time , they are all crap. So i certainly wouldnt expect that everything their name is on is a good game, and all the problems with CS will be solved. You people amaze me. This is the newest genre of games there are, and if you look at it, it has to be a nightmare to run all of this smoothly.Why don't you people give them a break? How would you like to go to work, to have 500 whiney babys playing a game and crying when you don't get to them right away? It's always easy when you aren't the one doing it. I myself think they did a jam up job with this game, and they always have tried to fix things that were broken, or had problems. I mean YOU are one person, get over it if they dont drop the servers down and fix it everytime you have a problem. Because I would be mad then and another 55,000 would be.<BR>TTraveller</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Garrethe, <BR>You're kidding right?<BR>hahahahahahah<BR>THAT is what insurance companies do, take your money and screw you when you have an accident and need them. Cannot tell you how many friends, relatives, etc., who have been dropped like a bad habit by the ins. company after an accident.

</FONT><HR>I believe that Sony is making a huge profit because the game is so wildly successful.  You've stated that you had no idea that you would have the response that you have had, and probably based your financial model on about 50,000 subscribers.  Those boxes sold and few months of subscriptions paid for the development.  The first 50,000 or so people who paid $60-$70 covered the cost for you to develop the game.  The other 250,000 boxes were profit.  Now you've got a game that was designed to make a profit from 50,000 monthly subscriptions, but you have 300,000 subscribers.  No matter how many extra servers and no matter how much bandwidth you need for them, the economies of scale say that in real estate, personnel, and other things that DON'T go up significantly, you will make lots of money.  <P>Of course, you couldn't have relied on this huge success, so you must have expected to make a reasonable profit at the 50,000 subscriber mark, and you must be making a huge profit because of the runaway success of the game.  Congrats!<P>Now do something with customer service, other than try to get free labor.  In almost two years of subscribing, I've needed customer service about five times.  Three of those times sucked, because free employees don't care about doing a good job.  Since it cost you nothing, you think you've get it for nothing and can't hurt you.  Wrong.  Bad CS hurts you.  Posts on this board show it.<P>Response to this game has been greater than you could have hoped.  Verant and Sony have made wild profits.  Now give some of it back.<P>Bel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About Customer service.  I used to play nightly with a friend who was a druid.  One day in early December he tp-ed to the Misty Druid ring, when he got there most (not all) of the items in his inventory were gone.  Unfortuneately this happend at the same time Scar's came out.<P>Guess what, he is STILL petitioning Verant to repair his character, they said that it usually only took a few days, but they were swamped by problems with Scar's.  Here is is January 26th, almost two months later, and I saw him on in RV zone, and found to my amazement that his character still had not been restored.<P>Now That is what I call customer service...  NOT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It never ceases to amaze me how much hostility there is over this game.  Jester has some valid points, though they might seem impolite.  Adding content without fixing the old stuff is lame.  What's worse is the new content always has bugs.<P>Heh I'm glad someone brought up how condescending and anal Abashi can be.  He's the driving force that keeps me in such anticipation for UO2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally think that the price to play MMORPG’s should be at least $15 per month and maybe even $20.  However, there is a catch.  I think that in order to secure this industry there has to be a way to ensure that people can play multiple MMORPG’s and not pay for each one.  That would be too much money to expect people to pay.<P>I think the solution to many of the problems in this specific market would be to have some third party company step up and start a universal charge system for MMORPG’s.  Example:  I enjoy playing Everquest but would like to log into AC, or UO just to check things out every once in a while.  Instead of playing for all three services I would log into my MMORPG account and just play whatever one I felt in the mood for.  At the end of the month I would only see one charge on my account regardless of what game I was playing.  Lets say my monthly payments to this service was $22 per month.  The service would take around $2 for itself and then split the remaining amount based on the percent played to the MMORPG’s.  So if I played EQ 70% of the time and AC 30% of the time EQ would get $14 and UO would get $6.<P>A service of this nature would help ensure that the online game industry remained competitive because customers would be willing to play multiple games.  If customers are willing to by and play more games then the developers can get more investors.  They would not have to be as concerned about one game monopolizing the entire industry because players would be able to flip back and forth and play what they are in the mood for.  Another nice thing is that the company that provided the service would have very little overhead and has a great possibility for profit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050375-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050375.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050375-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050375&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050375&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
