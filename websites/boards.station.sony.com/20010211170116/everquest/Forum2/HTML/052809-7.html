</FONT><HR>A few observations..<P>Armor Class <BR>- We have no inherant class ac bonus' except for class specific armor.  If we are the tanks, we should always have some comparable armor class bonus.  It is frustrating to be the tank with shamans with better armor than you have..lol, or even AC.  (and I am not talking from the perspective of uber equipment, just basic proper armor for classes, like banded in the teens..<P>Bind ability<BR>-We cant travel well, at least let us be able to bind once ever few zones...or once a day, or something...it really cuts back on your vision of a large world and travel if that fact alone makes melee classes and warriors NOT WANT TO TRAVEL!!!<P>Taunt<BR>-Taunt needs to be reviewed...If I am fighting with SK's, they will out aggro me most of the time...my taunt is useless at times..it turns them to my direction for a split second but unless I dole out some major damage at that ime, no real tauning effect oocurs.<P>Disarm<BR>-I have not gotten disarm yet but one of my concerns has been confirmed abot disarm...no MoBs really use weapons, or the percantage that do compared to those that dont is nominal...this is our only skill from lvls 25 -50, and it really cant be used.  I fight giants in WW, ones with Hammer of flattening, tree flyer axe, or leg chopper sword, do not hit me for any more noticable amount if damage than those without a weapon.  Seems like this needs to be reviewed as a proper discipline and replaced or upgraded with one that we can actually use.<P>Stun<BR>-ok this is sorta a pet peeve more than anything else...how can I get hit for 1 pt of dmg and get stunned...just dont make sense...have some sort of ratio to your power, or lvl, or your hit points...if I have 800+ hp and get hit for 1hp of dmg, and i get stunned seems very unrealistic.  Have a ratio of the amount of damage that will stun you, and if the hit equals or exceeds that damage, then stun, or have a chance too, but in real life..i do not get stunned by paper cuts, or scrapes, but have Ray Lewis tackle me and Ill sure as heck be stunned.<P>Weapons and armor (equipment)<BR>-This wil piss off the trolls and flamers but who cares...give us more class specific items at lower lvls, lower lvl warriors are not seperated by anyone class due to equipment...shamans, rangers, sk's, palis all can wear our armor, clerics too.  What is the point of being a tank if you have the same AC as every one else, just a few more HP's??<P>My main concern is bind, and the lack of any skills or disciplines for 25 lvls of playing...please look into this...look at every class, and see how many spells, skills, disciplines, etc they get through lvl 25 to 50, and at least balance that out some with warriors...shoot anything would be good, even just throw us a bone, cheap tail whip for iksars, belly bash for ogres, head bash or something, just a new graphics or maybe a new button to push, no more serious damage, no balance issues, just something for us to look forward to other than skill going up by 5 pts and few more HP's.<P>PLEASE READ THIS&gt;&gt;LOL<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'm going to wade into this with my concerns.<P>1) Taunt. More of it. Needs to be more effective.<BR>2) Disarm. Either make it useful, or get rid of it. <BR>3) Someone suggested an AoE taunt. That's a great idea. Make it a level 45 skill (so that warrior have something to do between 35 and 51 other than get drunk). Call it "Infuriate" or something like that.<BR>4) Not going to comment on the epic stuff, other than to agree with what's been said.<BR>5) Make more questable weapons. The ranger Orc Impaler and Sword of Morin quests are good examples of decent mid-range weapons without massive camping trips to get. Give warriors a range of such weapons, from say 10 to 60 (make 60 the epic, if you must).<BR>6) Make religion mean something. As a follower of Tunare, I have absolutely no reason not to plunder the PoG to get my armour, because there's no quests up there for me.<BR>7) Make different fighting styles have some practical value. If an Ogre wants to smash away with his 2her, make it such that he can match the damage output and (more importantly) the taunt of me with two single hand weapons.<BR>8) Give us a reason to use a shield (or let us sling it on our backs and count there).<P>That pretty much sums up my wish list. I've never been excluded from a group because of my race (even if half of my guild is convinced I'm a ranger), so my hit points aren't a huge concern. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>one thing i would really like:<P>When i go berserk with no healer around, i know i am going to die unless i am right next to the zone.<BR>This berserk thing is only useful when used with the lvl54 discipline, which can only be used every 60 minutes.<P>When i go berserk and the mob is in bad shape too, i want to think "maybe it can save my butt and help me kill this mob". Unfortunately, IT ISN'T THE CASE. Cripples are way too rare and seldom make the huge amount of damage everybody sees in screenshots.<BR>Right now, berserk is like an automatic /yell that doesn't tell where you are. It should be more of a chance to survive a bad encounter when travelling.<P>About disciplines: most of the warriors i know only use a few of them... why use evade when defensive is much better ?

</FONT><HR>I think that warriors should be given mana.  Not to heal or cast offensive spells but to use combat abilities like in Diablo 2.  Rather than adding more zones to keep you from having to put up more servers you should just cut into your profit a little and work on more graphics issues existing.  Some things I would like to see is jump attacks, spinning attacks, running thrusts, "grabbing" a mob to taunt it absolutely, head butt, etc.  All kinds of things that would make the class more interesting.  If you think these things would be unbalancing you could at least add new graphics for the disciplines.  The disciplines are a bit underpowered IMO because Verant didnt want to make them *too* powerful to start out.  The recast times are too high and SHOULD reset with death like HT and LOH.  Taunt, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Taunt, Kick, gets old quick.  Even making just a discipline that added some cool effects but didnt "unbalance" the warrior would be a great positive change and make the class more enjoyable.<P>Then again, too many people IMO are twinking warriors and making a terrible saturation (which has always been the case).  The average statistic I think is for every 5 warriors on a server at a given time you will have 4 clerics and 3 enchanters of comparable level.  I think first you should work on motivating the 2 neccessity classes before you encourage more warriors.  Nerfing clerics (IMO the most boring class), MoK and Donal's BP for example, is not a good start.<P>Norok Carraig<BR>Myrmidon of Kaladim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We warriors have too many hit points. Give some to the poor druids. <P>Actually, there are times when I wish I could. Imagine healers casting a spell, giving me an icon that if I click during a fight (say, when they are getting thoroughly attacked) transfer some of my health to them.<P>I've seen taunt mentioned every other post, but if you have an enchanter who casts memory blur, that issue of a weak taunt goes away.<P>That said, I'm a 35 warrior who consistently groups with a druid, ranger, wizard, and enchanter. The problem that we run into is that creatures turn from me onto the druid whenever she heals. And not just one of them but often all of them. When that happens, there is no way a combination of mem blur and taunting can change that.<P>So, I think you can indirectly improve our taunting by changing how creatures turn to focus on casters during a fight.<P>Other ideas:<P>1) Disarm: I have a skill of 119 and have successfully disarmed NPCs all of 4 times.<P>2) Except for trolls and ogres, we're far too pretty.<P>3) Give us the ability to do a Xena jump in the middle of a fight and begin whomping on their backside (which IMO should cause more damage since there are no defenses...unless you're counting eye-burning flatulence from the orcs). Even if there is no damage advantage, we would look really great in battle.<P>Also,give us some Rope-A-Dope footwork animation during fights.<P>Consider how neat casters look with their effects, warriors are sorely unbalanced in the Fashionable Fighting area.<P>4) Allow us to create a list of insults that are cycled through when we use taunt.<P>5) Put an NPC in our warrior guilds to whom warriors have to talk to. We have to tell a story of our adventures every 5th level (after 20). Doing so either gives us a built-in haste (1/2% per story) or improves our taunt. We have to choose one or the other.<P>6) Why can I only stun with Slam from the backside when creatures are running away?<P>7) Make it so that the longer we use the *same* weapon, the better our skills get with that particular weapon, thus adding offensive skills. But if we change weapons, that advantage is lost.<P>8) Make the female characters less buxom. It's a distraction even during fights.<P>9) Give us a Call of the Wild discipline. No, it's not a scatalogical reference. It's the ability to tame an animal (say wolves and lions since they are so plentiful).<P>10) Give a facial animation of a head shake anytime a caster talks about mana, medding, or cast time. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm rooting for better taunt of some kind.  The way taunt works now is an encouragement to lvl my warrior since that makes me more effective.  So it's not all bad.  <P>I like the idea of an AOE taunt, though it might take away from enchanters stunning or getting beat on (here's a good one, make it break mez).  Personally, I think if it lets groups go places without enchanters I'm all for it.<P>Lastly, 2handers need fixed.  Maybe they do the same dmg output as dual wield but they sure as heck don't taunt as much which is critical fighting a yellow or red mob.  So don't fix the taunt issue.  Make 2handers do bigger hits, more damage than dual wielding, and keep the crappy taunt ability on 2handers.  This allows for a warrior to fiddle around with carrying more than a couple low dly 1handers for taunting.  Also makes the class a bit more thoughtful since we should be involved in our equipment.<P>Myahak 52 troll basher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To quote Ugglie Bogmonster,<BR> "Ok, Santa, I want some better armor, and a giant axe…hehehe…<P>Here it goes:<P>1)Can the Crafted Armor suit be completed? Crafted Collar? Crafted Cloak? Crafted Mask? Crafted Belt?some of the stats in Crafted just don’t help at all (like the int and wis in the helm, or the int in the bracers). Can this be made a little better?<P>2)You get double attack at level 15, then riposte at 25. Ten levels later! Ack! Well, at least you only have ten more levels before you get the ultimate in do nothing skills, disarm. Good thing its only seventeen more levels before you get your first discipline. Now patience is a virtue, but this is a bit much.<P>3)Improve the bind wound skill for warriors. problem is that it’s not that useful in the post-50 world, but it would be at lower levels. I just think that this should be implemented much earlier, perhaps as early as level 1, because it is group friendly (reduces the group down time between fights), gives warriors something to work on during those incredibly long gaps when they are not getting any new skills, and is unique to the class.<P>4)Charge skill, which would raise the warrior’s attack skill for a few moments. <P>5)Now onto to bows. Increasing the range, and the damage/delay ratio of bows helps both the warrior and the ranger class, and still won’t make bows primary weapons over melee weapons. In addition, bows with some useful stats in them would encourage people to use them, instead of putting something else in the ranged slot. Finally, can we get some bows with AC in them? This would reflect the use of defensive tactics that can be employed when using the bow, and would increase the survivability of both warriors and rangers.<P>6)Improve the bezerker frenzy skill by putting it on a button, making it a tactical choice as to when it should be used.<P>7)Make it more fun to play the Warrior: In a tough fight near his group, the warrior pushes his auto attack button, slams, taunts and disarms. If it’s a bad pull, well then he hits auto attack, slams, taunts, and disarms. If he gets jumped while pulling, the warrior hits auto attack, then he slams, taunts, and disarms. If they pull an uber mob, then he….well, he hits auto attack, slams, taunts, and disarms. If the room pops, then he decides…well, I guess he hits auto attack, slams, taunts and disarms. See what I’m saying?"<P><BR>End of quotes from Ugglie.<P>I could not articulate any of these ideas better.<P>Jakzter IronFangg<BR>Barbarian Warrior - 20 Seasons Strong<BR>Omega Elite Guild<BR>Vallon Zek<P>"What the mind creates, the body completes!" - Anon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow!  Alan you just posted this yesterday and there are 248 response.  So you thought we would not have much to say eh? hehe jk.  Personally I think that warriors are fairly balanced but there are a few things that would make us more effective.<P>1.  Increase the drop rates on Cobalt and on Indocolite.  Indo is not that rare in Hate but on a 9 hour raid you will see 2 maybe 3 pieces.  Up this to 4 or 5.  Cobalt is super rare.  I have been in Karnor's for weeks and I may have heard of one piece dropping.  Equipment is all we have and AC is our most important stat.  To make Cobalt and Indo so rare puts warriors at a bit of a disadvantage.<P>2.  I know some folks have already voiced this here but put berserker frenzy on a timer.  (maybe equal to a pally's loh or an SKs harm touch)  And make it a bit more effective so that crits and crips go off a bit more.<P>3.  Revise disarm or get rid of it and give us another ability in its place.  Honestly this skill is utterly useless.  As some have probably already posted a mob hits just as hard with their weapon as without and sometimes harder.  And there are some zones where the weapon will disappear if you disarm the mob.  This may have use for pvp servers so maybe leave it in there but it is completely useless to Warriors on the regular servers.  <P>     These three items are not major.  As I said I think our class is fairly balanced.  But I think these three items would just make us a bit more effective.  My 2cp for what its worth.  Thanks for listening.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Disarm:<P>This is an issue for all classes that have this skill.  Disarming a mob has no effect whatsoever on their combat ability.  My suggestion would be to make Disarm work like the Cripple spell when used against mobs that are not wielding a weapon.  Currently, disarm does absolutely nothing -- mobs without weapons attack the same as mobs with weapons.<P>Taunt:<P>Another multi-class issue, but it affects warriors the most since we do not have spells to taunt with.  Our whole job in life is to tank, and yet I find it nearly impossible to taunt any mob over level 50 with me having maximum taunt skill.<P>Warrior epic:<P>I know you don't want to discuss epics, but it is one of the most difficult to obtain epics, and at the same time, one of the weakest.  Other people have covered this, so I'll leave my input at that.<P>"Charge" discipline:<P>This is a really silly discipline.  It makes you not miss for 12 seconds, with a recycle time of half an hour.  There is never a reason to use this.  The damage improvement is generally around 20% for a period of 12 seconds, which is to say about .01% of a typical mob's hit points.  Anyway, I would like to see it changed to a 'Spirit of Cheetah' effect.  A "get away discipline" that makes the warrior run fast for a short period of time.  Warriors have no escape effects, and since pumice got nerfed we're hosed if we run into a SOW speed mob, especially in the huge Kunark/Velious zones (where it's a long way to the zoneline).  It doesn't help that JBoots are a lot harder for warriors to obtain than any hybrid/caster class.  Changing 'Charge' to a running discipline would be a cool replacement for what is right now a useless discipline.  (Ideally, it should stack with, not overwrite, SOW.)<P>Arrows:<P>I'm sure rangers must complain about this more, but the way arrows track is really bad.  Go into Howling Stones (Charsis) with a bow.  Try to pull the entrance mobs.  You can't.  Even though you have a direct line of sight to them, the arrow will not angle up in time, it will fly straight into the steps at the monster's feet every time.  Very annoying to have to make a caster be the puller simply because I can't shoot the target.  (Alternatively, giving us access to an easy to get item that casts a some useless effect that's only good for pulling would fix this as well.)<P>Hit point buffs:<P>Maybe this is me being picky, but it has always bothered me that, after a full set of buffs, warriors do not have many more hit points than other tank classes.  After you add 1500 hit points to both of us, the percentage difference is greatly reduced.<P>It would be cool if clerics/shaman got a high level hit point buff that gave the target a PERCENTAGE increase based on their 'naked' hit points.  e.g., a spell that gives 20% -- if my base HP are 2000 and yours are 1000, the buff gives me 400hp, and gives you 200hp.  Thus maintaining the natural hit point differences between the classes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1)Increase taunt effectiveness in high level dungeons. there are dungeons (such as deep in seb) where taunt just does not work. if we cant do our job and take the damage, we are not wanted in a group.<P>2)Cobalt drops are rediculous across the board. my level 10 bard has as many pieces of kunark armor as my lvl 54 warrior - 2. the bard stuff cost me 3K, the warrior stuff cost me 30K. you economy is whacked. not to mention i have NEVER seen a cobalt helm or bracer traded - look at some of the trade sites - they are not there. you have made mobs hit so hard that we NEED high AC, yet we cannot get the armor to get a high AC. increase the drop rate across the board.<P>3)Critical Hits. Please make them at least do the maximum normal damage you would get for a hit. its embarassing to have people see you do a crit for half of what you normally hit for. a "Critical Hit" indicates a good hit, it should at least do maximum the normal hit damage.<P>4)Disarm. I trained this skill up to max, and i still have no use for it. I could not disarm a dry bones skeleton who was 30 levels lower than me, and it would not have had any effect if I did disarm him. replace this skill with something useful. maybe a instill doubt type of skill.<P>Thats it for now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It has all been said, best I believe by Frax.  My only point is to disagree with Banzai concerning the drop off the queen in Chardok for the epic quest.  It is Banzai's opinion that the drop rate remain unchanged because holding the room is a challenge.  Sorry Banzai, but breaking the room is the challenge.  Holding the room is nothing but tedium.  If you have assembled an army to break the room, must they all be bored holding it for hours hoping for a drop?  I would suggest the drop rates on the green scale, ball of ever living golem, hand of the meistro and ancient blade all be revisited.<P>Fedmahn<BR>56 Dwarven warrior<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Shield block:<P>I agree that something like this should be in the game, and not just for warriros.  Although other classes have a good reason to use a shield anyway (they get nice shields and one-handers that are nearly as good as same level two-handers), warriors do not.  They provide a single digit percentage increase in AC at a cost of about a 40% reduction in damage output.  Having a "shield block" skill would perhaps give us some reason to wear a shield sometimes, if it were good enough of a skill to make a difference.  Otherwise, the suggestion to make more shield wearable on the back is a good one.  There are very, very few back items in the game for warriors.  Most warriors I know are actually still using the 8 AC cloak from Cazic Thule or the 12 AC cloak from Sol B.  We get many armor sets, but none of them include back pieces.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's a strength buff that decreases over time into a strength DEBUFF.  The whole cycle only lasts for about 30 seconds.  I believe it's a level 8 cleric spell.  Anyway, I'd like to see it changed to Summon Bandages.  I actually like using Bind Wounds, but after stocking up on arrows, food, and having those friggin Kunark/Velious keys take up nearly a full backpack, I don't have room to carry bandages around.  Changing Cobalt Gauntlets effect to summon a stack of bandages would be useful.

</FONT><HR>Okay I've played a warrior as my primary character since Phase 2 of Beta.  I've seen a lot of changes to the class, the vast majority of them good ones.<P>I'd like first to address a few of the comments I've read on this thread (though I must admit to not having read the entire thread).<P>Cobalt bracers/helm are NOT that rare.  All but one of the warriors in my guild have one.  Some twinks even have one.  Same goes with the bracer, too.<P>Disarm IS useless other than in PvP situations.  Either find a way to make it useful or replace it with something beneficial.<P>Taunt... well that horse is dead and beaten to a pulp.  Taunt needs help, that much is obvious.<P>As someone else pointed out, between L25 and L52 the only new skill is the aforementioned Disarm.  Perhaps add an Instill Doubt or some sort of other defensive skill at L45 to help fill the void and address some of the concerns raised by my fellow warriors.<P>Epic weapon:  It needs some work.  I see many who seem happy with the 2h version but I can't for the life of me understand why.  With the 1h, you get a 100 DD in the primary hand and a permanent effect of 12 AC, 30 dex, 40 ATK in the off hand.  30 dex = more procs.  2h version gives you a 175 DD.  The 2h proc needs to be upgraded in a big way, there are plenty of other non-epic 2h weapons that have a bigger proc.  And yes, adding haste would seem to be a no-brainer.  I mean how am I supposed to taunt off a ranger who has a pair of epics with similar dmg/delay, 40% haste, and procs a SLOW?<P>I would like to see a slight adjustment in the HP department as well, particularly considering hybrids can regularly get within 10% or so of our max HP.<P>That's all I can think of for the moment but I reserve the right to edit my remarks at a later date.<P>Breeze Stormwind<BR>Inner Circle, Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as warriors go, they have 3 flaws:<P>They can't dish it out unless it's an emergency. I am a level 16 barbarian warrior, on TP server (not really a newbie for where i play) and i usually hit for around 30 damage a pop, with an axe of the Iron back. i can dual hit and i have crits for up to 69 and crippling blows as high as 104. while i can dish it out compared to many of the people i play with, i still have serveral problems. One is that i can never be that valueable, unless i pull nothing attacks me, until i double attack for crits. One way that i try to get around this is to have the healers keep me at around 1-1.5 bubs or health, when i am buffed up, that is about 150 or so hit points. Then i ALWAYS do crits and can lay out splitpaw commanders in about 30 seconds, however i have mad aggro.<P>so, aren't warriors wupposed to be just that, rogues shouldn't be able to do as much long-term damage as us, plus, we should be able to have the ability to "wade into battle". A possibility for this would be to increase the crits and crips DRAMATICALLY as far as occurences go. also, i LOVE the idea of an AE, like a big 'ol swipe with my axe that hits a bunch of the creatures around me, and maybe for the higher levels a move in which you can spin around in a whirlwind or something. these would improve the damage flaw with warriors. also, maybe with bigger weapons to ability to pound something behind you with the pommel of your weapon for a stun or something, not a huge damage output, but something to get them off of your back for a second.<P>2nd point: travelling. Binding is a real b**ch. if i want to go somewhere then i have to spend half my time beging somebody for a bind. I like the idea of having somehthing like harmtouch or LOH that is a 24-hour occurence but will bind you anywhere, at least to a city, above level 30 or so.<P>and lastly: Blacksmithing. For those of us that HAVEN'T been around for millenia, we have no platinum. i have, between all my characters, less then 50pp in raw cash. This makes it har at best to get armor. to give us a starting blacksmithing of 50, like dwarves get sense heading etc... would be extraordinarily helpful, or to have us have much greater success with smithing. Clerics etc.. shouldn't complain, we are saving your ass with our armor.<P>anyways, thats just my 14 pounds of cents.<P>-Kilaxin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really have to disagree with you on the Cobalt Bracer/Helm being not that rare, I have spent an eternity trying to get a Helm and still don't have one and i'm probably the best equipped warrior on my server, the drop rates are very simply out of whack and all i'm asking for is for them to be half as common as Deepwater Helm or Jaundiced Bone Bracer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would love to see an AE taunt.  I'd like to see it available alot lower than level 40, though.  I have laready run into many situations where this would've made a huge difference to the group as a whole and I'm only level 28 now.  This also would not change the balance, since it is already our primary resposibility.  <P>The class is balanced fairly well.  I'd heard of this 'AC softcap' and I would like to know if this is true.  If it is, I'd like it removed.  There should be no cap on AC.<P>As for the small vs. large races issue, I think this needs no adjustments.  I have the benefits of large races (Barbarian) but I still get stunned.  Ogres and Trolls can't be stunned, but they are also KOS everywhere and have a very hard time getting around in tight spots.  I have a very rough time getting around certain dungeons.  I got caught in the middle of 2 trains in CT last night because I was too big to get by them.  Small races don't get slam and can be stunned, but they also don't get stuck and killed like the large races do.  I don't know about the Armor Weight issue, but they seem balanced in all other ways to me.<P>As far as getting stunned, this IS ridiculous.  There is no way that I should be getting stunned when I get hit for 1 or even 10 if I have over 1000HPs.  Stunning should only happen when you are hit for near max damage.<P>I would also like to see some kind of Armor we can quest for early on in the game.  Something earlier than Crafted.  I know this is probably the same for most classes, but by level 15, you'd think there'd be some sort of Armor quest for those of us who rely on it heavily.  I personally like doing quests instead of buying all my equipment off of everyone else.  Fine Plate is just too expensive to buy until around level 25-30 and by then, you can start doing some crafted quests which are actually cheaper in most cases than Fine Plate.  This is just a suggestion, and has nothing to do with balance.<P>Also, if you could, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRAINS!  I was trained continually through 4 hours of playing in Mistmoore yesterday.  I'm not talking about newbie trains, either.  I'm talking level 40+ MOBs dropping on our heads.  Even standing right next to the zone, most of us couldn't get out in time.  If I find out who was doing it, I'm gonna let them know exactly how much I appreciated it!  I was so disgusted I just stopped playing last night at like 2PM on my day off!  I never quit playing that early!<P>(Sorry, that was a little off the subject there.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BreezeXeg, I agree that cobalt bracers are not that rare.  But the helm is.  In all the time Kunark has been out I've only heard of one dropping on my server, and when it did it was big enough news that it was all over the server boards for our server as a news item.  (LOL)  THAT is too rare by anyone's definition.   <P>  I also agree with some other posters that the chardok queen should drop the blade every time.  The trouble is that she is an extremely hard mob that doesn't really drop anything anyone would want so it is nearly impossible to convince your guild to undertake the 10 or so raids that it is likely to take to get your blade.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Make criticle hits more "criticle" by having them always do at least the max damage of a normal hit. For example, I can land normal hits with my Wurmslayer for up to 98, yet still get Criticle hits for 56 with it.  If my normal hit cap is 98 I'd like to see criticle hits always do at least 98.<BR>Make double attacks/triple attacks/quad attacks do normal damage.  I notice that when I land a quad attack it's usually for very little damage, I even see them for 1,1,1,1 somtimes, yet I never land a normal hit for 1, or if I do it's very rare, yet when double attack or triple attack go off it's usually for half the normal damage which wipes out the usefulness of this ability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a 55 Warrior on Prexus.  For the most part we are a great class.  However there are a few issues we encounter.<P>1) Taunting mobs over level 50 even after the change to taunt is ridiculously difficult.  I understand the game balance issues with taunt working too well but I think a little more boost would be nice.<P>2) Is there a reason piercing caps lower than the rest of our weapon skills?  (pierce is 240 at level 60, vs 250 for the rest)  I'd like to see pierce cap raised equal to the rest of them.<P>3) Related to (1) above, one of the best ways for warriors to taunt is the proc on our epic.  However this is bugged.  The proc on the mainhand epic weapon is a taunt, damage and mob debuff.  However, because of the debuff (which stays on the mob over time) if a 60 warrior procs on a mob and a 59 warrior then procs later the 59 warrior gets a 'did not take hold' message and does not benefit from the taunt or dmg parts of the proc.  Could we get the taunt & dmg parts of the proc made separate from the debuff part so there is utility in it for warriors other than lvl 60?<P>4) Epic again even though you don't like it.  Main hand epic is 14/24 which is awfully slow for a main hand weapon.  Maybe the main hand blade could have the delay decreased to 10/18 to help in taunting/dmg output?<P>5) Epic yet again, look at all the multigroup mobs a warrior has to kill for his/her epic: 2 dragons, Maestro, Queen in Chardok, Spiroc Lord in air.  Are there any other epics that require *5* big 'boss' type mobs for their epic?  Given that we have to kill 5, the drop rates on the hand off Maestro and Queen's Blade in Chardok are ridiculously low.  It really wouldn't be unbalancing to have those two drop their item every time.<P>Other than these nitpicks Warriors are a great class!<P>Gorlab 55 Warrior<BR>Tenakha 52 Druid<BR>Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Sorry to post again, but I had some more thoughts I wanted to mention.  IMHO, warriors should not be able to self-heal, other than the current bind-wound ability.  Along these lines:<P>1.  I do NOT think bind wound should be increased. <P>2.  This one is going to get me in trouble with some of you, but my understanding is that the cobalt breastplate effect includes a 100 point heal.  Get rid of that.  We should not be able to heal.  Replace it with something else that is a nice effect that doesn't infringe on other classes' abilities.  <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Preface:  I'm a lvl 60 Warrior w/ my epics and full cobalt armor.  <P>Warriors are pretty much perfect.  There are 2 things i would improve.<P>1.  Taunt.  It sucks.  Basically moving you up to number one on the hate list by 1 point is just not enough.  I can tank well in some circumstances, but it really is hard to keep things on me if there is a ranger or a monk or even another warrior w/ jade maces in my group.  The taunt effect on the epic is not good.  It doesn't do enough to keep you high up on the hate list because the weapons themselves are way too slow.  <P>2.  Epics.  This is hardly a big deal, because there are other weapons that I'll be using shortly in the main hand, however.... There is really no reason for the main hand weapon to not be 12/20.  There are a ton of weapons of that calibur that have been found.  They are rare, but so is the epic.  Also the main hand proc has some problem where if there is another warrior that procs then mine don't take hold.  Also the taunt on the proc just isn't enough.  It rarely taunts a mob onto me that already isn't on me.<P>That's it.<P>Laters,<P>Fumin Drachejager<BR>Warlord of Tunare<BR>Talisman<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
