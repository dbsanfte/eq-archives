</FONT><HR>GM Vedan on Xegony doesnt change names after level 50, and IMO, if someone reached level 50 BEFORE a gm ever talked to him about his name, it should be his, some people dont think their name is offensive or against the policy, and some cut it close, but changing names after being ONLINE(play time) over 1/3rd a year is rediculous, i understand you have rules and such, and OFFENSIVE names should be removed no matter what, but changin names after level 51 that are boarder line and or not offensive at all is __&lt;insurt vulgar language here&gt;__... i wouldnt blame a level 60 for quiting... you know  how much TIME it takes to get 60? having you name changed that late is VI's FAULT! IF YOU had more GM's they'd be able to see it, i talked to vedan one afternoon, he doesnt change names unless they are offensive 51+, and apparently gm's have been trying to talk to me for over 3 months, but havnt until then, whos fault? not mine, i never heard anyone had problems with my name, but apparently guilds have been petitioning that my name (Wiliam Walace) cuts close on the naming policy..<P>And thank you, Wiliam Walace is a VERY common name, and my friend's name as well<P>Wiliam Walace<BR>55th season shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sheeesh, I agree with the above post, some of you people need to at least *try* to be creative when making your character's name. I couldn't get the juices flowin' when I created my main and just flipped through the generator a few times because I wanted to get on and play the game and it's been fine for me.<P>To you people that think this is wrong just because of the person's level, GMs can't just wander from zone to zone checking out names so it may take that long before someone (who may or may not be mad at them) finally petitions it. If your name was against the rules, you should have known that it being changed was a possibility.<P>Wiliam Wallace, great example. I bet you're a barabarian too huh? Kilt and blue facepaint, the works. Surprised you made it to 55 without a change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I created a character named "Daintee", a dwarven warrior, for jokes.  I got plenty of laughs.  When I hit lvl 20, I couldn't think of a surname, but when I turned to my guild I got plenty of suggestions.  The one I found funniest was "Undderpants".  I went and reviewed the naming policy it was not in direct conflict with any naming policies I could see, and was not offensive.  I got at least one message an hour saying something about my new surname.  I never expected to keep it long, but yes, I grew attached to it.  <P>After 15lvl of having it, I was in arena at a guild event, and someone had petitioned Calyssa (Head GM of Prexus) for a bugged corpse.  When she arrived, she deleted my surname and disappeared.  No message, nothing.  Didn't tell me why it was breaking the naming policy.  I'm just happ she left Daintee.<P>But, when I petitioned wondering why my name was offensive, I was given an response that Undderpants was offensive.  Come on! How is an article of clothing offensive?  And Dwarves worship Brell, lord of the underground.  I asked how it was offensive and the GM responded that if I didn't understand, it was too bad for me.<P>Enough of my ranting, I'm now 42nd, with my name of Daintee Footstool.  I sympathize with all the people on VZ and al servers who are violated this way.  Either the naming policies need to change, or the way they are imposed does.<P>Enough of my ranting, I'm out.<P>Daintee Footstool &lt;42nd Dorf Warrior&gt;<BR>"Long live the undderpants!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>***First off I was in chat and messing around with the rename function and now I'm stuck with this for a week.  yuck...***<P>To my point.  I just purchased the game in October.  No where does it say to read the naming policy on a website when you install the game or make your characters.  If this was in the license agreement, fine (it isn't), but to have a policy on some remote site that you aren't even aware of or forced to read is bad business and laziness on VI's part.<P>It would be simple to force the new user to visit a web site upon first run or install.  Maybe when you create your station name.  I've even seen web sites where if you just scroll to the bottom and click accept on their agreement it realizes you didn't read it and won't let you past until a certain amount of time has expired.<P>VI dropped the ball on this one.<P>Until every "offensive" npc name is changed (including qeynos - sonyeq) VI should respectfully not make anyone change a name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I hope you stop by by and read this again. This will NOT be a flame. Fact is, some names should be changed, no if's and's or but's. Those being BLATANTLY offensive names. And I dont mean someone who finds Deadcookie offensive, because their grandmother died and she used to make christmas cookies. But if they are marginal and haven't been petitioned or observed by a GM by a certain level, it should stay. Verant talks about promoting groups and developing contacts within the community. Renaming an individual at the whim of a GM is AGAINST that vision in every possible way. Renaming should NOT be done without some sort of review. And it should DEFINITELY NOT be a name that the GM chooses. I've heard that 10minutes later a GM changed a players name. Not enough time to decide I say. Did the player even know HOW to rename? I dont. Never came up. Did the GM inform the player of how to re-name? This is a big deal Absor. I rarely, maybe only once have posted here. But after seeing this on Everlore, then reading your response, I had to come say my piece. PLease review the policy and give us a straight answer. Will GM's (who yes, have had personal issues with players) be allowed sole discretion at disrupting our community in this manner? We know some people deserve to be renamed, but Verant's process is lacking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is kinda funny.<P>For the last few weeks I have been trying to get my surname removed, but they will not let me.  Kahm Santovasku on Prexus.  I named her after a character in a comic I found lying around.  Turns out it's pretty big in Japan (Outlanders, by Jonji Mantanabe), and I was a bit worried about having a manga/anime savy GM rename me at random.  Figured I'd just go surnameless for a while till I thought of something good.  But alas, even though I have petitioned several times the guides and gms I talk to all say nope, we can't change your name.  I point out that it is like Luke Skywalker.  Luke is cool for first name, but not with lastname Skywalker.<P>Of course, I wonder why you can't do /surname to replace you own name at any point in the game.  It is only the first name that must be unique, so why not be able to change your last name?  There is still only one Kahm on the server.<P>but I've digressed, so I'll stop.<P>-Kahm<BR>warrior of 33 season, fighting proudly for the Legion of Iksar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I admit I haven't real all the posts yet, but I agree that there are serioius problems with the Naming Policy.<P>OK, I can accept that names containing slurs towards race, creed, gender--etc--are bad names.  That's almost a natural given.  I don't totally agree with the "copyright" idea, since it's not like we are trying to publish stories and steal from other authors.<P>The main problem is that these rules are not enforced to everyone.  Sure, I see people run by with names like "meeliketoscrew" (not kidding) but I have also seen about 5 or 6 "Deedlit" (or variations), when most anime fans know she is a copywritten character from Lodos Wars.<P>As for changing a name on someone, sure I know they can physically do it, but I don't agree with the way it seems to be happening.  There is nothing wrong with issuing a warning and being polite, like saying, "Hey your name violates the policy and we have to change it," and then offering an option of creating a new name.<P>Afterall, the GMs are suppose to be checking these names upon creation.  It's entirely possible that a player will make an innocent name that will violate the naming policy--and it's suppose to be taken care of before the character is completed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My name is Clerion. I thought it would be witty to have a Cleric named Clerion. Does it sound like Clarion, the name brand of speakers? Yes, could i have some punk petition me to a GM? yes, if these guys did for their names...however, at level 35 i have many many many friends. Dont even think about changing my name. If i were at level 60, i wouldnt care if my name were Monostat Itchytwat, you'd better not touch my name without apologizing on every tell you send me and being the nicest darn GM Ive ever seen, not to mention, making that server wide message.

</FONT><HR>Yes Phisto, unfortunately your name is in violation.  It violates rule number 11.  Pray that no one reports you =(<P>As to the person that couldn't see how Vhalen can be interpreted as Van Halen<P>   Vhalen<BR>-&gt; V   Halen<BR>-&gt; Van Halen<P>Does that help.  Of course its not blantant, but I bet that's where the origin of the name comes from.  How is it offensive? Well according to Alan, this is a fantasy game and names should fit the setting.  Well the year is currently 3000 something and the planet we are on is not necessarily Earth, so how would they possibly know of Vhalen (Van Halen), Lars and Ulrich McMannis (Lars Ulrich of Metallica), Bait Masterson (Bat Masterson), or Qeynos (Sony EQ).<P>This is the point that I and others including Vixx and BobEvans want a response from Verant about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I certainly didn't make my original post to make friends, nor do I think anything will be changed by my posting.  As such, I didn't feel any obligation to be polite.  Bottom line is something senseless was done to make a couple of long time players quit.  You can visit Nekutlos Forest and see the 'Arntemp' corpse in front of Neriak as a reminder of what poorly thought out decisions can do.  Until it rots, that is.<P>I think it's worth mentioning WHY this happened.  Why, after 14 months, GM's went on a frenzy.  This is, at any rate, what I gathered from Karn:<P>We were in Sebilis.  We're a PvP server, zone control is a big issue.  A rival guild that usually occupies Sebilis was in Plane of Sky.  A couple members logged on and went into Sebilis, perhaps not realizing the rest of their guild was elsewhere.  They got PK'd with the help of Karn.<P>So one of them (Subdural -- say, isn't that a layer of skin, not a good fantasy name?) petitioned a GM about Karn's name as a form of harassment to seek revenge for the killings, and told Karn as much in tells.  Sure enough, the GM shows up and starts changing names.<P>Seems a little fishy to me.  A little cheap revenge with the help of a GM?<P><BR>If nothing else comes out of this, I want Verant and their customer services representatives to get a feel for what happens when you make hasty decisions.  Someone said 'jump' and they jumped without considering the ramifications, motives or weighing the situation.  It was a foolish move to make such haste over a something which was not harming or offending anybody but stood a good chance of making a lot of people very angry.<P>And it did, too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm not high enough level to see it for myself, but it sounds like the high level folks on any server are a tight community and reputation is important.

</FONT><HR>Dyer, I apologize if I offended you.  I seriously thought that you might not have seen how Vhalen CAN be interpreted as Van Halen.  Based on Lars and Ulrich in WK, it lead me to believe that other such rock names were scattered throughout Norrath, and Vhalen is a good example.  <P>Abashi stated in a post a long time ago (sorry no link) that names such as Qeynos, etc. were intentionally placed throughout EQ.  My point, if I made it too subtle, was to show the contradiction in Alan saying that the naming policy is in place to keep the game in setting, but at the same time, EQ has names on NPCs and cities out of setting.<P>But please Dyer, don't label those trying to argue a side of the story.  I'm sorry if I misinterpreted your post.

</FONT><HR>Something that will not fly well, but needs said nonetheless. Every time you get in the game, you click on acceptance for a EULA. That's End User License Agreement. You may not care about it, nor read it. Nonetheless, it gives Verant the right to do as they please, and they do.<P>The only power you hold is the power to stop paying and go play elsewhere if you can't live with that.<P>The fact they actually put up message boards for people to comment or vent is a very effective way to control WHERE folks vent, and considering more folks sign up every day, regardless of all the complaining done here, it certainly demonstrates how well versed they are in marketing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll try and keep this brief.<P>It is a fact that EQ has become less and less of a role-playing environment and due to that fact more and more people are naming their characters "Debbie Doesdallas" or "Poppin Fresh" due to the lack of fantasy "feel" remaining in the game these days.<P>I've been playing this game since Beta4 and back then (obviously) we were a small community of players. We role-played and all tried to come up with some creative names to match the setting. Later after having reached 20th level we had to petition our last name and so made efforts to do it right. Today with +300 000 players and dozens of servers there is overcrowding and with that comes the bad apples.<P>Sadly, more and more, Norrath is becoming a place for Dewds and power levelers and that blame falls on a lot of shoulders (Verant's and ours) but nowhere and at no time has anyone managed to convince me that the rights of those who choose to disrespect the game rules, who consider EQ to be on par with Quake or Diablo to be above those who still want to role-play and preserve some essence of what EQ was originally all about.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>If you want to act the fool and name your character Flush Medown then go right ahead but consider it fair play when I petition your name in an ongoing effort to clean up the trash. <P>Don't get me wrong I laugh at those funny names just like the next guy but I enjoy EQ in a different way and Verant has given me the ability to make a difference by ratting some of you out. So I use it like a plumber uses a wrench on a leaky pipe- I fix it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036481-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036481&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036481&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
