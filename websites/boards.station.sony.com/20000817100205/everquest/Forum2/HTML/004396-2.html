</FONT><HR>How about a 12 level cap for healing/buffing?<P>Personally id like to see there NOT be any xteam healing/buffing but that would be somewhat a pain cuz there arent many elven warriors to group with for example. Had it been that way since the start, it would have been great. A much more diverse world, one without a bunch of wood elven druids and high elven clerics. A world where a human cleric is a barb warriors best friend. But i fear its too late for that, too much time spent and too many friends now. What would be truly great would be a new PvP TEAMS server with these rules in place. Whats chances of that happening Gordo?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I hadta ask &lt;cringe&gt;... /em dodges the VI ice comet.<P>In the meantime while we all anxiously await the new server  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  <P>Instead of eliminating the ability to xteam heal, how about this:<P>    2 warrior trolls and a human cleric attack a group of humans. During the battle the cleric heals both warriors. The warriors kill 3 humans. The cleric gets the human faction hits along with the trolls cuz he healed them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> This is done with NPC's why not implement it for PC's?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>First of all I'm glad you observed that this is a problem. It isn't just a minor nuisance; a certain guild on Vallon Zek is systematically abusing the current ruleset to gain the advantage of having invulnerable healers, scouts etc.<P>I would suggest the 3rd option. Even though I think crossteaming buffing/healing is a greater problem than out of range buffing, I believe this combination would work.<P>I can explain this - from our dark point of view, we have to crossteam to get rid of the invulnerable healers, while we can just bring in lower level guildmates (or higher level) to get rid of out-of-range buffers/healers. I don't want to crossteam in order to fight on equal terms.<P>I don't really believe in G vs E. There are PK guilds of shorties (Reapers) only on Vallon Zek as well as human only guilds (Global Menace etc). By turning G vs E you change the game to the point where these guilds cannot really exist anymore. Plus the environment would be become more boring if the lighties can't attack each other. <P>THANK YOU for listening Abash.<P>Mirixia L`Elamshinae<BR>Priestess of Innoruuk (level 51)<BR>Black Sun, VZ<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi-<P>The immortal healer case is actually a rare occurence in game. Also to point out 90% of immortal healing is done within light races, not a dark elf cleric healing lights killing darks. <P>There are 4 types of immortal healing.<P>1.A healer to high for the people fighting so he cant be hit.<P>2.Someone to low for the people fighting who can heal.<P>3.Human fighting elf with a human druid healing the elf. (tons of variations of this since there are 3 light teams so when lights fight each other there is gonna be immortal healers)<P>4.Dark elf healer with lighties killing darkies.<P>The most common being #3 or something along those lines. <P>Here are some problems with your proposed solutions regarding PVE. You stated this is Everquest with PVP not PVP Everquest so I will assume you want to fix this without harming the PVE aspect of the game. <P>1) Drive by. Im a half elf grouped with a dwarf cleric. Dark elf comes by and hits me, I cant be healed or buffed while in battle which would be very harmful to PVE. Even if this is illegal its gonna happen.<P>2)Full group deep in sebilis. Im a half elf ranger grouped with 2 human warriors and a dwarf cleric. One of the warriors accidentally targets me and hits me once, my riposte goes off and hits him. Now me nor the warrior can be healed by the dwarf cleric deep in sebilis. There are many variations of this which could and ultimately will prove harmful in PVE.<P>The way the team servers evolved, it was developed into a sort of G vs E because everyone went out and made a dark elf and the only way to balance it was to combine the 3 light races against the darks. You suggest changing the server to G vs E. The problem with that would be mainly the light guilds that choose to be team only. Reapers , La Cercle De Mort, Shanks come to mind on Vallon Zek. Changing the server to Good vs Evil would effectively destroy these guilds. <P>From a roleplaying standpoint there are many justifications behind why a person Cross Teams.<P>Another reason not to change is because of the systems that have evolved to stop it. Our reputations on the PVP servers are valued. If you are seen cross teaming, you will become Kill on Sight to the rest of the server possibly kicked out of your guild etc. <P>Also , all that has been posted here are why cross teaming needs to be stopped. No one has yet posted the disadvantages to cross teaming. Yes there are some. For instance, A lighty guild cross teaming between the 3 light races fights a dark guild. The dark guild can effectively use AE spells and not have to worry about hitting a fellow team member where as the lights can kill any one of the other 2 teams they are with. <P>The main problem you see is immortal healing but this  rarely happens. If im an elf fighting a human with an elf healer its an immortal healer. Best proposition to stop this would be to change the server to Good vs Evil. No matter what situation or change you do, there will be people who dont like it. With the exception of changing to coin only we have gotten along with the crossteaming this long I really don't see any reason to change it. For anyone who has played the servers for a while im sure at one point had an immortal healer and went against one. We learn to live with the rare chance this happens. <P>Currently, you state there is no rule against immortal healing, how about possibly starting one up and allowing it to be enforced by the gms to see how it goes. Just to point out I think the punishable ones should be the one's done on purpose like a lvl 50 cleric healing lvl 20 people. Not a lvl 40 cleric healing a lvl 41 whom he was grouped with fighting a lvl 49. If your groupmate got attacked you would want to help anyway possible and this situation wasnt done on purpose like the 50 cleric healing the lvl 20. Just trying to differentiate between the immortal healers that are done on purpose and the ones that happen by chance. <P>Graym<BR>Prophets<BR>Vallon Zek<P>PS: I didnt reread it so disregard any typos. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, it seems like those opposed to #4, just making it GvE, light V dark; are the PK's.  They do not want their possible pool of victims lessened.<P>A few that are against it have 'solutions' that are so unrealistic in the possibility of implementation; that i am surprised they post em.<P>Truth is that now the server has gone to coin only, it has done what exactly what Verant intended the game to be.  More toward player vs environment than PvP.  That handy list of no drop items that could not be looted is no longer viable, and people are questing for better stuff. <P>Also GvE will not destroy any of the Vallon Zek guilds.  Friends are friends and they will still hang out together.  Making the game GvE does force one race only guild to group with members of other races.  It just means you can't gank some soloist of another race who is on your team.  Also, there is always the duel option.  And there is still the guild war option.<P>I have yet to hear of a guild war on Vallon.  And it is the PK guild that always turns down the invitation.  (shanks turned down KotAo, Die klilen Strohlen turned down one also)<P>In order to focus the game on Player v environment, PK needs to be made tuffer not easier.  (coin only was a great step) Now a 2 team system, does not eliminate PvP, it focuses the game back to the intention of PvE.  And i believe it strengthens Roleplaying.  Many quests are multiple town related and are designed GvE already.<P>I only have two characters over lvl 3 in the game, both barb, one tank one shaman.  From the other posts i have read on Vallon board, most PK's have multiple races that are both G and E.  One had a DE caster (back in item loot days) and a barb warrior; they would camp both in Blackburrow, kill a barb with the caster, loot the item and drop it.  Then log on as the barb warrior and pick the item up.  The lamest thing i had ever heard of, and not in the Verant 'vision' thingy.<P>Just make it GvE, The current race only guilds can stay race only.  They just cannot PK as many folks as they once could, and they are more focused on PvE.  the Best solution there is <P>Chief<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There should be a limit on beneficial spells on ALL servers.  It just is the MOST necessary on the PvP servers.   <P>Why should a 50th level guy be able to heal a 10th level guy...but a 50th level guy cannot kill that same 10th level guy?   The only benefit for a 50th level being able to heal a 10th level is for the following:<P>1. Twinking<BR>2. Cheating in PvP<P>Both reasons suck.  Get rid of them.  Twinking sucks and High level healers in low level PvP fights, suck.  SOunds like a no brainer.<P>*hurries to finish twinking shaman in case they implement this*.<P>Gray<P>PS  As a final note.

The above sggestion might work i think. Unless someone points out otherwise. Oh dueling should incur faction hits tho.

</FONT><HR>the short-term limit on buffing/healing from higher lvls would be nice (a few min after a person is attacked, or til they zone), but with a gradually widening range to keep it in line with the lvls you can group with.  Abashi mentioned himself that there would be an abuse that would make the healer in the group ineffective.  IF the range for allowing heals/buffs keeps in line with the lvls you can group with, that would be the most fair.  Then a lvl 39 healer with a lvl 30 in their group could continue to get healed.  I've had groups that ranged from 30-43, and i would hope that as long as the lvl 30 got exp, that they would be able to receive healing and buffing from a higher lvl groupmate.  THe best course of action is to implement the no heals or buffs from someone outside their lvl range to get exp, so that a lvl 50 would be limited to higher lvls, yet could continue to heal a lvl 40 in their group if a member of an opposing team attacked a group member.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, <BR>First I’d like to say thanks for the thought Verant has put into this it sounds like a good idea to me (except for the GVE part, I like the 4 team aspect of the server).  I like both idea 1 and Idea 2<P>I don’t have a RL problem with people cross-teaming in PVE but I do have a problem with people x-teaming in PVP.  I like your proposed solution of disallowing x-team spell assistance for a finite period of time after PVP combat is started.  I think this should also apply to team members outside the +/- 8 level limit when they are in PVP combat<P>One possibility for change might be to start the timer running when you initiate/respond to conflict with someone on the other team rather than just when they hit you.  IE you attack someone or attack back and then the anti x-teaming & high level buffing timer starts.  This is just an idea though, Id rather see something implemented than sit around and talk about a theoretical perfect solution that might be implemented after I’m dead.<P>From a RP perspective I don’t see any more of a problem with this than with why we cant attack our own team.  Obviously the gods of Norath are enforcing some kind of moratorium on conflict within your own team so why not extend it somewhat in this manner.  Perhaps there is a contest of some kind going on with the gods that we are all a part of to see who will control the universe.  As part of this contest the gods might also want each low level members of a team to prove their own worth in PVP in a fair manner thus disallowing very high lvl chrs from assisting low level members in pvp.<P>Thanks for the ideas.  I only play on the PVP servers now.  When they came out my interest in Everquest was renewed and I will never go back to a non pvp server.  I enjoy the feeling of danger knowing that there are intelligent opponent in the game that might be plotting my downfall and who wont forget about me just because I cross a zone line.  I don’t enjoy being ganked by someone who I have no possible chance of even harming because someone is assisting them completely beyond my level range or hiding on my team.<P>Thanks, <P>Yeeluth<BR>Iksar Monk – Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes Bullmer's suggestions seem simple enough and should fix the problems and make the majority happy. I really like it.<P>I play on VZ (yes, the x-teaming server) with my 45 Elf Enchanter, and i have a lot of fun, but...<BR>To respond to those people that think PvE shouldn't be harder then the blue servers (yes, the x-teamers). Well it is harder! blah! Stop being jealous of the uber guilds on blue servers that can kill dragons fast, get loot, and repeat next week. They have access to all the loot and dungeons; they can group with any race/class; they can just go do quests/loot/exp all day (what else can u do on blue servers? =). They dont have to worry about "RACE WARS" going on, The enemy trying to invade your homelands etc, etc.<BR>In other words they are playing the game with difficulty: Easy, and that’s fine if they are having fun. I wanted to play this game with a regular difficulty and to have some fun doing fights, wars, and roleplaying. I know I may never spend more then an hour at a time in Lguk, if it was a challenge to take control and BE there, and that’s what was fun for me.<P>To get back to the point… let’s do what Bullmer said!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I posted this on the origional thread, but in case the focus has shifted i will cross-post it here. (and fix some spelling and clear up my language)<P>While there is nothing wrong with the idea technicaly, it is flawed philosophicaly. I don't like crossteamers, but the varing ideas about how to play the game are esential to the game. I would rather have contempt for a player because i know he helps lighties than because the game only allows me to attack his kind. It is not verant's job to make people play their charictor in certain ways or with certain values. <P>People need someone to hate. It is a release in the game and if we did not have these crossteamers the hatred would find other (less deserving) targets. At the very least it should be up to the individual player to choose a team knowing that that choice has reprecussions within the community.<P>Also why should a high level cleric (like me) be kept from patroling Nek healing up those of my race who are defending the land from those who would ruin it. If chance (sneeking up) mobs are part of the game, why should a pk not have to be conserned about attacking someone who is near a higher level friend. Limiting higher-lower interaction unessarily limits the community bonds and feeling of interdependance.<P>How would you define race? Some on pvp feel that a human/elf team is a crossteam. others believe that it is light/dark. If the community can not decide, why should you?<P>note: in your post you only mention race, not leavel. but because the examples mention lvl restrictions i assume that was an oversight. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think that changing to Good Vs Evil would be the best thing to ever happen to PvP teams servers.  I also think that disallowing cross-team healing/buffing would be a great idea, but i dont think that a lvl restriction on healing buffing is a good idea.   Some times i trade buffs for food and water, or ill buff someone if they are nice, or i will be running through nektulos and see a newbie getting beat on by a fire beetle and decide to heal him, that would just take all that away.  Out of range healing isnt really a big problem, some people just try to make it seem like one.  I really do think that the servers should be changed to good vs evil, or at least VZ should but, only prolem would be "good" people being put on the evil team  (human sk's and necros's) that would have bad faction with his team mates.  Making it so no factoin hit would prevent that from happening though, just people with already bad faction may have a problem.

Then, to add to that make it so that good cannot help evil and vice versa.  As far as having a lvl 50 around to buff and heal . . . So be it.  I mean people have lvl 50's around all the time on the regular server to help them lvl faster.  Its all part of who has friends and who doesn't.

</FONT><HR>I'm a Troll, and people know me for it, but for the sake of brevity, I'll not bother with the toothsome talk.<P>PVP is broken in a number of ways, but not irrepairably. So as not to touch on, or otherwise inundate this thread with other problems and potential solutions, I'll stick to the matter at hand: invulnerable healing and cross-teaming.<P>Fact of the matter is, the teams are unbalanced. The orange/evil team easily numbers the same as all three other (shorts/elves/humans) 'good' teams. This still continues today, although the balance has at times shifted and swung like a pendalum. (For most of TZ's existance, the evils actually outnumbered all three other teams.)<P>In this, I find that Abashi's third option presents the most pronounced possibilities for change. TZ has, from the beginning, been Good vs Evil. We embrace this. Not only that, but the server population makes this necessary. Troll and ogre warriors do not cross-team with 'lights' (the other three teams) so they can conceivably 'do GvE.' They're not needed. They have barbarian, human, dwarven, et al, warriors that may not be as good, but that's subjective, and they succeed.<P>Invulnerable healing on our server is an exploit, and nothing more. It's used for this purpose, and nothing else. (Since the server will never accept cross-good/evil-teaming for the planes or high level areas, nor does it allow this for low level adventuring either.) And in this, not only does it mirror the belief and eco-system on TZ, but it also dispels the problems brought up by Abashi, with the least impact and no drawbacks to our Team-PVP. (Good/evil crossteaming will never happen. And the 'out of level buffing/healing clause if someone attacks' WILL be abused, just for spite. It opens up a whole new issue to deal with for CS in lieu of the problem it fixes. That is not advantageous.)<P>Anyway, that's my two copper.

</FONT><HR>You've captured the solutions perfect Abashi:<P>Both of these are solutionS need to be implemented to make this a true Racewars server "and" eliminate invulnerable healers.<BR>1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<BR>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<P>Granted, this isn't going to thrill the G vs E community, but this is what how racewars was inteneded to be designed.  Four Teams, competing against one another.  The fact that many (not all) of the good races have treaties not to attack each other, should have nothing to do with the game design, and promoting a true Racewars scenario.<P>This doesn't stop cross racing traitors from grouping together, fighting together etc..This  simply means, that there will be some limitations to what extent they can help each other.  I think this is a wonderful improvement.  It puts the Racewars back into Racewars and it should have been the design from the start.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There's another problem with this change from a "lightie" point of view that would totally make evils own on PVP teams:<BR>A group of 2 highelf casters, 2 barbarian warriors, 2 dwarven clerics (class doesn't matter, but this is just an example). Group is suddenly attacked by a group of 3 orcs. Highelf caster tries to get an AoE spell off without hitting group, but accidentally hits one Barbarian warrior. Barbarian warrior is taking heavy orc damage as well and dwarf cleric is trying to heal him...but wait. He was just attacked by a player and cannot be healed. One dead barbarian.<P>Another scenario, same group. Barbarians go in to tank. One of the dwarf clerics decides he also wants to melee, but accidentally clicks his groupmate instead of enemy. Barbarian is hit once by cleric, rendering him unhealable by group.<P>This scenario only works to the advantage of darkies. (especially on Tallon, where darkies are as huge as all other light teams combined.) And greatly impacts PvE for light teams, since they really need to group with each others teams to be effective sometimes.<P>I see the other instances mentioned to be problems, and (at least for tallon) Xteamers are labeled as such and hunted. <P>Perhaps you can use the over 8 levels and cannot cast benificial spells on teammates (which would aid in curbing powerlevelers too)<P>As for the suggestion of no benificial spells if person is attacked by another player...you can see by my examples that I'm not so sure if that is a good idea. Light teams need each other. Humans support elves who support dwarves against the dark threat. A team of differing light teams are already severely disadvantages due to AoE spells. If you add to that a team of darks who can take any lighty mix team due to the fact that the lighties can't support each other, you've got some real PvP problems that are now worse than the ones you started with.<P>So now you have grave impact with PvE for lights, and PvP for lights with the proposed change.<P>Impose an 8 level limit for buffing and healing. That's the only suggestion that has been mentioned thusfar that would not have a negative impact on PvE or PvP as it was intended to be implemented.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ok, i changed my opinion - i like my idea, but i dont see it happen ever... so the second possibility i would prefer is: good vs evil based on race, deity and class.<P>On Tallon Zek - the server has always been light vs dark.... most of the original population lived that way... now some newbies are emerging that only see pvp as a matter of anarchy, not RPG.<BR>Many of the longtime players there feel sad about this - but they dont know a better place, so they are still here.... and hoping for a change.<P>So the best option would be to open a new server and make it good vs evil based on race, deity and class. The three PvP server are existing for a long time now, the population is raising, so its time for something new.<BR>Then let the Tallon and Vallon players move to this server if they like - the pro-4teamers then still have their place an tallon and vallon.<BR>Everyone is happy.<P>If thats not possible, then i would appreciate if when vallon or tallon is changed to good vs evil, and the ones on the other server get the option to move.<P>Me, and my friends came to Tallon Zek because we knew it would be 4teams which changed into good vs evil - we liked the roleplaying-aspect and put a lot of work into our live there - its sad to see how all this wents down, and you know many others feel the same way you do, but you cant do much against a flood of newbies and quake-gamers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I beleive the good versus evil idea would work best.<P>This not only promotes roleplaying, but also each of the "lightie" teams alone do not have the numbers to fight the "darkie" team. If they align, then they have a chance on both servers of withstanding fights with the "darkies".<P>As well, the healing/buffing being disabled across teams aspect would prevent invulnerable healers of the team type, but still allow invulnerable healers of the level type. Level invulnerable healers can be handled by joining in groups and guilds with others who can help protect you. This encourages the grouping/guilding aspects of the game. Also, often times higher levels enjoy helping lower levels (ex: high level cleric being nice and buffing those in a newbie zone), and this would still be a possibility.<P>If an ingame vote could be taken, this type of issue would work quite well to obtain a general concensus of what people would prefer.<P>Thank you again for your continued consideration of the minority PvP groups.<P>~Old School PvPer<BR>Rallos Zek to Vallon Zek since Day 1</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>yep, it would also promote roleplaying...<P>- some people posted that the gods in norrath are less important and changing this would promote RP: but most ideas were a little to hard to implement and would affect PvE<BR>- some people called for a Server labeled "Roleplay": but everyone has a different definition of this, so it didnt happen<BR>- many people on the Team-PvP servers are concerned about crossteaming or PvP-Exploits - but there isnt an easy solution to this<P>So making a new server, dark vs light based on race, deity and class would make everyone of the above happy.<P>Gods have an impact on gameplay, so they become more important in conversations. Together with light vs dark this really would be the dream for most of all the roleplayers across the servers (also the blues).

</FONT><HR>No please don't do anything about this supposed "problem". I had never seen, nor known that the "invulnerable healer" problem WAS an actual problem, but merely a situation created by the server ruleset.<P>If you were to make my buffs and heals only effect other players within 8 levels of my own, then I simply have that much less of a desire to play EQ at all anymore.<P>My greatest joy as a shaman in this game is being able to cast my "super buffs" and heals on people vastly lower then myself. I spend hours merely helping lower level characters with this effort. At times, this is also the ONLY way I can participate in the wars that errupt. Why shouldn't I be able to help other on my team, regardless of level?<P>Why would you to force me to ignore the injuries and pains of others, merely becuase they are too low in level for me to help?<P>So many times you ask players to rely on each other in order to play your game. Well, this "invulnerable healer" situtation is simply another fact of these terms. If there is a healer in the area too high to be attacked, then the players have to call for someone within that level range to take out this healer. That is how is has always been dealt with.<P>Now I am merely speaking about the situation of level difference. If you plan on addressing the other "problem" of having a player on the same team helping the other team, then you will need to address the REAL problem of cross teaming on this server.. which is this "light vs dark" BS.<P>In short, I am against placing level limits on who I can or can not cast my spells upon. Like I stated, I do not play on a "blue" server, so if you limit my experince in PvP - teams, you will be ruining EQ for me.<P>If others merely say good riddence to me, then fine. All I EVER do in this game is help others. So you will be losing one of the few honorable players left on this server.
