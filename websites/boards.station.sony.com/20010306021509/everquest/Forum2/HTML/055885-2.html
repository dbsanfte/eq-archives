</FONT><HR>Oh yeah I forgot, it would be kinda cool since mages don't get any sort of illusion if the Phantom armor actually made you look equipped in what it was. Everything but a helmet (like npc's) I don't imagine this would take much fixing or altering anything in the global file.  and anyone that wouldn't like the look could de-equip and re-equip their robe fast to cancel the effect on their look and/or make the "illusion" part go away when you zone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Harach, obviously a large number of people disagree with you.  In fact, not only do I disagree with you, I personally don't think we need improved invisibility either, but considering the only difference between it and regular invisibility is a fixed duration, it's too minor for me to care.<P>All of these items are fairly minor fixes that would solve a LOT of mage aggravation.  Noone is asking to be made twice as powerful (well, noone being serious), so how does that make this whining?  It's a class talk thread for crying out loud.<P>So just continue trolling along somewhere else, ok?<P>Leo.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not a mage, but why would mages ask for new pet graphics? Didn't you get Monster Summoning(pet that looks like random monsters!) Shouldn't that be pretty much IT for diff pet graphics? Also the epic is one huge elemental i've heard. Can't your pets be bigger than normal or small? I do see the point with enchanters getting their pets a little more different though, maybe even shadow knights getting a different looking pet quest. I think mages are good in this area already though<P>Also I think mages are pretty balanced imo, call of the hero is a awesome spell, as is the pet which backstabs.<P>Also I think the mages main offensive spell should be conjuration. Whats the deal, not conjure up flying spikes instead of evocating spikes? Doesn't make sense.<P>Just a few of my opinions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some things I do NOT WANT MAGES TO GET (my primary is a 49 mage, so don't think this is class envy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">):<P>- Illusions of any kind -- and I do mean ANY kind.<BR>- Any more damage DoTs or DDs - we have plenty of these.  Some levels are lean, sure, but we can manage (hell, I kicked ass even at 33!)  Resist debuff DoTs would be neat, like one vs. fire and one vs. cold (they would drop mob's resist by 5 points per tick for 10 ticks, and then it would take 10 ticks for the resistances to recover. i.e. the mob's resists go 100, 95, 90, 85, ..., 60, 55, 50, 55, 60, ..., 85, 90, 95, 100.)<BR>- More summons.  I don't think we need any more.  And no matter what we get, they by nature have to be relatively useless compared to regular items that drop off mobs.  WELL... come to think of it there are a couple that would be useful.  Also, let us summon a Bindstone:<P>Spell: Summon Bindstone<BR>Cost: 400 mana and a reagent that costs 12pp (how about a peridot?)<BR>Effect: Summons a NODROP, LORE item with one charge of Bind Self.  Bind Self can only be used in an area where a melee character could be bound by a caster.  i.e. if Teramenor can bind Rusharack in Freeport, then Rusharack would only be able to use the right-click effect of Bind Self when he's in Freeport.  He wouldn't be able to use it in the middle of the East Commonlands.<P>This helps alleviate the melee binding problem a bit.  Having a reagent for it would also mean that people would have to bring a mage a Peridot in order for the mage to cast it.  That way we wouldn't get pestered for bindstones all the time.<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well.", Absor.<P>Mages are not this solo killing machine anymore.  In fact as far as soloing goes.  Hell I would put us tied for 4th on the list, maybe.  Best Solo,<BR>1. Wizard with J-boots<BR>2. Necro<BR>3. Druid<BR>4. shaman-mage, hell shamans solo as good as we do.  At least they have sow and can run a way.<P>Mages go from very strong to pathetic weak in between spell circles.  Take a 33rd level mage.  It is nasty for a 33rd level mage to survive to 34th level.  He did not have an upgrade in DD since level 24!  After he summons about 10 pets he might get one that is not green, and now the most important part of all.  Since that mage is level 33 he hunts stuff con blues to him.  He has two choices.  His pet is so weak to the Mob, he has to nuke real heavy, and risk the Mob killing the mage.  Or he trys to heal his pathetic pet as fast as he can before the Mob kills it.  A 33rd level mage is pathetic at soloing.  A 33rd level druid, necro, or wizard with J-boots can run rings around a 33rd level mage.  Same with a level 43rd mage.  Guess what no increase in DD since level 34!<P>Now most mages don't like DOTs.  Well they don't like the DOTs we have.  Well this is one mage that thinks DOTs could help the mage class out big time.  First move the spell Elemental Malestorm to 39th level.  You might have to modify it's damage I don't want to DOT better than a shaman/necro.  But basically move the spell down to 39th level.  That way we can DOT the monster and it won't agro on us like it will with a DD blast.  Than give us a good DOT in the post 50 spells.  <P>Post 50 Mage spell list,<BR>1. Went from 2nd to 2nd-3rd in DD,<BR>2. Our pets basically got nerfed, they did not progress in power.<BR>3. Yes we got even more horable summon spells post 50.  I mean give me a break.  Bandaids and bread and water at level 51!<P>Absor, the mage class has more useless or 90% useless spells than any class.  This is a fact.  Just look at our summon spells, our DD vs summon creature(when the last time you fought a shadow man).  I mean the mage spell list has a ton of non-useful spells.<P>So in conclusion what I would do.  Give us a DOT spell post 50 and move our 44th level DOT to 39.  PLEASE FOR GOD'S SAKE FIX OUR POST 50 SUMMON SPELLS!  Than give us an upgrade to our 20th level heal spell please.  If our pet dies, mage dies.  MAGES HAVE NO DEFENCIVE SPELLS BY THEMSELVES.  Heck necros got more defencesive spells than Carter has Pills.<P>Absor you feel like a fair guy.  Trust me mages are hurting as a class and need some bennies.  We are anything but uber.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If we did it your way they would be way, way, way too powerful.  I've read your posts, both here and on other sites, and I wanted to show you something.  You never take your suggestion to its full conclusion.<P>Let's do this.  I'll assume that you used the most efficient use of rain spells in your examples.  So let's look at the change you suggest using the most effective use of your version of the spell.  And, for extra fun, let's take one of the worst ratio rain spells and look at it.  Also, keep in mind that at level 29 a magician's DD spells are extremely efficient.  So this might be the 'worst case' scenario for your suggested changes to the rain spells:<P>Level 29 best blast Inferno Shock (110 mana) <BR>Level 29 Rain Spell Lightning Storm (162 mana)<BR>Blast = 1.85 damage per 1 mana <BR>OLD Rain = 1.77 damage per 1 mana<BR>NEW Rain = 5.31 damage per 1 mana.<P>And that's using the least efficient rain spell as the example.  It's more gruesome using the better spells.  This would make rain spells so extremely broken that it is just silly.  It doesn't really matter what you remember GZ saying about this.  Such a spell should not be that efficient just because GZ may or may not have said that it should work that way.  Lower resistances are probably the only thing that might make some sense here.  Keep in mind that rain spells do less damage per tick, therefore their taunt rate is lower than the column spells.  They have their own advantages.  The change that you continue to suggest would be far too much.<P>KindirDBlood wrote:<P>&gt;"is this a post to us or was it supposed to be an email to some staff memebers? i don't get it <BR>&gt;Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet?

If I do not walk my pet allong spamming /pet follow me button then he gets stuck if I get more than 20 feet ahead. I have to wait at every corner and turn him carefully. I usually just kill it and summon a new one at the Emporor room."&lt;<P>Thanks, I do need a list of the worst zones for pathing.  But, dern it, I almost missed it because you were re-listing my list…<P>DrewD wrote:<P>&gt;"- Crushbone. Pets fall in the water a lot. If you run between the castle wall and the outer zone wall, the pets like to move inside the wall (where the orcs are). <BR>- Befallen. My main memory here was of pets wandering through doors and 32k'ing themselves when the door shut. They're not good about sticking close to the master. The earliest no-move-with pet zone I recall. <BR>- Mistmoore. The courtyard has some strange issues, particularly on the hill above the lake, or the little notch on the left as you head down the initial ramp, where pets take large angular wanders into the courtyard to get back to you after a fight. <BR>- Sol A. Pets have trouble with the pathing around the staircases, the "window room" which avoids the swinging blade trap thing, and the path down to the metal doors to the bartender (etc). <BR>- Gorge of King Xorbb. At the "mino altar" (where evil eyes and Lords Syrkyl, Sviir, Soptyvr spawn, along with minos and muddites) there's lot of odd in-across-out pathing. From spots at an angle in front of the altar, pets will run around behind the altar and back over to get to the eye spawn points, aggroing any minos that may be back there. (Eyes and pets do the same on their way to you.) Creatures that patrol in a circle around the altar have trouble reaching PCs up against the wall. Simple side to side steps can make mobs run back to the middle, across, and back to you. (Slow enough to be exploitable, if you're that sort.) <BR>- Yeti caves in Dreadlands. Monsters or pets have a tendency to wander up the mountainside instead of coming into the cave. The paths don't seem to quite match the walls, so NPCs sort of "slide" along the paths at partial speed, instead of heading straight down the tunnels. <BR>- Sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen. There's a sort of forward tower with a bridge that's a really fine place to practice pet control. If you can walk around it and get your pet inside the tower, congratulations! There's also some place where pets on the top of the tower can be attacked through a wall or from under the world. I'm not sure where that path goes, because the pet was effectively vanishing, out of range, an "invis now" situation. <BR>- Najena and UGuk. I remember these as being pretty good. They're both well into the "move, then pet up" phase, so I haven't fallen into most of the problems, I suppose. But I do recall running around most of the easier half of UGuk with an air pet up surprisingly successfully. <BR>- Runnyeye. There's a place just past the goblin warlord + elite guards, off to the right toward the King/Borxx room, where a seemingly infinite amount of goblins get trapped by the wall by the water. Pets would have the same problem wandering around there, I'm sure."&lt;<P>Thanks.  Long list… heh.<P>Anyway, I mostly wanted to drop in and ask you folks to PLEASE stop restating the whole list with comments saying 'I like this'.  Comment on specific ones that you think I'm wrong about, and add new ideas.  But I really need you all to be more concise and help me be able to read these threads.  I don't want to have to start skimming them.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Looks like you HAVE been reading the mage posts after all.  here are my sugestions.<P>Improve a pets taunting ability.  A pet that IS taunting should out taunt a tank in melee that is NOT taunting.  Attack range may be a factor here.  (Mage pets have a long reach)<P>Vary the attack speeds like the were before the duel weild fix.  Fire pets attacked faster.  Give the Air pet far more AC.  (It already has more we are told, but not enough to SEE a difference) Give the water pet a far higher dex for procing.  Increase the damage done by the spells so that is a factor in deciding what pet to choose.  (the spell as of now does less damage than a single punch)  I like the fire pet as a caster, but the spells are far too weak to be of use.<P>Give us a pet complete heal at 49 for double the cost of a new pet.  (400mana)  Or at least a 1k heal for 200mana.  (that’s less than half a 49 earth pets hp)  perhaps require a regent as a new pet would.<P>Mages have some useful summons now and some that are useless.  Basically, the non-weapons are good and the weapons aren’t.  The players understand that you are wary of letting mages ruin the economy with great summoned stuff to newbies but surely there must be a way to let mages summon weapons useful to a group of their own level and not twink the newbies.  Procs with a minimum level are one such way.  They would help us customize our pets too.  The sword of runes is a good weapon.  The spear and 2 hand staves are not.  I suggest:<P>Torch of something:  1hb procs burn (15DD    level 20 and stats to be determined.<BR>Whip of something:  1hs procs stun   (No DD)    level 24 and stats to be determined.<BR>Mace of something:  1hb procs ward undead  (40DD)    level 29 and stats to be determined.<BR>Dagger of something:  pierce procs light healing on wielder   level 34 and stats to be determined.<BR>Spear of something:  pierce procs quickness on wielder   level 39 and stats to be determined.<BR>Arrows of something:  arrows with no proc  level 44 and stats  6 damage and 100 range.<BR>Sword of something:  1hs procs shock of spikes (170DD)     level 49 and stats to be determined.<P><BR>Some new summons of buff stones.  Each of the following is already a spell in the game, I’m suggesting a weaker but longer lasting version the mage can give.  Since these are all ammo slot they can’t stack with each other.<P>Endure XXX stone:  a 10 to 20 point resist buff, one for each type, could be low level or one at higher level gives all resists.  Level 12 or 16<BR>ToughStone:  give some hp and AC.  Level 20<BR>Sightstone:  see invis and ultravision.  (upgrade to coldstone)  Level 29<BR>Faststone:  5% haste  (now that haste stacking is fixed this is very reasonable.  It will not shift the balance of power nor make a newbie godlike but would be useful to many tanks our level)  Level 34<BR>Waterstone:  gives water breathing while worn.  Level 34<BR>Smartstone:  a 5 point Int buff for the ammo slot. Level 39  (far less than the chanter buff)<BR>Wisestone: a 5 point Wis buff for the ammo slot. Level 39  (far less than the chanter buff)<BR>Magicstone:  50mana buff like gift of series.  Maybe add 1 charge of modulate.  Level 44  (higher level that the chanter buff)<P>Mod rod is too weak for its level and mana cost.  Give it more than one charge.  <P>Mages have no mana regen abilities or spells.<BR>I propose that mages get the partial reclaim spell.  It would work only on our pets and would have a lousy conversion rate on the order of 500hp on the pet to 100mana to us.  It perfectly fits the class and is not overpowering by any means.  Give it a low casting cost and a moderate recast time (30 sec)  Level 49.<P>Mages are defenseless.<BR>Mages are the only class that can’t survive a green mob that jumps us unexpectedly.  All other classes have some sort of escape.  For many its root and run.  Stun and run, fear, memblur, snare temporary invulnerability, or mez work too.  A tank just whacks it and is on his way.  Mages alone have no such defenses.  Its have a pet up at all times or get killed.  (or gate home if you can get it off, but then got to travel a long way again)  Having a pet up at all times is not practical due to zoning and pathing problems and due to the fact we can’t have a pet while invis.  <BR>Most mages say root is the answer.  All other casters have it, even hybrids get it (or snare).  Root or snare in any form or by any name would be the answer to many mages dreams (root, snare, summon chains, etc.)<P>Upon login, convert the summoned bag to a nodrop, non-wieght reducing bag so we don’t lose all of our hard earned loot.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I've have played a Magician exclusively for 2 years now (almost) and only have a few things that I have seen in need of attention.  My experience inlcludes raids to the highest level including Velketor, the Dain, Klandikar, Zlandicar etc.<P>Here are my recommended changes:<P>Make us the true masters of summons, give us charm summoned (49), fear summoned (39.  Heck we already have banishment.<P>Add an upgrade to scintilation (I love this spell) at lvl 60.  Perhaps 800 per for 420 mana.<P>Give our bolt spells to druids as they are outdoor spells and give us there DD.  This only makes sense.  If you insist on leaving us with the bolts, increase there damage to match there limited usefullness.  59 spell should be around 1200 dmg.<P>Give us a continued progression of the summon weapon spells (use your imagination).  Sword of runes is 7/27, mod rod is 8/26, lvl 49 weapon would be some proc or stats you deem addequate with a 9/25 stat and go from there.  e.g. 52 would be misc. stat/proc and 10/24, 55 would be 11/23 with misc. stat/proc, 58 (final) would be 12/22 with misc. stat/proc and possibly only castible once per game week.  All of these weapons would be NO RENT and maybe even timed (i.e. they poof after x amount of game hours and have to be recast thus making it necessary to group the magician and not just get the weapon and bolt)<P>Make our illusionary armor just that, an illusion.<P>I agree that the pet heal should be continued.  Make the cost the same as pulling a new pet (i.e. mana and malachite) and only restore pet to 50% or even 75% at a higher lvl.  I would still use this alot.  As it is the lvl 20 spell only heals 1/15 of the pets health which is useless for the mana cost.<P>The summon pet spell needs to be fast casting...but can have a lengthy recast.<P>The DoT series should be cold based and the lvl 55 DoT should be more dmg.<P>Pet sow is nice but I can't see how that is a huge concern.<P>Activate CoH in the plain of Sky, it would make the zone alot more attractive and for gods sake make the items better.   The risk/reward there is just not worth it.  Magician items in sky have charges where as items in the Plain of Growth are permanent effects (which I love btw  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) and the stats from the items in Sky are greatly inferior.<P>The pet immunity to Fear is an awesome idea, I hope it sticks.  In all honesty it should be caster's pet only. (we want to keep this challenging  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P>How about including our pets in the group buffs.  I see the pro's and con's here...soooo.<P>I don't think that removing pets from wave spells is all that overpower and truth be told I only use scintilation anyway as that spell has unlimited mobs and is fast casting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.  That spell is my bread and butter.  An upgrade at 60 would be great.<P>How about making the Greater Voceration pet models the same as golems?<P>just my 2 cp.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The magician epic should be addressed.  The major problem being the earth staff off Innoruk. The drop rate is still extremely rare and even if it dropped every time off of him just getting a chance to fight in hate the day he spawns is extremely difficult.  Every time there is a patch several guilds go to the zone and argue over who has the right to kill Innoruk.  The EPIC fight should be with the monster NOT with other guilds.<P>Please put this item on an equally difficult monster with a faster spawn time.  And when other classes fight their most difficult mob their epic item almost always drops.  With Innoruk the chance is one in 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They just don't cut it for a class that is supposed to be a master at summoning.  Don't be afraid to give extra stats(+INT, etc.) to No Rent items.

Then they get a reagentless pet.  <P>Let me rephrase this.<P>If you die, you have absolutely no way to protect yourself other than nukes which arent powerful enough to kill typically.<P>We have 0 forms of escape spells other than Gate.<P>This really doesent bother me anymore due to my level but the lower lvl magicians could use some help.<P>As for pets being the main reason we are let into high lvl groups.  Well your off there too.  My lvl39 warrior has more damage output than my pet at 56.  Sure I can nuke and get the group drunk off my summoned ale.  But big deal.<P>Since SoV magicians have become a lot more desired due to the fact we sucked so bad in RoK that everything in SoV doesent resis us.<P>My best plea would be to give lower lvl mages a high mana weak stun or even a 5 sec root.  Something that allows them to not die excessivly at lower lvls.  Necromancers receive: Root, Snare, FD, Divine Aura, Mezmerize, Charm, etc..etc..etc..<P>We get Gate.  If that sounds like class envy thats a cop out, necros have pets only a hair less powerful than Magician ones, and their pets fight from behind, thats their purpose.  Its quite obvious we are lacking in that department.<P>Again this wont have any effect on my game, Im 50+  but Ive now level 2 Magicians on 2 servers past 50 as well as a multitude of other classes, I know what Magicians lack all around.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Ideally I'd like a spell that lasted as long as a standard buff...would make me a very happy soul in PvP...about 5-10 minute range would be fine.<P>Escape spell...fast cast gate, yonder, shadow step...you don't have a pet up the whole time when travelling.  If you get jumped by a brownie in LFay or some other nasty see invis mob this would be a huge bonus.  I think this would be better than a root/snare/fear option as those could be used for xp as well...we don't need that, would upset class balance.<P>Pet recall spell...I doubt all the pathing issues will be fixed...so could we have a spell that summons our pet to us?  The addition of clearing aggro on it would be nice, but possibly overpowered...maybe a straight summon at 20 and a summon/clear aggro at 39/44.<P>Lzoril</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My suggestions:<P>Most important:  to be able to command a pet to back off and it will stop fighting even when something is aggroing on it.  This would make us much more welcome in groups with a pet.<P>Mana regen of some kind (partial reclaim energy spell)<P>Better summoned items so people want them, or summoned items that would help us, such as no drop j-boot type spell (see below), summoned sword for pet (no drop) that casts stun.<P>Something to help us flee with no pet:  perhaps a blinding spell?  Fear would be good, and as necros have this, I do not see why it would be unbalancing per se. Fear kiting seems to be the favored method for necros and shadowknights. I would love root or snare, but I understand why this would not be possible.<P>AC buff for the pet. <P>Lose the DOT...it's fun, but not needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahhh finally we can have a discussion about this, thank you for your response, Alan.  Now lets analyze the facts about this line.<P>&gt;" Magicians also suffer more than any other class from the broken nature of AE Rain spells (hint: pets being a valid target is NOT the real problem)."&lt;<P>"Grimstaff, I've read your calculations about how you think rain spells should work. If we did it your way they would be way, way, way too powerful."<P>The problems with this view point are many:<P>-GZ Himself said they are broken as they are done now, and no offense but I'd say the guy who designed the spell system knows much better about what would work and what wouldn't in terms of balance.<BR>-Verant assumed the spells WERE working as I described until we informed them otherwise in January... which means that you guys thought the concept was balanced and not a problem, why the change?<BR>-There are issues you are not paying attention to here.<P>--Three waves, each one is resisted separately, so that instead of the damage being added up, it has to be considered in three different packets.<BR>--The damage is over 12 seconds (3 waves 6 seconds apart) so it has a similar effect as a DOT, it might not even take effect due to the creature dying in that time.<BR>--The area is fixed at a given location, and the monster can physically LEAVE the area of effect, thus negating 1 or more waves entirely.<BR>--Like all AE spells, they will affect the caster, and damage him. <P>In other words, looking at the damage as a single, total package is misleading.<P>"I've read your posts, both here and on other sites, and I wanted to show you something. You never take your suggestion to its full conclusion."<P>Actually I think its really you that have not taken it to its full conclusion.<P>Let's do this. I'll assume that you used the most efficient use of rain spells in your examples. So let's look at the change you suggest using the most effective use of your version of the spell. And, for extra fun, let's take one of the worst ratio rain spells and look at it. Also, keep in mind that at level 29 a magician's DD spells are extremely efficient. So this might be the 'worst case' scenario for your suggested changes to the rain spells:<P>"Level 29 best blast Inferno Shock (110 mana) <BR>Level 29 Rain Spell Lightning Storm (162 mana)<BR>Blast = 1.85 damage per 1 mana <BR>OLD Rain = 1.77 damage per 1 mana<BR>NEW Rain = 5.31 damage per 1 mana."<P>This only assumes that you hit with every wave on every target.  Now, do you have a problem with PBAE spells?  Here's another comparison that you might want to ponder (I run the risk of you freaking out and calling for PBAE to be nerfed here):<P>Level 24 best blast (Frost Shock)= 187 damage(110 mana)<BR>Level 24 best PBAE (Cast Force)= 101 damage (123 mana)<BR>Max targets hit by PBAE at best estimate = 10<BR>Mana efficiency per point of damage by your system = 9.181 damage per 1 mana<BR>Level 24 Rain Spell (Lightning Storm) = 75x3 (162 mana)<BR>OLD Rain = 1.77 damage per 1 mana<BR>NEW Rain = 5.31 damage per 1 mana<P>See how that works?  PBAE is in ONE shot, its drawback is that you have to be near the targets.  Rain does it in THREE shots, the drawbacks being listed above and MUCH more crippling than PBAE.<P>PBAE is balanced.  Rain is not.<P>It doesn't really matter what you remember GZ saying about this. <P>Actually it does matter.  Its not my recollection, it is the truth, if you want the actual EMAIL I can get that sent to you.  The fact is, the word and reactions and ideas of the designer of the spell system for a game has tremendous weight, because he knows the balance of the game and the spells and how they are supposed to work better than anyone else, right?<P>You cannot simply discount the fact he wanted it changed.<P>"Keep in mind that rain spells do less damage per tick, therefore their taunt rate is lower than the column spells."<P>That is the only advantage, and it is easily overshadowed by the disadvantages.  Please, Alan, think through this carefully and get back to us on it.  Magicians everywhere would really be helped by this.<P>3 waves on 4 targets.  That's the fix.  If that is too painful for you, then lower the damage on the rain spells, or make them single target, don't pretend its a valid AE if it gets weaker and less useful the more targets you get.<P>PLEASE lets have a dialog on this, its been a problem for years that Verant recognized and admitted was a problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to say on the battlefield we're pretty balanced.  I'd only suggest minor tweaking there. However, when it comes to non battle oriented skills Magicians seemed to have gotten the shaft.  Wizzards, enchanters, and necros get some basic pure caster abilities, like levitate, water, breathing, invisable, infra/ultravision.  But along with those basic pure caster spells, they also get other abilities, for instance, Wizzards get ports, Enchanters get all those great jewel craft spells, and illusions, aliance etc.  Mages on the other hand, are supposed to fill this gap with summoned items.  But it seems like every item we get to summon, is just a ring or staff with water breathing, or ultravision.  While wizzards are getting Group portals, which can make them rich, Magicians are getting swords that proc ward summoned... When enchanters get Enchant platnium, and wizzards get more portals, the mages are stuck with the staff of symbols.  Yay, see invisable charges on a staff.  I'd say this kind of thing applies to necromancers too.  <P>I hope this is clear.  I'm kinda sick right now and it might be affecting my preformance.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most of thins I read above.<P>Robe of Conjuration: 56 damageshield or Call of the hero would be really nice<P>Pet graphics: At high levels, a new model would be cool. Maybe have our last 4 pets (57-60 spells) be an Efreeti (fire), a Pegasus (Air), a Golem of some kind (Earth) and some kind of water mob model for Water. &lt;--- I'd love this one. Wow!<P>A total new model for epic pet wouldnt hurt at all.<P>Vs boss mobs the shamans always use their 60malo (if you have one), so mage malise line isnt needed here. In groups, 51 malosi for instance, cost 175 mana, long cast and recast and WAY to resisted, on mobs it need to be casted on they wont work/get resisted to much to be worth it, lower resist or manacost.<P>Groupdamageshield: I love the 53 one, but it costs like 3! regular 49ones, and you hardly ever have more then 3 tanks in a group, reduce to 240mana?<P>More pet buffs, and those should not stack, you have to chose one of them to use(stacks with burnout though), to increase the variation on pets and use for them.<P>-Higher agi/ac buff<BR>-higher str buff<BR>-increase regen buff<BR>-make pet proc something buff<P>The pre kunark pets vary in alot of ways, but, as fire pet already is casting a DD, water pet is hardly ever used. Make it not cast at all so you can pick that vs mobs that resist to much/dont need to be casted on?<P>Pick a name for pet or name them player's pet would be really nice (someone tells the guild: who is the owner of that pet?)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Epic: Staff of elemental mastery earth is the very problem here, not that it drop of innoruuk that in himself is a rare and hard to get to, but its a megarare drop. Questgiver tells us to get staff from a minion? or servant? of Innoruuk? Make some mob spawn after Innoruuk is dead (see enchanter epic) that drop the staff - all the times. Can be some harder then Innoruuk himself, doesnt matter as long as it actually drops.<P>The controll summoned line above would be really nice.<P>Make 51+ pet spells quest or something so we can get them, we are the pets, remember?<P>1: Another higherlvl mod rod spell with more charges - better hp-mana ratio<P>2: Another cold stone ammo slot type item with not just ultravision but also see invis, and perhaps some resits<P>3: Mod rod type of item that instead of mana gives HP. At the cost of a stunn or something, as alot of classes dont have mana to lose... (200mana, 2-3 charges of 200hp heal for 5-10sec self stun?)<P>4: Item with charge of 1 point blank AE spell (lose 600hp cast 600dd point blank ae) a small bomb comes to mind <P>5: Item with charges of invisibility.<P>6: Item with charges of damageshield (200mana for 2 charges of lvl39 damageshield as a 50+lvl spell?)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's something worth mentioning.<P>   Pet pathing and control issues are the<BR>biggest detriment to mages.   It's hard to<BR>control pets, and I've been told I'm one of the<BR>best pet handlers by the Enchanters in my guild.<BR>Any ideas how to fix this?   Several have been<BR>floated around, like the /pet ignore attack etc. <BR>What would be fair and balancing in this area?<P>   Looking down your list, it sure looks like<BR>you have everything else.

</FONT><HR>-&gt;No rent items: The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in<BR>time was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution.<BR>-Woot sounds good to me.<P>-&gt;Rain Spells:<BR>-Why use these? I never use this line of spells due to the fact it hits the pet with one wave. 99% of the time I'm fighting I'm using my pet. The spell doesn't do enough damage to justify using it while hitting your pet, moreso when you have resistance checks on each wave. I would rather slam the mob with one of my regular nukes and save some of my pets health for more tanking. About the only situation they are good for is fighting giants, since they seem to take all the waves upon them.<P>-&gt;New summoned weapons:<BR>-This has been discussed in depth in the Mage Summoning tread. Would like to see new weapons for mid levels, and perhaps upgrades to existing ones ie Modulating rod(more charges, or higher mana return rate would be nice), summon snake fang.<P>-&gt;New pet heal:<BR>-I would like to see a new pet heal at the higher level, perhaps at level 39 or 44. At these levels the level 20 is almost not worth the time or mana spending to cast, even less worthy now that 39+ pets get auto dualweild, would you cast heal or cast a new pet? Many I think would agree would cast a new pet.<P>-&gt;New pet graphics:<BR>-High level ones sure, not really a priority I don't think.<P>-&gt;Pet names:<BR>-Err sure... would probably use it during downtimes, got nothing better to do while I sit waiting for mana. It also as stated, leaves a place for abuse with unappropriate names, heh something Verant has been cracking down on lately it seems. A better option as mentioned, have the pet take on their master's name ie Klass's Pet.<P>-&gt;Dots?<BR>-Why did we get this? Mages are all about power, take their target down as fast as they can. The longer you stay in battle the worse off you and your pet are meaning longer downtime. Which all mages try to cut down on since we don't get any mana regening resources, other than mod rod at 44, which is more like storing away mana for a rainy day. <P>What I would very much like to see implemented is a new line of spells. Our spells right now consist of two types - magic and fire based. For the masters of summoning elements thats kind of limiting. Instead of the dot's a new line of Conjuration Ice based spells would have been nice.<BR>Our Malise line of spells are nice but they only help with one line of our nukes - fire based.<P><BR>-&gt;Improved Invisibility:<BR>-Why not us? we're casters too! Think someone forgot about us.<P>-&gt;Pet Health Bars: It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<BR>-WooT, very nice idea. Would be useful for healers of the party as well.<P>-&gt;Phantom Armors:<BR>-I love this line of spells, I'm glad I'm getting type of regening happening in my downtime.<BR>The only problem is the overwriting of the other spells in its line, clerics mostly but necros buffs as well. While I would take a clerics buff gladly any day, sometimes its nice to have your regen armor on. Please allow for other buffs placed on you to be left clicked off.<P>-&gt;Voice Graft! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please! Oh Please!<BR>If verant is looking for more ways to add some fun into a mage's lineup, don't look any further, this spell would be fun, as seen with necros. If this does get added to the spells lineup then I would suggest forgetting about the ability to edit your pets name.<P>-&gt;Summon fireworks<BR>-hmm interesting party type idea Secias  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>we got food, we got beer, we got bandages for accidents, now some fireworks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
