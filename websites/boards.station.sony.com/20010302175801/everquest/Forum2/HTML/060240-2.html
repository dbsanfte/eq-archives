</FONT><HR>Personally, even though I'm a founder of a pure team elven guild on Vallon Zek, I don't think you need to go as far as disallowing the grouping and buffing/healing in between teams.<P>Here's my suggestions:<P>1) Add faction hits when somone they were healing dies to or kills the person they are fighting (some sort of time limit flagged for pvp in that zone). <P>2) Heals, damage sheilds, and buffs should be based on the level of person on the recieving end, not the caster of the spell, in PvP. This would put an end to the OOR/Immortaling we deal with on a daily basis. <P>3) Damage sheilds in PvP should be nerfed along the same lines as DD and DoTs.  As a well equiped rogue at level 35, I pierce 3-4 times per round, about every 2 seconds, for a max of 20-30 damage each.  If I'm fighting a 39 mage, his firesheild does 18-20 damage (One of those two), regardless of fire resist, level, etc.  This, in my opinion, is terribly unbalanced.<P>4) Thanks for fixing the LoH and HT problems.  Please don't change them back, it was an exploit.<P>5) Fix caster Line of Sighte exploits (Nuking from platforms underneath you, behind walls, inside of buildings, etc.), levitating above melee/arrow range, so that a lamer caster couldn't be completely invulnerable to melees in certain situations.<P>6) Fix banker faction so you can raise it along with merchant factions.<P>7)PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Take the faction hits away from duels and arena combat.<P>8) Why am I still taking damage shield damage with ranged attacks?<P>Ok, I think that's my major concerns.  Thanks for opening this thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, I hope they listen to us!<P>Here's my wish list:<P>1)  Make the availability of dungeons/zones equal to all teams.  For example, give the short team a place to hunt at 40-50th that is near a zone controlled by them.  Give the elves a place to hunt from 40-50th that is near them.  As it stands now, you can't play PVP teams hardcoded if you're an elf or a short--it's much harder due to availability of zones to those races as compared to darks/humans.  Look at the zones that are commonly in control by darks--Sol A, B, Najena, Guk, for example. . .look at the places commonly in control by humans. . .it's not very balanced.<P>2)  Make faction hits for PVP duels non-existant, including arenas.<P>3)  Encourage a little more roleplaying by making it impossible for a player of one religion to heal another if their god disagrees with the other player's god.  (Or fix the geography if you're going to hard-code teams into the servers)  Darks shouldn't be grouping with elves or humans or shorts unless those elves/humans/shorts worship a like-minded god.  But what are you going to do about necros and SKs then?<P>4)  Bring back self-only instant-effect pumice, especially for warriors.  I can easily get rid of a warrior on my tail by using the water, the hill bug, or a myriad of other ways.  Pumice evens the score a little.<P>The reason why Tallon Zek was Lights vs. Darks for so long is because the Darks had unity hard-coded into their game, and Darks had control of Guk, Sol A & B, Oasis, etc.  Darks could level up from 1-50 in relative peace, while Lights fumbled around.  Why do you think this is?  And with the advent of Kunark and Velious, how does this change the balance?<P>Is it logical for shorts and humans and elves to group with each other?  With a few exceptions, yes, it is.  Is it logical for darks to group with any other team?  With a few exceptions, no, it's not.  Don't hard code the teams unless you can be sure that you're balancing the game for all teams--elves would get slaughtered on a hard coded PVP teams server, followed by shorts, followed by humans, and finally darks.  If you can't balance it, don't make it hard-coded, but try to do something about same-race invulnerable healing against a PVP opponent. . .perhaps give a 4-8 level limit and make anyone hittable to anyone else?<P>Thank you for listening, I hope my words help.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ARKONS.  No, i do not belong on a blue server.  You are flaming me for my opinion that the PK guilds have too much of an advantage over the good folk of norrath simply because of their willingness to murder their fellow player.  Reread your post and you’ll see that you accuse me of complaining about my gear being taken.  I did not in any way complain about that, I wholeheartedly am in favor of item loot.  What i DID say, was that Pks in full PvP blue diamond resist gear face little to no risk against victims in their PvE gear.  If you took that as a complaint about item loot, im sorry, you need to  read a little closer.   No, it was a complaint about an easy kill.  I do not care about items i lose, I can easily buy another.  I’m level 35 now, and my complaint is being murdered by someone who I cannot kill because the lvl 60s in his guild twinked him with platinum jacinth and blue diamond resist gear that no one should be able to get for PvP until they are in the planes.  And furthermore, being ganked at low health is NOT , as you say, “being bested”.   It is simply the willingness to murder and steal, although I am not complaining because I’ve done it too.  I’m simply saying that the higher ups in the uber PK guilds twink their lower members with the above mentined uber-resist gear, and a goodie caster has about the same chance of killing a PK caster in full blue diamond resist as a true level 10 has of killing a level 30 deleveller.<P>As for calling you one of those uber-pks, I apologize, because your board name here happens to be the in-game name of a member of an uber-pk guild.  Or maybe you ARE him, but left that guild or bought the account, I do not know.<P>One more thing -  I didnt say pumice should be back unnerfed, simply that it should not remove harmful effects first.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Gaurd training is a serious problem on PvP teams servers.<P>10) Add rez effects when killed by another player, nuff said.  You guys did the whole "no mana or memed spells when respawning" thing, now fix this.  It will be the first step to end bind rushing.<P>11) PLEASE train your guides better.  Every single guide and GM that I've delt with on PvP issues ALWAYS has a different opinion/descision/rules on the same matter.  Its like they make up their own rules.  Some of them even come from blue servers, and give warnings for engaging in PvP at all it seems.  Please give us better Customer support on PvP servers.  Sometimes it takes up to 4 hours to get a petition answered.<P>12)  Make a published set of rules, that Guides and GMs have to follow on team PvP servers.  It seems like no one goes by the same set of rules.  Of talked to some really clueless guides.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>reply to response to Emuqum<BR>Any change which destroys 2 years of friendship and guilds in order to end a PvP exploit OOR or invulnerable healers is far more devastating to the community than l can even begin to say. I know that the server was planned as 4 teams, but evolved as a Light Dark. Next came one team guilds in force and now we have a large crossteam guild which has in it 50% of the server 55 plus folks. I am aware of the limits and difficulty my guild and others have had dealing with such a powerful 4 team guild. We however have dealt with it as best we could and continue to deal with it ever day. Forcing many to disband our guilds because the server may be hard coded for 4 teams would be the largest mistake Verant could make. After 53 levels it is clear PvP is never going to be entirely perfect. The game is clearly not built for it for a myriad of reasons, many of which are already posted. I would rather leave a zone of fight an oor healer than give up a group of friends. As a side note several races would be at an extreme disadvantage in any hard code to 4 teams and evil races as they were for awhile would again outnumber all or most of the other teams.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, I play on Rallos Zek and this is what i think.<P>1) Please do something about delevelers, there is nothing more irretating than being pked by a monk that has deleveled from 20+ to 10..<P>2) Keep loot coin and one item.. There is very little twinks on the server and that is great gives everyone a chance.. Plus the extra fun when you know that you can loose that one item you have worked hard to get. (People it is only game!)<P>3) You could create a NPC that people could got to, to turn in a armor type and some money and get back the same armor type but it is no drop.. This could help the warriors.<P>4) Why not remove the procentage of damage and let all spells do there max damage if not resisted and put pumice back for the warriors. And let Enchanters charm and let fear work.. Would this not cause more team work.. Pure PvP combat.. <P>5) Give xp loss for pk death but not lvl lost. You keep your current lvl but loose xp to the begining of that lvl.<P>6) If you add faction hits you also have to added faction quest so one can raise ones faction again.. These quests should not be easy but should exist.<P><BR>Thanks..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Verant wishes to fix only ONE thing, please let it be invulnerable healing.<P>I see a few ways of doing this:<P>1.  Hardcode the teams.<P>2.  Code it so that when someone is attacked by a person, someone not of their team can't heal them.<P>3.  Hardcode the teams, and then open up a fifth team, which would be done by handing in your "Book of Discord".  (If this was done faction hits would have to be changed.)<P>I am willing to go with any of those three, as long as there is NO invulnerable healing.<BR>---<P>Some other problems:<P>1.  Deleveling.  This is done when someone that is higher level, experience kills themselves over and over and over, so that they become lower level.  (This is mostly Rogues.)  This results in HUGE damage, killing lower levels in just a few hits.  Just fix this by haveing skill loss upon death.  If your skills are maxed for a level 30, and you delevel to level 20, your skills should be reset to level 20.<P>2.  OOR Healing.  This problem mainly occurs at the lower levels.  It happens when a lower level character goes out to PvP, and a Higher level character follows.  At lower levels it virtually makes the person being OOR Healed (and buffed) invulnerable.  (The worst are Druids.  How do you like fighting someone with thorns that do more damage than your health per hit at level one?)  The simple (and fair) solution to this is this:  If someone attacks you, there should be a check before someone heals or buffs you.  A check which looks to see if you are in the attacker's range.  If not then you can't heal the person.  <P>3.  AE Spells.  This is mainly for those who play on Rallos, I believe that this change should not effect the PvP Teams server.  There should be some penalty for cross teaming.  Anyway, perhaps there could be some type of command created so that when you cast an spell it doesn't effect other people.  Something like:  /pvpoff and /pvpon.<P>/pvpoff would make it so when you cast a spell (or even try to hit someone) it looks as if they are out of your range.  HOWEVER, people can still attack you with this command active.  (Meaning you should never be immune to PvP.)<P>/pvpon will do the reverse of /pvpoff, making things normal.  <P>This would solve that problem pretty well, and seems like the only logical solution.<P>Those are all the main things that need to be fixed, but I just ask Verant to PLEASE look at Invulnerable healing.  Fix it so that it is no longer a problem for us.  <P>Thank you for addressing the PvP concerns,<P>Melara X`Shain<BR>Officer of:<BR>Liberation of the Underfoot</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Comments are directed toward Vallon Zek<P>1) Eliminate cross team healing and buffs.  It sucks to be a human fighting a dwarf and a human druid is healing/damage shielding/buffing the dwarf and you can't do a darn thing about someone on your own team helping an enemy. This is a bad thing.<P>2) Leave getting buffs/heals from high level players as is (long as they're received from same team members).  It's nice to get high level buffs and stuff when exping.<P>3) Eliminate faction hits for dueling members of your own race. If you and friends on your team want to practice PvP you lose faction within your home city.  This is plain stupid.<P>4) Gnome Clerics should be given a new spell called Ward Forestal.  It should be extremely mana efficient, say 1 mana to 250 damage and work on any human team player in High Pass and High Keep.<P>Gnorville<BR>Cleric 21<BR>VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play on Tallon Zek.<P>If you make this change, abruptly, to a already in play server, I will be extremely disappointed.  I'm already hanging onto my Everquest desire by a thin enough thread as it is; if you hard code the server after all this time, uncool.  My character has developed in the world of the server AS IT EXISTED.  I have friends and commrades who are not on my team; to force me to leave them is extremely uncool.<P>If you change the PVP Teams to hard coded teams, you MUST enable a server split/move for those who no longer wish to play under that environment.  If you're going to rip me from my friends (many of whom are not my team), I would rather play on a new server than remain there.  To tell me "sorry, your played days are on that server and we're not movin' 'em" ... that'd be even more uncool than changing to hard coding.<P>And just so you know, the teams on Vallon / Tallon are *not* balanced in respect to PVE.  The short team lacks feign pullers of any kind (no Monks, no Shadow Knights) and also lacks Shamans.  The elven team shares this disadvantage.  For PVE purposes on the Team servers, only the Human and Dark teams have all the tools needed to successfully level and raid for loot needed to be successful in high level PK.<P>Don't change the server without giving us the option to change servers first.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Dave's World<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>Thank you for at least starting this discussion.<P>Many of these posts talk about compeletely re-writing the game and I don't think that is within the scope of what you are trying to accomplish.<P>If you fix OOR and Invulnerable healing you will solve 80 percent of the frustration with the game.<P>How about adding a 50 percent experience penalty if you are grouped with someone from another team as an extra bonus to solving the above?<P>I would support the hard coding of teams. Of course, I'm on TZ and play in an all-short PvP guild (GO LotU!)<P>Your idea a few months ago about a PvP flag preventing beneficial spells being cast by non-teammates was a good one, but would lead to people running up and hitting an elf while he/she is engaged with a MOB then running away and letting them die and thus get exp killed.<P>Bottom Line: Find a way to stop Invuln/OOR healing.

At least those are my thoughts on the matter.<P>Absor, this would have been fine if you thought through it at the beginning.  But we have spent over a year developing friendships and communities that would be destroyed by such a change.  If you do this, you will not be fostering communities, you will be showing us that you have utter disdain for the communities we have worked to build.  And please, you know it is ridiculous to expect someone who has played a character for over a year and through 50+ levels to just start over so he or she can stay with the guild.<P>There are other options, please PLEASE look for one.  Someone suggested that you code it in such a way that cross-team healing cannot take place for a period of time after a character takes offensive PvP action--this would eliminate same team invulnerable healing in PvP while leaving the PvE game basically untouched (except for when the two mix, which would be ugly but better than nothing.)  I know it would be significantly harder to code, but it would be far better for the community.  The biggest problem with invulnerable healers is healers who are out of the level range anyway, not same team healers.  Change it so that you cannot heal or buff someone whom you could not group with for experience (you would have to do it this way rather than 8 levels or it would once again seriously damage the PvE game.)  You have lots of options to consider that will show us that you value the friendships we have built.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>[This is just a repost of mine, from the other thread  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ]<P>Why are there 2 PVP Teams servers? I know when Tallon Zek first opened, it was way overloaded so you maked Vallon also.. but I just don't see why we need 2 of the same exact type of pvp server. I know Tallon is played more a light vs dark server among the majority, I can't speak for Vallon as I've never been there...<P>But what if you did it like this.. Choose 1 server and hard code the teams to get rid of invulnerable healers, etc. Choose the other and hard code it to be TWO teams, good and evil, and have the deity you worship be what chooses your team. If you happen to be agnostic then it would be your race that determines it (agnostic high elf would be good, agnostic dark elf would be evil, etc). Maybe you can call it Order vs Chaos or something &lt;shrug&gt;<P>Have it hard coded that you can't:<P>1) Cast a beneficial spell (buff, heal, etc) on the opposite team<BR>2) Group with the opposite team<BR>3) Trade with the opposite team (maybe)<P>And, of course, when this change is made, allow people to movelog themselves to either server, or even to Rallos maybe as well? This way the folks that want good vs evil can play that way, and the folks that want teams like it is now can play that way too.<P>Oh and also keep both servers coin only loot but get rid of the faction hits in pvp <P>--Eldrad on Tarew Marr<BR>--Sorcen on Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is always a team with smaller numbers, lack of classes, etc etc.  There should be a way of killing off invul healing. I xteam, and have a blast doing it, the pve, the pvp...but I don't nessesarily like invul healing, tho I do it anyways, cause if my options are to be an ass and invul heal, or watch my guild mate die, I will chose to be the ass.  Guild war server would be wonderful, however there are a *LOT* of guildwar bugs that need to be worked out.  I think a guild vs guild server would be the best option, many can say thats what RZ is, but its not.  RZ anyone can group / heal / atk anyone, with different level limits, and item loot.<P>*IF* VI decides to hard code teams on team servers, you had best also offer a /movelog to *NON-PVP SERVERS* as well as VZ / RZ.

</FONT><HR>Coding the teams isn't JUST for OOR healing though it is the main concern. I have always enjoyed the COMPETITION that the teams/Lights,Darks have had attaining differant goals in the game as well as attempting to control differant territories.<P>Examples include as with me being a dark.<P>I'd like to hunt in Mistmore, looks like it has some great loot but damn if it wouldn't be hard to get that deep into Lighty lands and camp there withour getting PK'd. Do I like that? No, Do I enjoy that aspect of the game ? Yes.<P><BR>Frontier Mountains looks like a great place to hunt,, I can somewhat.... but theres more lights than darks there,,, makes hunting a challenge. Do i enjoy that apsect of the game?  Yes.<P>The competition for hunting grounds and bragging rights for taking down the uber mobs IS WHAT I LOVE about the PVP game. The actual PVP is a bit flawed but the fact that we are all competing for zones and mobs is adds alot more to the PVP experience than actualy making that human bard crumple to the ground with a grunt.<P><BR>Quests are more challenging. To get half the stuff for quests you need to go into enemy territory and for that many times you need guild assistance or some terribly nerve racking runs through enemy territory. I remember when I had to run from Neriak to permafrost for a cleric quest. Slinking and hiding the whole way there only to learn I needed enduring breathe to get what i needed. Now I was pissed but the fact it was such a nerveracking experience , doging and avoiding and running from lights the whole way made it an experience I wont soon forget.<P><BR>I am not in competition with other servers, I couldnt give a dam what server kills what mob first. I am in competition with my enemies on MY server. I do want to take Frontier Mountains back and make it a regular Darky hunting ground.<P><BR>Now how does Cross teamiung affect this aspect of the server? I have seen more lights running untouched through once Darky controled lands. defend your home you say? Of course we will but as an example ,, while me and a few 28- 30 darkies were camping Sol B, deep in Darky land we were ambushed by twice our number in lights who we hadnt a chance again because a very high Dark Elf Cleric was healing them as we attempted to valiantly fight for OUR dungeon. We had no chance to defeat them and we had no CHANCE to die honorably, I was so sickend I had to flee where I once would had died fighting. What is the use? when your own untouchable team , that is suppose to be on your team defending your lands is making sure you cant.<P>In addition the competition many of us team players strived for is now basicly scoffed on by cross teams as if it is a waste of time to try. The copmbine their light and dark ranks and get the mobs they always wanted , the zones they always wanted, go anywhere and do anything. It flies in the face of the team,s concept, the struggles we have enjoyed, and the goals we wished too.<P>Alas I do hear the humane cry of those who built alliances based on the LIGHT/DARK war and I here thier side. The Lght/Dark war on Tallon is what made Tallon as balanced and enjoyabe as it had been. The darks had such a hold for suchj a long time they were forced to unite against us. TO that all I can simply say is it needs to be done regardless, with the stipuilation that the teams are rebalanced and either condensed to 2 teams or 3 teams so that any team has enough flexibility to do PVE as well as PVP. It can be done, and even with that there will be =ruffled feathers but,,,,  Cross teaming is an obvious issue.<P><BR>Re align the teams and hardcode them.<P>Tallon Zek-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Make some zones guard free, and with neutral Bankers, shop keepers ETC. So there is something to battle for. Say you make Freeport as neutral zone, I choose freeport becasue it doesn't have any apparent small zoneing unlike HH and HHK.<BR>Then let people duke it out for freeport, one week it's owned by the dark races, the next by the light races.<P>Make charm and fear work again, all you have to do is set a timer on charm and fear yes? And make it so you cannot send a chamred player to any mobs what so ever. Charmer X charms player X, Player X breaks Charm, Charmer X cannot cast charm again until X amounts of minutes. Same thing with fear.<P>Make communications in between different teams imposible, except for Enchanters in respective races illusion. Makes belonging to a group feel so much more important.<P>Cross team healing and flawed logic with spells have allready been brought up.<P>Make more melee items no drop or change drop rate.<P>If not, make bag items lootable too, so the friggin casters and baggers can feel the Consuqenses of dying too.<P>I think most people are aware of that EQ ain't made for PVP but think of it. You guys allready have the concept of Languages, races. Territory there, now implement it in a good way.<P>Make a brank spanking new server, or more then one, dont make people be able to /movelog, becasue everyone will. Just let everyone start fresh, it will be interesting.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a few very serious problems.<P>- The Enchanter class is unplayable in mid-high level PvP. This ist the worst unbalanced situation in EverQuest.<BR>The opponents resisting any damaging enchanter spells and they can kill with 1 or 2 nearly unresistable spells an enchanter.<BR>Solution: please make the enchanter DD spells just partialy resistable, improve the effectiveness of the Tashani spells and give the enchanters 1 non-magic based DD or DOT spell.<P>- Mixed races, OOR Healing, etc.<BR>the big majority of the players on Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek showed, that they wish to play in Light vs Dark mode. Please change Tallon Zek (at least like a test) officially to Light vs Dark, just 2 teams server. The big majority of the 3 light teams (elven, shortie, human) are willing to form an alliance and dont kill each other. Please respect this and eliminate the possibility, that "traitors" can attack another Lightie. <P>To change the server to a really (hard coded) 4 team server would be a very bad, unacceptable act, it would cause, that me and most of my friends and guild mates would quit Everquest. (This should be not a thread, but its true and you should know it.)<P>Maybe Verant should let the players on Tallon Zek vote about a change to a clearly declared 2 teams Light vs Dark server ? ( Like a year ago before changing coin +1 item to coin only. It worked well, lets do it again in this another important issue)<P>- Necromacers are in PvP overpowered. They dont need any PvP skill to be able to kill very easy, very fast another players. Each stupid 5 yeras old child can play a necro and be succesfull. Nerv the necros!<P>- hard coded (lesser) "Loot and scoot" rule ?<BR>Maybe it would be a good idea to do this: If a level 12+ player was killed in a non-town zone in PvP, he should not be able to zone in the zone in that he was killed for 30 minutes.<BR>To avod problems with corpse recovery, the corpse should be automatically teleported to the bind point of the respawned players.<P>Thank you for listening, <BR>Amenoron Mezzingu, Level 44 Enchanter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't know how the other 2 servers have developed because I play Tallon exclusively.  But as far as Tallon is concerned, it has became a GvE(good vs evil / light vs dark) server.  To hard code team by this time would definately be the break point for a great number of the already unhappy population due to extream neglect in terms of game change/nerf considerations etc.  <BR>Hard code Vallon and open up the /movelog for those who perfer hard coded server.  If EQ is all about team play and develop a community, then you can't destory a community that has evolved into the state it is in now.  Other option is to have a new "hard coded" server that is done right to begin with.  but since i've always heard the excuse of servers are expensive, I would think that changing one server to hard code and open the /movelog is the 2nd best choice.<P>Psyclum Stormwielder (enc) 54<BR>Psyclume (wiz) 47<BR>Psyclim (brd) 35<BR>Psycle (mnk) 19<P>Solhealer (clr) 50 (2nd account to res myself and friends)<P>All Tallon Zek<BR>total /played days on TZ = over 150 days<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think this is a wonderful idea. Crossteaming creates a myriad of problems on a PvP server. The most significant is invuln. healing. <P>ie: Someone from team blue is attacking someone from team orange, yet another person from team blue is healing orange. The blue attacker cannot do anything about the blue healer because they are the same team, althouh this person is going against the entire purpose of a teams server.<P>On Tallon Zek, through the creation of an elite guild called Pandemonium, the highest level light and dark races have combined together and use this exploit to their advantage in PvP. Considering they already have the levels and equipment over other players on the server, they also have invlun. healers regardless if they are being attacked by lights or darks.<P>The only way anyone the server could even hope to fight these people is to resort to the exact same tactics they use. Crossteaming lights and darks so that all races of the guild can be attacked as well. That isnt what the server is about though and most people wont do it. <P>I think Verant just assumed that people would stick to teams only and didnt implement coding for the non- healing, buffing etc. of opposite team members. There should also be a level cap on buffs that can be cast for same team members. A level 50 healer following around a level 10 PK'r isnt very fun and is an exploit as far as I am concerned.<P>Its not like this is anything new to Verant. I'm sure they know what happens on all of their servers and maybe just dont care enough to actually do anything about it. <P><BR>Decayed010: "Some good points but i have to disagree with the loot and scoot crap.<BR>Its a good rule for when your just playing to pk each other or haveing a zone war. but if i'm trying to lvl and someone comes and picks me off and expects me to loot and scoot they have another thing coming."<P>Theres plenty of other servers for people like you. If you dont feel like you need to scoot, you probably also think its ok to bind rush the attacker so you can get rid of them and get back to your precious "EXP". If I get PK'd, regardless what I'm doing, I leave.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
