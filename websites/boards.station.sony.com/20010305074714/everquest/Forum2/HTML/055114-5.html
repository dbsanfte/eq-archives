</FONT><HR>HIDING ACROSS ZONES:<P>The NUMBER 1..if nothing else at all balancing issue...<BR>They've said they won't modify code to make hide/sneak work across zonelines so it looks like the only way we'd get it is with an item. It shouldn't be an existing spell effect like gather shadows though..or there'd be those who just used that instead of hide/sneak to get around the slow effect of sneaking. I'd suggest making a new spell effect that has low duration..maybe 40 seconds to allow logging, and a snare effect on the user to prevent its use other than to zone or log.<P>Its not the perfect solution that fixing the code would be but it would cover the biggest part of the problem. We'd still die if we went LD in a bad spot, and would need a safe spot to cast it to avoid aggroing mobs. <P><BR>"ESCAPE" SKILL<P>A difficult to use escape skill should not be completely ruled out.  If we can manage to get far away from a mob and hide it should memblur.  This would be no easy task like feigning, we'd have to really work at escaping to succeed, using a successful ID check and running the other way or using terrain to our advantage to pull it off.  The hide/evade ability should be modified to memblur if we can manage to get far enough away from a mob..distance to be determined.<P>THROWING<P>Just give us throwing weaps that match the monks..contrary to what you posted in their thread, we were told long ago that we were to be the masters of throwing.  We have crits but we have horrible, low damage, low range, high delay weapons to work with.<P>Finneus Fingers, Karana<BR>56 Rogue<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are a few collective ideas, and thoughts from Rogues.<BR>1. Poisons:<BR>   - to expensive to raise skills<BR>   -hard to get components to raise skill<BR>   -rewards (produced poisons) are not worth     thework to make them<BR>   -stackable poisons would make them much more feasable to carry around<BR>   - poisons applyable to rangeslot<BR>   -make apply poison succeed always and as your skill raises have the amount of time required to apply poison reduced<P>2. Traps:<BR>   -not enough of them to make the skill worthwhile, make some unaviodable<BR>   -bards can disarm most traps rogues can, this makes our higher skill cap useless<P>3.  General:<BR>    -Soulbound lockpicks, quest perhaps<BR>    -also something like a soulbound keyring, all the keys I have on me when I die is just nuts<BR>    -make our new plane armour suiting the rogue class...there is not really much that stands out more than a rogue in Assassins armour, a rogue in PoG armour looks more like a sideshow clown than something to be feared<P>4.  Combat skills:<BR>   **higher skill cap for safefall<BR>   -HIgher skill cap for riposte, parry<BR>   **higher natural resists, at least to poison<P>5.  Sneak, Hide/Evade:<BR>***-when fighting and a mob is on you, if he hits you near the time you evade it will fail giving you a message "you must be perfectly still to hide"<BR>   -higher success rates on evade at higher levels<BR>   -Evading underwater, close to impossible<BR>   -completely invisible discipline, where nothing could see us for several minutes<BR>   -sneak/hide breaking on zones<BR>   -sneak speed increase with skill increase<P>6.  Weapons:<BR>    -more throwing weapons<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well if you did not know this he runs a rogue, so don't nerf your bosses's class now!<P>In fact one time the rogues got so mad  at all the BS we use to take.  Big John Smedly, came on the The SafeHouse Board to tell us rogues that he played one and we will get a fair break.  <BR>You know I have not seen him back there for many moons thou.

</FONT><HR>After a very bad start, I am quite happy with how rogues ended up.  I just have a few minor things I'd like to see addressed.<P>Evade- The changes they are considering making don't worry me much.  Evade was implemented when the hate lists were much shorter.  Evade being changed to only lowering you, say, 5 to 8 slots on the hate list wouldn't be much too complain about.  However the change is implemented, the problem they are trying to correct is the ability to drop too far on the hate list, not lessen the day to day effectiveness of evade.<P>  At least I hope not.  Evade as it is now in a single group situation is fine.  It works maybe a little less than half of the time, and it can be "interrupted" by a mob hitting you too soon to hitting the hide key.  These are reasonable drawbacks to a very useful skill.<P><BR>Sneak/Hide- Its been brought up a ton already, but I would absolutely love to see it work across zone lines/LD/camping.  If it can't be done for technical reasons, I love the idea of making mobs non-aggro for a few seconds after zoning to give us time to hide.  I don't see how that could be abused to give us maybe 5 seconds or so to hide before getting killed if we zone into a hostile environment.  <P>  As much as I'd like to be able to sneak faster underwater, it doesn't make much sense.  =P<P>  I would however, like to be able to sneak faster in all directions, not just forward.  To me, I picture a rogue dodging from corner to corner, checking all around to make sure no one sees him while sneaking around.  Sneaking faster only straight forward doesn't make a lot of sense.  When I have to sneak out of Sebilis from zone in, I have to strafe and do a lot of aggro-checking because random frogs see invis.  I have to pass behind the ones that do see invis so that sneak works and they don't see me.  Increased sneak speed in all directions would make this a lot easier, and I can't see a balance reason to not allow it.  <P>  I also agree that increased sneak speeds should start sooner.  =)<P><BR>Illusions- Been mentioned before.  Enchanters can click-cancel theirs.  Rogues and bards have to zone, camp, or wait for theirs to wear off.  Is this intentional?  I'd love to be able to click cancel them when I need to.<P>Weaponry- It would be great to see something other than 10 damage weapons for the mid to high level range.  It just seems that the overwhelming majority of weapons are of the 10 damage variety.  I went from Slime Coated Harpoon to Eyerazzia to Trak Tooth to Blood Point before getting my Ragebringer.  I'd imagine a lot of rogues went through a similar progression as high level weapons with anything other than 10 damage are few and far between.  A little variety in damage would be nice.<P>  Another thing that bugs me is the fact that weapons like the Trak Tooth and Eyerazzia are primary only.  I'm sure there are more examples, but these are the two that stuck in my mind.  I can understand making a large weapon like the Crys Spear or the Wurmslayer primary only, but why would a light rapier and an even lighter dagger be primary only?  There are lots of better, larger, heavier and faster weapons that can go in either slot.  Making these weapons primary only severely shortens their usefulness, especially with Ragebringer in the picture.<P>Speaking of Ragebringer, it may be too late to get the effect redone, but I'd like to see some sort of noticable effect on it.  Spewing fireballs and lightning bolts isn't exactly appropriate for a rogue weapon either, but I'd love something like the subtle but noticable dark blue glow of the cleric epic.  <P><BR>Armor- Mrylokar's boots are extremely rare on Brell.  Maybe 3 or 4 on the server.  I don't think there are any Mrylokar's Gaunts at all on the server.  <P>  SoV armor, for whatver reason, isn't tinted like it should be.  Its been mentioned a lot, but rogues shouldn't be bright yellow.  =)<P><BR>Poison- Again, its been mentioned a lot before, but its too time consuming for it to be very useful.  I only bother with it in PvP pretty much because the effects on mobs are negligable considering the time it takes to gather components.<P>  They should be made stackable though, like the shaman potions.  It can be argued that a rogue is more in need of stacking poisons than shamans needing stacking potions.  Rogues have to carry a 6 slot container with them at all times to be able to make poisons.  The container must be empty as well in order to have room make the poison.  They also have to carry around 2 to 3 components per poison, 2 to 3 different types of vials, and 2 to 3 different types of suspensions (all depending on the level range of the poisons).  This could very easily take up 3 or 4 of your 8 primay inventory slots if you plan on using more than one poison.  Rogues must then stop what they are doing and, in a hostile environment, combine the components in hopes of making a poison, then wait another 7 seconds to apply it.  It is a huge hassle.  It would be so much easier to make a few 10 shot poisons while in town so that poisons take up maybe half a bag instead of half your inventory. =)  Shamans generally don't make potions outside of town other than resist potions for raids.  Shamans don't often use their own potions either, so they generally don't have to carry many around.  Stacking just makes it easier to sell.  Incidentally making poisons stack would also make them easier to sell, another good reason to do it.  =)<P>Like I said, overall I'm very satisfied with my class.  I just wanted to bring up a few minor things I'd like to see changed.  =)<P>Alren Bandire<BR>Level 59 rogue<BR>Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Unlike a good many folks I understand that poison cannot be changed much without dramatically affecting PvP (where it can be a significant factor), so for Player-VS-Environment it will never be more then a toy skill.<P>Also I understand that not much can be done about allowing hide/sneak to work across zones.  BUT...many zones in Velious render some of a rogues most valuable contributions to a group useless.  If we can't hide we can't scout or corpse recover.<P>The ranges on many throwing weapons are so low you're in the aggro radius of a critter before you're in range to throw a weapon.  This and low damage, high weigh make the skill little more then another toy.  If it's intended to be a serious skill these issues need to be examined.<P>Most importantly the change to Evade will SERIOUSLY effect rogues.  As it stands now it works maybe 25% of the time (between outright fails and the fact that we're 'moving' when we're getting hit; and it's useless in underwater zones because you can't hide while swimming).  As it stands now evade allows a rogue to avoid enough damage to allow us to survive a battle.  Prior to evade rogues died, a LOT...any reduction to evade's effectivenes will return us to this situation once again.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PICKPOCKET!<P>Pickpocket is one of the most basic rogue skills both from a RP standpoint and from a game standpoint.  The fact that a level 60 Assasin can't pickpocket something 15 levels below him is just rediculous.  Please remove the level cap for this spell.  Perhaps make it like lockpick skill where at skill 201 gained at level 51 you can begin to pickpocket above the previous level 45 cap.  Also tag spells as magic items so they are not part of the loot table that rogues can pickpocket from.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quick run down of my creditials..<P>-The only level 60 Rogue on VZ.<BR>-I have been played a rogue since day one of EQ<BR>-I have seen the test of time on rogues and have 3 other rogue twinks<BR>-I love the rogue class and have seen the class become what it is today<P><BR>Rogues are very well balanced right now at the 53+ level but are still very weak at the lower levels. PvP shows this over and over. An equally equiped rogue and warrior at level 53 or below...the warrior crushes the rogue. A rogue will need at least 5 levels on that warrior to beat that warrior in a duel. I am not sure what to do, but rogues need to be made more group friendly at the lower levels.<P>HIDE ACCROSS ZONE LINES!<P>Invis works, hide should. Casters should not be able to see us with see invis. After all, invis and hide are two different things. Verent treats them as such. Example, I can't hide/sneak and zone. Hide/sneak works against undead and live things.<P>EVADE!<P>DO NOT NERF THIS. At level 60, if there is not a taunting tank, and I evade successfully and then hit the mob one time with a backstab, i'm at the top of that list again. <P>Before evade (adn before you were aroud Arbor) rogues were not wanted in groups. We had the hitpoints and ac of wizards back then. We had NO way to get a mob off of us and we sucked all the mana out of healers in groups. We were worthless back then. Now we have evade and can avoid sucking mana....<P>Evade should work if you are moving. I see evade working as i'm trying to run away from a mob...ie jumping behind rocks, ducking behind a bush. <P>Evade = getting out of the way. It does not mean standing still.<P>FAST GET AWAY<P>Give us something. A skill, a questable item, an ability..something. <P>I suggest giving us an abiltiy called "Run". <P>We hit the button and for 3 seconds get a burst of speed equal to a bards song. Make it at the cost of a bubble of stamina. <P>I can't begin to see how this is so unbalancing. It is a skill used to run, not kill.<P>FIEGN DEATH<P>There is no reason that a rogue would not play dead to get away. Take evade away if you want and give us FD. I still can't believe that a monk, someone that uses innerstrength to over come things, will play dead...but I can see a backstabing rogue falling out of a fight early that their group is not going to win to play dead and live.<P>Pick Pockets<P>Why is the cap so low? I am level 60 and fighing mobs that are even or red to me. I do not hang around in Crush bone anymore. make the PPs skill useful again. Just make it so it doesn't work in some zones, or on boss mobs. <P>TRACKING<P>This is a major issue on pvp servers. Evil teams do not have a tracker. Give Rogue (A.K.A Assassins, which track people and things to kill them) the ability to track. You named us Assassins after all, how about giving us the ability of assassins.<P>This would alost make a lot of the Evils on PvP servers happy.<P>SNEAK/HIDE<P>Make it so they are one button<P>POISONS<P>-Make them stackable (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD)<BR>-Lower costs<BR>-Give us an ability to forage poison supplies in zones that have mobs that drop poison supplies<BR>-Raise our natural poison resists to equal the natural magic resist of Warriors. Ie 50 base at level 60<BR>-Perhaps give applied poison charges. As it is poison is worthless on mobs with 200,000 hitpoins. What is my 445 poison that cost me hours of camping and 20pp going to do me on a mob that has 200,000 hitponts?<BR>-Perhaps make it so the poison stay on your blade while you are in a zone and have a random chance of going off on mobs<P><BR>APPLY POISON<P>A worthless skill now. Make it useful. I suggest that as your apply poison skill goes up, make it so that it reduces the amont of time to apply a poison. <P>Example<BR>-At 50 it takes 7 seconds to apply<BR>-At 100 it takes 5 seconds to apply<BR>-At 150 it takes 3 seconds to apply<BR>-At 200 it takes 1 second to apply<P>Make it so that when you auto sit to apply a poison, you auto stand like with bind wound.<P>IF YOU NERF EVADE <P>And take our only ability to get away or avoid mobs in fights (which EVERY other class has except a tank..ie Feign death, Divine Aura, SoW, speed songs, Hitpoints out the wazoo, root, snare, pets to stay behind), then give us equal ac as a warrior and the equal hitpoints. Because that is in a sense what you are trying to do to us. Make us warriors with the hitpoints of casters.<P>Drizzlin the Silent &lt;Silent Souls&gt;<BR>The Assassin of Vallon Zek<BR>Of the 60th Season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I know there is a quest for J-boots, I also know that if you dont have a nice guild or an upper level caster, you can forget getting them yourself.  A nice long quest simular to the on for the burning rapier would be nice.<P>As far as my comment on spears, The spears you listed are nice, but most of those are only available at higher lvl.  Would be nice for those of use who want to use a spear to have that option.  Besides, who says a big old Barbarian would be happy using a puny little knife.<P>The pickpocket idea I agree is kind of unrogueish but, I would rather use the ability and have everyone see it.  Then not use it and have someone in a group either refusing me the ability to do the skill, or blaming me for subpar item/coin loot, whether I am using the ability or not.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DEXTERITY AND/OR AGILITY-<BR>	When creating a rogue, the “classic” EQ rogue emphasized dexterity and agility.  After two years time the “modern” EQ now focuses on strength.  Why?  Strength has a marked, sometimes biased, effect on maximum damage, attack rating, and backstab damage. The net result has been race-favoritism among rogues.  In fact, many low-strength rogues re-rolled their characters in favor of strength rogues and the predominant advice given to those making a new rogue is to focus on strength.  Well I’m a bit disgruntled about how powerful strength has become while the real rogue attributes, dexterity and agility, have been neglected.  Strength should not be the end-all for rogues.  Various aspects of dexterity’s and agility’s role in the daily rogue grind need to be re-analyzed.  Among these is what is known as “processing”.  Many tests have revealed a “very” small increase in the process-rate of a weapon at low (~100) versus high (~200) dexterity.  Furthermore and as I understand it, the proc-rate of offhand weapons is independent of dexterity.  It seems ludicrous that dexterity should have no effect upon proc-rate of offhand weapons and I can only hope that it is not true.  				<BR>	A qualm I have with agility concerns “evading”.  I am not sure if there is anyway to test high versus low agility on this particular ability but it is logical that agility should have a effect on a rogue’s ability to evade.  Along these lines (and I know this is a toe-stomper to some), large sized rogues should have lower chances of successfully evading compared to medium and small races.  This would make being a small, nimble rogue a “worth-while alternative” to the large, clunky rogue races.<BR>	This last ‘peev’ is not truly a balance issue but more of a bug.  When I’m in dwarf form there are inclines that I can not scale.  An example of one is the undead temple in the desert of South Ro.  In dwarf form I CAN NOT scale its walls to get to the top of the building.  However, when I assume dark elf form I can walk right up this wall.  This is not very realistic and needs to be addressed.  What benefit should being a dark elf have over a dwarf when it comes to being nimble and fleet-footed.  I chose a small class under the assumption that I might be more rogue-like than my larger class mates.  The whole agility and dexterity attribute system seems to have been thrown out the window concerning rogue foot-work and body movement.  Please address this and give those rogues who are small and who placed emphasis on dexterity and agility at the get-go the benefits of being so.  I’m tired of the strength-is-king mentality among rogues.<BR>	So to summarize, please 1) reassess the process-rate of main hand weapons so that high dexterity rogues get a “significantly” greater chance at processing than low dexterity and, 2) make offhand weapon proc-rate dependent on dexterity (i.e., just like main hand), and 3) make evasion and other roguish skills of body manipulation agility- (and/or dexterity-) dependent abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>POISON-<BR>	Rogue poison has come a long way.  I was a skilled poison maker prior to the poison system upgrade and am even more skilled now.  I love using poisons.  I have lots of options now.  The only problem is that the options take up a lot of space, time to make, and in the process take up a lot of my sanity.  I simply want to address poison by comparing it to alchemy.<BR>	Alchemy reagents can be purchased from single merchants on shaman-based cultures.  Alchemists use a single bag to combine reagents to produce a potion encased in a vial (where the vial comes from is still subject to conjecture).  Alchemists use another bag to combine their unstackable potions into one stacked five- or ten-charge potions.  Alchemy costs a lot of money to learn; however, alchemists can sell their trade to other individuals to cover costs of learning alchemy.  A caveat of the latter is that alchemists become useful in the trade-economy.<BR>	Now rogue poison.  Toxicologists must travel to remote, one-of-a-kind merchants to purchase reagents and suspensions.  Toxicologists must travel a multitude of zones to collect reagents that drop from various monsters, many of which are low level.  The net result being the consumption of vast amounts of time JUST for collection (not for learning the actual skill have you).  Toxicologists use a single bag to combine the reagents, a suspension, and oddly enough a vial (unlike the alchemist’s medicine bag, our mortar and pestle does not magically make a vial).  Hence, toxicologists must either ally with a master potter or become master potters themselves.  Again, the result is a massive consumption of time (I mean I got 140 unfired sealed poison vials that I NOW have to fire them all one at a time in a kiln... please this is overkill).  Toxicologists produce an item that is unstackable.  Toxicology is cheaper than alchemy but I feel the time sink does not offset this fact.  It takes a lot of time to learn this skill, so much so that many rogues decide to learn poison in spurts of every ten levels or so (or worst not at all!) simply because traveling all over hell and high water does not fit in with an experience-driven schedule.  Lastly, toxicologists produce an item that is only useable by rogues, many of whom I’ve already stated do not use poisons, with the end result being no interaction of toxicologists with the trade economy.<BR>	I compared these two skills in hopes it would reveal the inadequacies of poison.  Now I am not really asking for poisons to have a market economy, I’m just asking for a leveling of the playing field here... the time sink for poison is just incredible.  Resolving the time-sink is complex but the reward obtained for the time invested is not that great.  So here I go... about to beat a dead horse.  Rogue poisons MUST have multiple uses.  Again and again Verant has insisted poisons can not be made to stack.  Ok, I accept this.  Lets forget stacking... lets forget charges... I propose a novel, yet simple (I hope its simple anyway) solution to getting multiple uses out of a poison vial... ‘apparent’ charges.			<BR>	Make the finished poison react differently when it is applied to the weapon.  Make the success rate of applying a poison to your blade dependant on the player’s apply skill (this is how it used to be prior to the poison-system patch a few months back).  So a level 18 player just starting to apply poison would have, say, a ~50% chance of failing.  Whereas, a level 60 rogue with apply skill maxed would have, say, a ~10% chance of failure.  Ok easy enough, so here is the big change I propose... make it so when the rogue fails to apply the poison the poison vial is broken and disappears from inventory.  However, IF the rogue successfully applies the poison the poison vial is not broken and it remains in the rogue’s inventory.  Based on the numbers (suggested above) this would give a level 18 rogue approximately TWO “apparent” charges per vial and the level 60 (capped) rogue TEN “apparent” charges.  Of course the rogue could get real lucky and get more than the predicted number of uses or be unlucky and lose the vial before the “apparent” charges were met.  Furthermore, and reiterating on the lack of dexterity or agility-dependence on skills the apply skill check could be modified by the rogues agility and/or dexterity (base statistics would be best since so many rogues are twinked with uber-gear nowadays).  In other words, strong rogues who invested in strength at the expense of dexterity might have greater chances at failing applies and breaking the vial than rogues with high dexterity and/or agility.<BR>	So in summary, change nothing about poisons other than the application success rates and based on the application check, if successful the rogue keeps the poison vial and if unsuccessful the rogue loses the poison vial.  The only other change I’d like to see implemented is remove the sitting during application and replace it with the bind wound animation.  When a person sits, especially a rogue who has deals a lot of damage, they become easy target for attack by the current monster or others around it.  With sitting rogues have no chance at really reapplying poison once combat has started.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DAMAGE SHIELDS<BR>	Rogues are a grouping class and more often than not a group can deal with damage shields.  However, a rogue who is off traveling by him or herself and engages in SOLO encounters is subject to a significant disadvantage versus monsters with damage shields.  This fact is based solely on the rogue’s ability to inflict damage very fast.  Rogues have NO alternatives to mitigate the damage caused by damage shields under solo circumstances.  For example, rogues lack two-hand weapons proficiencies and ‘good’, albeit slow, one-hand weapons to minimize damage from damage shields (e.g., crystalline spear, green jade axe, Brell’s keg popper are examples but are few and far between).  Furthermore, it appears (at least when I fight solo with my rogue) that a damage shield on a green mob versus higher cons does just as much damage to me as the higher level con; even though I can resist the nukes or dots of the green con versus the higher level con.  There appears to be NO resist check against damage shields!  Even with 100 magic and fire resist, a fire damage shield on a green mob will cause significant amounts of damage!  The net result is that rogues, more often than not, have a lot of trouble taking down a green monster with a damage shield whereas other similar-level classes do not.  When there are multiple green monsters all wearing damage shields the problem is compounded.  It is very disheartening to engage a green monster, come very close to death, and gain nothing except down time.  A clear cut example are fire elementals in Lavastorm.  Those elementals are level 15 or so and I once had my level 40 rogue there collecting charcoals.  At best I could fight five or six elementals (one-on-one, back to back) before I had to sit and heal for 20 minutes.  No other class is subject to this type of damage like rogues are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>INSTILL DOUBT & BACKSTAB<BR>	Instill doubt is not a class defining skill.  I have no problems with instill doubt as it is currently implemented for rogues.  However, backstabbing is a class defining skill.  It is a slap in the face of rogues to allow us the ability to fear a monster and then not backstab it.  This would be like telling a necromancer, “Sure you can fear that monster but you can not cast on it or have your pet attack it.”  The entire ID-BS sequence and how it is programmed must be addressed.  A rogue should never lose his ability to backstab a target except when he is not at their back.  To effectively fear a monster and open it up for the back shot and then not be allowed to backstab it is absurd.  The average “fear” duration after an effective instill doubt is about ten seconds at best; this is roughly the same time to recycle the ID and/or BS timer and as a result, more often than not, a rogue does not even get to backstab the monster after fearing it.  At level 50 with my (untwinked primary) rogue I had trouble soloing a green sand giants in South Ro unless I feared them more than once.  I did not gain experience from these giants and yet I often survived with a bubble or two of health or was forced to zone.  If my backstab was not disabled after I feared these giants I would have survived with much more health and at least felt justified for not having gained experience.  I mean give me a break, I have witnessed a level 38 necromancer on one instance and a level 40 magician on another solo a sand giant.  At least they received experience for their near death encounters.<BR>	As a side note and I am unsure of whether it has been tested, necromancers and shadow knights are such that the duration of their “fear” is dependent upon their charisma, the lower the longer.  For consistency’s sake, the fear duration of rogues and monks should also be charisma dependent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE - ‘CONFUSION’ (Lev. 45, 30 minutes)<BR>	This discipline is ONLY useable after establishing an agro-list from combat.  When a rogue uses this discipline it does the following, 1- stops the rogues attack, 2- attempts a hide (a.k.a., evade), and 3- if the evade is successful then there is a 50% chance at unresistable ‘confusion’ (a.k.a., memory blur) where the monster removes the rogue from its agro-list, untargets the rogue, and spouts off the following, “&lt;A monster&gt; appears confused and has lost sight of you!”.  If the evade fails then the monster continues attacking and the rogue must restart his or her attack manually.  The refresh times and ‘confusion’ success rates suggested above may be prone to adjustments (e.g., level, skill, and/or agility and dexterity modifiers) but they get the idea across.  Lastly, this discipline can be used against multiple mobs but the ‘confusion’ check must succeed for every monster on the agro-list, which makes it fairly useless in multiples vs. single rogue situations but does make the discipline a viable alternative for escape when solo and losing the battle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

When a rogue uses this discipline it does the following in one fluid step, 1- shadow-steps the rogue to a position behind the mobs back, 2- automatically orients the rogue to backstab(-able) position, and 3- lands a backstab.  This sequence of events occurs in such a way that it is ‘faster’ then the PC-monster’s turning abilities and will land the backstab 100% of the time.  The backstab may not be maximum damage but it is guaranteed to hit.  For those rogues capable of double-backstab the use of ‘slink’ makes the chance of landing the second backstab also 100%.  If this discipline is used during the grey-out period during the recycling of backstab it will not work.

</FONT><HR>A lot of good posts have already covered most of the problems I've experienced or heard about... so I will only give a short vote of agreement.<P>*1. Evade should be able to be used while moving.  This fits with the concept of ducking and dodging.  I have yet to reach high enough level to use this skill... but nerfing it sounds like a very bad thing to do and could possibly ruin my little amount of enjoyment I get out of playing this class.<P>*2. Why should rogues (and evil races/classes in general) be nerfed by NOT allowing us to ROLEPLAY our characters according to their descriptions?  Isn't this supposed to be a roleplaying game?  If so... why can't I go around pickpocketing, no matter what the PnP is... <P>I have had to LIE about what class I am (said I was a fighter until I got backstab at level 10) just to get into a group.  It's not so bad on Vazaelle as it is a new server, but from what I hear, low-level rogues have it hard getting into groups (which... btw... isn't that the other point of this game?  Grouping with friends/adventurers?)<P>*3. Stackable Poisons - 'nuff said.<P>*4. Hide/Sneak - Stay up across zoning, etc.  Give them a hance to take us off the aggro list at low levels.  There have been times at the orc camps in ECommons that I move in to use my backstab, miss, and the orc lego aggro's onto me, even despite two warriors and a monk pounding away on it for at least five seconds.<P>I'm sure there are other things... but please... look at what you want us to do in this game... especially ROLEPLAY-wise.  I'm a rogue... aren't I supposed to be tricky, deceitful, underhanded and such?  Again... why do people that want to truely portray an evil character properly, get treated differently than the supposed 'heroes'?<P>~Level 11 Rogue on Vazaelle~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright, this is going to be a long post, but please read it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Disciplines -<P>Level 53 - Counterattack. This one is alright, although phased out by Nimble a couple of levels later, because of Nimble's shorter refresh and longer duration, as Riposte holds little appeal for rogues due to our lack of high damage weapons. Nothing is really needed to improve this, except maybe some high-damage high-delay two-hand piercing weapons for use with it.<P>Level 54 - Deadeye. I personally never use it - the very tiny extra bit of damage that it does isn't worth giving up the safety cushion that a ready-to-use Counterattack or Nimble give you. Suggestion: Increase the duration to 3 minutes or so.<P>Level 55 - Nimble. Excellent discipline, the only one I have hotkeyed at all times.<P>Level 57 - Kinesthetics. Trash, junk, zevel, musor, etc. 18 seconds of guaranteed DA/DW at a level when you're pretty much guaranteed it by your levels of double attack and dual wield skills anyway. Absolutely not worth losing your ability to go into Nimble mode for half an hour. Needs to be dropped down to level 40 or so, when it would still have some use, and have it's duration increased to at least 90 seconds.<P>Level 58 - Blinding Speed. You'd think no discipline could be less useful than Kinesthetics in it's current form - and you'd be wrong. This is supposed to haste you - but it does not allow you to pass the class/level haste cap, and at level 58, whenever you're hunting, you're grouped - and when you're grouped, you're at haste cap anyway. As a result, you lose your ability to go Nimble for 30 minutes and gain absolutely nothing. Increase duration to 45-60 seconds and make it break haste cap. As an alternative, you can change it into an 18-sec burst of 200% running speed, an escape ability similar to Spirit of Cheetah.<P>Level 59 - Duelist. No complaints there.<P>Hide and Sneak -<P>Whenever we cross a zoneline or go linkdead, hide and sneak drops. This means that in order to enter a hostile zone (Sirens Grotto, Howling Stones, Dragon Necropolis, etc), we must beg a caster for invisibility. Worse yet, if we go linkdead while sneaking through a hostile zone, we are 100% guaranteed to come back dead. Please make it last through zoning/LDing, similar to what you said you were going to do to illusions (which suffer from exact same problem).<P>Ragebringer particle effect - <P>The green dot that's supposed to travel along the blade zips through so fast, it's impossible to see unless you look really really well. I suppose it's a low priority issue, but it shouldn't be all that hard to slow it down...<P>Assassin's Chainmail -<P>Ummm, ***? Sparkling gold gem-inlaid armor for assassins? I suppose it could make our victims die from uncontrollable spasms of laughter... anyway, it needs to get a dark gray/black pallette swap.<P>Range on Sense Traps - <P>EXTREMELY short - in some cases, it appears to be shorter than the trap's activation radius. I have the skill maxed (200), but when I attempted to drag a corpse in Dragon Necropolis from Dominator Yisaki's room to Zlandicar's chamber, a path that takes me through 2 spike traps, I set them off 3 times out of 4 - despite me knowing EXACTLY where they are, and moving a step at a time when I got to area, then hitting sense traps, waiting 10 seconds for refresh, taking another step, hitting sense traps again, repeating this for 5 minutes... and then out of the blue spike trap hitting me and THEN I sensed it. If a wanderer passed by at that time I would be dead in an instant. Sense traps needs a range increase to ~50 feet, and/or reuse time decrease to match that of sense heading.<P>Instill Doubt - <P>This skill runs through a bunch of completely ridiculous checks, and you have to succeed in each and every on of them, or you fail - resulting in completely ridiculously low success rate on anything, even the deepest green mobs. Successful instill doubt is an exception, rather than a rule. Here is an outline how it works:<P>Ensure backstab is refresh - if it is not refreshed, you are GUARANTEED a failure - thus you cannot use backstab and instill doubt at the same time, severely crippling your damage output.<BR>Hit instill doubt - it appears to run a success/failure check on every figure of that little dance you make - /cheer, primary slash, offhand punch, pierce. If you pass them all (which is RARE, even when you're level 60 with 200 skill and using it on a level 10 bandit), proceed to next stage.<BR>Kick is invoked - since we have no kick skill, it uses our offense rating. If you miss the kick, you have failed. It used to be that if you fought a mob that required magic to hit, you'd get the INVULNERABLE message even if you were wearing magic boots, and that would - guess what - cause your attempt to instill fear in the mob to fail.<BR>Fear (the basic, level 4 necro version) is invoked, and checked against target's magic resistanse. If the target resists it, you fail - and resist rates on Fear line are pretty damn high.<P>As a result, the success rate on Instill Doubt on low blue con creatures hover somewhere around 0.5-1%... if not less. Thx useless skill ^_^<P>Disguises -<P>How about some questable masks that allow us to disguise as other races? Gnome, wood elf, dwarf, high elf, barbarian, etc. Maybe set some race restrictions on who can use them... ie, barbarians can't use gnome disguise, and halflings can't use ogre disguise, etc.<P>Plane of Growth -<P>Similar problem to bards and warriors - wood elf and half elf rogues can follow Tunare, yet, there are no quests for them in Growth, although there are quests for most other Tunare-following classes (clerics, druids, wizards, magicians, enchanters, rangers, paladins).<P>Poison -<P>Far too long of a subject, and I'm tired of writing. Suffice to say, you need to kill a few dozen mobs in order to inflict a small amount of damage on one - and even that is not guaranteed. No one I know uses it - and I know a lot of rogues. It simply isn't worth the time and money.<P>Gholam Stickyfingers<BR>Halfling Blackguard<BR>Sacrament of Chaos<BR>E'ci Server<BR>http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi!<P>Discussing Rogue Disciplines.<P>lvl 40- Fearless- Lasts 11 seconds, 40 min reuse at lvl 60- Please consider either A) Increasing the time its in effect B) Reducing the recharge rather dramatically. This disc has (non PvP) One real use of evading Dragon fear, and generally encounters, especially SoV style, tend to last rather long. In essence, this disc will always be passed up for more viable alternatives, the proposed askance would help this at least be a considered option.<P>lvl 53 Counterattack- 9 seconds 53 min recharge at lvl 60- Please consider increasing the effect length or shortening the recharge. My reason is thus: The short delay versus the long recharge makes this almost a non-option at lvl 60 since nimble will help you avoid damage for a full 3 seconds longer and recharge in less than half the time. While no damage is dealt in return with nimble, general consensus (on average mind you) is that living longer is a *good* thing, and is better than the hits you might give back using this disc. The proposed changes would again help make this a more viable disc.<P>Lvl 54-Deadeye- 14 seconds of every attack landing, 24 minute recharge at lvl 60. A fun discipline for the level. No real changes needed, in my opinion.<P>Lvl 55- Nimble- 12 seconds of dodging all frontal attacks 25 minutes recharge at lvl 60. Generally the most used discipline, our little life saver. No changes needed in my opinion, with a slight consession that 3 more seconds added to this would be a nice addition. <P>lvl 56- Kinesthetics- 18 seconds all dbl atk/dual weild skill checks will pass 100%. Please note you will NOT HIT 100%, only that you have the CHANCE. Recharge time 27 minutes at lvl 60. This disc is rather a downgrade from deadeye, considering that at this lvl most of our skill checks have a good shot at passing already, and Deadeye GUARANTEES a hit 100%. This skill would me very helpful if the time was expanded by a considerable amount, up to 1 minute. It would be the rogue's choice to deal with the aggro. By expanding the time on this discipline it allows a rogue more flexibility in dealing with a combat situation where they can choose to risk the additional aggro to recieve the CHANCE to land more attacks.<P>Lvl 58- Blinding speed- 15 seconds of stackable haste 28 minute recharge at lvl 60. Please seriously consider a dramatic overhaul of this discipline. I discern a small difference with this disc only when I have no haste buff other than Ragebringer. If I have any form of haste upon me, I cannot discern any change in my atk speed. I ask for two changes to be considered with this discipline- A) A Dramatic increase in the effect time, so the haste given can make a marked impression within the time alloted. B) Have the haste be stackable PAST the haste "cap" for rogues. Let it be the rogue's responsibility to consider the aggro effect this could/would generate.<P>Lvl 59- Duelist- 12 seconds of base damage increased 29 minute recharge. Great skill, I use this second only to nimble, no change needed - In my opinion.<P>If any are wondering why I wrote WHAT the disc does, it is so Absor does not have to go look it up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Crover<BR>Assassin<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR>Guild?

</FONT><HR>One more thing:<P>Sense Trap/Disarm Traps -<BR>I have only started using this since my Velious exploration began, but I have some questions/observations.<P>1. Reuse time on the skill is a bit too long, I mean, you are talking about people relying on the rogue to go, inch-by-inch, and hitting sense trap to detect if there is anything dangerous around them.  So, with the reuse time as is, you'd crawl through a dungeon like a snail!  I think the reuse time should be reduced a bit.<P>2. Skill radius - someone already mentioned that sense trap skill radius is a bit too low...  I totally agree.  On the other hand, the skill radius for DISARM TRAPS seems to be so much larger!  I mean, I can use Disarm traps to semi-sense the trap!  Ok, it doesn't tell you which direction the trap is in, but using Disarm Traps when there is a trap nearby will produce a message that says "The trap is too far for you to disarm" - while, standing at the same distance, pressing sense trap will indicate that there is not a trap closeby!  This is a bug that should be fixed!<P>Otherwise, why not give us one combined skill that just sense and disarms?  I mean, it's not like when you sense a trap you will want to disarm it anyways - that way we don't need to have another hotkey assigned to our abilities list (it's already very cluttered as it is).<P>Thanks for listening...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Personly, if I were you wanting to know what a majority of the well infomred people think I would first ask Kendrick what the rogue community wants and then head to TheSafehouse (http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse) where Kendrick frequents the forums. There you will find all wealth of knowledge you could ever want about rogues.<P>And if you want my opinions, 1) Poisens stackable to make them useful at all exept for maybe, maybe one fight, make the darn things stackable! Please.<P>2) I also posted something similar to the burst of speed like disipline. Call it charge opponent or quick get away or whatever but a burst of speed that can be used for getting away. It makes me soooo mad everytime I die from a green hillgiant in west commons because i was stunned once and got pounded for a couple hundred dmg and couldnt get to the zone.<P>3)Dont nerf evade, it works fine and it doenst put you at the bottom of the list, I know, because ive succesfuly evaded and still been attacked.

</FONT><HR>Well, here is my two cents worth.  <P>-More variety of off-hand slashing/1hblunt weapons at higher lvls.  <BR>-Change the color of Assassin armor for the love of god!<BR>-On PVP, when a rogue hides AND is a certain distance away from an attacker, the rogue should be dropped from target.<BR>-Poisons are somewhat costly to make and it is a pain to collect the items for what we get as a result.  It could use a little fine-tuning<BR>-Allow mask illusions to be clicked off<BR>-Some kind of ability to get us through the 35-50 period.  Maybe something someone suggested earlier.  Some kind of /disc that would allow us to run at Jboot (of course not SOW) speed for 15 or 20 seconds to get away from a mob.  Should be able to be used in dungeons unless Jboots or SOW.<BR>-Soulbound lockpicks would be nice<BR>-I like the Ragebringer without a flashy particle effect, but is there a way to maybe make it blur as we run?  Not alot, just a little.<BR>-Get rid of the Apply Poison skill.  If a rogue has the ability to make a poison, he should be able to apply it.<P>As far as the Evade thing, I can understand the change, but it doesn't mean I have to like it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, let me say that, in my opinion, Verant has done a good job at fixing the Rogue class. At the beginning Rogues were very unbalanced and needed a lot of help to make them fun, just like a lot of the other classes. I know this thread is about class balancing and things like that so I will get on with it. This post may seem a bit wordy, but I want Verant to know how I arrive at my ideas and that there is a lot of thought put into them, not just a hasty 'wish list' slapped together.<P>I think that the Rogue class is almost perfectly balanced as far as the game engine will allow. I, and many other people I am sure, view the EQ Rogue class as an 'Assassin' class. I view Rogues as doing things more stealthy and shady as opposed to the damage dealing, poison using EW Rogue. But since the game cannot be redone from the ground up, I am sure that the Rogue will be staying almost as is until the final days of EQ.<P>I also believe that 'class balance' is not just about making a particular class more powerful or uber, but it is also about rounding out a class, making the class more believable and fun to play. Take the illusions that Enchanters get. Are some just fluff and don't do much? Yes, but do they make the class more fun to play. You better believe it. I hear Enchanters always wishing they had more illusions because they find them fun. I also wish that Bards had songs that flung people about like the gravity flux spell without hurting them. Fluff? Yes, but it would be a Hoot!! The first time I got a ride by a Tentacle Terror, I almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard (it was outdoors in Unrest, so I went flying hehe). Remember, being balanced does not just mean super-mega-uber-awesome power and skills  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Now, onto my suggestions and ideas.<P><BR>----------- Idea 1 -----------<BR>------ Droppable Chests ------<BR>------------------------------<BR>I think that in many ways it could be easy to allow Rogues to do more Roguish type of things without unbalancing the game. One of these ways would be a locked chest that Rogues can unlock to see what is inside. Right now the only thing a Rogue uses his/her lock picks for is to open locked doors. Putting items in the game that also allow Rogues to use this ability would make it more fun for the Rogue class and make the time spent taking up that lock pick skill more rewarding. Here are the details of this idea.<P>1-	the chests would NOT be static in rooms and such. They would be dropped by mobs. The graphics are there, and so are the sounds. Nothing new would need to be added as for graphics and sound. Not all mobs would be able to drop these chests, and not in all zones either. They could be dropped by named mobs or by normal standard mobs. They would also be random and not drop every time. It would be based on a percentage, much like some items are done now I believe.<P>2-	they would also be NO DROP. This would ensure that no other class could gather up a whole bunch and then sell them off or give them to twinks and such. This would also ensure that they would not be farmed or used as trade bait. It would be a direct reward to a Rogue if he were in the party or nearby. No other class would benefit from this and this would ensure that no other class becomes unbalanced. This would also mean that low-level Rogues could not be given a chest to practice picklocks on. If they are worried that high level Rogues would do this as well (no risk and good reward) just make the chest able to be picked open once, after it has been picked open it would not need a lock pick to open it.<P>3-	they would contain items only usable to Rogues, or a small amount of cash. After all, these would not be rewards for quests or for an extremely tough mob (however, they could be if Verant wished to do so. But ONLY if the item inside was only usable to a Rogue). The Rogue only item would be the only choice because it would be unfair to other classes to deny them items simply because they did not have a Rogue handy. The best item to put in them, I think, would be poison. I know that this seems it would lessen the desire for Rogues to make poison but not so. Why? Because Verant could make the poisons NO DROP and more importantly, they could control what poisons could be dropped. If they feel a particular poison would be too unbalancing, just leave it out. If they think more poison types should be in the game, just put them in there. Making them NO DROP would also ensure that the Rogue who looted the poison either used it or destroyed it. As for skills, the Rogue might not use the 'make poison' skill, but would certainly have to use the 'apply poison' skill. This would be another skill that would be used more. The cash reward (or gems, or food and water, or other misc items) would also be low key. Since the Rogue is the one opening the chest he could keep what was inside all for him if he wanted wanted to. Making the item(s) fairly mundane and coin amounts small would ensure that class balance again is not thrown out of whack.<P>This idea may seem like fluff and just a 'perk' to the Rogue class, but only if you look at it that way. Remember, Verant could put ANYTHING in these chests that they want. From small amounts of coin, to quest related items, to poison players cannot make, the ideas could be endless.<P>---------- Idea 2 ------------<BR>----- Stuns from Behind ------<BR>------------------------------<BR>When I think of Rogues, I also think of how they interact with enemies and the like. Backstabbing is in there, as well as disarm, riposte, etc. But I also think that Rogues should be able to 'stun' and opponent from behind as well. After all, we are at a creature's backside 99% of the time anyway, so we should know how to do this. I know Rogues in EQ do not "mug" people, but I always think of how they take down opponents silently, and this is a very effective way. This could be implemented as a skill OR as a weapon. Both aspects are below as different sections, so please read all of it to make sure you see both options explained. Here are the details of this idea.<P>1-	Make it a SKILL or DISCIPLINE. The skill could be introduced at any level, low or high. This skill would be like backstab, in that you MUST be behind the creature to try AND you need a certain type of weapon in your hand (either primary OR secondary could be chosen). The weapon could be a simple blackjack or a club. OR it could be a certain weapon type, ex, a 'heavy' blackjack or a 'bouncers' club. Making it primary could be a way of offsetting the skill, since a Rogue could not backstab while they have a non-piercing weapon in their primary hand. Now, I know that you are thinking "what is stopping a couple of Rogues stunning an opponent so much that nobody in the group takes damage, that would be absurd". I agree. Verant could make the skill similar to a discipline, or make it a new discipline altogether. It could only be used once every X number of minutes. This way the Rogue could help out the group, but not be able to make an opponent incapacitated for such a long length of time to reduce the risk of a fight.<P>2-	Make it a WEAPON. The tougher version to control. Making it a weapon is certainly tougher of the two. Since it is an item that must be "acquired", not all Rogues would have a chance to get it automatically at a certain level by training it. The weapon could be quested for, purchased, or just found off of a mob (this could also be put into a chest from idea 1, see how good idea 1 is!!!...wink wink). Now, controlling how often a person can stun for with a weapon is harder to control as well. The easiest option is a weapon with a proc. I know some people have a problem with giving spells to tanks via weapons, so this would not sit well with them. Also, a Rogue could get lucky and stun with the proc a lot of times in a short period of time, but the opposite could happen as well. Just ask any Rogue who has a Bloodpoint and he/she will tell you that when you are desperately in need of that proc, it just never happens  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>That is it. The only other thing I have concerns with is Hide/Sneak staying up while zoning, but it has been covered.

</FONT><HR>The one and only positive change Rogues need is this ...<P>More quests.<P>I would give up a lot of bonuses for this one improvement. It distresses me greatly to see calls for more damage or better phat loot, when the outcome of some of the suggested changes would be to make Rogues even more uber than they are now. Don't make us better soloers, keep the Evade nerf in, do what you have to do. Just give us a few more mid-level quests. As a Dark Elf Rogue, we have the "collect a bunch of snake skins and fangs and put them in a bag" quest, and the "go to Rivervale and kill a pregnant woman" quest. The result of both of these quest is, well, a silver or two. w00t<P>While I think Everquest is an incredible game by a fantastic company, I think one thing horribly lacking in the mid level game are the quests.<P>Well, that and the "silent NPC" syndrome. Hire a writer to go through and add a bit of text to most NPC's in the old world. Just a bit of flavour. And change the "You've ruined your own lands, yada yada yada" thing. Would it really be that hard to make a few monster race specific sayings? I think those two changes {more quests and more diversity in what the baddies say and emote}, would be a HUGE benefit to Everquest.<P>Oh, and I just gotta say, the defensive cap is, frankly, too high. Right now it caps at 252, which is WAY too high for a lightly armoured scout. Plus, at high levels, Rogues can {sorta}easily hit the soft AC cap of 1100. There's no way this should be happening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having a rogue as my main character since DAY 1 of EQ, I'm very pleased with the class in its current state.  IMO the class fits very well now in terms of balance, but there are some small issues I'd love to see added or polished:<P>*Evade: change to a separate key and not tied to hide.  In combat, where every second counts, not being able to evade correctly because of client&lt;--&gt;server lag is bad news.  Also, in its current state it is near impossible to evade underwater (KedgeKeep for example.)  I believe evade is priority #1 -- if after the nerf the skill isn't effective it will be VERY devastating to the class.<P>*Hide/Sneak speed: change from level based to skill based.  IMO, as it is now, the benefits come way too late in the game level-wise...it misses a huge window where it would be very appreciated.<P>*Disarm weapon/Instill doubt: even at maximum skill (200), both skills are way too unreliable in terms of success rates.  Instill doubt ecspecially because of missed kicks and fear resists. % success rates need to be raised.<P>*Pickpocket: basically useless in the high level game because of MOB level restrictions  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>*Tracking!: fits the class perfectly and would be an excellent compliment to scouting situations.  I don't believe this would be unbalancing, keeping in mind possible skill caps and the fact that bards get the skill for apparently no real reason.<P>*Soulbound lockpicks: a great addition for corpse recovery situatons.  Currently the Gnome-tinkered mechanized lockpicks are exactly the same as normal lockpicks, yet cost 20pp vs. 1.5pp.  Maybe make the mechanized lockpicks soulbound?<P>*Watchman armor: Gnome rogues are restricted from wearing the tinkered armor, possibly becuase of it being plate based?  Oddly enough, the stats and effects on the various armor pieces seem suited for rogues..<P>*Sneaking underwater: not possible, therefore one can't hide/sneak underwater.  For KedgeKeep, a rogue has to resort to invis spells for corpse recovery...doesn't seem right, even though the sneak underwater message makes sense.  A minor issue.<P>Just my thoughts =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please Don't nerf Evade.  I seem to get beat on a fair amount right now.  With two warriors on the other side that mob turns maybe 50% of the time when I hit evade.  And that is a big maybe.  If you nerf it the healers will be wasting way to much time on us, and we will be back to no one wanting us in a group.  We are VERY group dependent so please don't ruin it.  You need to talk to Rogues (That have been around for a while)about this, not your testers that create one on the fly.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
