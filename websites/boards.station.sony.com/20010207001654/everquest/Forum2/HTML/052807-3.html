</FONT><HR>The major concerns have been listed, and I honestly hope the "Team" considers them.<P>The only things I would like to add are:<P>- Song of Shields.  As already stated this song gives no text when it is used (unlike ALL other bard songs.  I, and almost all other bards, rely on the text message feedback for our timing.  However, in addition to that this song makes a casting noise (like a cleric casting a buff).  Bard songs don't make any noises that others can hear for the very simple reason that we are "casting" a song every three seconds and the resulting cacophany would make us extremely unwanted.  Groups tell me NOT to play this song simply for its annoying sound.  Please remove the sound from this song.<P>- Casting animation on bard songs.  We are bards, we play our instruments...we don't cast spells.  I should not be swinging my arms over my head while playing my Chant series or while playing Niv's Melody of Preservation.<P>- Drums.  Why does my drum look like a flute?  You took the time to create a graphic for the Nostrolo's Tambourine (kudos on that one it looks great!), but all the other drums still look like a flute.  We've been asking for this to be changed for two years, please have your graphics people take a few minutes to create a drum graphic.  Aside from that it would be nice if different instruments of the same type looked different.  Not all spears look the same, not all swords look the same.  It would be nice (albeit a very minor issue) if different lutes had different graphics (or at least different tints).  The Conch Shell Horn is indistinguishable from a Minotaur Horn or a Brass Horn.<P>- Twisting.  Twisting songs for more than an hour at a time is physically painful as many others have already pointed out.  No other class is so demanding for the player.  Please bring this issue to the Team's attention.  The macro system already implemented was interesting, but not useful for bards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>By and large, I honestly think the bard class is pretty balanced right now, at least for my level.  I DO see some limitations lurking on the horizon and I also remember some of the struggles I have had fighting through the teens and then through 30 and 31.  With all that in mind, here are the things that I think could use some modification to balance our class with others.<P>1) Selo's Chains - either lower the resistance rate or lengthen the duration (reduce the secondary resist, in other words) so that it is a bit more reliable.  Soloing anything that runs halfway fast is fatal when you get a series of resists on this song and we often do.<P>2) There is no doubt that to be useful and successful a bard has to twist songs and twisting is wrist/hand intensive.  If there is any sort of mechanic you can create that allows a programmed twist, even if it is just mana/heal in downtime, it would really lessen the chances of dedicated bards crippling themselves with repetitive strain injury.<P>3) It seems to me based on what I read and what I can ascertain of the higher level songs and equivalent spells of other classes, that we really are added baggage beyond level 50.  If, on the other hand, our songs stacked straight up with those of enchanters/clerics/shaman, we would be seen as much more valuable.  Even if just the post level 45 line of spells stacked that way, it would open doors for us in a big way.  I think anyone who has gotten comfortable playing a bard is of the mind that they don't want to replace an enchanter or a rogue or any other class, but they do want to bring enough to the game that they are desired to fill in the multiple roles they play.<P>Steppy<BR>Bard of 33 Songs<BR>Luclin Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I tried. I read for 2 hours, and I'm not even on page two. So, I have to post without having read everything. (Do you blame me?)<P>1. When a bard song and a caster spell conflict, the bard song always has a shorter effect and probably also has a lesser effect (unless a caster in its teens is grouped with a bard in his 50's). MAKE SPELLS ALWAYS OVERWRITE SONGS, AND SONGS NEVER OVERWRITE SPELLS.<P>2. I get the message, "Your feet move faster," immediately followed by, "Your song ends." My buff icon disappears. It's not gameplay, it's a network traffic bug - the end of the first song arrives just after the beginning of the new one, and the ending goes into effect. ADD A SEQUENCE NUMBER TO THE EFFECT, SO BUFF 282773 FROM CHARACTER 2837 CANNOT BE CANCELLED BY THE END OF BUFF 282772 FROM CHAR 2837?<P>3. Buffing as a primary role (applies to Shamans, also) is broken by server age. It's very useful while resists / stats are lower, but as equipment levels rise, so do stats & resists pre-buffing. The 200 soft-caps come into play, and buffing loses value. SEE NEXT OBSERVATION.<P>4. Bard melee ability post-40 is ludicrous, and their defense is worse than a ranger's (figure parry & max hps in here). Bards are NOT HYBRIDS! They are an odd class, who start out as good fighters (due to self-buffing) and transition into casters somewhere in their late 20's / early 30's.<P>Bards have some advantages over other casters: they can only be interrupted by stun, and they rarely (never?) run out of mana. Their effects should be less than other casters. But someone else pointed out here that they can only really have 3 effects in play at a time: balance that against a shaman dropping 10 buffs on each group member, and the Bard having carpal tunnel syndrome. Yes, the bard buffs should be less effective, but not to the extent that they are.<P>I don't think improving Bard buffs is an answer, though. Remember point 3, above. I think giving Bards more effective, BALANCED attacks (more targetted DoTs at 75% of a druid's effectiveness per second? Poison-based, or sonic-based, to go with the frost / flame / magic-based ones? Maybe DD at 50% of a wizard's damage/second? Just ideas, here) will allow them to transition from buffing when it is appropriate, to doing some damage when buffing resists is no longer an option.<P>I recognize that Crowd Control is right out: if bards were effective at Crowd Control, two bards could lock down 6 or 7 mobs indefinitely (while all the casters in the party medded to full mana). In this case, not requiring mana would break the game.<P>I know I am talking about something major, and not just a little tweaking. I also know you (at Verant) have (had?) at least one person who plays a high-level bard. I wonder: does this bard play over a regular network connection, though, or does the bard play "in the office" to eliminate internet backbone issues? This is an honest question, and I think it should be asked, just to be safe.<P>Instruments that combine effects (drum+brass, drum+string, string+brass, etc) with bonuses (+10% to +15%) would be excellent additions to go with lambent armor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I completely agree with a need for a specialization skill.  Since it's quite obvious that bards, though described as hybrids, are forced into their form of casting as a result of horrible melee ability, a skill similar to casters seems in order.  Not that I think we should really have better melee skills.  I feel that even with the jack-of-all-trades label, we are still bards.  We should excel at playing songs, so our instrument fighting capability should be better than our melee.  Yes, we can wear plate, but honestly (excluding twinks) plate armor does not become available to a normal character until long after our tanking abilities have dissappeared.  Just because no other class in the game plays songs, and as a result, there is no basis of comparison to judge our instrument based skills, does not mean that our songs should be as undereffective as they sometimes are.  Just as Warriors are excellent tanks and Wizards are excellent nukes, we too should be excellent musicians...a label we often fall short of with unintentional nerfs to our songs and the subsequent excuses that they do not validate immediate patching.  Even at very low levels, some of the songs that could prove most useful have unbelievably high resists.  I could count on one hand the amount of times the level 8 lull and level 15 mez have worked.  Ironically, with all the complaints you see on this board, people still play bards for the challenge.  It should be a complex class to master, but complicated due to difficulty and complicated due to uselessness at high levels are two different things.  I think as far as all classes go, the game could definitely use more mid-level equipment.  Since our primary skill is charisma, some quest items should be available.  Instead, the items are obtained by brown-nosing higher level characters into helping you out.  The alternative is waiting until you are high enough to get the item yourself, but facing the fact that it has probably outlived it's usefullness.  For bards specifically, we need more instruments, especially weaker one's available to low-mid level characters without the need for twinking.  Everyone focusses on the higher levels, and I do admit, they need work.  But there are countless advocates of higher level problems, while very few to voice concerns over the first 30 levels of the game.  I don't particularly mind the obscenely high taunt that my bard seems to be.  Actually, it's kind of useful to know that the mobs are coming straight for me...it adds some predictability to the fight.  We can strategize based on it.  So, in summary...<P>1)  Specialization skill suggested by others is a very good, and long overdue, idea for a hybrid class that obviously leans more toward the caster side than melee.<BR>2)  Need more low-mid level quests/items, specifically, instruments.<BR>3)  Without upsetting the balance with enchanters, I would like to see the lull/mez songs actually work without needing to be twinked with an obscene amount of +CHA stuff.<BR>4)  Any balance changes that are made should be with the mindset that we play songs for a living.  That should be our strength.  We do not need Double Attack or better melee capability, we need to be truly exceptional musicians.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bards are not overpowered in the least. We have been nerfed repeatedly. Honestly now In order to achieve Viability in a group I have to CONSTANTLY twist songs just to be medocre??? All of our songs should work...that means 50%mez resists arent acceptable and 1 second snares too. Mana less magic sounds great...well when casters can sit down and rest to gain mana we bards are still twisting trying to make our half broken songs work. The reason many people dont play bards is because they arent terribly powerful at all. Sure bards have some solo potential(much like Druids), but that is only because of there wide range of skills which helps them heal and fight. But a bard rarely solos easily it can be done but is difficult often time consuming to do. I prefer grouping but my skills are either weak(melee)or useless with enchanters and other classes. I really think resists by BLUE mobs should be drastically scaled back. The problem bards get nerfed because of some soloing issue (fear kiting) and we lose an important skill being able to snare. Our AoE mez is pitiful, I dont want it to be grossly overpowered but it should stop blue mobs consistently and stop whites pretty well too. When i use AoE mez I forgo all buffs melee and any other songs just to AoE mez. I think if I concentrate on just AoE mez I ought to see  some results, not a bunch of red resist messages. PLEASE make our self only haste/buff songs stack with everything 100% after all all this song is bring the bards melee skills up to a more respectable level( no where near the other hybrids still). Also our other haste songs should stack at least partially with other haste buffs. Doesnt have to be 100% but make it worth using. And one more note plz Fix Selo/Song of travel/invis/Lev to encompass MUCH larger areas which include all people on autofollow. I really dont see a balance issue with increasing these songs ranges. In conclusion bards work harder than any other class and still fall short of other classes. I feel that if a bard is willing to put forth the effort he ought to be a very strong character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think much of the balance issue have already been gathered in the Concert Hall ahead of time, and Kaearia's post pretty much sums it up.<P>I just have something to add with the issue that bards aren't contributing enough to groups at high level.<P>Like Thott said quite many times already, after level 50+, bards' contribution to group are getting less and less efficient, and to a point that it's really a waste to bring bards to large scale raids.<P>There has been quite a few suggestions on how to balance this, one of the most reasonable one I believe, would be to allow bards' haste song to stack with enchanters' haste, as well as allowing bards' haste song to go through the haste cap.<P>However there is still one other thing that could be done. That is, to grant bards Double Attack.<P>Every melee and hybrid class in EQ can double attack, except bards. Early in the game, bards already have mana-free songs and thus giving double attack to bards seems too much power.<P>But as the game evolves, this doesn't neceesary be true anymore. Bards melee damage output is way too below par.<P>Other classes are getting more mana efficient spells, more spells and a much greater mana pool (even hybirds now have the same mana pool as casters given the same INT/WIS), and spells that last a very long time, bards song always lasted 12 seconds and need to be refreshed every 12 seconds.<P>That means at any given time, bards can only keep up to 3 songs active, while other classes can easily keep 5 or more buffs active.<P>Now to really allow bards to stand a chance in nowadays EQ, granting them Double Attack is merely one way to introduce more melee damage to bards.<P>I'm not saying granting bards the same Double Attack skills as Rangers, Monks or Rogues, bards should only get DA at a much higher level (maybe 53 or 54), which caps much lower than the other DA owners (let's say 100).<P>At high caps, DA can land triple or even quadurple hits PER hand, and with such a low cap as 100, bards at most can land double hits per hand.<P>This addition skills to bards would grant us more melee damage, but still wouldn't make bards into melee machine like rogues and monks, they still do 5 times more melee damage than bards.<P>Just my 2 coppers.<P>- Solos Chimamire<BR>- Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In reply to...<P>=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>In reply to the few people that said the epic weapon should stay the way it is.... ummm... how would you feel if you had to redo the quest?<BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Obviously none too pleased.  However, this is because I DID all the work.  If I hadn't started, I would have no problem with doing the quest- if I had a problem, I wouldn't have DONE it in the first place.<P>=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>The uberness factor... the ONLY way you will drop gorenaire is if you're an uber-uber guild. You probably can count the number of servers that have DONE it on one hand. <BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Off the top of my head:  Veeshan, Mithaniel Marr, Solusek Ro, Drinal, Nameless, Erollisi Marr, Erollisi Marr (2 different guilds).  This is 7 off the top of my head, and there are many more.<P>=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Friends and contacts? Are you kidding me? I'm L50, and we failed our last 4 out of 5 vox attempts. All my "friends and contacts" are WAY over the level cap. If I was on an old server, the likelyhood of me getting friends and contacts' twinks together to hit vox is greater than my friends and contacts' mains doing it.<BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Sorry that you haven't had luck in this area.<P>=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Trading ability. I thought we weren't supposed to BUY our uber weapons? The cash it'd run you to buy a vox scale probably is 50k pp+. Not to mention any guild that rips off it's own bards to sell the thing to a higher level bard is dispicable.<BR>=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>What makes you think that all guilds automatically HAVE a bard that will have a hope of killing Trakanon to obtain the epic someday?  Many many guilds allow all casters to random, award the scale to a caster, or allow all casters/bards to random.  Try buying it from one of these.<P>Again, I'm sorry it's hard.  It's still easier than many others (Warrior and Magician notably).  Also, the quality of this weapon far outshadows the quality of many others- I would rate it as the number 2 epic behind the Cleric.   Quite simply, this changes the game as a bard.  It damn well ought to be difficult.<P>My problem isn't the difficulty... it's forcing me to remain under L53... in a sick and twisted way, I kinda wish it could only be gotten off gorenaire, at least then I would rush my way to L60 so I could whoop up on her instead of farming. : P<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DB wrote:<P>&gt;"Drums... I really dont thing drums look like a stick and im 100% sure you dont strum them... unless ive been wrong all these years :-)"&lt;<P>I was aware of it.  But since I'm pretty much starting fresh here, give me things that you know I know, just so I don't forget to put them on the list.<P>NOR_Bard posted, but someone else wrote:<P>&gt;"In general, melee damage triples from 50 to 60 and spell damage increases 50%. Bard "spell" damage is really a form of melee damage, since the damage is slow yet takes no mana. Yet for some reason it follows a lesser curve than regular spell damage. I have no idea why."&lt;<P>Well, because you are comparing 1 song to all of the melee damage done by a rogue (why not pick a warrior, or a caster?).  Now, add the other things that the bard does into the equation, and let's talk further.  Look at damage by twisting two songs plus the damage done by increasing the attack speed of that same rogue.  Or look at the increased damage of that rogue when bard hasted, and the increased damage output of the wizard under the mana song AND whatever third song you want to sing…<P>I'll agree that perhaps we should look at the damage dealing ability of the bard.  But I'm not convinced that it's too low by this argument, as it fails to include all the other things that a bard does.  It's kind of like saying that an enchanter doesn't ramp up his damage as fast as a rogue after 50th level.  Bards are not just about damage dealing.<P>&gt;"Most bard songs don't get upgrades. They're designed to get better with level. If you take our Chant series as an example (a targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50, the song increases from 39 damage for 3 ticks to 48 damage for 3 ticks (+23%). From levels 50 to 60 it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You designed the level 50+ spells to represent a larger increase in power than just 10 levels. "&lt;<P>Far better argument.  Self contained and useful.  Thanks.<P>&gt;"- Tweak the formulae used for song effects in the 50-60 range, to accurately reflect the large increase in damage/effectiveness other classes get in the 50-60 range."&lt;<P>This is the best balance method, I think.  It keeps the balance within the class itself.  Then we can make items that tweak that balance slightly later.  The idea that a class would need to have an item just to be balanced doesn't sound right to me.<P>&gt;"The level 35 song (Denon's Dissension) is AE pulse based and drains 24 mana/pulse (i.e. you lose mana every time I sing the song). If I chain-sing this song (restart it every 3 seconds), I need 4x longer to drain as much mana as a like-level enchanter. It works out to about the same amount of time as the enchanter if you factor in med time, but you have to understand that an enchanter can haste and clarity his party before the fight, and mez extra mobs while he's draining mana. If I chain-sing this song, I can do *nothing* else except melee to contribute to the fight. Also, from level 37 to 57 this song only increases 9% in the amount of mana drained. The enchanter mana drain goes from 229 to 352 in the same level range (+54%). The way this song scales with level needs to be improved *badly*."&lt;<P>Well, 'badly' might be an overstatement.  But I can see your argument.<P>&gt;"The level 57 song (Cassindra's Insipid Ditty) is single target and drains a laughable 1.5 mana/sec at level 57. The drain rate is so low that most bards mistakenly thought the song didn't drain mana at all. It is 21x slower than enchanter mana drain. I would need 4 minutes to accomplish what the enchanter can do every 11 seconds. If you factor in meditate time, in the 4 minutes takes me to drain 350 mana with this song, an enchanter can drain 2100 mana, sit down, and med back all the mana he used. If we haven't killed the mob by then. Consider removing or lowering the resist check as well so we can use it on level 63 mobs. Ditty has a wis/int debuff component so it will not stack with itself, and only a single bard at a raid can be using it on a target."&lt;<P>Seems like it need looking into.  But keep in mind that the debuff component that you casually mentioned is probably considered a useful thing, and has to be taken under consideration when we look at this song.<P>&gt;"Solution: Remove the "soft cap" if it exists. Improve the player resist rate against these high-end targets with maximum resist, so that there's a significant benefit to getting up near 255. Double-check to make sure there's no roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 (or whatever the max is in your code)."&lt;<P>I know nothing!  I'll look into this.<P>&gt;"Comparing Rondo (57) to our level 54 song is a joke. If you're singing Rondo, a mob hitting your party on average 1.5 times every 3 sec will take 4 dam/sec from the damage shield. For the damage shield to offset the 23% loss in haste, your party must be doing less than 12 dam/sec melee damage for Rondo to be better than Celerity2…<P>…<P>Please either fix hastes/slows so an instrument increases them, or change these songs to have double their current haste/slow (optionally making them instrument-only)."&lt;<P>This whole part of your discussion got completely confusing.  You are trying to compare the haste component on a haste only song with a song that does several things (not just haste and damage shield).  My first thought would be that of course the haste will be less when you get a ton of other bonuses with the song.<P>Frankly, I am very dubious of any comparison of things that are rather closer to apples than oranges.  But I'll add the request to the list, and we'll hash it out internally a bit.<P>And, once again, comparing song with the spells for classes is a tough thing to do, and may not always be a fair comparison.<P>By the way, none of your links are complete…<P>&gt;"- The BP is a self-only 100 point heal with a 12 second cast time. In 12 seconds, a level 50 bard using a Plane of Hate lute can heal 80 hp for each party member. I don't even know what the point is making the BP's heal self-only. <P>- The vambraces have an effect of Invigorate - a targeted stamina replenishment. Our level 3 song replenishes stamina for the entire party. Our level 34 song does it while healing and giving mana."&lt;<P>Ok, I can see it.  The logic might have been that this is a 'free spell slot' for bards, but since you will have that song memorized to help your party, the clickable effects are not really useful.<P>&gt;"- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead. <BR>- The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above."&lt;<P>Welcome to the world of magicians…<P>Here I find it very easy to argue that not all items are supposed to be super useful.  These two can save you a trip to town and allow you to put it off until a more convenient time.  It's certainly not the most awesome effect in game, but that's not really a good argument.<P>&gt;"For the other classes that get it, Kunark armor effects give them something they didn't have before."&lt;<P>Here is where you get yourself in trouble with me.  I do not like the idea that classes now have the ability to do things they were not intended to do by the use of items.  I am strongly against such items, and their existence is certainly not going to convince me to ask that more such things go into the game.<P>&gt;" I suspect the same thing is happening with the Velious bard armor effects. Currently the Melodic BP right-clicks Song of Travel. Song of Travel has 12 second duration and an invis component so it drops every time you right-click to re-activate it. Since you have to re-activate it every 12 seconds, it's dropping every 12 seconds. It's pretty silly to put this on an item as an effect (actually, it's pretty silly to make right-click effects out of any song that bards usually leave playing, since you have to refresh it every 12 seconds)."&lt;<P>Now that's an idea (even if you don't actually state it).  Make the benefit of these items that the duration is a lot longer, so that these songs don't need to be resung once started.  I don't know how that would work balance-wise, or if it's possible in the game.  But I'm much more in favor of that than giving bards the powers of other classes through items.<P>&gt;"This nerf affects us even when we aren't fearing, and you didn't compensate us for it in any way."&lt;<P>To be fair, you should know that this is a red flag for me.  Compensation for a needed change (even if it was a nerf) is never something I will support.  Show me how this change unbalanced the class or something, but don't tell me that you deserve more power because something was taken away…  if it was made weaker, it was because it needed to be weaker.  There is no compensation.<P>&gt;"Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane (L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration. They could last the full 12 seconds, they could wear off immediately. No other movent slowdown spells in the game have a random duration, even though the spell versions last 10-50 times longer than Chain. It can't be because Chain has a slow component attached because no other slow spells in the game have a random duration either. I hear all the movement slowdowns except the level 1 snare used to be random duration, and were gradually changed to have a fixed guaranteed duration - except the bard ones."&lt; <P>A logical enough argument.  And you weakened it with this last line:<P>&gt;"In light of the above one-sided nerf, perhaps you could give these songs a guaranteed 12 second duration?"&lt;<P>But it does not invalidate your point.<P>&gt;"There's also an infrequent bug that affects all the movement debuff spells. If you try to chain/snare/darkness a mob that's already begun fleeing, sometimes the spell/song will land but will have no effect (if this happens, repeated attempts to chain/snare/darkness it will have no effect). Due to the random duration of Chain, bards are the ones who get bit by this one the most."&lt;<P>Never heard of it.  I'll list it and see if I can get someone to look into it.<P>"Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>And he may have been right.  But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard.  This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power.<P>&gt;"At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes."&lt;<P>One of us is making a logical error here...  Bardic hastes are not, primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior.  That's not the intent.  The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount.  Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class.<P>&gt;"You need to make sure the people designing this stuff understand that bards are a plate class."&lt;<P>Just because a bard CAN wear plate, that does not mean that all of the armor pieces designed for bards MUST have plate armor class.  That's a false assumption.  I agree that the designers need to keep the idea in mind, but don't go overboard.<P>&gt;"OTOH, if you just don't want bards picking any high level locks, leave the cap as is, but give us the skill at about level 10. That way it's at least usable by low level bards in Befallen and Najena. I'm not sure why you'd want to do this though, seeing as rogues already have several ability monopolies (backstab, pick pocket, invis+invis to undead, poisons)."&lt;<P>*sigh*<P>Well, of course rogues have a skill monopoly on basckstab, pick pockets… this is another one of my pet peeves.  I LIKE the idea that classes remain unique.  Telling me that bards somehow deserve a skill just because rogues have it is silly.<P>I'll add the pick lock cap to my list…<P>&gt;"Song of Shields (49) has no message. It went from bad (spamming us with a buff message for each group member), to worse (no message at all). Please put in a single line message (flagged bard song so others can filter it) just like all our other songs."&lt;<P>Seems like this needs fixing.<P>&gt;"The "song ends" "song starts" "song ends" bug is still around. I understand you're aware of it and trying to track it down. I can verify that it's a server-side problem, not a client-side one. If it happens to a damage shield song, I do not get the benefit of the damage shield. <BR>I also suspect the bug can also happen to mobs, who then unwittingly benefit. Several bards (including me) have noticed that sometimes we'll successfully re-charm a mob, get the "You don't have a pet to command" message, and 12 seconds later get the "Your charm has worn off" message. It sure sounds like the same bug only happening with a debuff on the mob."&lt;<P>I can't believe this is still around.  I'll add it.<P>&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song.  So I don't see this as a big problem.  All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period.  Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<P>&gt;"Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51) don't give any message when they're about to expire. You removed the message in response to complaints about the spam (we were constantly getting the message even with the song playing). The correct fix is to increase the duration of these songs by one tick so the message isn't generated for at least one tick, by which time the song's next pulse will refresh it. You had this correct fix in place with Aria. Then you removed the message entirely from both songs when you "fixed" Song of Travel."&lt;<P>Makes sense.<P>Ro-kenn said:<P>&gt;"What 'negative changes' do you have in mind Absor?"&lt;<P>Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that allows bards to change into werewolves.  And if anything else comes up, I'll add it to my list.  Right now, that's the only thing I have that I know of.<P>rbroz wrote:<P>&gt;"When in a group, all the messages I see that are to me state: Play the mana song. That should not only be are main purpose in life once we make 32nd lvl. "&lt;<P>I wanted to get this out of the way.<P>The groups that are asking you exclusively to play the mana song, they are your fault, at least in part.<P>You need to educate these groups about all of the other things you can do.

It's the same reason that I never ask anyone what level they have played their class to, or what class they play (though players often include that information regardless).  It is possible to understand the mechanics of EverQuest without actually having ever played the game.  Any well thought out argument can easily be proven.  I am willing to accept what you tell me as truth if it makes sense.

But we'll bring them to the attention of the team for future consideration.<P>Jochomo wrote:<P>&gt;"I doubt you'll read this far,…"&lt;<P>You're kidding, right?  This is only page 2!

</FONT><HR>Problems with being a bard -<P>My biggest concerns about bard balance are about bards in the later (50+) game.  Thott's post on the efficiency of bards as compared to other classes is particularly relvant - however bard's ability to take and deal melee damage also seems to follow similar curves.  At higher levels bards so called melee skill are very weak while at the same time our staple songs are being eclipsed by other classes.<BR>However my biggest concern about bard in general is carpal tunnel - twisting songs and switching instruments is becoming increasingly painful.  Additionally it means that i cant communicate with the rest of my group - unless i want to talk in 2-3 word bursts.  A beefed up macroing system, or some other method of selecting song combinations really is necessary.<P>Gulamin - Lvl 50 Bard of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, I think I disagree with the deluge of posters saying to increase melee skills ... at least until high level.<P>As any bard who knows the class real well can tell you, the most annoying thing to see is a bard standing there swinging two ykesha's playing mana song and using chain, and nothing else.<P>I've been in situations where I can do NOTHING else, when things are highly resistant, or perhaps when I need to level up my melee skills.  But in order to prevent the 45+ game from being overloaded with bard twinks who don't know squat about playing the game, I'm in favor of bard melee continuing to suck really bad until your over level 50.<P>Before anyone decides to respond to this with derogitory comments, I went through the game as a bard from level 25 to 46 twisting songs, swapping instruments, and very rarely meleeing.  I know the class quite well, enough to know that if you spend all your time meleeing because your melee skills don't suck, you won't learn what being a bard is really about.<P>The idea for us to get double attack doesn't fit our role as a bard.  We aren't warriors.  Though I think one real nice idea would be for bards to get backstab that caps at 100 (at level 50), and give us more piercing weapons we can use at higher levels, then allow our singing shortsword to be used in our off-hand as an instrument, but if lyran's lute (and other primary 1h instruments) are equipped, it nullifies any and all instrument effects, similar to when you are using an instrument, and hold an instrument of the same type in your cursor.  I'm not suggesting you turn currently nice rogue-only weapons into bard/rogue only weapons, but a bit more variety would be nice.<P>Another huge problem is how resistable our songs are.  I don't see how it would be possible to make it so our songs aren't resisted 90% of the time in velious without making them nearly unresistable in the old world, but who knows, maybe you have (or can add) a flag to the songs that does a check:<P>if (bPlayerIsInVelious)<BR>bLowerResists = TRUE;<P>I go into dungeons in Velious, and find that none of my chants will land, or if they do they break early; chains is resisted more than chants, and breaks early; charm resist's a lot, breaks early, and giants refuse to obey orders half the time if I don't pound /pet back off 'til my keyboard is broken, and even then they oft times end up attacking the mage, and the mage's pet then goes off on the pet (and then me when charm breaks).  Best of all, giants in velious are immune to mesmerize.<P>Kelin's Lugubrious Lament - Highly resistable, duration is too small and/or random, song does not report having worn off.  You don't often find yourself trying to lull just one target, there's typically 2-3 things you don't want to come with a pull.  Suggestion: make instruments augment duration (I know it's by tick's, and not by time, but give us a break here.  Sung, 2 ticks, normal/gypsy lute, 3 ticks, kelins lute, 4 ticks), make it less resistable the better the instrument, or a combination of the two.<P>Cinda's Charismatic Carillon - Instruments do not augment the effect, or the range.  It claims it's a wind instrument, but I've yet to see any benefit from using a wind over just singing.  I've been SO close to bumping my faction up from say, apprehensive to indifferent with this song going that if an instrument DID affect it, it would have shown indifferent.  Killing and/or doing quests there after proved I truly was on that verge.<P>Brusco's Boa****l Bellow - The damage on this is laughable, it should have a 0.0 second stun component (which it does not), rather than relying on it's knockback effect to be able to stun a caster.<P>Guardian Rhythmns - Won't stack with chant of battle.  The reason for this is that both songs increase AC.  Please, take a moment and compare the relative AC gained at various levels, and help me to understand how this would be unbalancing to stack?  It might help mitigate a few more damage points, but would allow me to provide a 3rd usefull buff during encounters which need high resists.<P>Denon's Disruptive - Please lower resist's on this song.<P>Shauri's Sonorous Clouding - Please increase duration to 4 ticks as you did with levitate, and if you wouldn't mind, increase the range a bit.  At times, people like to use /follow, but the distance people end up following me at with that command is outside the reach of this song.<P>Largo's Melodic Binding - Nice song, can we get a targeted version?  Thanks<P>Melanie's Mellifluous Motion - How about either putting entire party in same spot, or moving everyone random distances in the direction the bard and/or party member is facing.<P>Alenia's Disenchanting Melody - Very random, could you make it work a bit more straightforward?  About all I use it for is debuffing groups for naggy/vox runs, but it has it's uses.<P>Selo's Consonant Chain - Lower resist's, and make it fixed duration at 3 ticks instead of random 1-3 ticks.<P>Crission's Pixie Strike - Great song, if there's one song I don't want you to change for the worse, it's this one.  Though I certainly wouldn't mind the duration being upped to say, 4 ticks if i'm using an instrument =)<P>Fufil's Curtailing Chant - Make damage & resist reduction on par with the other two chants.<P>Agilmente's Aria of Eagles - Please put the message 'you feel as if your about to fall' back in.<P>Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity - Bug that doesn't allow you to chain sing this song, increasing mana regen by 1/3.  Currenly, chain singing the song creates 'phantom mana', making it appear as if the caster is regenerating mana 1/3 faster, however when the caster begins to cast a spell, or uses any castable items (ie., jboots), the fake mana disapears.<P>Lyssa's Solidarity of Vision - Please fix replication of data to be more accurate when something or someone is targeted, and allow this song to break the restriction of casting on someone who is in the water while you are not, or vice-versa.  Problems with this song are: when someone not in your group gets too far away, all you see are basic 'anticipated' movements (ie., the person supposedly moved forward, so their body animates), but if the person is fighting, you see nothing but them standing there, and sometimes whatever their fighting doesn't even appear.  Things that your seeing through another person (or things eyes) should be replicated more reliably to you, while things around you are replicated less reliably to compensate for the increased bandwidth lost when the other data is fed to you.<P>Cantana of Soothing - 1/3 less effective than heal/mana/stamina regen songs we get previously.  The amount of mana received while twisting it with 1 tick cantana 2 ticks chorus of clarity is nearly negligeable.  I personally just twist 1 tick heal + 2 ticks mana to help out the healer(s) in the group.<P>Denon's Dissension - Chipping in my word on this song, hoping you'll fix it.  Suggestion:  Make it target based, and drain 3-5 times the amount of mana it currently does, REQUIRING an instrument.<P>Vilia's Verses of Celerity - Great song, stacks with Speed of Shizzar, however I believe it's only the agi/ac components stacking, but the haste component does not.  If you were to make the speed component stack, bards all over would sing high praise of you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Psalm of Purity - rarely cures a poison dot before the dot has ran it's course.<P>Tuyen's Chant of Flame - Scale the amount of FR that it drops even more post 50, along with scaling the damage it does.<P>Solon's Bewitching Bravura - Halve the amount of mana it requires.<P>McVaxius Berserker Crescendo - Haste not being augmented by instruments.  What's the point of using a horn if i can sing it and get the same effect?<P>Denon's Desparate Dirge - Make it target based, NOT AE, keep the amount of damage it does, require 160 damage, and have a slow component added to it for about 60% slow that last's 1 minute.  At level 43 when we attain this song, your typical bard has approximately 850-900 mana, so you'll have 5 shots with this song, and then 1 additional use every 20-25 minutes.  Personally that would fall under the 'desperate dirge' category to me, since I try to save my mana as much as possible for charming.<P>Cassindra's Elegy - The amount of int/wis that this add's gives a very negligeable amount of mana.  Playing this song for myself, with no other int increasing items on, I saw my mana bar go from full to missing a single pixel of mana.  I realize 44 int/wis is a lot, but about all I'd use this for is trade skills<P>Jonthan's Provocation Target - Please make this target based again, and return the rune component to it.  This was a very usefull spell for keeping pet's alive if you had an all caster group.<P>Tuyen’s Chant of Frost - Scale the amount of CR that it drops even more post 50, along with scaling the damage it does.<P>Shield of Song - Fix the casting sound, casting animation, no message, and please allow this song to be 'refreshed' more often than once a tick.  As is, if the effect is partially used up on someone, and it is re-sung within the space of a single tick, the rune is not reset to full strength.<P>Melody of Ervaj - Personally I'd rather have the mana drain component that was originally in it ... who cares about a 5% haste song?  Especially when it requires an instrument.  Suggestion:  Target based mana drain (double that of 35 mana drain) + target slow: 30%<P>Selo's Song of Travel - How about 2nd song of travel without the invis component?  I'd rather have one of each personally<P>No opinion on the other 50+ songs, I'm not that high yet ...<P>Melodic Breastplate: Change effect to a version of selo's accelerando with a levitate component (but not invis), make it an effect that is always on, and (preferably) group, not self only.  Also should be augmented by an instrument if you have one in hand if the speed is not already on par with that of a drum.<P>Make sure someone who actually understands what it's like to play a bard as high as 55+ is the one who reviews changes to the bard class, and isn't just told 'see if you find something wrong' and isn't told what is changed, as you do with your test server players.  One thing that your playerbase doesn't know is that typically speaking, test players know only a little more (if that) about what was changed than the general populace finds out, and that's not saying much.  I realize you want to make the  game fun for them as well, and don't want spoiler information leaking out, but SOMEONE who understands it needs to test it.<P>SS boots and greaves, summon a stack of 20 at a time please.<P>SS breastplate, how about a regeneration effect similar to fungi tunic (though it doesn't have to be THAT nice)<P>SS gloves, here's one of those nerfs ... works for anyone under level 45, but it's not supposed to.  Similar to the iksar ceremonial breastplate and it's regeneration.  It's proc level is 45, but it works for anyone.  Suggestion: targeted right click effect: enduring breath.<P>SS Bracer, I love it, a stackable damage shield =)<P>SS arms, instead of a castable invigor, how about permanent invigor?  Bard never loses stamina.<P>SS helm, instead of eye of zomm, I'd rather have a zero-time cast bind sight that last's until I remove the effect.<P>singing shortsword: if you take my suggestion of giving us a capped at 100 backstab, I'd suggest either making it a piercing weapon, or allowing it to go in offhand but nullifying any instrument effects for 1h primary hand weapons, to allow for piercing weapons to be used for backstab.  OR, give us a backstab that can work with either primary or offhand weapons.<P>Again, I wanted to touch on instruments.  There is a large number of our songs which are supposed to be affected by an instrument which aren't, or the amount it helps is negligeable.  Take wind instruments for instance, the only two songs I can think of where a flute is usefull is level 19 invis (required, doesn't increase range with better flutes, doesn't increase duration), and pixie strike (increases the amount of MR that is debuffed).<P>Now, last, I just had a fairly heated debate with some people about what bards should/shouldn't be doing.  One of them used to play a bard, and deleted her after selling all her equipment when she realized that bards are so useless post 50.<P>They all seem to think that post 50, bards are there to provide mana, resist buffs, and get bard only no drop items that would normally rot.  This from people who are in what might be considered an 'uber' guild (god i hate that word).<P>They don't want us there to crowd control (charm hard capped at ~51-52, pixie strike and higher level mesmerize only allow for controlling up to 3-5 targets at most, provided there's zero resists ... typically speaking though, you get 30-40% resists, so realistically we're talking 2-3 targets), they don't want us for haste (our only two stackable haste songs are instrument only and give a measily 5-10% haste), they don't want us for slowing (our best slow only does 35%), they don't want us for snaring (snare is highly resistable, unguessable duration) ... they want us for resists, and mana.  That's it.<P>So, when you see the things I and other's here list as things we want improved, it has nothing to do with us wanting to have a god-like class that can do everything in the world.  I don't think 3/4 of the stuff I've listed will get implemented.  But the more I list, the more you'll consider, and the more usefull things you might allow me to do post 50.<P>There was a level 60 bard who posted some figures on how much damage he could do in melee per minute.  I think it's just sickening that melee-wise, with nearly maxed haste, with nice high end weapons, a bard could deal only 1200 damage a minute.  When going against Trakanon, dealing that kind of damage, it's so negligeable as to not even be noticed.  Trak typically goes down in under 40 seconds, so the amount a bard fully equipped with the best gear is helping out in such minor ways as to not even be noticed.<P>Our songs have very high resist's at high levels, so it does no good to use anything but buffing songs ... oh, but no one wants our buffs, they won't stack for the most part with other classes.<P>Anyways, that's enough of my ranting.<P>-Desbarolis -- 46th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

HOWEVER, since there are ALREADY items in the game for other classes ( Ie. Warriors, who were never intended to wield magic, are now capable of casting an impressive array of spells!! WTH? ) the only way to BALANCE this is to either give us some as well, or remove thiers. Warriors should not cast spells under ANY circumstances.

</FONT><HR>Bards getting backstab has got to be one of the most ridiculous suggestions I have ever heard. Double attack makes MUCH more sense to me, as we are associated with SPEED, and thus we can perhaps swing our blades faster than a big fat shadowknight. I dont think having double attack makes us a warrior.However, I can live without it.<P>Backstab takes into account the shady/stealthy character of the rogue, able to remain unseen by the enemy, until the moment he strikes from behind. Bards roguish skills are mostly parlor tricks. We are not stealthy by any means. We wear plate and we have huge, colorful spell effects that fill the entire screen. Backstab is absolutely out of character. Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;I am strongly against such items, and their existence is certainly not going to convince me to ask that more such things go into the game.<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>Actually, every item except Eye of Zomm (Take it back, please!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) is an ability we already have.  Forage = (sort of) summon food and drink, we already have damage shields, we already have enduring breath and Invigor and wayyy better heals than the BP.<P>As you mention later on, giving us effects that last longer than bard songs is a great way to go.  let's see:<P>Breastplate - supposed to be useful since it is an Uber item (Abashi said so  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">).  Change this, definitely.<P>Gauntlets - 'Always on', non-negatable Enduring breath. Woohoo! (seriously, I want these gauntlets!)<P>Bracer - stackable, longer lasting damage shield - nice little improvement.<P>Greaves - summon food. ACK! Foraging non-*poof*ing food is easy.<P>Boots - summon water - OK, foraging water is a little tougher.<P>Vambraces - We have several stamina regen songs, including a couple that also give health and mana - we will usually have one memmed.<P>Eye of Zomm - we already have Bind sight. I suppose this is an upgrade.  Might be good for feeding Necros on raids.  Still, anything else would be an improvement.  How about a longer lasting version of Veracious Concorde?<P>I think a nice idea for something we already have now, but longer lasting would be levitate.  The level 51 song has invis, so any circumstance that would bring that down (being attacked by a skellie, twisting corpse song, etc) will end it.<P>A long lasting levitate (no bat wings) would be a great alternative to using the Song of Travel - it just saves some twisting on our part.<P>It would be even kinder of you to make its casting time &lt; 12 seconds so when it starts to run out we can refresh without losing speed.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. &lt;&lt;<P>Actually, the level 39 Charm spell uses mana as well.  Until Song of twilight, Charm is a bard's most effective means of crowd control.  Losing mana=losing a lot of crowd control as the level 27 charm doesn't work on mobs above level 37.<P>&gt;&gt;Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that allows bards to change into werewolves. &lt;&lt;<P>Ok, I know you don't like compensating for nerfs, but if you take this away, can you give us an in game story (possible quest tie-in) explaining why Bard faction is opposed to Mistmoore, and maybe a baskstory involving the gypsy musicians?  you could trade Illusion:Werewolf for Allusion:werewolf   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&gt;&gt;&gt;"3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>new instance of the song. . . .&lt;<P>I consider this a very minor bug. It can't be very common. But I'll add it to the list.&lt;&lt;<P>It is still fairly common, depending on your lag.  It can happen any time you are twisting three songs.<P><BR>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<P>**It's not our only mana-using song.  Our higher level Charm song also uses mana--and a LOT of it, for something that needs to be refreshed every 12 seconds.  Oh, that one doesn't work quite right either--it functions like a spell with the song stopping instantly on success or failure, rather than taking a few seconds...probably don't want to fix that because higher level bards are used to it, but it can throw off a newly-39 Bard.<P><BR>&gt;"At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes."&lt;<P>One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not, primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior. That's not the intent. The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount. Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class.<P>**Absor:  What he means is the party loses the bard's melee output because that song requires an instrument....I think that's what he means at least.  And that the haste would have to be 45% to compensate for the loss of the Bard and actually be beneficial.<P>&gt;"3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>new instance of the song. Very very annoying when you're selo's cuts out while kiting a<BR>mob."&lt;<P>I consider this a very minor bug. It can't be very common. But I'll add it to the list.<P>***It is AMAZINGLY common--but ONLY for Bards.  Other classes are affected too but it is rare that they time their spells well enough that it happens to them.  However, I can count on it happenning at least once a day if I'm busily kiting something.<P><BR>If you would like, I can always just ignore player input until I have had the time to level every class up to 60th level and become qualified enough to understand what people tell me…<P>There is a reason that I never tell people what classes I play, and to what level. It's the same reason that I never ask anyone what level they have played their class to, or what class they play (though players often include that information regardless). It is possible to understand the mechanics of EverQuest without actually having ever played the game. Any well thought out argument can easily be proven. I am willing to accept what you tell me as truth if it makes sense. I would hope that you would accept what I say only if it makes sense and not based on what characters I have or have not played.<P>**Bravo.  Abashi admitted he plays a necro, once...and it still haunts him.<P><BR>OH, one more BIG thing, to me at least.  At the release of the game the graphics for a Bard singing were a TON more spectacular than they are now.  I particularly remember Bruscoes' Boa****l Bellow with a line of translucent bubbles streaking out from the Bard's hands to smite the target soundly (no pun intended).  Now...a little light and a bit of a color flare but it's a lot less pretty.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Most bards probably have quite a bit lower I'm sure. But a ranger around 50 or so tanks better than me even with only 850-900 ac. The reason they tank better is skill caps.  I'm not sure what mine and rangers dodge cap at but they're close.  However bards get parry at 53 and it caps at 75 while rangers cap at much higher (185 this site i'm looking at says) and get the skill at level 18 .  Sooooo if rangers are the only offesive hybrid BUT tank better than bards.  What are bards then ?

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thott (Guildmaster of Afterlife) had made 2 article that sums up the issues we have with bards' lack of power and haste stacking, since I think you are not reading the links posted by him, I'm reposting them here..<P>The nice graphs are MISSING so please do visit the link if you get a chance.<P>---<P>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/powercurves.html<P>Bard Power Curves<BR>By Thott<BR>Also see Bard Haste Stacking<BR>Discuss<BR>Bard effects are weak. When asked why bard effects are weak, the same answer is always given: bard effects are weak, because bards do not require mana. Fair enough. The implication here is that bards, because they do not require mana, can do more than a caster, which is limited by mana, over a long period of time.<BR>In other words, if a bard and a caster both share an ability, then in an hour of play time, the bard can do more of that ability than the caster can. Sure the caster can do more in a short period of time, and the caster can gain great power right now in exchange for downtime later, both of which a bard cannot do, but over time, the bard does more. Bards are marathon runners, casters are sprinters.<P>Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be true. Consider this graph: <P><BR>This graph shows the time required by a bard to keep four tanks hasted in their group, which is 33% (three songs, one of which is haste). The pink line is the time required by an enchanter to keep four tanks hasted with their best haste, i.e. what percentage of an enchanters mana regen is needed to maintain the buffs. This does not include augmentation or augment, just their regular (more expensive) haste series, and VoG at 60. If the no-mana version of haste that a bard uses, the one with lesser effect, is to be better over time than the high effect enchanter, then the time required for the bard would have to be less than the time required by the enchanter. And for some level ranges, it is. But at higher levels it's not even close. <P>Some people pointed out that bards don't have to keep haste up during downtime, so the time required for bards to haste is lower than 33%, and this is true. But a good group has very little downtime, so in those groups the value is close to 33%. And even more importantly, during downtime, a bard sings just one song. So the next graph, showing time required for clarity, would actually have a bard at 100% during downtime periods. What's more, the below graph only shows 33% time required to do clarity for a bard, yet before cantana, it's actually 66% (2 pulses) to equal clarity. <P><BR>This graph shows the time required for a bard or an enchanter to maintain their best clarity-like effect on four members of their party. For a bard this means they use one of their three songs to provide mana. For a enchanter this means using their mana to cast their clarity buff on everyone in the party. If a bard is better over time, then the bard would need to spend less of their time to achieve the clarity effect than an enchanter would, which is obviously not true. <P>It has been pointed out that bard clarity is better than enchanter clarity. This is false for Chorus of Clarity, the 32 bard song. It is identical to enchanter clarity in the mana it gives, but it in reality worse, because it requires two pulses per 3 song cycle in order to keep up. Cantana is better than clarity II...by one point of mana per tick. In both cases, all a bard has to do is miss one pulse per minute, either due to stun/bash/missed notes/operator error, or due to time spent trying to do crowd control, or for that matter, even time spent LD, for enchanter clarity to be better. <P>Now that Velious is out, the higher level enchanter gift spells add mana as well, and pay for themselves to be cast on the rest of the party with the mana they give the enchanter. With the gift series, enchanters give more mana, period. <P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Enough of efficiency. For some reason, enchanters not only have stronger effects, but the effects are more efficient (by far) and get more and more efficient at higher levels. This must be because bards get more powerful at higher levels, that their power curves increase faster, in order to make up for the increasing efficiency difference. Right? Right?!? <P>Here's a comparison between healing capability. The actual values aren't important, what is important is the shape of the curves. Note that all the classes profiled here have the same shape curve, except for bards. The bard curve is much flatter. Why doesn't bard healing follow the same curve? <P>This graph doesn't account for CH, for a graph comparing cleric healing with and without CH, even including the cleric BP, go here. <BR>At 41 bards get Psalm of Mystic Shielding, which stacks with hymn and adds a small amount of healing, and at 47 bards get Niv's Melody of Preservation, which adds a bit more healing, and stacks with hymn, but does not stack with Psalm of Mystic Shielding. These are not on the graph because they are less efficient. Adding them in would actually make the curve increase even less, because this is a graph of efficiency, not speed. Adding the other songs would make the line for bards rise if this graph were showing healing speed, but on any healing speed graph, bards would be so far down at the bottom as to be one with the border. <P>What about damage? Here's a graph of sustained damage for bards, using the most efficient damage song a bard has at any given time, graphed vs. wizard and druid sustained nuke damage/sec. Sustained nuke damage/sec is how much damage a druid/wiz can do using only nukes starting from zero mana. <P>Note that the actual numbers here don't matter. A bard can do more damage by using an instrument (which doesn't do much to the curve btw) or by using more than one song. A bard in full "nuke" mode can do more damage over time than a caster in nuke mode starting from OOM, which is to be expected. This is one case where a bard really is better endurance wise, which I fully believe they should be, yet the curve is still wrong. <P>The reason that bards can do decent damage around level 50 even with the flat curve is that the songs themselves limit a bard prior to level 46. Before 46 a bard doesn't have 3 decent damage songs to sing, so damage is limited to just 2/3 of what it could be based on the curve. So the curve increases in max possible damage output with a more normal shape due to when the songs become available. Yet a bard is surely singing three songs, a decent bard is at least, prior to 46, so switching from 2 to 3 damage songs isn't an increase in damage, it's trading something else the bard was singing for damage. It increases the speed, not the efficiency, of damage the bard can do. And thus the graphed curve is accurate, and it's flat. <P>It's equivalent to giving a caster a spell with a long recast on it, then later giving them another spell with a long recast on it. Now the caster can do twice as much damage in the same period of time by alternating spells, but their efficiency is unchanged. <P>No matter how one looks at it, from 46 on, the curve is wrong. <P><BR> <BR>Again, the graph is much flatter for bards than for wizards/druids. <P>Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level. I did this analysis when after a long period of time playing I began to feel that bard power simply didn't improve equal to other classes. All the songs improved, and higher level ones were a bit better, but it just felt like the class as a whole wasn't improving properly. <P>If I had only one 50+ character and it was a bard, then I would discount the feeling as simple class envy, but I have two other 50+ characters and they progress fine. I also do a great deal of game analysis, to help determine what is the best direction for my guild to go in terms of recruitment, and every piece of data I collected pointed to the same thing. <P>Actually graphing the curves turned out to show an even greater difference than I expected. <P>There are some bard effects that are actually quite good efficiency wise, such as fear at 26 and charm at 27. But once the 27 charm is useless and a bard switches to the 37 charm, the efficiency is gone. And as levels increase the bard cost for aoe fear stays the same, yet the cost for others goes down. My necro for example can keep a mob darknessed and feared non-stop and gain mana. At 26, my necro could not. But since 49 it's been trivial to do so. For a bard, the difficulty is constant. If Song of Midnight slowed mobs instead of speeding them up, then it would be the solution, since the time required for a bard to fear/chain something would then decrease. <P>Charm is wonderful at 27, too wonderful in fact, it should in my opinion be gimped, either by reducing its range or by having it require mana. Charm kiting is simply too powerful. It is my hope that the flat power curves are not left as they are as a punishment to the class for the 10 levels of charm kiting glory. <P>There's more. Not only are the curves flat for all levels, including past 50, but past 50 many key abilities are stripped away. The bard charm cap doesn't change at all from level 39 through level 60. At 50 a bard can fear a red mob. At 60 a bard can fear only a low blue. The cap (53) doesn't change. Bard mes is capped as well, at 55. On mobs that are over 55 a bard can't charm them, can't mes them, and can't fear them. A wizard is better at crowd controlling these mobs, because a wizard can root. A bard can not. I can't find anything that increases even as fast as other classes past 50 much less so much faster than other classes as to require removing other abilities to compensate. <P>Along those same lines, bard Selo's at 50 is 65% base speedup, 10% faster than SoW. By 60, a druid is moving at 70% speed with their wolf form, FASTER than a non-drum bard, to say nothing of the movement advantages given by Egress. Why doesn't bard speed increase past 50? Other bard songs do. Well this question I know the answer to: Selo's doesn't increase past 50 because anything faster than level 50 Selo's plus a drum from Nagafen results in no movement increase. <P>In Kunark beta, Selo's increased past 65% like one would expect, up to 75% at 60. Any bard past 50 that used a Nagafen drum moved at normal movement, no boost whatsoever, so the song was changed to cap at 50. This was the fast fix to get the expansion out the door, but it means that the one bard ability that bards value above all others (remember the outcry when Selo's didn't work with a drum?) is gimped for a reason other than class balance, simply because it didn't work when it was first tried. Hurry hurry, we must release! <P>This is a bigger problem than it first appears, because if any drum comes out that is a bigger boost than Nagafen's drum (and I am told there are some in Velious) the same thing will occur - that drum plus Selo's by a 50+ bard will result in no movement increase. This cap needs to be tracked down and increased, to match 75% base improved by the highest instrument modifier possible. Right now you can see the bug easily by using the Puretone discipline then hitting Selo's. The result is no movement boost. Don't try using Selo's to get away if you're using this discipline, it won't work. <P>I would graph the time expense involved per percentage of movement increase but with 40 mana for SoW and 33% time require even at 60 for Selo's there's no point, it's obvious that Selo's is incredibly expensive. At least with a drum it's fast, and it's worth paying more for something if it's better than everything else. <P>In any event, it's pretty obvious this class is not balanced. <P>Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt; <P>---<P>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html<P>Bard Haste Stacking<BR>By Thott<BR>Also see Bard Power Curves<BR>Discuss<BR>Technical Background<BR>Haste is represented in Everquest as a number greater than 100. 10% haste is represented as 110. The problems with haste stacking throughout the history of EQ are all related to this fact. <BR>If a strength spell stacks with another, then the strength values are added. If a resist spell stacks with another, then the resists are added. So if a haste spell stacks with another, the hastes are added:<P><BR>Haste1(10%) + Haste2(20%) = NewHaste(30%) &lt;-- expected<BR>Haste1(110) + Haste2(120) = NewHaste(230 = 130%) &lt;-- actual<P>History<BR>In early beta, bard haste stacked, and instruments worked with bard haste songs. The level 10 song Anthem de Arms was a stringed song, meaning its effects were boosted when using a lute. As described above, this mean that the doubled haste was extremely high. Its original haste value was higher than 10% I believe, but even at 10%, the resulting haste would be 110+110=220=120%, which is far faster than anyone expected. <BR>The end result was a bard with a lute singing Anthem de Arms made the entire group an incredible killing machine. The more than double attack speed was impressive to behold, as I actually had occasion to experience it. Bards were rare, so it wasn't very common, but any group that had a bard would cut through mobs like butter. Healing was hardly an issue, as mobs simply didn't live long enough for it to matter. <P>This was, of course, fixed. The fix was first to lower the haste on Anthem de Arms (and all other bard songs), which of course didn't work, (10% haste doubled is 110+110=220=120% haste), so Anthem was changed to be singing only. No lute, no bug, no problem. <P>Sometime around this time a haste cap was put into the game. This worked as a general catch-all for any such haste bug. No matter what happened inside the haste calculation code, there was only so much haste a player could have, based on their level. This is the same haste cap we have today, patched up to extend past 50. <P>Later in beta, in phase 4, it was discovered that a bard singing Jonathan's Whistling Warsong and Anthem de Arms, which stacked then and still stacks now, would cause the same haste bug, for the very same reason. The fix was to make ALL hastes not stack in any way. Anyplace where the code would add two hastes together it instead takes the highest one and uses that. This solved the 20% or so haste from Jonthan's plus 10% from Anthem to be 20% instead of 120+110=230=130% haste (which simply hit the cap). <P>When I say all places in the code, well that means all places, including where the code would double the effectiveness of a song when using an instrument. This is why GZ said that McVaxius` Berserker Crescendo had increased haste with an instrument - when he tested it in early beta it did, but in late beta it was disabled, so now it doesn't. <P>Enter final. In final all the bugs with haste stacking were hacked up to not be visible, except for one remaining place hastes stacked that was overlooked: item haste. Item haste and spell haste stacked. And just like spell+song or song+song haste before, when it stacked, it stacked wrong. So a 20% belt plus a 10% song/spell resulted in 120+110=230=130% haste, which hit the cap. <P>A few months ago this bug was finally fixed. Now, hastes can stack and stack properly. A 20% item plus a 10% spell/song results in 30% haste. However, all the other places where haste was originally supposed to stack, that were disabled (most likely with full intent to reenable them later when the core bugs were fixed), were left alone. <P>Up until this point, bard song didn't stack with enchanter hastes, but bard song gave max haste to anyone with a haste item. Both were bugs but one was negative to bards, and the other was positive. It wasn't optimal but it was still somewhat balanced. The fix changed that. <P>What If Haste Stacked?<BR>What if bard haste stacked with enchanter haste, would it be too good? Would it unbalance the game at this point to allow it, after all this time? <BR>Well, it didn't unbalance the game to remove the haste+item=max haste bug, reenabling regular haste stacking won't be any worse, but lets look at the numbers. Here are two groups, one with an enchanter giving max haste (I test max haste to be 95%, but my numbers are typically a bit low, so lets say it's 100% inside the system), the other with an enchanter and a bard adding haste past the cap: <P><BR>Group 1:<BR>Warrior 50 damage/sec<BR>Rogue 100<BR>Rogue 100<BR>Rogue 100<BR>Enchanter<BR>Cleric<BR>Total damage: 350 damage/sec<P>Group 2:<BR>Warrior 61 (45% haste stacked on top of max haste)<BR>Rogue 123<BR>Rogue 123<BR>Bard 30 (25 base)<BR>Enchanter<BR>Cleric<BR>Total damage: 337 damage/sec<P>Not exactly godlike, even in the perfect situation where the group has heavy melees. Every rogue slot replaced with something that does less damage (i.e. any other class) makes the bard version of the group even weaker. For example if one of the rogues were a warrior, then the first group loses 50 damage/sec, but the second group loses that 50 damage/sec plus 23% more, or 61.5 damage/sec total. That other 11.5 damage/sec is taken straight from the damage the bard is adding to the group, which even in the perfect case is less than a rogue. <P>The reason haste stacking isn't as good as one would initially think is because haste is added, not multiplied. 45 added to 100 is 45%, but 45 added to 200 is only 22.5%. Haste stacking by its very nature provides limited returns. <P>Now we have the Ervaj line, which I inadvertantly had input into. I stated that the #1 problem with bards, and the only thing that could really make any difference to the class without a huge overhaul, was haste stacking. Well the designer working on Velious bard songs couldn't change how haste stacks and say that's part of the expansion. His job was to come up with a few new songs, nothing more. So he created haste stacking songs. <P>The value he used for the level 60 version is 10%. I assume he intended the 10% to mean 10% more damage. With an instrument, that would be around 23% more damage - exactly what existing bard songs will add given the way haste stacks. His instinct for the correct value was accurate. <P>However, like all other songs, the 10% haste doesn't improve when an instrument is used. And the haste doesn't go past the cap, which makes it useless in every case (mathematically 10% more haste added on to existing bard damage even in a heavy melee group is always less damage than using a chant instead in that song slot). And of course haste doesn't multiply, it adds, which means that 10% haste is actually only 5% more damage. These songs are doomed. <P><BR>Benefits of Haste Stacking<BR>Bards could group with enchanters and still be useful, if the group composition is right. <P>Bards could do decent damage on raids. While adding more melee damage would help bards do more damage on raids, it really doesn't help unless the bard were to do as much damage as a rogue, which is unreasonable. As melee defense goes down, offense should go up, and bards are the least defensive of all melees...and the least offensive as well, if an enchanter is around. Stacking fixes this. With stacking the bard melee damage would stay low outside of raids, where it's fine, yet the group damage on raids would increase with a bard around. As calculated above, not as much as putting a rogue in that slot, and of course even at best there can't be more than one bard per group, but at least the bard wouldn't come with a 70 damage/sec penalty. <P>The bard class would make sense. Currently EVERYTHING about a bard stacks if the engine allows it. Resists stack. Stat buff stack. Damage shields stack. HP regen stacks. Mana regen stacks. Everything except for haste (and negative haste, slowdowns) stacks. If bards have one theme above all others, it's definitely stacking. <P>Bards would be no stronger solo. Bards would be no stronger in a 6 person group (that doesn't include an enc, and to a lesser extent, a shaman). Bards would not be more powerful in an enc/shaman group than they would be outside of one, they simply wouldn't be any weaker. <BR>Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt; <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I had a small book written on this subject, but something happened quite recently which I think eloquently point out my complaint with the bard class. My guild recently began to explore sleepers. We had a limited amount of keys, with a trickly coming it. It was put to the guild leaders to come up with a list of who would get in.<P>1. Warrior<BR>2. Warrior<BR>3. Paladin<BR>4. Cleric<BR>5. Cleric<BR>6. Necromancer<BR>7. Shaman<BR>8. Enchanter<BR>9. Rogue<BR>10. Cleric<BR>11. Warrior<BR>12. Cleric<BR>13. Monk<BR>14. Rogue<BR>15. Cleric<BR>16. Rogue<BR>17. Warrio<BR>18. Rogue<BR>19. Wizard<BR>20-25 mis healing/nukers<BR>26-36 misc healing/nukers/hybrids<BR>37. Bard<BR>38-44. misc healing/nukers/hybrids<BR>45. Bard<P> Note, in our estimation, the opporunity cost of having a bard come was not low enough till 36 people already had keys. At which time, the benefit of having manasong outweighed the utility of another class.<P> Each class has a mix of things they bring to a raid, or anything really. Bard, ostensibly gave up a lot to be one of the best classes to have in a group. This has proved time and again to be false. Especially on raids, a situation, to which, I will devote the rest of this thread.<P> On a raid bard songs are next to useless. Resistances are best boosted with gear. Gear does not die in the middle of a fight, leaving you without. Speed is best boosted by an enchanter. It does not stop in the middle of a fight when the bard dies, and is usually better.<P> Bard damage output is pathetic. We do about 1/3 the damage of a warrior on a good day with superb weapons, which we usually do not get because they would be better off in the hands.. of anyone really. We are a 'plate class' but verant has changed our role so much that we are easily one of the worst tanks.<P> Our one solace is manasong. A job that I have heard other bards doing with a joystick and /fol. There is a bard I know, who turns on manasong, hits /fol, and plays his rogue the rest of the night.<P> I really don't know how else to get this through. Bards are effectivly useless on a raid. They don't add anything useful to getting there. They add almost nothing to the end battle. The only small way they shine is slightly reducing bufftime. <P> Suggestion:<BR>   Make up your mind. Jack of all trades needs to be boosted, or we need to get better at melee.<P>   1.) Better jack of all trades.<BR>       - A haste song which stack with everything AND breaks through the haste cap. a 30 pct haste means the bard must be grouped with 3 other melees just to be the equivalent of 1. 4 melee for the bard to actually have an improvement in the group. This leaves room for only 1 healer. Bard haste must be at least %35+ for the bard to make ANY good improvement on a group. That's haste that stacks and breaks the cap. Everyone on a raid already has max haste from enchanter buffs. We need to be able to do more.<BR> <BR>  - Damage mitigation song. A song that would dramatically reduce the amount of damage a group would take. By at least 20pct. Would make a bard useful.<P><BR>  2.) Decide that at high levels bards learn melee skills.<P>      - bump up high level bard melee skills.<BR>      - give us double attack, high.<P>Bascially, give us some way to actually help in a battle. Bard songs are already iffy. If the bard dies they vanish. This means they should be more powerful, not less. Either give us some songs which really allow us to make a difference, or give us the melee skills to make that difference ourselves. I would prefer the first option. I didn't make a bard to be a warrior who sings. But I also didn't level 57 times to realize that my contribution to a group effort woudl best be served by mana pumping, then logging out and playing my rogue for the fight.<P> Verant, compare opportunity cost between having a bard in your group, and any other class. Especially melee, especially enchanter. Compare the utilty of a bard vs another class ASSUMING that group has the 2 essentials of a high level group: Cleric and Enchanter. Use that, and you'll realize that just about every bard with a clue at high levels, realizes how badly they suck. Ask Aftathott of AL. Ask Crip of FoH. Ask Sartori of Legion. They'll all give you the same thing.<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>QUOTE<P>---<P>&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<P>---<P>Absor, yes we DO suffer ill effects from low on mana.<P>There are 2 songs that uses mana, level 43 Dirge and level 39 charm. Level 43 song cost 800 mana and level 39 charm cost 20 mana.<P>Though not everyone of us keep the level 43 Dirge memed, I'm pretty sure that 95% of us keep the level 39 charm memed at all time, it's a life saver.<P>So here's the situation, each time we sing Dirge, it almost depletes our mana pool leaving us unable to keep a mob charmed (doing crowd control at times).<P>Why not instead of using mana, change Dirge to have a re-cast of, say, 10 minutes?<P>Also as the name of the song suggest, it's probably used only at the most desperate situations, for example, when the bard is low on hp and is running for their life, hoping the song would save them.<P>However this song has an AE effect and could damage the bard themself, so instead of saving them, the song kills them.<P>I really thing the song should be changed to a single target DD instead of AE.<P>- Solos Chimamire<BR>- Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The first 3 songs which a bard starts would not terminate after 18 seconds but rather would continue to automatically cycle until stopped by the player.<P>If the player tried to start a 4th song, she would get a message along the lines of "You cannot weave more melodies into your concerto."<P>She can, however, terminate a song at any time by clicking on the active song gem (or pressing the relevant hotkey).<P>As soon as the bard is back to having just 2 songs active, she can immediately start up a new song by clicking on the appropriate gem.<P>If the right instrument is equipped then the song will gain all the appropriate bonuses.<P>Thus a bard could have 3 active songs without needing to twist, or could cycle 4 or more songs if they did want to twist in more melodies.  (It will be necessary to reduce song effects to just 6 seconds after termination rather than 18 and some songs may need to have their effects modified slightly to accomodate this.)<P>If the bard were stunned, it should interrupt their songs but should not require them to be manually restarted.<P>2)  Using multiple instruments<P>Bards should be able to equip multiple instruments in their primary, secondary and range slots.<P>This way a player would not need to switch instruments between their secondary slot and their inventory every few seconds.<P>This would mean that a bard could have duel-wielded weapons and 1 instrument equipped, 1 weapon and 2 instruments, or 3 different instruments equipped at any one time.<P>This would result in an increase to either a bard's damage output or song efficiency, but from what I've read so far, this enhancement would be greatly welcomed.<P>I look forward to hearing other people's comments on this initial proposal.<P>Tranule.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
