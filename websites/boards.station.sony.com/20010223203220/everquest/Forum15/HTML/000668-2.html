</FONT><HR>I'm personally stunned that someone was complaining about high-level foraging.  At lvl 51 I usually throw away most of the food I forage because I've already got two backpacks full, and all of the wacky special items I get are in no way a problem.  And how in the world is this a balance issue?  There are way more serious concerns facing rangers- my vote (not that I get one, heh) is to have this non-issue removed from the list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have but one thing to add for rangers.   Rangers are supposed to be the masters at the use of bows... so why not reduce or eliminate the minimum range of bows.  I hate it when one becomes snared and a monster starts casting on you while out of melee but just under the minimum range of the beast.

</FONT><HR>What I'd like to see is more low level DoTs that use the conjuration skill. That way we wouldn't have to summon lightglobes to get our skill high enough when we get stinging swarm.<P>Also, I listed a few bugs with the Ivy Etched armor quests that I think should be looked at. I've reposted the whole thing here:<P>from my post at<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-3.html<P>****<P>I don't appreciate the fact that Ry'Gorr armor is so much superior to Ivy Etched armor (each piece has AC equal to that of plate armor, and in most cases (this is just my opinion but I think it's also a popular one) the stats are better as well). I'm not saying that Ry'Gorr is too good, but I think, given that it requires roughly the same level to attain these armor pieces, that Ivy Etched armor should be made less difficult to obtain. Here are some things I believe need reviewing:<P>Greaves - by FAR the most problematic of pieces to obtain. Many rangers tend to get Silver Plated Greaves instead, since Ivy Greaves are so hard to get and popular opinion rules they are not worth the trouble. This quest involves hunting down a wood elf thief who is a rare spawn on a strange cycle: his placeholder will, after 60 minutes, suicide and be replaced either with the next placeholder, or the thief (Wiltin Windwalker) himself. However, if the placeholder (a buccanneer) is killed, there will not be another spawn until 80-120 minutes later, which can be either Wiltin or another placeholder. The biggest annoyance is that if Wiltin doesn't engage in combat (i.e. is attacked) within 15-30 seconds of his spawning, he will despawn and the cycle will start again. People have reported taking up to 3 days to get the quiver he drops, and the problems don't end there; since the quiver is a container, it will disappear if a main inventory slot is not open when it is looted, since it has nowhere to go (normally containers fall to the floor in this situation, but since this one is No Drop, it just disappears). I would fix this by applying some global code which makes it that containers remain on the corpse if they have nowhere to go, and also by making Wiltin stay for the duration of his spawn cycle (not just half a minute). Making him spawn more often would be nice as well.<P>Gloves - now this is just a plain shame. Not only are Dark Mail Gauntlets better than these, but again it is a nice quest hindered by ridiculous spawn times. This quest involves returning the Bow of Kithicor to Leaf in Kithicor. He mentions somebody called Maldyn Greenburn in Rathe Mountains having the bow and hunting the Unkempt Druids. The spawn rate on Maldyn is somewhere in the vicinity of 60-80 hours. He's pretty tough to kill as well, and for a piece like gloves, I don't think he's worth it at all. To add to all this, he is KOS to hill giants, so if you don't get to him before they do, then you have another cycle to wait before you can try again. These gloves' stats should be increased to be better than Dark Mail Gauntlets, and Maldyn should be looked into.<P>Boots - now here something puzzles me. This piece requires a piece of Ronium. That means that you need Soil of Underfoot. Which means you have to kill fairies. Fairies, considered to be the children of Tunare, and rangers need to kill them to get a pair of boots? Of all classes, it makes the least sense for Rangers to have to do this. Pixies I can understand (in the ranger guild in Kelethin a quest is given to go kill pixies so they stop burning down trees in the Faydark), but Fairies make NO sense. I think this quest needs to be reviewed.<P>****<P>Thanks for considering this, and I congratulate you on doing such a great job so far with reviewing the classes. Keep up the good work and I hope to see these bugs corrected (as well as thoughts on what seems to be incorrect but can't be classes as a bug) soon!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cool, that is really good summing up of the posts I reckon.  It is nice to see defence receiving notice and at the top of the list too!<P>If defense alone was improved, it would all be worth it.  I'm tired of working so hard to get to a decent lvl and being slapped around like a fool.  We have lower defence than ALL melee or hybrids and have NO evade skill like rogue Evade till very late on. They cant operate without it, neither can we.<P>Yes archery would be nice, but I'm not sure that the z-axis issue is that important really. Just make the darn things hit and do some reasonable dmg.  Its not like we can quad kite or anything.<P>Everything else is fair enough, but not as core to our issues as defense (imho of course)<P>Basically...

</FONT><HR>Raise the kick skill cap. Why? Cause you are considering raising Pal and SK bash skill cap. Plus, no SK or Pal depends on Bash for damage, they depend on it for its stun capability. However, since Kick doesn't stun RNG rely on it for damage (which it cant do since it lands only 50% of the time) so please raise the skill.<P>Also, if you arn't even gonna consider Self-Ports, PLEASE explain to me WHY NOT? Giving it to us would be justified by the fact that druids can port and they are our parent class. Like I've said before..PAL get res, SK get summon corpse..RNG SHOULD get self-port!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Few notes (of mine) that got lost from this list:<P>Jolt: Costs too much mana. Add that note please. =)<P>Thorny Vine armor: Compair the saves to other classes armor. Rangers get +7 across a suit, I think everyone else gets at least +10 or more. Since stats are broken in the game (see other threads for more info) you think you could at least make the saves similar to other classes'?<P>Raincaller: Switching it from a click to a proc would be great since bows can now proc.<P>See Invis: Keep in mind this dovetails with tracking. Can't track invis unless you can see invis. Druids can cast see invis, bards can sing their invis song to gain it. Ranger get to camp a bracer of the hidden along with every other class in the game.<P>Kylong Breastplate: Jade Mace is the same way. ALL mace wielding classes can use the Jade Mace EXCEPT rangers. Rogues, bards, etc all can use the mace, rangers can't... go figure. Sarnak battle shield falls into this catagory too(don't think rogues get to use it, but druids and warriors do)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All in all I am very happy with the "suggestions" you have here. Addressing the archery issue I would add this:<P>The z-axis problems need to be eliminated. I often miss because of this and yet can cast on the same thing. Archery should really have the same z-axis check that spells do.<P>Archery damage. I think it definitely needs to be boosted but that the modifier should be added to the arrow damage not the bow. The expensive high damage arrows should do considerably greater damage than the cheap vendor bought or summoned versions. Other classes kite with the only expense being mana. The added benefit here is that it would actually make fletching more viable.<P>Quivers. There is no real reason to have them. What little weight reduction they give is more than offset by the fact that the best quivers are only 6 slot containers. Since it has been stated that we will never be able to put a container in the range slot itself, the best solution would be to have the player made quivers have 10 slots. And yes, most rangers you use bows carry 200+ arrows.<P>Just a couple of thoughts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I still think they are ignoring a rather basic disparity in the offense/defense issue.  Rangers have received no upgrades since Kunark was relesed, and are basically lvl 40 in defense.  Even casters like druids and shaman got upgrades.  When Alan says that we have Jolt, that's was something introduced WAY AFTER Kunark came out, and I think was a small bandage applied to a sucking chest wound.  Verant has stubbornly refused to admit they made a mistake in regards to ranger defensive issues.<P>It's not like we want 252 in defense and other "defensive" type skills, just a bit of parity.  If the knight classes get upgraded to 235 in offense and 252 in defense, they WHY, OH WHY, can't rangers have a 235 defense in conjunction with a 252 offense?  I understand managing the hate list, but with the current 6 person group limitation we sometimes have NO CHOICE but to do our full damage potential.  That's like telling a pro-athelete to igonore his physical skills and do basketweaving instead because he was making too much money.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif">  <P>We are not asking to get defensive skills equal to warriors.  If we have to pay for our offensive skills with lower hit points AND lower AC AND lower defense AND lower dodge AND lower parry AND lower riposte, it just seems like we have to deal with a lot of ANDS!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  Just let us get a bit of parity with our role.  Give us all the offense you want, but let us have some skills and abilitites to offset that.<P>Also, DON'T NERF Rouges.  They are VERY WELL Balanced now, nerfing Evade will make them as mad as rangers!<P>So, what does Verant have against Rangers and Rouges?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>A couple of things Absor:<P>1) You have missed the point on both Archery and Trueshot.  Yes, there are problems with height,  LOS, and blocking that make them less effective and need to be fixed.  Even when height and LOS are not a problem (flat terrain), archery does not do enough damage.  Trueshot should do MORE DAMAGE THAN THE EQUIVALENT TIME SPENT IN MELEE.<P>2) I understand that the scrolling tracking window on test is NOT limited to Rangers.  THIS MUST NOT STAND.  Tracking belongs to Rangers, and I don't feel any need to make an argument on this issue.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>You have made an excellent list. I have also looked over the paladin and SK lists and they look excellent as well. But, of course there is a but, I noticed that you failed to repeat cross-hybrid issues. Could you please add the following to both paladin and ranger lists.<P>- The removal of the extra mana penalty for hybrids casting spells. You mention that this will be looked into in the sk thread, but not in the ranger and pally thread. Could you please add it to our lists as well. All three of our class threads made good arguments for the removal of this penalty (i.e. lower wisdom as a hybrid, lower efficiency spells, etc.).<P>On a minor note, can you please up the starting wisdom of half-elves to 75. It is currently 65 whereas humans and wood elves have 75. If we are a child of both our stats should be between the two (i.e. 75). We have retained the 75 charisma and 75 intelligence - but our wisdom is not. Logically it does not make sense.<P>Regards,<P>Longetalos<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That's 20 points.<P>Rangers are going from 240 Offense to 250 Offense.  That's only 10 points.  They also are going from 240 Weapon skill to 250 Weapon skill.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I repost the foregoing here cuz demmit I want a reply.<P>Before ROK came out I NEVER posted on these boards complaining about the ranger. NEVER. I was perfectly satisfied with the class (altho I did hate how tracking worked). I could TANK with the best of them, do good damage and had some neat spells. I was happy with the class. I was having FUN with it.<BR>Then Brad (Aradune), decided to change all that. He didn't ask the players first. He just decided to change the ranger's role. How? By not raising their defense along with the other melee classes. By changing defense/dodge/parry/riposte tables that were in place prior to ROK and by changing the AC discrepancy between plate and chain.<P>HE decided that rangers will no longer be the EQUALS of the war/sk/pal. End result? Rangers got pummeled and pummeled bad. They became dazed as a result of losing their once proud role.<P>After ROK came out I was on these boards nearly daily screaming foul. I felt betrayed. I had played my ranger with a certain role in mind quite successfully for almost a YEAR, only to have the rug pulled out from under me.<P>I won't even bother going down the ABASHI road back then. He never bothered to do his homework before responding.<P>Brad decided to leave heading the "Live team" and enter Jeff Butler. Jeff Butler was viewed by many rangers as a potential "savior" to the class. This image was created from the "famous" Las Vegas meeting with him, Brad and Sunmoon. I, of course, was skeptical as is my nature, and even warned folks on the ranger glade boards not to discount Brad's influence. <P>Jeff then conducted many "tests" regarding the ranger. NEVER has Verant disclosed what these tests shown despite numerous requests that they do so. What then did Brad do? He decided to up dodge/riposte some and THAT was it. Rangers cheered, and there I was again warning them all that this would not matter. And guess what? It didn't. At BEST the changes aided damage avoidance by a mere 2-3 percent. BIG DEAL.<P>Now SOV came out. SOV is at best a playing ground for the "elite" guilds. And if the rangers weren't getting creamed enough in Kunark, now they had to fight critters in SOV which made Kunark critters look like pansies.<P>What was happening now? Certain classes were becoming "elite" and others were becoming obsolete.<P>So now Verant decides to do a "final" class balancing act. Personally I don't think many really know what that word means. I define it quite simply, balance means that no ONE class should be so powerful compared to another. There should be PARITY. A warrior should NOT be more valuable to a group than any other class. A rogue should NOT be more valuable to a group than any other class. A cleric should NOT be more valuable to a group than another. An enchanter should NOT be more valuable to a group than another. And prior to ROK that was the case. Class substitutions could be readily made with EQUAL success.<P>Not so now. And ranger IS at the bottom of the list bar NONE.<P>Let me state that playing a ranger to level 50 is CAKE. I know what I am talking about. I've done it THREE times on THREE different servers. BRAND new servers, where there was nothing to be handed down to me. I was not using items that were above my level range at any time. I even leveled my first ranger to 50 using a PGT and OBSIDIAN SCIMITAR.<P>It's post 50 that is the problem.<P>It's ironic that I have THREE level 50+ rangers and not one is 60 yet. It's not that I can't get one to 60, I could have a long time ago; it's because I don't have fun with the class after a certain point. I get tired of always playing the bride's maid. Right now I'm playing a SK (level 32) and he rocks (twinked like hell tho).<P>I blame one person and one person only for all this. BRAD. <P>The proposed changes to the ranger simply will not, let me repeat, WILL NOT change the plight of the ranger. It is simple MATH. 4th in offense, last in defense for a melee class means LAST in group choice. That will ALWAYS be the case. ALWAYS.<P>Some say rangers aren't asking for same defense as warrior, etc.. WRONG. I want the SAME defense as ALL THE OTHER MELEE classes. It's the ARMOR'S AC differences that I am not asking for a change. Plate should have more AC than chain.<P>Right now ALL the other melee classes will have defense of 250-252. ALL OF THEM. Absor I defy you to explain to me why a rogue and monk justify 252 defense and NOT the ranger. I've stated this question plenty times and NEVER has anyone from Verant even tried to answer it. You say we have great offense so no defense. Well rogue and monk have the BEST offense and BEST defense. EXPLAIN THIS. Explain to me why a TAUNTING class defined by YOU as part warrior should not be put on parity with rogue/monk defense. You can't. Tis why no one at Verant ever tried. You know, I could at least accept being LAST in Defense if I was FIRST in offense. THEN your arguments might make sense.<P>Until changes are made to the ranger which will improve it's tanking ability it will never be group useful at the higher levels. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Howwl:<P>You are correct those changes on test are balanced (well, rangers getting 2 more skill points maybe but who cares).<P>I was referring to this comment:<P>ITEM: Defense Skill Cap.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems fair to move the ranger defense skill cap up to match the knights' offense skill cap.<P>STATUS: None<P>I would say either that that is not fair to Knight classes, or Knights should have their offense raised to Ranger levels, because of the fact that dual wield is being ignored in this equation.<P>Regardless, with the changes on test, Rangers in *gameplay* WILL be doing as much or more damage than warriors.  Useable weapons just as good or better, offense skill AND weapon skills the same as warriors, Dual wield skill the same, Double Attack only 10 less.<P>For Knights, with the changes on test, Knights will still be far inferior defensively than Warriors.  Yes, Defense skill will be the same, but our Armor has FAR less AC than Warrior Armor (Fear/Hate, Kunark, Velious class armors).  Cobalt for instance has 43 raw AC more than Deepwater, while Deepwater has only 17 raw AC more than Tolan's - supposedly chain based armor.  Further to the point, Riposte, Parry, and Dodge are all capped substantially lower than Warriors, and of course quite a bit less Hit Points - all of which are contributors to Defense (tanking) as a whole in gameplay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I just wanted to get these<BR>                          lists out to you fresh.<P>                          I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is<BR>                          not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At<BR>                          this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>                          Thanks for the input so far.<P>                          Alan<P><BR>                          Rangers:<P><BR>                          ITEM: Defense Skill Cap.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: It seems fair to move the ranger defense skill cap up to match the knights' offense skill cap.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Dodge and Riposte Skill Caps.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: If it seems that rangers still need a bit more defense at the upper levels, raising the Dodge skill cap<BR>                          would seem the most logical way to give them better damage avoidance. If we want to give them more offense<BR>                          and more defense, then raising the Riposte cap would make sense.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Archery.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: The concern is that this combat skill is not effective enough, primarily because of what seems like a<BR>                          bug. Archery seems to have a lot trouble with z-axis issues that cause the ranger to miss far more often than he<BR>                          probably should. Also, why not push the ranger skill cap on archery up some, actually allowing them to be better<BR>                          than warriors at firing their bows?<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Tracking.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Obviously people are anxious to get the changes that have been suggested, like scrolling and<BR>                          sorting.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Trueshot Discipline.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Rangers are of the impression that this discipline is not tuned up properly yet. They would like to<BR>                          see it do more damage and/or hit more often. The problem with targeting here might be closely related to the<BR>                          situation when this discipline is used, combats where a lot of characters are trying to take swings at one enemy,<BR>                          not leaving any lines of sight for the ranger. Perhaps this discipline could allow this ranger to ignore the normal<BR>                          issues with intervening PCs and NPCs. Also, the discipline could be tweaked up a bit just by giving it some sort of<BR>                          minimum damage, perhaps a portion of the base damage of the bow used.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: More Hit Points.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Rangers would like more hit points.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Jolt.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Players would like to see this spell lowered in level (49th perhaps) and have another, more effective<BR>                          version added in its old spot.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Spell Stacking Issues.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Strength of Nature (51) and Call of Earth (50) are the primary concerns here. Strength of Nature<BR>                          does not stack with Divine Strength. Call of Earth does not stack with the enchanter Augment line, Speed of the<BR>                          Shissar, Coldain Shield of the Eight or with the monk epic effect (I think it overwrites them, which seems like the<BR>                          right way to do this).

But these spells are actually lower level spells for their parent class, and the<BR>                          parent class can cast them on lower level characters.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Thorny Vine Armor.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Rangers would like to see these drop more frequently. The problem does not so much seem to be<BR>                          with the rate at which the mobs actually drop the armor, but the (in)frequency of the mobs themselves.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: See Invisible.<P>                          DESCRIPTION: Rangers can cast Camouflage, but they can not cast any version of See Invisible. Not being able to<BR>                          cast some sort of See Invisible makes Camouflage a somewhat less useful group spell, since the party can't see<BR>                          each other.<P>                          STATUS: None<P>                          ---<P>                          ITEM: Kylong Breastplate.<P>=&gt; If it's considered a plate item, it wouldnt' be used by rangers, but could be worn by any plate wearing class.

</FONT><HR>Let's see, I'm pretty happy with this list, I am waiting for those tracking changes desperately, the sorting and scrolling, and happy to see a possible upgrade on the Raincaller on that list as well, I finally finished this quest, and I don't mind the same damage as the Trueshot but I would like to get either an unlimited charge on the spell or at least a way to recharge it. Maybe it can recharge in a certain amount if game hours like lay hands so that it doesn't make it overpowerful by it being unlimited. I am also hoping for more hps as well as changes to archery, fixing the z-axis problems and those stupid messages about the target being too high or too low, as all of us know a good archer should be able to shoot up and down without an issue. <P>Vesta Treeblossom<BR>49th Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahhh I saw a suggestion of making the effect from the Raincaller a proc, that would also be cool and keep it from being overpowered while removing the dumb 5 charge thing. Also, I saw someone ask why we can't have an outdoor only bind. Umm probably because no class except the casters can bind themselves anywhere, saying it's an outdoor only bind pretty much lets us bind anywhere, that would be completely unbalanced to the other hybrid and melee classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Absor, you still don't understand,<P>Heres a point of view I dont see anyone else arguing from. The message is the same (defense please) but the logic used to get there is a bit different. And now Ive managed to confuse myself. <P>I am a 35 ranger. I group/pair with a warrior of the about same level (I have never been more than 3 levels above him). We have been grouping since about 25. Over this time with essentially the SAME offense (1hs, 2hs, etc.) and defense (defense, dodge, parry, riposte) caps he tanks MUCH better than I do due to his higher AC and HP. (BTW what I mean by the same caps is that on a level by level basis asuming level maxed caps we are the same until mine stops rising and his continues.) I am valuable to this pairing because I offer similar offense, good enough defense to stay alive to buff and heal him, snare and debuff the mobs, and then root if things go bad. My offense may actual lag a bit in terms of melee because of his greater strength, but my DD and DoT spells compensate somewhat, although I need to be very frugal because they cost a lot of mana (half-elf) that is better spent on buffing, snaring and de-buffing. <P>In a larger group, I may exceed him on offense because I can usually use my DD and DoTspells with more abandon. I dont need to keep him buffed and healed (cleric, druid, or shammy does that). Be he still out tanks me by a mile. (Again, by tanking I mean absorbing hits, not overall fighting). <P>So heres what I dont get that is coming from Verant et al. After 39 levels of having the same per level caps as all the other melee classes and not being overpowered, all of a sudden we have to be frozen in terms of defensive type skills compared to the other melees or we are overpowered? (By the way the same argument can and should be made for the knights offensive skills and, *** our offense skills too). We arent (nor are the knights) pushing warriors out of groups pre-40 and our caps are for the most part identical to warriors, both offensive and defensive. Believe me even pre-40 no one says oh, look a ranger and a paladin, lets kick out the two warriors and get them. In fact the opposite is true in some cases. Or even given a choice in a forming a group, warriors will be picked over rangers and knights pre-40 even with the same caps. So why the radical shift in the end game. Why are we neutered in terms of defense post 40? <P>From what Verant has done with the caps it says one of two things, neither of which I believe. One, we have been overpowered the whole time from level 1 to 39. /em laughs hysterically and cannot pick himself up off the floor. We definitely DO NOT suck from 1 to 39, but we are by no means overpowered. Or two, post 40 we receive some massive god-like powers and need to be nerfed to compensate. Well reading all the old-timer ranger posts, I know that that is not true either. <P>Bottom Line: If having the same per level caps from 1 to 39 works, why doesnt it work 40 to 60? <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>=/\= ABSOR, ITEM MISSING FROM LIST =/\=<P>I appreciate all of the effort going into the leveling of the class system in EQ as Im sure do the vast majority of your customers.  I am especially appreciative you have taken the time to listen to us and look at what changes can be made, not only class balance to make our EQ experience more enjoyable.<P>I have been an Everquest subscriber since January 2000 and have since played a large array of classes.  My favorite class by far is a Ranger, my first character in EQ being one and regularly playing both that first character and another Ranger levels 39 & 49 as well as a lower level one to test all the Ranger/Race combos.  This is not due to any special abilities or advantages found in Everquest for these class but because the Ranger personality fits more with mine than any of the other classes.  Granted the Ranger class has a lot of shortcomings but overcoming these is half of what being a ranger is about to me.  Some of these unfortunately placed the Ranger at a disadvantage as far as class balance would go, having groups bypass selecting a ranger consistently in favor of other classes that could do the job.  This list and the changes being made on the Test server go a long way towards addressing those issues, however there is one issue which I feel strongly enough about that was not included on the list although I saw it mentioned several times on the discussion thread; the CLASS DEFINING ABILITY.<P>Among my many characters I have both a Paladin and a Shadow Knight, their respective one use per day LoH and DT abilities places the Ranger at a misbalance when compared to these other hybrids.  I understand the logic against comparing a hybrid against a member of their parent classes and why it will never be as good as one of them, but here I only seek balance with the other hybrid classes.  These two abilities being skills that neither hybrid shares with another class and being a sort of get out of death free card which regularly gets my Pally or SK out of situations in which my Rangers only choice it to get to a place where Corpse Recovery will be easier and die holding off the mobs as the party survivors escape.  Unless a Ranger groups constantly with a Cleric that can XP Resurrect he is losing a lot of XP here that the other hybrids get to keep.  While some have argued that the class defining ability of the Ranger can be its tracking, it is something that they share with several other classes and cannot be compared with HT & LoH.  <P>One issue that came up several times during the discussion was that of the survivability of Rangers in all sorts of encounters, and although I have started backing out of fights to heal and lower agro before charging back in with very limited success, this puts me at a disadvantage to those two other classes that continue in the fight having a higher HP base that a Ranger and at the last minute obliterate the MOB with a well placed Harm Touch or the use a well place Lay on Hands to restore the main tank or Healer and all I can do is back out (which I still personally dont agree with) and have the MOB deal out the damage meant for me to one of the frail casters or another already embattled tanks.  IMO a Ranger should have similar gift to contribute to its group.  This is not a preference or wish list issue but a BALANCE one.  I can offer several possible solutions to help illustrate what I mean, but keep in mind these are only suggestions and that just having an actual skill is my balance recommendation.<P>-	Keeping with VIs Vision of Rangers where they are Damage Dealing Platforms, a Frenzy Skill could be appropriate in which the Ranger deals out an amount of damage per level comparable to the SKs HT, while dodging / parrying / riposting all attacks dealt during the time it takes the Ranger to inflict that damage (i.e. the Ranger would double strike for a large amount of damage during a period of x rounds while not getting hit during this time and while hitting collectively for the approximate total damage a Harm Touch of the appropriate level would do). Too much you think?  Keep in mind this would be a once per day ability, take into consideration the huge agro you have just built up with that specific MOB if you fail to kill him and then the fact you would probably be at very low stamina after having inflicted so much damage.  I dont see it as unbalancing, just the opposite.  It gives Rangers a fighting chance to survive, something the other hybrids already have.  As far as HT & LoH its would also be something that takes place over a couple of rounds instead of instantaneously.<P>Of course there are other possible possibilities, from healing, to a few seconds of invincibility, to getting a  companion who will come to the Rangers defense, to having Karana or Tunare send a bolt of lightning or whack (for some reason Im surprised that Whack is a bona fide word, although dont even get me started on milk, think about it) the MOB with a rolled up newspaper for 10K damage but you get the gist (I hope, if not ask for clarification) of my suggestion.<P>I strongly believe this is a class BALANCE issue that was not addressed in the list.  I did not post to the initial thread because almost all of my balance suggestions had already been addressed (including this one).  Not including this on the list, which I understand is a list of things to be REVIEWED not a list of things that are going to be changed or fixed.  With a lot of the things on the list either being bug reports or wish list items I think this deserves to be sent to the review team for further inspection unless there is something I am not seeing here.  This also seems to me as a balance modifier that would help Rangers throughout their careers without having to wait for 50+ levels, which most of them will never achieve, to get a spell like jolt (which I appreciate tremendously but it doesnt do anything for those with characters below the 50s).<P>Thank you for your attention and as an aside thanks for the mana pool fix, the xp penalty adjustments, and the root/snare fix!  Love em!<P>Dingurth Megilindir<BR>Twilight Marauders<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR>Best Looking Half Elf Ranger of Norrath<P>Ranger till I die, and die, and die, and die, and die, and die you get the picture!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, to kick the dead horse:  I am happy for those of you have reached the magical 50.  You may get another chance at life.  It would be nice for the rest of us in the majority to get a chance as well!  You say that you cannot get into groups once you reach a higher level?  Well take it from me, that same mentality exists at much lower levels as well.  I do get into groups about 75% of the time - but that is because I have learned how to deal with my SEVERE limitations compared to the fighters and casters.  And these groupmates have told me on more than one occasion that "rangers are only good for snaring mobs or tracking something" - the only reason I was in their group was because of my personality!  Gee, that says alot about the character class when it's my real-life "character" that makes me valuable.  In short, I as a "low-level" would like to know that something is going to be done to make me more group-friendly so that I can aspire to reaching that lovely 50 mark you have already attained.<P>Oh heck, let's kick the horse again:  I am an outdoors*wo*man.  Why am I bound in the CITY of Freeport while fighting four zones away?  The warriors can keep their cities, I was born in the woods and only go to the city when it is absolutely necessary.  It is absolutely wonderful to find a group, become their meat shield, and get to spend 20 minutes running back to your corpus if said group is unable to take advantage my lack of AC and HP.  In my personal opinion, the binding issue is #3 right behind AC and HP.  Heck, make me quest for an item (not an UBER LEVEL quest item) that gives me wilderness bind affinity.<P>PLEASE think of the folks who aren't 50+  They already have a whole expansion pack to themselves...let's work with the WHOLE class, not the UPPER class.<P>Deoca, 25th Ranger of Karana<BR>anti-snob of the working class<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
