</FONT><HR>I forget where I read this, but one of the 'blue names' said something to the effect of:<BR> <BR>"Some of the items that we've given right-click effects are too powerful. This breastplate was one of them. I find it a bit surprising that most of you are suggesting that it was not too powerful. I'm sorry that we had to change the casting time on it. But the item was plainly overpowered, and it needed to be changed."<P>How is this SUDDENLY too powerful?  It wasnt too powerful six months ago.  So why is it all of a  sudden too powerful?  And yes, Im SUGGESTING that this item is NOT too powerful. Deep down I have NO problem eating a nerf when I can clearly see something is overpowered or unbalanced, but that is simply NOT the case here.  I need an explanation.  It isnt like these BPs fall off trees, they are RARE and DIFFICULT to obtain.  I would wager that there are less than 200 in the game TOTAL across all servers.<P>How about instead of screwing over owners of a 'decent' breastplate, you INCREASE the effects on the class BPs that are GARBAGE? ie SK, Shaman, Ranger, etc.  Why does everything only focus on downsizing and hinderance to the playerbase?<P>I'm sorry if MOBs you considered 'unkillable' were being taken down with guilds that happened to have a few Donals BPs, but thats too damned bad isnt it?  There are so very few of these circulating that in essence, you've singled out a handful of people and said, "screw you!"<P>My question is this:  Retroactive nerfs need a serious RATIONAL explanation.  I have yet to see one.  VI has always promised that retro-nerfs would be FEW and far between and ABSOLUTELY necessary.  So...was this necessary?  WHY was this done?  Saying "We changed the casting time, because it was too powerful" is unacceptable.  You simply cannot shoot from the hip and adjust equipment on a whim like this.  I strongly urge you to reconsider.<P>Donals Bp should be 20sec<BR>Stability Bp should be 9sec<P>Nino McHammer<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It needs to be fixed regardless of how long it's been broken, and VI only recently saw that it was indeed way too powerful.<P>This was a retroactive nerf.  It was a fix to a serious problem.

</FONT><HR>Let me present this hypothetical situation.<P>X mob has 350k hit points.<BR>X mob triples for 800+ max<BR>X mob has a AE breath that is a mana sieve.<BR>X mob is completely invulnerable to magic.<P><BR>One possible way of killing X mob is to use a mana free method of healing. A few clerics with Donals BPs, chain casting CH on the main tank means that Y group of 40-50 people MIGHT be able to take down X mob after about 8-9 rounds (or about 3 hours).<P><BR>Without a mana free method of healing, the battle with X mob has this result. Med/Buff/Med. Attack... 2 breaths (or about a minute) later, every caster is OOM, all the tanks are dead and X mobs is sitting at 98% hit points.<P>With the nerf in casting time, the first method mentioned simply gets dragged out over 8-9 hours, or Y group of people farms Trakanon some more until they have enough Donals BPs so that they can have more clerics chain casting CH.<BR>At that point, Verant, in their infinite wisdom, will likely nerf the BP cast time to 40 or 50 seconds....<P><BR>This was a stupid nerf.

Verant often looks at stats onpaper and say "that looks ok"  only after the players develope a habit of exploiting it do they bring the nerf knife in.  personaly verant probly couldhave made it 25 seconds and there by end alot of the abuse but seeing how clerics are one of the golden children i couldn't care less if they nerfed the whole bp.  <P>ya i'm still peaved you clerics whine more about your holy group slots, scared unshareable spells and your uber equipment then you do about broken classes.<P>your whole argument "what is bad for the cleric is bad for you" is all bull chips.<P>Why shouldn't shaman/druids get regens that cast in 3 seconds and heal 1000-2000 pints in 15-45 seconds and stack with other regens as to make them viable healers?<P>Why shouldn't paladins get 93%res as a once per day god ability at lvl 54 with a loc on it so no one can dual him/her on blue servers til it is renewed?  <P>It is the clerics strangle hold on the post 50 healing spot in groups and their inability tosupport broken classes that brings anger to you here.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I look at each and every "nerf" as something that might very well happen to my own class next.  *Will* happen, actually, as Verant continues their unending circle toward the never to be attained "balance" of the classes.<P>Unending because every time a class loses or gains something, then all other classes get re-evaluated.  Every "balance" causes another "balance", which causes another, and so on.  <BR>Consider system doesn't work right?  No surprise there.  The classes have been so.....

</FONT><HR>Some of you people that complain these items are overpowered really don't have an idea of what the 50+ level game is. Come back when you've had to fight Guardian of Travish (which is literally a FIVE MINUTE melee combat because he has close to 150k hp) or the insane Velious hitting monsters that hit in the 700+ range and are close to being invul to all forms of magic (meaning NO SLOW.) These items gave people a fighting chance, now the only way to take some of them on is sacrificial waves or be victim to mass LD.<P>The only way that the chestplate of stability was overpowering was when it was used in the old world coupled with a manastone.<P>You guys got to understand 2 things. One, these items are not easy to get. They are event level items, not something your regular xp group will be able to attain in any form. Their main purpose is (well, were) to significantly help melee combat on the event level. You guys are only looking at it from a farming xp perspective, and that is WRONG. This is NOT a moss twig issue where some level 49 ranger can get lucky and store an uber weapon. These items were designed for events, the fact that they can be used for xp'ing is well, an acceptable drawback.<P>Secondly, Clerics NEED these items to adequately support their tanks when they fight the new Velious monsters. Complete heal is NOT an option when monsters hit for 700+ (UNLESS you have a secondary healer, like another cleric who can keep the tank alive with remedies to time the CH just right). Clerics will burn through divine light and remedy and become oom very quickly while the monster is still at 60-70% life.<P>There is nothing wrong with items that significantly augment a class, that's their purpose. But to be considered a VIABLE option, the casting time has to be reasonable. Do you know how fast a tank will drop when he's being hit for quad 700's? You think a 20 second celestial elixir will save him? NO. <P>It's not overpowered making clerics less dependant on mana. Clerics still had to use their fast heals between elixirs to keep their warriors up. Overpowered would be giving this effect to the warrior breastplate. The only purpose these nerfed cleric breastplates serve now is healing people during CR on wipeouts, and that's just sad. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's a simple solution to this nerf, people will farm Trakanon till all the clerics of their guild have the Donal BP's that cast CH in (now) 30 seconds, what they'll then do is when they plan to take down an uber mob is have let's say 8 clerics do the following:<P>Cleric1:  Begin casting Donal CH before fight has even begun on the tank that is going to hit em first<P>Cleric2:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric1.  total time is at 5 seconds, 2 castings have started.<P>Cleric3:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric2.  total time is at 10 seconds, 3 castings have started.<P>Cleric4:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric3.  total time is at 15 seconds, 4 castings have started.<P>Cleric5:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric4.  total time is at 20 seconds, 5 castings have started.<P>Cleric6:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric5.  total time is at 25 seconds, 6 castings have started.<P>Cleric7:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric6.  total time is at 30 seconds, 6 castings have started, 1 has completed.<P>Cleric8:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric7.  total time is at 35 seconds, 6 castings have started, 2 have been completed<P>Cleric1:  Begin casting 5 seconds after cleric8.<P>"""""""" rinse and repeat.<P><BR>In this situation the clerics will need to have some foresight as to which tanks are going to get hurt, therefore the guild will designate tanks that will keep the mob on them and assign the above clerics to those tanks.  If all clerics stay on one tank then he gets CH'ed every 5 seconds.  If you have 8 clerics split over 2 main tanks you'd probably have 4 clerics per tank and have them start casting the donal ch 7 seconds after the prior cleric.<P>Verant really hasn't solved anything here, the possibility is still there to do what the guilds did before the Donal BP was nerfed.  Since the cast time is now longer, they'll just get more and have the clerics act as i stated above to solve the problem.  So what will you do then Verant?  wait another 6 months to figure out "Oh this is still overpowered" then make it 50 second casting?  guess what they'll just get more clerics with more bp's and follow the pattern above.<P>Here's a hint Verant, uber mob loot is SUPPOSED TO BE POWERFUL you idiots.  Otherwise what's the point in giving crap or nerfing something that a L20 wouldn't use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The real issue behind this is Verant still hasn't managed to design a decent uber mob encounter.<P>Their first idea was AE mass damage waves. Players overcame these with resist gear.<P>As a response Verant made mobs largely immune to magic. This not only alienated most of the caster community but didn't help much, guilds simply became tank/cleric heavy.<P>Then Verant just upped the AE damage and effects and introduced gating mobs etc (plus a few other additions I can't think of right now heh). Also timing became much more of an issue, on many encounters now they have to be well-timed. You can't simply clear to uber mob, buff, med then charge.<P>The players overcame this by using more players, better equipment and learning the art of patience.<P>Then Verant got creative and found a way around the old 32k hp problem (this I had assumed was the main reason their previous uber mob tuning had been so lame, to be fair with a 32k hp limit they'd done about all they could do to keep a challenge on the mobs).<P>What TOTALLY gobsmacks me is most of the uber mobs I'm reading about in Velious not only now have massive amounts of hp (which they should do) but Verant have also kept the old methods of defeating playerers - most motably immunity to virtually all casters bar wizards (who were also nerfed).<P>For Innoruuk's sake Verant! You now have such a blinding opportunity to be creative and let ALL players participate in raids I can't believe you can see it staring you in the face.<P>Yes bascially what I'm saying is now mobs can zillions of HP that is what the focus of uber mob tuning should be on. Of course some mobs should retain immunity, some should keep massive AE spells, some should keep fear/gate/disciplines etc etc BUT the baseline of mob difficulty should now be how many hp it has NOT how magic immune it is.<P>You have crippled the offensive casting classes vs uber mobs and you continue to do. Can you not see that allowing caster classes to do offensive damage not only gives the players a more diverse arsenal to chose from it also allows you to give mobs 1 million+ hp and still make them, eventually, killable. Please note I'm am NOT saying remove all other mob abilities and just have encounters based on hp - that would obviously solve nothing and lead to enoucnters based largely on how many casters/people you can field.<P>I bet who ever tuned Dain etc in Velious got an absolute roasting from Brad et al when they discovered such an important mob was killed so soon after release. Verant's reaction? Rather than try and be creative (as I have suggested) they simply checked the logs (or spied on raids) and determined the 'factor X' they hadn't considered was clickable items such as the Donal BP. The result? Out comes the nerf stick and bang goes the another piece of credibilty they had with the player base. Can you not see that nerfing uber items to such an extent they lose their worth is the opposite of what you should be doing?<P>I suggest you read Oceanus's post on this thread where he states this change will simply make the length of encounters greater (to such an extent players on the raid will have been rez'd multiple times during the combat - this alone should be enough to tell your doing the tuning wrong). Some of the uber mobs in EQ SHOULD take hours and hours to kill - but they should include all classes in the fight, they should be truly EPIC. All you've done is dragged on the tank/cleric/wizard battle while others sit and watch. <P>If any uber more tuners are reading this - please just remove your blinkers and get creative!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  I'm going to give everyone here the chance to ignore this opinion right away by saying I have not yet hit lvl 50+, so I don't have any experience on planes raids, and whats involved other than listening to guildmates who talked about them.  It seems the game changes tremendously at the planes level so my reasoning here may be flawed.  I think what happens is that more often than not the players tend to more creative than the game designers.  The designers come up with an idea for an item that they think is really neat, intending it to be used in a certain way, and that way only.  Players tend to find new and innovative ways of using items with either other items, or by having multiple players with the same equipment and cascading the effect.  Then the designer looks back and says, "That's not what I wanted to happen with that item.  Never meant for it to be used in that way."  And then of course you get the nerf.  Now the people that have the item are angry because they earned the item, and the people with out the item tend to agree it was too powerful.  Is it an exploit?  I don't see it that way, just people being creative.  I just don't think the designers have the large guilds in mind all the time when they develop certain items or concepts, or they wouldn't have introduced the item at all.  As a casual gamer I will never get any uber-items, I don't have that kind of time.  But does my enjoyment of the game get dwarfed because others have really nice items? No.  I'll never duel them, even if I were the same level, cause I'd get flattened, but let them enjoy there stuff. The only time I get annoyed is when I can't camp for items I should be able to aquire without being in a 100 member + guild on a raid, is constantly being farmed by either ebayers or other guilds.  (I've never been less than 5th in line to camp the AC for the jboots  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> which equals much more time then I can spend online in one sitting)  It seems to me that 30sec to cast any spell kind of makes it useless in combat, and more of an after combat recovery type of thing.  But I'm sure the clever gamers out there will again find a way around this limitation.  They always do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Do you have even the slightest basis for saying this?  I think it's pretty conclusive, since they -changed- it, that that was exactly NOT their intent.  Or if it was, it was their intent that these items that will make it possible come from Velious itself, not Kunark or Antonica/Faydwer.<P>Why do you people insist that the very top mobs should be killable within 3 weeks of the expansion coming out?

</FONT><HR>i know they are unwarranted Nino, that's why i said all that will change is guilds will try to farm more BP's and create a longer counterbalance of cast time to how many BP's they have.  The situation will now become longer and more risky (if there is such a thing as "more risky" in EQ since it's already next to impossible) which Verant is relying on to make things more difficult for the high level players because god forbid they get an item that's actually *good*.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn- <P>There is an enormous difference between the expansion to Kunark and the expansion to Velious.<P>Of course nobody was able to take down Trakanon for a few months. (six weeks actually).  This is because Trakanon was a level 60 encounter.  Since there werent any level 60s, of course it took time.  However, every high end encounter in Velious is also tuned for level 60s. Guess what?  We are already level 60.  There isnt going to be a couple months to 'level up' before people try the top end encounters.<P>This is like saying if Verant put in a new lvl 30 dungeon and then was mortified that the 'boss' mob in that zone was killed in the first week.<P>Now im not saying we've seen all that Velious has to offer.  In fact, there are a multitude of stone left unturned.  Some of the equipment we find may indeed make top end encounters a little bit easier.  But all that aside, I still do not see the reasoning to nerf a functioning balanced piece of equipment because level 60 players were winning level 60 encounters.  If people level 45 were able to do this...then we might have a problem.<P>Nino McHammer<BR>Fires of Heaven <BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor how is the game "more fun" because of this change? If anything it's more of a pain.<P>If suddenly all our weapons turned into rusty daggers would the game be more fun?<P>The real issue here seems to be that you didn't want guilds to kill velious uber mobs so quickly.  Why else would you mention that the game should last years?  And its not a coincidence that the ress nerf was put in in the same patch.<P>GM follows uber guild x around, finds out how they killed mob y and nerf item z.  It's quite that simple.  It's their attempt to slow us down.  The item was never too powerful or they would have changed the effect completely or removed the bp from the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nino - if clerics weren't already ABSOLUTELY required in every ubermob encounter, how does making a cleric WITH A DONAL'S BP absolutely required help matters?<P>As it stands, from everything you people are saying, these mobs are -CURRENTLY- completely undoable UNLESS you have CLERICS with DONAL'S BP.  No other clerics really necessary.  This single item that belongs to one single class makes the difference between a completely impossible encounter and a doable encounter.<P>You need to ask why this is unbalanced?  I mean, isn't it patently obvious that no single item should make such a vast difference?<P>By the way, Alan, it's Qwinn with a W  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042199-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042199-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042199-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042199-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=042199&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=042199&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
