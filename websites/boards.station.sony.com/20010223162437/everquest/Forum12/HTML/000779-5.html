</FONT><HR>I believe that the entire Everquest community could benefit from having a few appointed, high level characters in each class to express the wants and needs of that class.  That way, the very good ideas are not lost among the thousands of repetitive ideas.  The appointed characters could tell Verant exactly what is wanted in an orderly, well thought out manner.  I believe that this would relieve the communication problems that have been brought up throughout this forum about the ideas and wishes of the Necro community not being looked at, along with any similar problems within the other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>**Cheers for Tamria** Well said.<P>When I started my necromancer I did it because I thought the class was cool and would be fun to play.  Now at highers levels its frusterating and difficult to find a group in any high level raid.<P>Did our class need nerfing when this game came out, Yes.  Do we need to be better solo'rs, No.  Do we want to be manastones, No.  We want to be what we are, Necromancers but we have to rely on you to decide what the is.  This game is not flexible enough to allow for us to define that role.  Its kill or be killed and power counts. <P>You defined us from the begining as solo'rs, YOU defined us, not us.  I am so disheartened after listening to my friends who are 54+ level necros talk about their spells and abilities.  I can't stand the thought of having to start over because I am so frustrated with this characeter.  I don't have the time to do it.  <P>Its just very frustrating to know that I become a member of the "trash group" on big raids.  I do hope that when you do make these changes, you will consider what role we fill and make us at least of some use to high level raids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, there should be more direct player interaction with Verant. If you want a game lasting years there comes a point where you have to really listen to the players and act on issues they raise. We all realise mudflation will kill EQ faster than any bugs but there is a balance and Verant is currently too far on the side of paranoia.<P>There is no debate on these boards and it's incredibly frustrating. We post ideas/concerns and only very few are addressed and even then usually not satisfactorily. You can't have debate via a messageboard. It either needs to be done via IRC or in person.<P>However the trouble is even if Verant agreed to a Player Council, how would we elect the representatives? There is too much animosity and cyniscm amongst the playerbase to form a council with wide-ranging support.<P>What I would like to see is the minutes of Verant meetings where player issues are being discussed. Sure confidential stuff should be cut out but currently we never get to see why some ideas are rejected, for all we know verant misinterpret the idea or reject on misinformation.<P>Whilst Absor is supposedly the Verant guy on the side of the player it's still apparent that his loyalty lies with his pay cheque and rightly so. But I still think if Verant is serious about keeping EQ alive for another couple of years they need more player involvement - and that's not simply starting Class Talk threads.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow.  Well.  Call me stupified.<P>One week for necro talk in which no one talked with us.<P>25 items on the list, eight of which where on the initial necro talk list.<P>Let's look at the original eight comments and lack of response:<P>No comment made on the fact that Lich was changed in a patch to give more mana.<BR>No comment on the valid numerical numbers given showing how lich IS balanced and if changes are made then lich is INEFFICIENT due to costs of healing self vs mana gain.<P>No update to track corpse being fixed - I mean did he actually update this list?<P><BR>Let's look at the new info on his list<P>Item - trucidation<BR>Uhm.  Last time I checked Trucidation had a 15 min recast.  But I could be wrong.  Happy to hear they admit for it's high cost it should do more.<P>Item - pets and fear immunity<BR>Sigh.  Yes, pets should be immune to fear as they are undead.  Completely ignore our comments on our undead fear/charm/lull spells.  So it's undead, yippee.  Enchanter is all powerful and can charm/mez it.  Period.  Maybe if they couldn't charm undead or fear undead, might that be an intrusion on another classes toes?<P>Also, completely ignore the data which shows<BR>A.  Level of pets summoned out of line with 53, 56, AND 59 pet spell<BR>B.  Lack of HP = sheer lack of lifespan with 53 & 56 pets<P>Also, no response on explanation how 50+ fear spell isn't any better than lower fear spells.<P>Item - stacking bug with splurt<BR>Oh, haven't we been saying this since KUNARK!!!<P>Item - summon companion<BR>Sigh.<P>Item - screaming terror<BR>Bug yes that enchanter can't overwrite.  What crack are you on?  There isn't a single mob that I can mez that an enchanter can't.  <BR>Oh, yeah, screaming terror was supposed to be something different, but they couldn't get it to work.  sigh.<BR>Completely ignore request for upgrade to this...<P>Item - Sedulous Subversion<BR>Sigh.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, thank you for the response.  That helped.<P>Some additional thoughts:<P><BR>ITEM: Ignite/Chill Bones<P>***<BR>If the skeleton can’t be sized, then perhaps remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Or, give it a longer recast time instead of the ‘sticky’ thing.<BR>***<P>It already has a pretty hefty recast time of 12 seconds.  Not exactly chain casting.<P>"Ghosting" transparency would be a nice effect.<P><BR>ITEM: Track Corpse<P>***<BR>&gt;”The Track Corpse was fixed about a month ago and works fine. At least for me. Just wanted to let you know”&lt;<P>I know. There are a lot of things on these lists that are already fixed, at least on test. I’ll be updating them after the next patch.<BR>***<P>Track Corpse works like multiple castings of Locate Corpse - it turns you in the targetted corpse's direction every 6 seconds or so.  It would be nice if it worked more like tracking in general, giving a message about direction rather than actually spinning us about.  But yes, it is functional, if a bit awkward at times.<P><BR>ITEM: Lich Series<P>***<BR>Actually, the main drive for wanting it changed is because it’s broken.<P>Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<BR>***<P>Yes, let's fix things that are broken.  While it's being fixed, can we take another look at it for balance?  Does the difference in mana generation between Lich and Clarity/Clarity 2 really justify the amount of health lost?  Does the self-only limitation of Lich versus targetability of Clarity/Clarity 2 justify the amount of health lost?<P>Also included is Dark Pact (8).<P><BR>ITEM: Essence Emerald spells<P>***<BR>Essence emeralds are supposed to be hard to get. I’ll add a note to the two spells that use it that don’t raise the dead that if we are going to leave them as they are, then perhaps a new component is a good idea.<BR>***<P>Thank you.  Please also consider letting those two spells require an Essence Emerald, but not consume it.  If that seems overpowering, consider making Essence Emeralds lore, letting us use the trapped soul to power spells until we release it for a resurrection - which then requires us to make another sacrifice to use any of the spells.<P><BR>ITEM:  Pets and Fear Immunity<P>***<BR>It makes some sense that undead pets would be immune to fear. Again, this would help the necromancer do more at the end of a raid. Perhaps only the highest level undead pets would be immune to fear.<BR>***<P>Yes, thank you.  An inborn immunity, not an additional spell.<P>Feel free to apply this to all high-level undead in general.  It would give us a use for all of those undead-only spells that don't get out much.<P><BR>ITEM: Summon Companion<P>***<BR>Giving this to magicians requires consideration about giving it to necromancers (and all other pet classes).<BR>***<P>I think we all agree that magicians and necromancers are the primary pet classes.  If we can call Goner from beyond the grave, certainly we should be able to call him from the other side of the bridge.<P><BR>ITEM: Coffin Availability<P>***<BR>There appear to be no regular coffins available in Necromancer/Shadow Knight guilds other than Neriak. They should probably be available elsewhere.<BR>***<P>As has been mentioned, the coffins are actually in the Neriak cleric guild.  There's a reason for that - the Neriak necromancer guild is particularly unfriendly, even to other necromancers.<P>Perhaps they could be created through trade skills - Coffins could be made through smithing, Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffins could be made through jewelcraft.<P><BR>ITEM: Temporary Animation<P>***<BR>Actually, the assumption would be that you would only lose experience with the first death.<P>Besides, it’s just an interesting idea from a player that I wanted the team to see. I wouldn’t expect to see it showing up in game any time soon.<BR>***<P>There is already a precedent for this with the cleric's Death Pact spells.  These could work the same way, with the Animation effect replacing the cleric's healing effect.  An example from the previous thread, in case it gets lost:  Cast on a party member before/during battle; when target's HP drop below 0, spell kicks in with 1000 point heal, illusion:skeleton, and a long-lasting DoT that does 100 points/tick. This effectively lets a necromancer "animate" a dead party member for a very short amount of time - enough to help out in a raid situation, but the target is still going to die.<P><BR>ITEM: Defoliate<P>***<BR>&gt;”I've been trying to inform you Absor, Defoliate *isn't dropping*.”&lt;<P>Ok, added.<BR>***<P>Just want to be clear that Defoliate is the level 29 spell, not to be confused with the level 52 spell Defoliation.  Defoliation may be a rare drop, but Defoliate just isn't there.  What is and isn't a plant is also on your list, which is nice.<P><BR>ITEM: Pets<P>***<BR>Your pets are pretty good, but I’ve listed the one pet that gained the most concern.<BR>***<P>Please note the many comments that all of the post-50 pets have significant problems (hit points, resistance, etc.) and add those to the list as well.<P><BR>ITEM: Damage upgrades<P>***<BR>And I don’t remember any requests for DD upgrades post 50. Please explain to me why you think you need an upgrade.<P>I’ll add a request for a damage upgrade post 50th level.<BR>***<P>That's exactly it, thank you.  Just for completeness, here's the argument.<P>In the high-level, large mob situation (dragon, epic, etc.), we run into this:<BR>a) Little to no pet damage - Our pets die quickly from overwhelming damage that they can't resist, get hit with fear and run away, or can't participate due to pathing/aggro issues.<BR>b) Little to no DOT damage - Even if corpse poofing didn't scare people off, only the best of our damage-over-time spells hit hard enough to be worth casting.  Since DOT spells can't stack with themselves like DD can, just one necromancer can pretty much take care of this.  This is assuming the spells can be landed at all (often not the case), and that the fight lasts more than a minute (less than that and the DOT hasn't done appreciable damage).<BR>c) Little to no DD damage - Without our lifetap line, we're left with Chill Bones (55, 500ish damage), Ignite Bones (44, 500ish damage), Torbas Acid Blast (34, 220ish damage), or Shock of Poison (24, 150ish damage) - and we can't use the Bones spells because of the illusion.<P>It's not that we necessarily need a DD upgrade here, we just need a way to do damage.  We have an offensive spell line-up.  How are we intended to do damage?  If the answer is Pets, that's great - but the pets will need to be much more useable than they are now.  If the answer is Damage Over Time, that's okay - it gives one, maybe two necromancers some damage output, that's better than where we are now.  If the answer is Direct Damage, that's great - multiple necromancers would have a role, and the Lifetap line is the obvious choice for this rather than putting in new spells.<P><BR>ITEM: Summon Corpse<P>***<BR>Why does the ability of SK’s to cast this spell mean that you should get the better spell earlier? I’m confused by this.<BR>***<P>Our unique ability to Summon Corpse was one of the few things that made us useful in some of these high-level situations.  If we get the better spell earlier or at the same time, we would still be marginally useful (due to the less restrictive component requirements).<P>This would be a moot point if we could do damage.<P><BR>Thanks again, looking forward to being wanted in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Absor, <P>I appreciate your time to read all of these posts and I just wanted to give you my opinion on some issues. I think its a bad idea to provive any new type of DD type of spell to necromancers since they were never defined this way.This class has a strong DoT series of spells but to give necros DDs for Uber raids because they feel useless is not a solution but very unbalancing. I think its weird to have skele form from ignite bones but as you stated in the past, necros weren't meant to chain cast. To give both strong DoT series and then to upgrade their DD line is just gonna open a can or worms. I implore you to rethink any ideas you may have about giving new 'DD type' spells. By new, I mean using so called low cast,recast chain type casting spells. If it smells like a Duck, walks like a Duck......you get the idea.

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Temporary Animation<P>***<BR>Actually, the assumption would be that you would only lose experience with the first death.<P>Besides, it’s just an interesting idea from a player that I wanted the team to see. I wouldn’t expect to see it showing up in game any time soon.<BR>***<P>Now this is quite a nice idea but how could it be made to work in practice?  As soon as you die you get the dreaded "LOADING... please wait" message.  Now if I as a necro cast reanimate then after the dead dude respawned at his bind point he would then be summoned back to where his corpse was to fight again for a short time before going back to his bind point.  The inherent problem with that it is quite likely that by the time the dead dude has been reanimated the fight is already over.<P>Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great spell which would make us wanted again (just think of a tank who's just died and we summon him back to get revenge from beyond death  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Casting after death does not seem an option because of this.  Maybe it could be cast as some kind of buff which would activate as soon as the character died.  It would have to be a pretty short lasting buff though as otherwise I could imagine teams of necros casting this on everyone.  This would lead to some serious inbalance.<P>Also, PLEASE, make our pets a bit tougher - they just can't stand up to a mob for any length of time (even at mid-levels).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*** Answer to Absor's Conjure Corpse Question ***<P>Absor, you wanted to know the logic for providing Necromancers with the spell "Conjure Corpse" at a lower level than 57.<P>It is this...SKs are a hybrid and, as far as I know, no other hybrid gets it's parent's class' spell until the parent gets an upgrade, if it were available.  In reality, the parent is usually 2+ circles above its hybrid counterpart<P>Here is an example.<P>SKs get Cascading Darkness at lvl 59<BR>Necros get it at lvl 49<BR>Necros get an upgrade to Cascading at lvl 59, hence SKs don't have their upgrade before Necros.<P>SKs get Asystole at lvl 60<BR>Necros get it at lvl 44<BR>Necros get an upgrade to Cecessation of Cor at lvl 56.<P>I guess you see the pattern.  I am not as familiar with other Hybrid/Parent relationships, but am not familiar of a time when the hybrid gets any given spell before its parent gets a corresponding, available, upgrade.  This is especially true for the issue surrounding Summon Corpse vs Conjure Corpse.<P>Necros get it at lvl 39 and currently receive an upgrade 18 lvls later.  But, remember, 7 of those lvls are post 50 so are much much harder levels than those &lt;50.<P>SKs get Summon Corpse at 50.  One could easily argue that Necros should get Conjure at 51, but the community has reasonably suggested lvl 55, which is a significant right of passage and still 5 lvls past where the SKs get their spell.<P>Please add this to the list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, Absor, I would like to say something about the whole lich thing.  You said that you wanted to fix it simply because it is a bug.  That makes no sense.  Anything currently in the game should either be fixed or left alone based on how well it is balanced in the game, not based on whether it was the intended effect.  For example, would you really want to change something that was balanced well just because it was not working as originally intended?  Would you really leave something alone that was not balanced simply because it was working as originally intended?  The fact that something is/is not working as intended is not a reason to change it, the only reasonable criterion is whether or not it is balanced in its current form.<P>Of course you then seemed to indicate that you wanted to change lich because you did not think that it was balanced in its current form.  I.e., you said that you constantly have to think about lich when implementing new things in the game.  For what its worth, I think that it is balanced.  It has a higher mana regen effect than Clarity II, but at a heavy price.  As at least one other poster mentioned, I am quite often at 60-70% or below of my already low max hit points when using lich, so that if I make - one - little mistake I am dead.  If this was nerfed, I would see no reason to use it over C2.  Also, as it is it really sucks my life bar down fast.  I mean, I have tons more mana than life, so that even 1/1 my life bar goes down very fast compared to the speed my mana bar goes up.  If my life were to go down even faster?  It would make this spell so hard to use as to be almost purposeless.<P>As for the rest.  Absor, I haven't read the other class threads, so I don't know whether or not they are happy.  What I do know from these posts is that at least the necros who post are not happy.  I sense a real attitude from you (e.g. "*sigh*") and I can only assume that it is because you are reading hundreds if not thousands of posts from unhappy people.  Please try and keep in mind that all of these unhappy posts are possibly an indication of a real problem.  I know that VI feels that only unhappy people post, and I think that is mostly true.  However, VI also then seems to go one step further and feel that for the most part all of the unhappy posts are from career complainers and can be discounted, and that there are ten happy people out there for every unhappy poster.  Please do not feel that way.  I played my necro for 50 levels and was very happy, and I never posted.  I then played to 55 and was fairly unhappy, but not so much that I would waste a lot of time reading and posting on these boards.  Now that I am struggling along post 55 I am finally so unhappy that I am willing to give up hours of playing time to read the boards and formulate my post.  The fact that I am willing to do that should be an indication to you that there is something wrong with necromancers post 50 - I did not suddenly just become a complainer after 50 happy levels.<P>At times you at VI seem to take the mindset that the game is fine, and the players are broken.  For example, when overcrowding was such a huge issue (pre-Kunark) Abashi used to post over and again that we were all crazy, and that there were tons of empty zones in the world that we could go to if we didn't like overcrowding.  In other words, instead of seeing the fact that some zones were underutilized as an indication that there was some problem with those zones, VI seemed to feel that the zones were fine, and that the players were just not using them for some inexplicable reason.  Now, many many 55+ necros are unhappy, and instead of seeing that as an indication that 55+ necros may have problems, you seem to feel that 55+ necros have just turned into complainers (*sigh*).<P>Please, please look into necromancers post 50 and particularly post 55.  I love my necro, and I don't want to just use him to twink up a tank.  Please, please try and work with us to make us happier.  And no, I won't stop playing EQ if you don't help necros post 55, since I love this game too much.  But I will stop playing him and play my twink tank, cleric and druid more.  That can't be a good result for you.<P>I think that the problem was that you saw us as overpowered at 50, so you didn't want to add more power to the class.  Hence, pets don't get much more powerfull, spells don't get much more powerfull, and some of the really creative ideas have creative but unworkable restrictions (i.e. night-only, Essence Emerald, etc.)<P>However, you also didn't want us to solo so much, so you made soloing very difficult post 50.  As it is, after months of playing post 50 I have found that I can only really solo effectively in Skyfire, and that only - very - slowly.  And I think you tried to make us more desireable in a group, but it didn't really work out that way.<P>The end result is that I am sitting at 55 faced with an huge time investment ahead of me with no real pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Each level after 55 will take a mountain of time, but will only yield a very small reward.  If you want us to be happy, one or the other end of that equasion has to be changed.  Either make leveling easier (either by restoring my ability to solo post-55 or by making me wanted in a group), or make the reward for reaching the higher levels greater.  As it is, I can hardly bring myself to log onto my necro anymore.  It has just started to feel too much like work.<P>Darq<BR>55th level necro on Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I also like the fact that i can form a group that's not like every other group, and basically function with any combination of classes, including 5 monks or rogues by fear kiting.

</FONT><HR>The in-game description of a Dark Elf Necromancer (race/class I play) is that of a being of great power, highly respected within the Dark Elf society, feared by most other races, a creation of Innoruk, practitioner of the dark arts, views Hate as a creative force of destruction, and more than likely be killed outside his hometown by other races.<P>I am currently level 40, but if what I hear from people of level 50 and higher is true, then there ought to be a "technical disclaimer" during character creation stating that the aforementioned description of the character ONLY applies to the first 50 levels. And that once you reach level 50 and go on uber raids your HATE is no longer POWERFUL ENOUGH, so you have to sit on your but and "kindly" submit yourself to the needs of others who reqire the use of your mana. <P>This, basically, goes against the true nature of a Necromancer according to the in-game description.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>   A few additions/explanations for your list, Absor:<P><BR>#1 - <BR>&gt;”5th - The issue dealing with the cost of summon corpse since SK's now have the ability. Spell is mainly used<BR>                          during raids which are done by 46+ chars so shouldn't we get the replacement spell before 57th. “&lt;<P>                          Why does the ability of SK’s to cast this spell mean that you should get the better spell earlier? I’m confused by<BR>                          this.<P><BR>   We feel this way because shadowknights use necromancy; necromancers do not use shadowknightry (hehe).  Shadowknights get armor class, hit points, disciplines, etc. becuse they sacrifice their ability to cast by a great measure.  If they can cast the same spells as us at equal levels, what is the point of being the "masters" of necromancy as the name might suggest.<P>   Do we see paladins getting revive around the same time in their lives as clerics?  Complete heal?  HAH!  The outcry would be deafening.<P><BR>#2 - Please add my vague request for usefulness to your list.  Necromancers (post 50) are not wanted in groups.  WE HAVE NO ROLE!<P>#3 - Let us cast the same spells when grouping together.  Every other class in the game reaps the benefits of adding another member of the same class to their party.  Necromancer damage is limited to ONE character per raid.  We cannot dd the same mob.  We cannot dot the same mob.  Our pets last a round or two if not feared and training.<P><BR>#4 Pets.  Our pets damage is fine, I guess.  Can we hang on to them for more than two rounds, though?  HP upgrades and poison/disease resists would help.  Two rounds of AoE spells from ANY uber mob destroys our pets.  Fear sticks on our pets 95% of the time.  Two rounds of melee damage kills them twice (lol).  They are worthless against boss mobs, plain and simple.<P><BR>Az</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>***** NEW SUGGESTION ******<P>Current necro pets from 1 - 24 are white skeletons with green eyes. from 24 - 44 they are brown skeletons with yellow eyes. Then from 49+ they are pink skeletons with grey heads.<P>The brown skeleton change was added about a year ago and was universally welcomed by necros. However, I think that the pink skeletons 49+ are kind of silly. How about skeletons 44+ being charcoal black with red eyes?<P>This is a palette swap, not a new texture, so it would not take any texture memory. Just a cool, fun bonus for 44 that has no gameplay change but is a nice visual additon.<P>Another idea is to have pet eye color change with each level, and pet skin color change every 20 levels. So at 24 the pet could be brown skin with green eyes, then at 29 brown skin with orange eyes, etc... till 39 with brown skin with red eyes. Then at 44 move to charcoal skin.<P>This would be a really nice and easy to implement addition for necros!<P><BR>*******</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>  OOH!  I absolutely love that idea in th post above, regarding enchanters being unable to charm/mez undead.  Shouldn't necromancers be allowed private rights to this area of the game?  <P><BR>   Please consider upgrading our mezzing abilities, especially against undead, and downgrading other classes abilities to affect undead mobs.  This would be a step towards giving necromancers back their role in the game.<P>   Another point I liked, from a different post, was that our last poison dd is at level 39.  Do any level 39 dd's even get used in this game?  In a 20-40 second boss mob battle, we do nothing.  Why not give us a nice new dd that does less than wizards and other pure casters, but more than shaman, clerics, and other healers, for innoruuk's sake!!!<P>   I can not, for the life of me, see why a cleric, master of HEALING, should be able to damage a mob anywhere near as much as we.  This is pure and utter favoritism.  Not only do they have their own role, but they are allowed to trespass (and surpass) in the roles of other classes.<P>   We are casters, meant to stand back and do damage from a safe distance.  They are healers.  They heal people.  Who should have the better dd?<P><BR>   Finally, I have to agree with the wizard who posted here earlier.  The entire game is unbalanced in favor of melee classes.  The caster should be the one who does the damage while the tanks live up to their name and tank!<P><BR>    Casters cannot take damage, therefore they should be able to deal damage.  As it stands, melee classes are the ones able to absorb *AND* distribute the most damage.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>(Since everyone seems to be posting suggesions again, I'm going to repost my original suggestions that I made to the official necromancer talk)<P>Dear Absor and Dev team:<BR>I would like to put forth some suggestions that would compensate for many nerfs our class has received and that would bring the necromancer back to being desirable and productive addition to groups in dungeons and in raid situations. <P><BR>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS:<P>-reduce the MR of many of the new uber mobs in SOV and ROK, this "mobflation" seems to be the cause of many of the problems for casters and necros in the post 50 game, as well this would help us stick our lifetap line of spells on uber mobs<P>-put some undead content in outdoor zones in SOV, there are zero undead mobs in outdoor zones in SOV, this is not only a nerf to necromancer but SK's, paladins and clerics who have a nice set of anti-undead spells, also bonechips are not readily available in these zones for necros<P>-fix the current code that no longer lets you resume your character if you crash or go link dead, both mages and necros use considerable mana to summon pets and suffer because of this attempt to thrwart cheaters who took advantage of resuming characters to dupe<P>-necro epic - ugly, impractical, very difficult to get, would never use, a complete disaster, there only a few on our server<P>-increase the drops in the planes, in all the raids I have ever been on I've only seen 1 necro item drop and that was a pair of boots in POG a few days ago, what we see is tank armor over and over again<P><BR>FACTION:<P>Why do rangers and druids get a amiable faction with animals and necromancers don't get amiable or at the very least indifferent with the undead?<BR>We are supposed to be the "masters of the undead". Even in skeleton form undead scowl at us. The faction system that is in use in lowerguk with undead would also prevent this from being abused.<P><BR>PETS & EXPERIENCE:<P>Currently if your pet does 51% of the damage to the mob it will take half of the exp. This is wrong and needs to be changed. Necromancers shouldn't be competing with their pets to see who can do the most advantage. We are the master of the pets therefore we should get FULL experience for the kill. Pets who are victim of bad pathing in dungeons get me killed all the time, perhaps my pet should take half of my share of exp loss.<P><BR>PET COMMANDS:<P>-new pet command /pet defend (toggles on and off)<P>This new command would allow the pet to continue to fight his chosen target and not defend himself from a mob that has chosen to start beating on him.<P>The most disconcerting problem necromancers have is the reputation that pets have with breaking mez inside dungeons when attacked by mobs other than the mob that is the main target of the group. Implementation of this single command for pets would make finally make the necromancer group friendly. Also the fact that the pathing is absolutely horrendous in most dungeons, this new command would make up for that. <P>-new pet command /pet report level<P>There is currently no way to know a pets lvl unless you sick it on some greens. This command would help.<P><BR>PET DAMAGE:<P>-increase the maximum damage of the lvl 53 pet, the lvl 56 pet and the lvl 59 pet by 2 damage each.<P>lvl 49 pet - hits for 47 to 55 <BR>no change<P>lvl 53 pet - hits for 49 to 57 BS for max 161<BR>new 53 pet - hits for 51 to 59<P>lvl 56 pet - hits for ?? to 59 kicks for 71<BR>new 56 pet - hits for ?? to 61 kicks for 71<P>lvl 59 pet - hits for ?? to 61<BR>new 59 pet - hits for ?? to 63<P>Since EQ was release the damage of our pets has remained stagnant and was even nerfed, while the damge of the average tank has gone up considerably due to better weapons, more haste gear, etc. The maximum damage that a lvl 49 pet does compared to a spectre pet is a difference of 6 damage.<P>Consider that it takes 2 times as long to get from from lvl 49 to lvl 59 as it does to get from lvl 1 to lvl 49, is it too much to ask to ask that our pets receive a damage upgrade at lvl 53, lvl 56 and lvl 59?<P>Look at the progression of HPS that the following mobs have then compare it to the 2 damage increase of our pets:<P>greater kobold lvl 34 - 1370 HP<BR>lava beetle lvl 42 - 3290 HP<BR>imp protector lvl 48 - 6566 HP<BR>fire giant warrior lvl 51 - 13136 HP<P>The mobs practically double in HPs every few lvls but necromancers are given pets that that only increase by 2 maximum damage. This list of mobs doesn't even include the new SOV uber mobs. Why is it that a lowly lvl 33 spectre in Oasis can hit for 80+ damage, yet my higher level pet only hits for 49?<P><BR>PET BUFFS:<P>-increase the inherent dexterity of our pets or include dexterity as part of the Augment Death pet buff<P>Recently the Verant nerfed our pets by placing them in a PC model from an NPC model. Now as Abashi admitted, our pets have seriously low dexterity and hardly proc at all when using weapons that proc. This change was done as a quick fix for the mages Sword of Runes bug, but it was never changed back after the SOR bug was fixed. For many necromancers that used gnoll<BR>hide lariats and other procing weapons, this change made giving your pet a weapon entirely useless.<P>-pets should benefit from group buffs, many times group buffs are cast by clerics, druids, etc. and pets are never included...why not?<P>-let us target other players pets by pressing the Function key twice, I can select my own pet if I hit F1 twice, why can't I select a groupmates pet by clicking twice on the function key assigned to him?<P>-potions on pets, currently potions can't be used on pets, why?<P>-mages get an extensive line of damage shield that are castable on anyone, necros don't get any damage shields, why?<P>PET FOCUS ITEMS:<P>There is only one in the game, the Encyclopedia Necrothurgia and it drops off a god and is rare as hell. I don't even know a necro on our server that has one or if it has ever dropped. Mages get focus items that they can quest for, why don't necros get them?<P>Perhaps there could be a quest for a focus item that enables the pet to cast disease on the mob. Also there could be one that roots the mob, etc.<P><BR>PET WEAPONS:<P>As the necromancer pet stands now after the dexterity nerf, there is no reason to give a necromancer pet a weapon past lvl 29. It's cosmetic only. I belive that an armed pet *should* do more damage than an unarmed pet. Pets equipped with FS weapons and better should receive a damage bonus or a parrying skill. Giving FS or better weapons to pets is also a great money sink to the game. <P><BR>SPELL UPGRADES:<P>Renew Bones: lvl 29 spell is our last pet heal spell max heal 175 HP at lvl 50 for 125 mana, we are supposed to go thru 31 more lvls with no other pet heal spells?<P>-upgrade at lvl 50 called Refresh Bones, max heal 350 for 250 mana<P>Spirit Armor: lvl 16 spell, increases AC +14, mana cost 75, we get no upgrade to this<P>-upgrade at lvl 44 to Guard (existing lvl 29 cleric spell which is natural upgrade to Spirit Armor) increases AC + 20, mana 80<P>Screaming Terror: lvl 24 spell, stuns target and memblur for 18 secs max, 60 mana<P>-necromancers desperatly need an upgrade to this spell which would help us be more group friendly, Screaming Fright lvl 50 spell, 36 secs duration, 120 mana <P>-upgrade Feign Death lvl 20 spell<P>Shadowknights get a Feign Death upgrade at lvl 60 Death Peace, we should get this spell at lvl 50.<P>-upgrade Invis to Undead, lvl 1 spell<P>Clerics get Sunskin group Invis to Undead at lvl 51, necros to should get this spell at lvl 51. This would enhance our grouping utility.<P>-upgrade Dead Man Floating lvl 44 spell<P>New group DMF spell called Dead Horde Floating, lvl 55. Again, make us group useful.<P><BR>CHANGES TO EXISTING SPELLS:<P>Essence Emerald spell line<P>-make Convergence the lvl 53 necro res that requires an "essence emerald" (which is the result of sacrificing a lvl 47+ player) a purchasable gem.<P>We currently have 3 spells that use the dreaded essence emerald. Nobody I know has ever agreed to be sacrificed or has sacrificed anyone to get these emeralds. In short these 3 spells which require this Convergence (res), Infusion (mana transfer), and Trucidation (lifetap) are never used by 99.9% of necromancers.<P>Essence emeralds should be sold for 500pp at the same vendors that would normally sell coffins. This change would actually make necromancers truly USEFUL and able to res members on a raid etc. Perhaps vendors could sell these in locations in Hate or Fear thus making them difficult to buy like the Tinker bag is in SolA.<P>Summon Corpse spell line<P>-move Conjure Corpse to lvl 51 from lvl 57<P>Shadowknights recently got Summon Corpse at lvl 51, necromancers should get Conjure Corpse at lvl 51. It is way to long to wait till lvl 57 to be able to provide the services of realistic corpse summoning. Regular coffins are too heavy and require there own INV slot, this makes using Summon Corpse completely inpractical for a necromancer below lvl 57. Please change this as it would make our us more desirable in groups/raids.<P>Lich Line of spells:<P>Why do we have 2 lich spells at lvl 60? Please move one of these to lvl 55 and reduce it's effectiveness accordingly.<P>A final note about spell upgrades. Why is it that we seem to get endless upgrades for spells that we never use. Case in point the darkness line of spells (snare). Every necromancer I know uses Dooming Darkness a lvl 29 spell despite the fact that Cascading Darkness a lvl 49 spell and Devouring Darkness lvl 59 spell are available. It is faster to recast and uses less than half the mana.<P><BR>BRING BACK THE FUN SPELLS:<P>When SOV was released our sister class the mages received a line of spells called Monster Summoning. These spells enabled mages to summon new and interesting pets from the NPC models of each zone. Each of these new pets has interesting abilities. These spells have brought back some fun and variation to the mage spell lineup.<P>I think necromancers need a similar lineup of spells. You could have Mummies that cast disease, Ghouls that root, Jack O'Lantern's that fear, Dry & Ice bones that cast, Zombies that stun, etc. what a shame the "masters of the undead (tm)" can't summon these undead beings. These spells would actually inject some fun back into the necromancer class!<P>Summon Dead I - lvl 34 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P>Summon Dead II - lvl 50 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P>Summon Dead III - lvl 60 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P><BR>NEW SPELL WISHLIST:<P>Portal of Tears - lvl 53 - evacs party to spectre island in OOT, dangerous in the fact that party will probably be attacked by spectres upon arrival, also this zone is considered remote, no way to zone out without gate or boat travel<P>Portal of Sand - lvl 60 - evacs party to spectre tower in Oasis, dangerous as well because of spectres on island.<P>Summon Remains - invariably on most raids a corpse will get stuck in a tree or on some unobtainable structure, this spell would summon the corpse of the mob so it can be looted<P>Summon Companion - due to bad pathing or leaving the pet behind, this spell would summon the pet back to it's master<P><BR>Misc:<P>One thing that really puzzles me is why 90% of our spells icons look exactly the same with a skull. Is there any possible way DMF can be changed to the levitate graphic that shamans and druids have? A little imagination would go along way into remedying this problem<P><BR>Finally, I think that the necromancer class was viable when the original EverQuest was released and before the 2 expansions were released. The problem is I see it is that the necromancer was never designed with lvls 51 to lvl 60 in mind. When you consider that lvls 51 to 60 take twice as long as lvls 1 to 50 something is seriously wrong.<P>This isn't a request for more sheer power it's really a plea for the necromancer to be useful in groups and on raids. I'm a lvl 54 necromancer I don't solo anymore because it's boring and there really isn't any place left to solo at my level--therefore grouping is my only option. <P>Nonetheless, to play for over a thousand hours on my necromancer and end up being a "mana feeder" is a sad state of affairs. To always end up in the "oddball" group in raids because you serve no function in a 6 person is depressing. <P>Can I see myself playing my necro for one more year? For 2 more years? Not the way things stand now. The necromancer class post lvl 50 is ill defined and irrelevant to the new reality--where tanks, clerics and enchanters rule the roost because of "mobflation" gone wild in ROK and SOV. To be honest, I love playing my necro. I don't want to quit but if there are no significant changes and upgrades to my class--I'm outta here. Thank you for listening Absor. I hope you will consider some of my suggestions.<P>Dornette<BR>54 necromancer<BR>The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>so I just started playing a necro (lvl 8) and this disturbs me... arn't necro's lone wolves? only grouping when it suits them?  and never giving up their power to clerics and other magic users? and if we are ment to "pump gas" then why are we KOS at all the other guilds?  don't change that it is just a joke to ill. a point.  Necro's should be a good class to "roleplay" esp. at high lvls, instead it seem that you have made the necro's the laughing stock of all high lvl classes.  This is some kind of cruel joke that only a Necro would pull on some one else. I'll continue to play so long as it's fun, but only untill that point. |(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great Idea... (please don't skip this over)<P>As for stacking of dots, if one necro could stack his or her dots, they would become MUCH too strong... but if two different necros could cast the same dot and have it stack, then the One Necro Per Group mindset could be gotten rid of.  I'm not sure if this could be implimented, but it would allow more than one necro in a group, while not improving a single necro's ability to solo.  This might help with allowing necros on raids and in having more than one necro in a group, but it does not change the fact that currently, one of the main reasons for having a necro in a group post 50 is for mana, which is not very interesting and ruins the fun of the game, so other action would need to be taken to solve that problem.  But this, i'm sure, would help alot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor stated - <BR>"Having a broken spell or game mechanic bugs me, and it means that we have to always have that broken spell in the back of our minds when we do things for necromancers. It’s a terrific pain when you’re trying to make a working game to have a broken spell sitting there like that."<P>Well, considering all the things you've done "for" necromancers: pets nerfed, life taps nerfed, FD nerfed, fear darkness resists nerfed, etc..., "fixing" lich is all you have left do to "for" us.<P>I know all the classes expect to see enhancements after every patch, but to tell you the truth, if we came away from this next round of enhancements without out yet another nerf, I'd be really suprised and incredibly happy.  Forget enhancements, just leave us alone.<P>Anywhere from 4 to 5 of my spells out of 8 on my spell list are 29th or lower.  Lich/BoD take up one, EB, and splurt are really the only post 29+ spells on my list, and Deflux will frequently make it there.  Why?  Resists and casting time on our darkness line making the ones after Dooming useless.  Night time only spells?  They'll never see the light of day (no pun intended).  If you're gonna do that, change the druid TPs to daytime only, see how they feel about that.<P>Changing our spells that are night time only to full time would be a huge step in the right direction, and certainly not overpowering.  And making the other essence crystal spells require something that would make them worth casting would be ok too.  Would life taps that aren't 100% resisted be overpowering?  We will never do the damage of wizards, nor should we.<P>There isn't a necro out there that doesn't feel that its justified that we're not the strongest group members.  We solo really well and we understand that our group abilities are lower.  If we wanted to be group only, we'd be clerics.  I love that you can create your own characters and do what you want.  Infact, I have a cleric, because my necro can't group at all.<P>Reading the druid strings makes me want to puke though.  They are just as good of soloers as necros, get TPing, SoW, heals, buffs, damage shields, you name it.  And they complain that they can't heal as good as clerics and they get it?  Evacing, buffs and some heals already out do necros a hundred times over in group situations.<P>I only want 2 things:<BR>1.  Don't nerf us again (Lich)<BR>2.  Make our spells usable in practice (essence     crystals and night time only spells)<P>Vaelik Radanavich of House Radanavich<P>finally reached the age of no more soloing (55th) and hence no more playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And it's even worse than "one necro per group" - currently it's "One necro per however many people are attacking the MOB".  If 50 people are attacking one mob, yep, every necro after the first tries to cast and gets "Your spell did not take hold".<P>I run into this all the time even in smaller groups.  It is very, very annoying, especially when I then see 4 wizards nuking away with not a thought to whether one of the other 3 wizards happened to have casted on the same creature.

(both soloing and grouping now unavailable and more time to read the boards)  Man I love my necro and its so draining and exhausting to see him now uterly useless.  I didn't suddenly become a complainer either.  I'd rather be playing my guy than posting here, but clearly thats not a real option anymore.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The thing that confuses me, as Im sure it confuses other Necros, is Verants whole stance on grouping vs soloing. "In the beginning" as it were, Verant let it be known quite often that there were a couple classes that could solo better than others, but EQ was a grouping game and therefore they did not support soloing as an active gaming option. Infact they tried everything they could within the bounds of not completely ruining a class to prevent mass soloing. <P>The first of these soloing nerfs was the first Necro pet nerf. Our 49 pets used to hit for 65 damage a pop. They nerfed them with a hard cap of 55. Time went by and pretty soon the kiting nerf went in. Effecting Druids more than Necros, it reduced the length of time and damage of a DoT if the mob was chasing you. It still managed to effect Necros, but since we could send mobs in the other direction, we didnt take it as hard. The next nerf to hit Necros was the dagger delay nerf. In order to fix Mage pets, Verant had to remove the ability of Necros to give their pets low delay weapons to speed up their attacks. If left in, Mage pets would have been too powerful in Verants eyes. So instead of finding someway of fixing it, they did an across the board pet nerf. The most recent nerf, the Sword of Runes. Some claim it was a bug and it shouldnt have worked like that...ok fine whatever, but what we didnt see at first was the fact that Verant made the pets more like a PC than an NPC. This lowered their dexterity and reduced a couple things. Dexterity seems to be linked with the ability to hit your target, as well as set off proc rates. Pets do indeed miss their targets much much more often than they ever did before, and the Necro pets ability to proc its lifetap has also been reduced. Perhaps an unintended side effect of the Sword of Runes change, but its a nerf either way. Now they want to nerf Lich...Absor says they probably wont...but I lack trust in Verant. Prove me wrong.<P>Now, after all of these nerfs that indeed effect soloing, Abashi, Aradune, many others within Verant had answered a multitude of questions from the Necro class regarding their ability to solo. Still their stance was the same as ever. Soloing is possible, but not supported. EQ is a grouping game...yadda yadda yadda. Now, enter Velious. The new shining star of Verant. The pinnacle of Verant achievement. Bravo, very pretty. Nice armor styles, cool looking mobs. Neat-O! But whats this? No place to solo for exp? Hmmm...well Kunark at least had Skyfire, which is extremely dangerous to solo in there. I tried it, didnt like it, almost died, got summoned a couple times. Not really worth my time. Soloing is boring. Aaaanyyywaaaayyy. Where was I? Oh yes...Velious. Mobs litter the ground in even the largest of open spaces. No real good fear kiting grounds here, especially not for exp. But hey..thats ok right? Verant doesnt support soloing, this is a grouping game. Suddenly after a year and a half though, a Necro meets up with another and says "Hey...do you have problems getting your spells to stick here and Kunark?". The other Necro says "You know something..I do seem to have alot of problems with that. And I cant do squat to any uber mobs." The first Necro says "Yeah me too..hmmm.." And before you know it we have Necro asking questions. &gt;GASP!&lt; How dare they ask questions! Send in the Abashi! "You must pay for being mighty Aviak soloers!" But..but..we want to be group friendly! "No! Go forth and solo!" You said you didnt support soloing.."Silence! I will speak no more!" So now you have all these Necros standing around wondering, are we a solo class after 50? Or a group class? Eventually we discovered we are neither. We suck in groups on raid levels and we cant solo half as well for exp as we used to. Druids and Wizards are doing it..look! There goes one now! Did you see that? "You must pay!" Yeah yeah...whatever. Bring forth the Absor! "Hi guys..what is it you do? Ohhh..Necros. Your overpowered! Bad Necros!" Wha? Let talk. "Ok, lets talk, but dont talk about this, this, or this." Ok first lemme..."Ok, I have you list..bye." Ugh...So what are we? A solo class in a grouping game? Or are we supposed to be a grouping class that used to solo? We certianly retain nothing to make us either. EXCEPT...drumroll please...mana transfer!! Woohoo!! Mana pimps, mana sluts, mana pumps, mana stones...wever heard it all baby! This spell line has been a curse since the day it came out. I was there when it came out. People hated it then and they still hate it today...well, the Clerics like it. And it seems to be oh so uber to the other classes, because afterall...popular people wouldnt be popular if there werent useless underlings, right? <P>So first Necros werent supposed to solo so well. We were overpowered and nerfed accordingly. Everyone was supposed to be a group class in a group game. But nowwwww, were denied any decent upgrades because we can solo...in a grouping game. Were told that we get nothing because were overpowered soloers who steal babies in the night and eat puppies. Ok, that last part I made up. My WHOLE point is...make up your mind what the classes are supposed to be. If Necros are meant to group, give us spells that work in groups. If were supposed to solo, give us a place to solo, all phat lewtz included. Hey..if were not a group class, we gotta have some way to get decent items. We sure as hell cant group to get them if were a solo class now can we? Youve basically restricted soloing in 99.9% of Kunark, and ALL of Velious. So youre trying to make a point..groups are needed. Ok fine, make us a grouping class then. But we dont get group upgrades because we can solo! Ah ha! Catch 22. The paradox of Verant rears its head. So what would you have us do? Farm Guk? Is that our solo purpose? To supply all the Rogue and Bard twinks with an FBSS? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>was going to be a few things, but just one for now (brain falling asleep)...<P>- Pet pathing and pet control, primarily in a raid context.  In normal groups, the difficulty with both of the above is understandable (though I do think bad pathing should be fixed whereever possible), because in said groups, the damage done by a broken mez, or a lost pet is limited.  The mobs involved are of manageable difficulty (otherwise you wouldn't have a single group doing them).  Even at worst, with a total wipeout, you only have six deaths on your hands.<P>In raids, however, the difficulty with pets stays the same, but the risk is much greater.  The mobs hit much harder, are much tougher, and in some cases are in greater numbers.  Effective crowd control can be critical, and it's not hard to see where a pet could screw that up.  Even worse, if the pet gets lost...the resulting train will not be pleasant.  And if there's a wipeout, that's not six people, that's 12, 18, 24+...and a whole lot of downtime for the raid -- not fun.<P>Consider that many raids already have a good number of melees present, and it's not hard to see why pets aren't allowed at many of them.  Hence, the request for better pet pathing and better tools to control them.<P>Many suggestions for the latter have popped up in mage and necro threads (as pets are a significant issue for both classes), such as /pet noattack (pet will not aggro), /pet nochange (pet will not change targets), etc.  Some other alternatives:<P>- Spell: Control Death -- makes a pet ignore attackers, and prevents it from switching targets.  This would slow the pet's attacks by say, 15%, however, so it would only be of significant use when pet control is important.<P>- Temporary pets -- ones that attack a mob once summoned, and suicide once it's dead.  Not a perfect solution, but this prevents issues with a pet being prematurely aggroed by a pull (since it doesn't exist until the owner is ready to attack).<P>I also agree that the suggested mage spells -- the anti-fear buff, and the summon pet, should be given to necros as well, as pet issues, again, affect us to a significant degree as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR<P>One thing you seem to miss but which was mentioned by many of my fellows: <P>The Darkness line at high levels should be looked at. Most necros (including me) still use the low level darkness spells (dooming darkness) because of their lower casting time mainly. <P>Darkness is one of our defining spell lines - I think you should think about it when the "upgrade" to such a defining line is not considered as upgrades by the player base and therefore not used. <P>Again why is this requested? Each class should be happy to get stronger versions of their defining spells - This isn't the case with the necro darkness line. Why ? <BR>a) In case the necro solos he needs to slow the mob "fast" - therefore he uses the dark spell with lower casting time. <BR>b) In case the necro groups, there are many classes outside which have "slow" spells with lower resist rates. In case one ot them is in group theirs will be used. In case it's the necros job to do the slowing the group will expect him to keep the mob slowed - again long casting time is contraproductive to this goal and so a lower level spell will be used. <P>2 suggestions: <BR>a) Reduce the casting time <BR>b) AND / OR increase the duration the spell needs to do its damage (keeping the mob slowed longer).  <P>IMHO it's ok to leave the mana costs and the resistance rate. <P>Noscuula<BR>  Level 50 necro on Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
