Look at it rationally, please, Abashi, if you have to get 10 items for example, each of which spawns once an hour or whatever, then you have 10 folks who are all travelling and actually doing something.<P>I've said it before, and I will say it again.

</FONT><HR>Ok lets make the camp 30 hours. What will happen?<P>You will have team farmers. Farmers that take turns watching a spawn, using the same account or saying they are in line for the spawn.<P>Oh you cant camp who ever is there has a crack at the spawn? No ways, to say that people will just pass by a spawn to see if it is spawning is crazy. That is like saying i will pass by a ride at disney land to see if there is no line. If there is no line i will ride the ride. If a person wants something they will wait for it; people go to disney land to ride the rides. Maybe they can't or won't wait the duration it takes for the spawn (or ride all the rides) but they wont just happen to pass by a spawn (or go to disney land). Although i respect you and a lot of your ideas, i just don't think that your idea has been well thought out, in this case. According to the PLAY NICE RULES a person must make an effort to share or work out who gets what at a spawn BEFORE any action occurs. It makes sense that the person who got there first should get first pick at the spawn. Please don't say that everyone can attack anything with out trying to communicate with each other; where is the work together spirit of the game if it is everyman for himself and not lets all work together and solve a problem with out pissing each other off.<P>Thank you,<BR>A customer getting tired of double speak</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>//If something only dropped once every 30 <BR>//hours or so if camped constantly, who <BR>//would camp it? What if it was 70 hours? <BR>// --Abashi<P>Coding any 'hard' timer on a spawn, whether quest or loot dropping, is a baaad idea. Here's the reality if the spawn is 70 hours:<P>Uberguild A finds spawn kills it. Uberguild then sets members to sit and time the respawn. 70 hours (and many shift changes) later, up pops a_lewt_dropper. Uberguild notes the time. 70 hour spawn. Uberguild kills mob, someone is put in charge of 'the timer', and 69½ hours later, Uberguild shows up in force with it's 'lewt taskforce' (wizards). Reset timer. /scenario<P>This is done with 8 hour spawns, what would be any different about it with longer timers? I will tell you what. Less people will ever see this spawn, since it exists in the world for all of 30 seconds (or less) every 70 hours.<P>The only anti camp solution for 'named' mobs is to have the spawn timer set to a wide random variable, say 30 hours to 100 hours. So you have your 30 hour 'anti-camp' threshold, but you defeat the 'timer' types as well. It would also delightfully confuse Uberguilds and their monopolistic ways.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually, there are already items in the game that do spawn every 30 hours or more.  And they are STILL camped.  Even if a person can't wait the full 30, 50, or 100 hours it takes, they're going to show up and sit on their rear for 12 or however long they can manage until they have to go or pass out at the keyboard.  And as others have said before, this favors the Farmers and the Uberguilds who have a much easier time camping a spawn for huge amounts of time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have a suggestion.<BR>Why not makes quests a compromise between the two techniques?<BR>A. you must go to a specific NPC and get an item, but this NPC spawns relatively frequently, say less than an hour, or every 5 minutes even. This npc informs you that you must also go kill in area X to get the second item that is related to his item. (say he gives you a blade and says you must go kill goblins in area X to get the handle for the blade).<BR>B. You then must go to area X and kill goblins which randomly drop the second part of the object (eg. the handle).<BR>This way you maintain the "Story" aspect but eliminate/reduce camping. You can still have mulitstep quests but each item in the quest has two parts - one from static npc & one from random mob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's clear to me that the vast majority of people hate camping and that it is probably the single most frustrating and game discouraging aspect of the game.<BR>Despite Abashi's reasoning that you aren't forced to camp, essentially you are. To complete the vast majority of quests you are forced to camp NPC's. Not just make it into the dungeon and kill them once, but to sit there for hour after hour killing the spawns to complete the quest. <BR>The other major flaw in Abashi's reasoning is that people camp for items because of the prestige effect. This is ridiculous, prestige weighs very very lightly compared to the necessity of improving your characters stats so that you can be an effective group member. I could care less if people know I have jboots, a shiny metallic robe and glowing black stone. I didn't get them for the  prestige I got them because I need the stats to be fully effective at my level.<BR>If prestige was a bigger thing with people you would see more people wearing rare but poorly stated items, but you hardly ever see that. People wear items that improve their stats, not what's rare. By and large people camp for items to improve their stats, not to get some prestige item. Please stop fostering the false concept that people prefer prestige over stats.<P>Although Verant's official line is that they don't want to ruin the prestige of items and so are willing to sacrifice their players game enjoyment for it, I think the real reason is that rare spawns and camping is an effective way to extend a limited amount of game content into as many hours of player time as possible. Remember the business goal of verant is not to make the player happy but to keep the player playing for as long as possible. Game content costs a great deal of money so it's only good business sense to stretch it to the limit of the players patience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see better quests, hence the name Everquest. I find that the game is full of useless quests, or quests that are so camped for the required components that is useless to do them.<P>If there is a EQ2 in the future of Verant I hope that they make it more flexible that the current version, where nothing can be changed to accomodate the players, but things can be nerfed. I like that game, but I find myself mostly killing mobs instead of doing quests that give worthwhile rewards.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I agree with the implementation of random loot tables for all dungeons, but I also agree that's a bit off the topic at hand.<P>As for the "long" camp times for some quest items being implemented simply to cut the number of those items being farmed, here's my suggestion (and I think this will appease the casual gamer and the power-goobers):<BR>    1)  Now, you currently have certain quest NPCs tied to certain factions to eliminate "farming" of quest items.  Why not make it somewhat like the guild trainers in that if the quest is for a specific class(es) make it so someone who tries to do the quest just for the sake of getting cash gets a message (like for the lambent armor quests) "You are not a member of the Bard class!  Be gone!"<BR>    2)  Make ALL quest items no-drop.  I don't see why this would be a problem, as most of the new items in Kunark are no-drop.  Once again, this stops the agricultural expeditions most often involved with these quests.<P>With those 2 simple changes, there is no reason why you can't cut the spawn time down on some quests (allowing casual and power-goobers alike to complete them) and still have a balancing effect on the economy.  Hell, there's plenty of "campable" items out there for the money-hungry power-goobers to scrounge up, so why can't we just make quest items that much more special to the classes they're intended for.<P>Just my 2cp.<P>Yinnyien Majere &lt;Ytrilynth's Hoarde&gt;<BR>Enchanter of the 35th circle<BR>E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You people at Verant seem to equate the cost of a virtual item to equal the time a real person has to spend in your virtual world. This thinking is flawed. A character should be able to go to a dungeon and complete a quest without waiting in line or some stupid 3/7/24/72 hour spawn. If hte character is big enough or tough enough to kill the monster he should get the reward.<P><BR>Oh BTW, Using a time limit to make items rare is the easy way out. Making quests that are dynamic and difficult to accomplish should be the way to implement quests. Every time I hear about a super long spawn rate I just realize how little vision is realy in the "Vision".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let's just say that people have come up with 10 to 15 different ways to alleviate the pain of certain camps.  We already know that what Abashi said is full of hot air meant to inflate his/Verant's ego.<P>I have an idea as well.  Instead of making it longer or shorter time or spreading the spawns that drop the item, eliminate the item, and make the quests more complex.  In other words, more items are necessary from many different places where you complete part of the quest, and go back for more.  Make it several phases.  Put the items on various mobs that drop more frequently and are random.  This will actaully have people questing, going out and doing things, instead of sitting at one spot hoping to encounter the mob only after making sure it is their turn.<P>Verant is wrong and Abashi is trying to manipulate you into thinking he and Verant are all wise and knowing.  This isn't true.  Keep up the faith and let them know they are wrong in no uncertain terms.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR># Abashi:  I wasn't talking about raising something from 4 to 12, as 12 is still within many people's camping range. I'm thinking more like 30. If something only dropped once every 30 hours or so if camped constantly, who would camp it? What if it was 70 hours? #<P>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!  BY ALL THAT'S HOLY, NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!<P>I swear on my mother's life that if you folks ever actually start implementing "solutions" this shortsighted and sadistic, I will cancel my two accounts in a heartbeat.  Life's too short to suffer at the whims of game designers who think the way to "fix" painful game features is to make them FAR MORE PAINFUL.<P>PLEASE try to think these things through better before you make such suggestions.  At least two other posters called this idea "insane", and I have to concede that they may have a point.<P>You ask "what if it was 70 hours"?  Here's your answer:  It would up the reward for the uberguilds who have the resources to STILL obtain the item (thus INREASING their incentive to camp the spawn), and at the same time it would be a slap in the face (nay, a kick in the groin) to those of us who would like a game that can actually be PLAYED and ENJOYED without worthwhile quests becoming an exercise in self-torture, tedium, and frustration.<P>Others have addressed very well the fallacies involved in the "make it longer and it'll reduce camping" belief.  Please read them, and pay attention.  Please.<P>Try to make it beyond someone's "camping range", and you'll fail, but you'll put it WELL beyond anyone's "playing by the Vision range".  It'll no longer be a quest that can be "done" by anyone who doesn't become a camping machine -- at best, it'll be a "lightning striking" rare random event on par with finding a winning lottery ticket laying on the ground in your front yard.  That may be exciting for the lone winner, but it's an empty, frustrating dream for everyone else.<P>Nor would we be happy to have it suggested that "all you have to do is check your front yard every once in a while and see if one of the winning tickets has fallen there..."<P>Here's a novel idea -- what's wrong with DECREASING the spawn time and INCREASING the drop rates of desired quest items?  Fine, so the item will "enter the economy" at a faster rate than it does currently.  So?  More happy, satisfied customers -- this is a bad thing?<P>And no, I'm not suggesting making JBoot quest items drop so frequently that every level 5 character has a set, but what would be wrong with most level 35 characters managing to score a set, if they wanted them?  Given the usefulness of the boots, I can guarantee that the loss of the occassional "I've got 'em and you don't" feeling will be slight compared to the scads of new boot owners going, "woo hoo, I can actually travel at a reasonable speed now instead of begging for SoWs like a newbie!"  And I think the druids/shamans would appreciate the relief.<P>Making desired items more REASONABLE (not easy, but reasonable) to obtain will increase overall game satisfaction, all but eliminate ubercamping (not to mention eliminate the "I sat for 12 hours and all I got was this lousy butt sore" frustration), and STILL leave people time to do the other 5,000 quests and fun things there are to do in the game (presuming the other quests get fixed to be worth doing -- and practical -- at the same time).<P>There are so many quests in the game that removing the chokehold bottlenecks in the more desirable ones will still leave players with more than enough to fill their time.  Indeed, they'll still find the game has more than enough to keep them busy for years.<P>So why, oh why, are most quests actually worth finishing seemingly designed to be DAMNED frustrating and tedious to do?  Giving a handful of players a "sense of accomplishment" is hardly justification for making many of the rest feel cheated, used, and bitter over the way the quest is currently set up.  Hard is good.  Mind-numbing is not.<P>If you want "quest" rewards to be just lightning-strike manna from heaven items, then just have them appear randomly on the ground and be done with it -- stop making them part of an alleged "quest" if you're going to make it impossible to get them without being insanely fortunate enough to trip over the quest NPC at a time when it's not already camped.<P>If you truly believe in quests, however, and this is EverQUEST, then make them doable by any player dedicated enough to devote his resources to the task.  And that does NOT mean making him rely on a lucky roll of a random number generator that's heavily weighted against him...  Any quest should be achievable by a player working hard enough at it.  Sheer dumb luck should NOT be a necessary ingredient -- if it is, it's no longer a "quest", no matter what you may call it.  "I did something hard" is a good feeling after a quest.  "I did something tiresome, dreary, frustrating, and in the end my number just happened to come up" is not.<P>I've done a number of quests, and the WORST, most hair-pulling aspect of any of them has been the "now sit and wait for a rare, long-spawn NPC...", which is a NECESSARY part of so many quests.  This is not fun.  Period.  There is no redeeming quality to this sort of quest requirement.  I'd rather try to kill something ultra hard, or kill everything in a dungeon hoping for a rare drop, or have to gather 20 things from all over Norrath, or something similar -- at least I'd be DOING something.<P>NOR is there anything fun about deciding to not waste my time on a "sit and wait" quest and doing without.  Both options are frustrating, and generate ill-will towards the people who set things up so poorly to start with.<P>You say that camping is not an intended part of questing, and/or that people don't "have" to camp in order to complete a quest.  I'm sorry, but you're mistaken, as many people here have ably pointed out.  Right now, for quests that require something from rare/long-spawn NPCs, the only practical choices are:  1.  Camp (painfully), or 2. Forgo the quest.<P>Long-spawn NPC quests may have seemed like a good idea, but they simply have not worked out the way you originally had hoped.  Making them LONGER will only make the problem worse, not better.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi-<P>I’d like to start by saying I appreciate the work you’ve put into EQ and all of the abuse and criticism you’ve had to put up with. You have my sympathy and support. However, I sometimes wonder if we play the same game. I enjoy EQ a lot, and I’ve appreciated thoughtfulness that Verant has put into it, but there are aspects to it that I really can’t believe anyone who has actually played on a live server for any length of time would leave in, much less defend.  Camping falls into this category. Some of your comments earlier struck me as being so divorced from the reality of how the game is played, that I can’t help but wonder.  While the idea of rare spawns and quests to serve as a challenge and game mechanics limit to the proliferation of items is an understandable one, the way the game is played in practice, it just doesn’t work out that way.<P>You state that people don't "have" to camp.  Don't be absurd.  Have you, Abashi, ever camped?  I'd bet so. Have you ever seen a high level character wearing only equipment that can be obtained from casual kills?  I think not, I certainly haven't in nearly a year playing the game.  And yet somehow you have this idea that including an aspect to the game that REQUIRES people to spend tremendous stretches of time doing nothing to get even vaguely decent items - we're not talking about the best of the best, here, we’re talking about almost ANY item of more than the most common and  basic attributes.<P>Look, we understand that you don't want to make every item universally available. That's fine, and we can understand and agree with that - fun comes out of overcoming a challenge, after all! As you have pointed out, if there were no challenge to getting good equipment, the game gets boring and tedious. But there is no challenge in spending 10 hours camping an ancient cyclops - except perhaps the challenge of taking it down before you get KS'ed by the crowds of other campers.  In fact, it makes the game…boring and tedious.  Exactly what you are trying to avoid.  You’ve merely replaced the tedium of being able to walk over any challenge with the tedium of leaving your computer on and burning your eyeballs out waiting for the rare mob that drops the mildly powerful item or quest component you need to spawn, doing nothing lest you lose the spawn.<P>This is yet another aspect of the game that penalizes the much-maligned "casual" gamer - as if spending 2 or 3 hours an evening doing any other activity, several times a week, would be described as "casual."  Those of us with jobs, spouses, children, and other demands on us like to play EQ as a relaxation, and yet things like questing deny us this..  Where's the fun in this, Abashi?  DO YOU enjoy doing this?  I thought not.  Why not take any of the very logical suggestions that have been posted on this board and make it so that getting a quest item or rare item is a FUN challenge to be OVERCOME, not a long boring wait whose only challenge is in remembering to look at the screen every so often.  It may shock you, but almost all "rare" items are camped not by players of "appropriate" level, but much higher.  When was the last time you say a mid 30's level camping the ancient croc in Upper Guk?  No, 45+ levels camp it to get gatorscale to sell to raise money to buy the items they don't have the time to camp themselves – the ones that do have 30 hour spawns.  It’s a same simple logic “well, I don’t have time to do a 12 hour camp, but I can do a 2 hour one, and if I do it 10 times, I can probably afford that 12 hour camp item”.  It cascades down, until even those most pedestrian of items are camped 24/7 on crowded servers.<P>On the other hand...in my mid teen levels, with a good, tough, and well organized group, we went to Upper Guk and broke and held the squire room, along with a number of additional spawns.  And yes, we got a couple runed bone forks, as a reward for the challenge, organization, and yes, a few deaths involved in doing something tough and a real stretch for our level.  And then a level 45 druid came in and camped the room for a day.  Result:  he got the same thing we did, but for no challenge, no fun.  And WE couldn't have the same challenge and fun, because he was camping it. This is the absolute worst solution to the problem if item proliferation that is possible.  Getting a rare item should be a challenge, it should be fun, it should be exciting, it shouldn’t be just having your name finally come up on the camp list.<P>To conclude this admittedly longwinded post, I’d like to offer up a challenge to Verant, and to you, Abashi, personally.  They say you play a number of characters regularly in the game.  Well, I challenge you to start up a new one, in a grouping class (not a necro or druid!) and play it on up without ever playing it for more than 2 hours at a stretch.  Ever.  This replicates the experience that many of us face playing EQ.  And no camping.  And no joining a guild.  And no doing any of the other things you keep telling us are “optional” aspects of the game.  And see if in a few months you still enjoy playing that character. Don’t ruin a great game with “solutions” that fail to solve the problem (item proliferation) and just reward boredom.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>We all know that the best items in the game come from camping and not random hunting or exploring; however, there is one subtle point that everyone is not quite getting:  <P>Players are not required to camp; however, they are STRONGLY MOTIVATED to camp.<P>This approach sends a mixed signal.  It is analogous to your boss saying "you don't have to work overtime, but if you don't, you will not advance as fast as others the choose to work overtime."  Most people would not think kindly of their boss if he or she managed people using this approach. <P>Under the current framework, players are rewarded with the best items the game has to offer when they stay in the same spot for extended periods. I can think of alternative methods of acquiring items that would not require camping; however, they do not fit within the current software framework.  For example, make the best items in the game quest-only where the quest requires NO DROP items that are at an appropriate drop rate on several MOBs all over Norrath.  With an appropriate drop rate, players could hunt and explore to get the best items.<P>I truly believe that the best items and loot in EverQuest should come from Questing and not camping. I don't think camping was a bad first attempt at all.  However, after implementation, it appears to reward players for staying in one spot for days or weeks at a time.<P>One approach Verant can do is acknowledge that the current product encourages camping and look for ideas to change it in EverQuest or another product (perhaps EQII).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you want to restrict how often Item X enters the world, it's easy to do without excessive camping:  <P>Just put a timer on the "here's your quest" NPC, or make the FIRST required creature have a spawn time.  If the quest can only be STARTED X number of times a day, and you are required to start it to finish it (make a component the first creature/npc gives vital to completing the quest) you can reduce the frustration.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I just know if the camp time is raised on items some will still be camped (the glowing black stone is). I also know the most it will achieve is a bunch of frustrated and POed players. This would be a case of the vision going out of control.<P>Me, I would like to see more random drops. Less camps. Right now the choice is camp or do without. Why? Because if you don't camp someone else will and you won't come upon it at random most likely.<P>Me, I support some items becoming more common, including the GBS (which I have one). If they become somewhat less valuable? At least you'll have more options of customizing your character. But maybe that is not in the vision. EQ doesn't seem to support a sense of style unless you are willing to sacrifice half your life for it. And you seem to want people to be more generic?

</FONT><HR>Wow!  Gordon's comments opened my eyes.  I've seen comments by people that Gordon doesn't really play EQ with real people and now I see that.<P>I HATE camping.  I did the luck thing like Gordan suggested... until I wanted to do a quest.  I wanted to do the Wizard Acumen Quest.  <P>First component I got was from the Goblin Headmaster.  No problem.  I had to kill him twice. But that was OK.  <P>Next component was from the Scryer in Guk.  WELL!  I went through there many times over three days, relying on good old luck.  Guess what.  The Scryer is camped almost 24x7!  So, to complete the quest I started I had to camp him.  The next time I went in, I asked the current camper how long they'd be and if there was someone else waiting.  Once I got the camp, I sat there and killed the stupid spawn once every 18 minutes til I was bored silly and logged off.  Next day I did the same.  Next day I did the same.  Finally, on the forth day, the person who had the camp already let me loot the glowing mask (they were after the shimmering orb) and I was out of there!<P>Now, if I ever build up enough patience again I need to go camp a few more semi-rare spawns.

</FONT><HR>Umm sorry Abashi the reason I want an exotic car is because usually they're hand made with extreme car using only the best components which equals quality. If exotic cars became commonplace chevy and ford would go out of business because everyone would see the wonders of a well built machine. However you do COLLECT cars based on their rarity like a duesenburg with that one of a kind hand tucked and rolled ostrich skin interior.<P>In eq I don't collect things based on rarity I get them cause they do something to make my toon better. Your philosphy is basically encouraging the keep up with the jones mentality. You're always talking about prestige associated with certain items which to me is kind of silly. To me that means you're telling me I actually care what people , whom I've never evern seen , think of my toon and the items he's wearing??? It's a game and I want to play it, I don't want to have to worry about primping for a dungeon crawl.<P>ps you could always have quests that start with an NPC saying "those durn orcs in S RO are passing my trinket around to each other and using for their evil ends. I implor you .. go stop them and return my trinket." then the trinket can be a randomly timed drop of a random orc in S Ro. <P>Or even crazier "My trinket was taken by a dragon to a distant land and I need it back. I'll reward you with this leet loot if you return my trinket."<BR>Mornelithe says "Which dragon?"<BR>NPC ditzy says"My oh my I have no idea. They actually have names? I never would have guessed. Well, I guess you'll have to kill them all. Good luck. Now GET OUT!!!"<BR>So now a person has to go kill all the dragons in kunark to get a rare drop off a random dragon for his leet loot.<P>You guys can alter quests a little if you get away from this prestige thing and thinking about how everone really just cares about their toon and their toons performance and no whether x item makes them cooler than all the other electrons on the screen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Amusing that some lessons are never learned...<P>Magic: The Gathering (trademarked by Wizards of the Coast, just so they don't get grouchy for the mention) made the same mistake: "It's okay for rare cards to be powerful, they'll be rare".<P>Bzzzt. Wrong. People will do whatever is necessary to get the "best/most powerful/etc" items/cards/whatever.  All "rare" does it create friction over access to the items that everyone feels they "must have" in order to keep up with the Joneses.<P>Personally, I think the 20-part quest idea makes a hell of a lot more sense. And if it takes a powergame one 18 hour session to complete and a casual person 18 one-hour sessions, who cares? They both get a shot at it, and folks are happier. People will do what it takes to get the items anyway. No sense in pissing people off in the process.<P>My suggestion to the Verant folks: Implement a few of these 20 one-hour step quests, and see how it goes. Add lots of travel, components in Kunark, OoT, Kerra Isle, Permafrost, etc (places you can't quickly get to via teleport  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Create quest "trees", where there are 5 steps to the main quest, but each of those requires 2-4 sub-steps, each of which require a handful of obscure items. <P>There's nothing wrong with an Epic quest, and you can still keep the storylines.  Just requires a bit more work than having the quest require 3 items with 20-100 hour camps each. <P>A good friend of mine plays a monk, and just about quit EQ over the Robe of the Lost Circle quest. And this is a guy who completed the treant fist quest.  Food for thought.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I normally do not post to the boards as I am one of those "casual" gamers. I have no 50+ characters and if you checked I probably have less than 100 days play time spread on all of my characters since sometime in May last year.  Now for the rest of you who are still here and have not turned away with the word "Noob" on your lips. This is in response to a reply from Gordon to a posting on this topic saying that the casual gamer need not camp for 7-10 hours they could simply rely on the element of chance for the creature to be there.  Just so that I am not accused of misquoting here is a copy of a portion of the reply :<P>You aren't required to "sit and wait" for the NPC. You are only required to be there when the NPC spawns. That can happen at any time, and you could choose to leave and come back later to try and complete the quest. <BR>ENDCOPY<P>I find myself in a strange situation so let me explain the assumptions I am operating on.<P>1) The spawn drops an item or component for a quest that would be desirable for many people to own<BR>2)I live in the continental United States and either work or go to school and so restrict my playing time between 4PM EST - 12AM PST Monday through Friday and Weekends. (high server load times) and that I'll only spend 20-40 hours a week spread over the course of a few days<BR>3)That there isn't a lvl 56 Person camping the item to hand off to his lvl 6 warrior. And that I will have a reasonable chance of inflicting comperable damge to someone my lvl attacking a creature appropriate to my lvl.<BR>4)That I do not plan on spending the 4-5 hours I may be on in one evening looking for some place that isn't camped.<P>This leaves me with a limited number of options.  The one that I belive that I and most casual gamers use is to camp/logout near the place or person that has the spawn or the item.  This allows us to check if the spawn is up when we log in and if not go on with our evening of play, or if we really want the item, to swap characters and play with an alt for the evening and maybe pop back in quickly just before we quit for the night to see if the spawn is up.  (please keep in mind the limited number of places where the risk of doing this is less than suicidal is rather limited).  Wow congrats my number came up the rare spawn is in now he is mine, but wait over in the corner a character sitting, while hunched over the keyboards a thousand miles away with discarded cans of coke around them another person cheers, having just missed the last spawn on a 14 hour cycle they have been waiting in this one spot for 27 hours for this same spawn.  Lighting bolts flash and axes swing.  Shazam by the power of the random number generator and the power of my spells the kill is mine.  Finally glad that I can stop "camping" the same spot I have been "camping" 10-15 minutes at time for the last 30 days I ready myself to continue with my 3-4 hours of gameplay remaining to me for the evening.  Surprisingly the guy from the corner is calling me foul names and petitions a GM accusing me of kill stealing and stealing his camp. So whose spawn is it? The warrior who had to run 10 feet before he could swing, the caster who started a 4 tic spell, the 10pt damage quick casting spell to start the monster moving toward you, or the taunt of the 122pt critical hit on the first swing that took longer to land?  The GM arrives checks the log Hmm the man in the corner has been here for hours you just arrived.  What?!? you say I have violated the play nice rules we should take turns and I should give the item to the man in the corner and take my turn?  I get a warning, my account may be suspended if I continue my actions? Frustrated and sick I camp for the night, knowing that tomorrow is a weekend.  I log in in the morning and my Karma must be good the spawn pops just as I log in, but wait there in the corner someone else sits all bright eyed and bushy tailed they have only been there for 6 hours and imagine their luck the spawn is here.  Fur flys and the dust settles wow my good fortune I get credit for the kill.  Another cry of anguish another GM another warning or perhaps a suspension because I have a history of violating the play nice rule. My question is this if my account is suspended do I get a Hammer of Flattening so that I may drive Gordon into the ground like a post to relieve my frustrations?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Umm sorry Abashi the reason I want an exotic car is because usually they're hand made with extreme car using only the best components which equals quality. If exotic cars became commonplace chevy and ford would go out of business because everyone would see the wonders of a well built machine. However you do COLLECT cars based on their rarity like a duesenburg with that one of a kind hand tucked and rolled ostrich skin interior.<P>In eq I don't collect things based on rarity I get them cause they do something to make my toon better. Your philosphy is basically encouraging the keep up with the jones mentality. You're always talking about prestige associated with certain items which to me is kind of silly. To me that means you're telling me I actually care what people , whom I've never evern seen , think of my toon and the items he's wearing??? It's a game and I want to play it, I don't want to have to worry about primping for a dungeon crawl.<P>ps you could always have quests that start with an NPC saying "those durn orcs in S RO are passing my trinket around to each other and using for their evil ends. I implor you .. go stop them and return my trinket." then the trinket can be a randomly timed drop of a random orc in S Ro. <P>Or even crazier "My trinket was taken by a dragon to a distant land and I need it back. I'll reward you with this leet loot if you return my trinket."<BR>Mornelithe says "Which dragon?"<BR>NPC ditzy says"My oh my I have no idea. They actually have names? I never would have guessed. Well, I guess you'll have to kill them all. Good luck. Now GET OUT!!!"<BR>So now a person has to go kill all the dragons in kunark to get a rare drop off a random dragon for his leet loot.<P>You guys can alter quests a little if you get away from this prestige thing and thinking about how everone really just cares about their toon and their toons performance and no whether x item makes them cooler than all the other electrons on the screen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Sure, some players are interested in the "prestige" taht comes from kewl l00t. I like to do a little RPing and I waste bat wings on levitate just to impress newbies. But I certainly am not going to camp an item for 10 hours or more to get something for the "prestige" of it! <P>There's no "wow" factor in owning most of this stuff anymore (as there proabably once was) for two reasons: <P>1) You can buy them off ebay, which takes no in-gaem effort<P>2) Most of the people who would be really impressed by the item don't have a clue how much is involved in the quest to get it.<P>That being the case, people want these rare items for one of four reasons:<P>1) Because they rock and people want cool stuff for their characters so they can kill ever bigger and tougher MoBs.<P>2) To sell for plat in-game, or real money on ebay<P>3) To twink someone, possibly themselves.<P>4) For their guildmates.<P>According to *the vision* I expect only options 1 and 2 are acceptable reasons to want these items. But these at most make up half the campers' motives. <P>Verant needs to wake up to the realities of the game, because we may be living in their world, but they are apparently living in some completely different solar system if they think gamer's motives are always going to fit Verant's hopes and desires.<P>---<P>PS- If this message appears more than once, blame it on The Stations lousy overloaded servers that keep timing out as I post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ahh Verant.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Gordon, I usually totally agree with you, I think 90% of the things posted here are people whining and being rediculous, but in this topic, I think Verant is completely wrong.<P>Camping is dumb.  Period.  Having an item from a camp is worthless, there is no prestige to having it, there is nothing.  People seeing you with a Testament of Vaneer is meaningless.  Why?  Because there are 50 level 1 characters on every server with one.  Why?  Because of camping (or Farming to be specific.)<P>Do you realize that 2 guilds on Fennin are already being commonly referred to as Sacred Farmer and Council of Farmers?  Why?  Because they camp, and do nothing but camp, constantly.  Level 50's camping level 30 spawns.  Why?  Because no one can out damage them, they can't die, and thus since they own the spawn, they own the cost of the item the spawn drops.  Simple RPG math my friend.  If I camp Gabby for 3 straight weeks and have 8 cloaks and I keep camping gabby, guess how much I can raise the price of those cloaks, even if I don't need the cloak.<P>This problem, (and believe me, it is a HUGE problem) is VERY easily fixable without changing any code other than data.<P>If something is a 'special' item (Meaning it's something worth camping) it needs to be Lore - No Drop.  <P>What does this do?  It makes items MEAN something again.  Nothing is more annoying than FINALLY getting to level 40 and getting a cool item and having a level 1 run past you with the item.  Maybe it's meaningful to me that I quested it, but there is no prestige in having ANYTHING in this game anymore.<P>Lore No Dropping the best items will COMPLETELY stop camping.  Yes, it will impact a SEVERLY CRIPPLED economy that is completely a joke right now anyway.  A level 50 that I know camped Gabby for 3 days and got well over 15,000pp.  That is not an economy.  That is not a game.<P>Please listen to the hundreds of people who are tired of waiting in line, LITERALLY waiting in line with 4 other groups to kill something that spawns once every 7 days and a MAJORITY of the time you are waiting with groups of people camping a spawn strictly to sell the item and have no use for it at all.<P>I know this ONE single issue has me playing Asherons Call a majority of my time and if it was fixed, I would play EQ more.  Please listen to what everyone is saying, this is the ONE issue that keeps EverQuest from being a great game.<P>Until this issue is resolved, I will continue to call it EverChat and I'll continue to watch Sacred Farmer and Coucil of Famers camp all the things I wish I could have, and maybe with the copper and silver loot the mobs drop I can save up my 3000pp to buy a single Molten Cloak off of one of the farming guilds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
