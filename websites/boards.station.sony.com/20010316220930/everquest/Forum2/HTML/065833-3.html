</FONT><HR>Alan, the problem with those encounters that Eduin and other mention - is that Verant goes out of it's way to make it difficult organize with other guilds and people to do such an event.<P>1.  There is no way to link multiple groups for exp.  Many, Many times - the largest damage dealing groups will get exp while the other groups just expend mana and hps.<P>2.  Lets say you get 6 groups together for a raid - because you have to.  Everyone is from a different guild.  The people that organize the raid are usually after a specific item..for ONE specific person.   What reason, other than fighting in a new zone,  would encourage people want to do something like this, in zones where death happens often, and experience gain may never occur ?  <P>3.  Communication on a large raid get's very tough if they people arent' linked somehow.  Most UBER guilds use guildchat while doing a raid.  How well do you think things are communicated to those not in the guild ?  Or, when they are,  it's often late or incomplete information.  No one likes repeating something that's already been said.<P>I agree with Eduin (ugh, did I say that?), 99% of the players will never see VP or similar zones.  Is that really Verant's goal ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>--"As Eduin (much as I have disagreed with him in the past) has repeatedly pointed out, the majority of the customer base simply do not have the time available to play 16 hour sessions. The game should be tailored to the majority of the customer base, not some arrogant elitist little minority."--<P>Somewhat harshly put, but Im generally in agreement. I have cut my play down to less than 4 hours a week now from what was 4 hours a day. When I realised I was playing close to 30 hours a week on a game AND STILL NOT GETTING ANYWHERE I finally realised there was a problem  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4 hours a week is casual gaming, 4 hours a day including weekends is getting close to a career. This game actively penalises anyone who cant spend at least 4 or 5 hours minimum in a single stretch once you get the the high levels. Even my work gives me 10 minutes break every hour  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Actually if I worked the way I played id pretty much be doing the following:<P>1) Announcing to the room that im unable to sit any longer without peeing my pants.<BR>2) Wait for them all to say AYE.<BR>3) Sprint at full pelt through the office, down the corridor, leap the stairs, kick the door down, throw my coffee cup under the machine and press the "espresso" button WITHOUT actually slowing down.<BR>4) Destroy the toilet door, tear a hole in my trousers, strain every muscle in my body trying to force 5 liters of liquid through a small hole at the speed of sound.<BR>5) Scald my hands in the sink for 0.5 seconds hoping the searing heat would kill germs rather than prolonged cleaning.<BR>6) Re break whatever remained of the toilet door.<BR>7) Run out, snatch the coffee cup up (probably before the water was actually even finished puring).<BR>8) Break the land speed record back to my seat and after being gone only 60 seconds id be asking "You all still alive??"<P><BR>EQ: Game or Special Force training?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK Maybe your right...about the percentage of Uber Zones in the game... But the Problem still remains, that there are Uber-Mobs (namely Boss ones) in most zones, and those are the Mobs that have 'OUR' Level 60 Spells etc... <P>If the Boss Mobs in the non Uber Zones were toned down a little, then we'd be happy... We've admitted that we ain't hard enough to handle your Uber Zones... Zone why do you think we can Handle an Uber Mob in a non Uber zone?  After all... a mob is a mob, we take them one at the time... there is no decrease in difficulty taking down a mob be it in Kael or in the sleepers tomb, only the difficulty in getting there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant lost control of this game when they allowed the increase of the level cap to 60. They had no clue how to balance the game at those levels (and still don't I might add). The whole level 50+ game is ill-conceived and equally poorly executed. Why do you think most of us never play characters past level 50? Because past 50 the game is less fun by a factor of 10. Drop the level limit back to 50 adn remove all high level dungeons from the game. Just make it an outdoor game so us Druids can quad kite.

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>The concern is not that I will never see content that requires and "uber'-raid. I never will, and I still like EQ and am ok with that. The problem is that those of us that arn't obsessed with this game and will never be in a position to do "uber" encounters are seeing alot of development effort being put into the highest end of the game while very little has been added to the part of the game the non-uber player is limited to (admittedly by our own choice of playstyle.) <P>The Warrens is the biggest thing to happen below level 35 since the Kunark lowlevel zones(which are borderline inaccessable to all but iksar, without higherlevel help.) The warrens was promised I think a year ago. In that time a good number of uber-encounters and raid zones have been added to fill a void in content at the highlevels. As an eternaly lowlevel player and (I'm assuming here) an equally valued customer of Verant interactive, I would think that the uber-level game has enough content to last atleast a little while and I would like to see some new content and re-working of some old content in the lower level and non-uber game.<P>Almost everyone gets to use level 1-30 content I would suspect at the very most 40% of the players over EQ's entire lifespan (I think this is a very generous guesstimate, but thats all it is) will ever see one uber-encounter. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry, but I have to side with Alan on this one..and this is why.<P>What you guys are really upset about is two things:  <P>1:  Why aren't there more zones where I can sit and camp a single spawn or two and get large amounts of cash/items.<P>2:  Why can't me and my tiny group go in and consistantly get super uber items.  Why should it take a large guild to finish my epic, and farm high end items back to twinks.<P>Now maybe there's some of you that don't do that.  Congrats, you're a minority.  Honestly (and I'm just as guilty of this as anyone else), it's all about the items and the ease of playing.  Brad once told everyone (back in the early days of EQ before Kunark and Velious) that people will always take the path of least resistance.  This is still true to this day.  People still camp, people still farm, and even the big guilds will still only raid things that they are guaranteed to win.  There are some guilds that go beyond that and fight the unknown.  I not only applaud them, but I wish they were on my server and I was with them.<P>So you can't whine about catering to the high levels in the game.  Everyone and their brother has a level 50+ by now..and those that don't are probably being powerleveled anyways.  If you don't believe my point of view..ask anyone who started this game back in Beta phase 3, when a fine steel weapon and 20pp in your bank was uber, and dying cost you a ton more exp than it does now.  Look around you and see how many players are running around in twinked gear they shouldn't be able to see for ages.  I'm one of them.  But I also know I'm cheating myself, and I accept it.  I certainly won't whine about it, save to point out that there's plenty to do, plenty to see, and the whole point is to have fun.  If you need to find more people to have that fun, then do so.  The tools are here...use them.<P>Vamphyrie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to diagree with the assumption that only 3 or 4 zones are uber zones. It seems in velious all indoor zones are uber giuld zones. At least to be able to attepmt content deeper with in the zone. Sure I can hunt around the entrance to Velaktors lab or sky shrine but to go any deeper I need an uber force weather that be a guild or a team of giulds thats the way velious is. My only complaint is that VI shoulda made that known before i spent $20 on the expansion that is mostly off limits to me.

This makes Dragon necropolilis western wastes veeshans temple and POM all out of reach for me. I like to think that maybe there is another way to zone to westernwastes. I look at the wall map and see that thrugadin or great divide should have a zone to westernwastes as well or maybe velektors but then again i cant go there either well not past the entrance.<BR>Also i choose to side with the giants after all i worship ralos zek but that makes it so i will never be able to get any off the class armor. My class armor quest pieces drop in veeshans temple of uber raid mobs in an uber raid zone as far as i am concerned. <BR>Sleepers tomb is another zone I cant use.<BR>so let us count them up. <BR>VT, SG, POM, DN, WW, Sleepers all out of reach to me. And most likely plane of growth since the mobs take 30 or 40 people to kill.<BR>I am a pick up player and dont expect to do uber raids. I do get invites to fear and hate some times. but i would like to have seen more content in velious that I can use. Or at least a warning dont join with giants unless your in an uber guild cause you will never get your class armor not one piece.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LoL.  Sometimes you just gotta laugh.<P>As for not having the time or desire to join these "uber" raids, give me a break.  I for one am what is called a "casual gamer".  I only play a couple hours a day (if I'm lucky) and maybe MAYBE get to play a lot on the weekends (if the honey-do jar is empty).<P>I play a 51st level cleric.  I have been asked to go on *several* uber raids.  I have yet to go..why?  MY CHOICE.  I realize that these raids will require a lot more time than I can dedicate to the raid so I choose to bow out.  Now am I peeved that I didn't get a shot at some "uber" loot?  Heck no.  I made the conscious decision not to go.  Do I care that 13% of all areas are "uber only"?  Again, HECK NO!  I enjoy having FUN in this game (even with all the *changes* to the cleric class).<P>If you want to whine about not having anything to do because you don't want to dedicate the time to it, well go somewhere else.  UO is still looking for participants.  I really have no sympathy for complaining about a problem when the solution is within your grasp.  If you don't want to play more, don't play, BUT please do us all a favor and not complain about your decision.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But, again u have more important things to do than try to see a dragon, like try to get ur kid to see college.  So i guess what im saying is u shouldnt be what Eq is geared for.  U are not their target customer i dont think.  Second, just cause u dont think its possible doesnt mean it isnt.  My father started playing golf at 50 and now at 55 he's really good and he has a job that takes him away from life constantly.  Now if he had been playing EQ instead of golf, well maybe he could be lvl 60.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Eduin,<P>I think your expectations might be a bit unreasonable. By asking for a challenge, you mean an encounter that your 10-18 player raid can beat, but isn't possible with one group. The problem is, that's a fairly slim range; raise the average level of your 10-18 man group by one or two, give them slightly better equipment, and the two group encounter has become possible with a single group - the challenge has essentially disappeared for you. It would seem to me that your demographic could be even harder to please than the uberguilds. You'd be better served, I think, by posting good examples of encounters that you like rather than by making the developers guess at what a good encounter to challenge you is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have seen a couple of valid points/complaints in this discussion, which I hope Absor didn't miss:<P>First one: "My own feeling is the mis-con on the mobs is where most of the problems come in. The level 45 to 50 mobs(based on con), are often as difficult as level 55 mobs on Kunark because of damage output."<P>And this is also true going from the high level dungeons in the main game to Kunark.  While I can understand Verant's desire to retain the interest of it's player base by slowing down leveling in the expansion and upgrade, I think they did go a little bit overboard, here.  Yes, it's fun and challenging to kill something that's really hard to kill, but sometimes we just want to kick back and kill one mob that we can still get experience from, without being under great probability of death even with a full group.  I think the lack of opportunities for this in Kunark and Vellious add a certain amount of unneccessary extra stress to the game.  Couldn't there at least be some places where we can kill stuff we get experience from without constantly worrying that one wrong move (or one bug -- as is often the case) will bring about a 3 hour CR??  Maybe if the mobs weren't so jacked up, the bugs wouldn't be such a major source of frustration and annoyance.<P>And secondly: "Until Verant gets around to allowing a set of groups to share experience, ANYTHING over 6 people is a "raid" by my definition. I define a raid as: Expedition where you will lose more exp than you can possibly gain, and have little to no shot at anything worth your time."<P>Amen.  This is one of my biggest complaints about Everquest and one I hear the most from other players.  I wouldn't mind so much that you've designed so much of the game requiring 2 plus groups of people to handle, if you'd designed anything other than shout/ooc/guild chat into the game mechanics to support this type of gameplay.  I see no reason why experience can't be handled in the same way as faction:  if you damage the mob you get some.  Also, how hard would it be to put in some /multigroup (/mg) chat channel, where you can add people the same way you do to a guild for large, time consuming raids of multiple groups?  I realize the code wouldn't be the same since currently a GM has to make the guild leader of a guild and I'm not a programmer, so maybe this would be a lot harder to do than what it looks like to me, but I think it would really be worth the time if it's not too difficult to do.  It would certainly make the game a much BETTER one.<P>Sune Darkstar<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's the whole thing, sequential play. This game is improperly geared towards the people who want or can spend huge blocks of sequential time. There are guilds who have managed to place people camping Lodizal on 8 hour shifts, 24/7. Getting "uber equipment" doesn't only take a huge investment of time, it requires you to have that huge amount of time in large, sequential blocks.<P>Basically, to be uber in EQ, you almost have to have no real life. I don't think people should be penalized for having a life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zrazzt said:<BR>__________________________________________<BR>EQ is meant to be a roleplaying game (meant to be).<BR>Roleplaying games are supposed to mimic life (though with different sets of reality).<P>In life you won't get to do everything before you die, why do you expect to be able to do everything in EQ?<P>Besides Eduin, if you were a better player, and didn't annoy everyone on our server, perhaps you'd get invited places other than lower guk at level 60.<P>Regards.<BR>_____________________________________<P>The point is, if Eduin can put together a competent full group that can invest 2-3 hours in the game, he shouldn't have to wait for an "invite" from the "uber" crowd. <P>ALL the content in the game should be DESIGNED around that style of play .. NOT the 5% Uber-raid-capable crowd.  <P>It would be like designing Diablo so that most of the best content can ONLY be attained **IF** you are playing with 5 other players.  That's not Diablo's target audience.  That's not who they're trying to keep happy.  Their target audience is the 90% that just play Diablo solo .. that's why you can beat it solo.<P>Is there MORE content in Diablo that is ONLY available IF you team up with 5 people online?  No.  <P>Everquest is designed around the 6-person group concept.  Their target audience spends 2-3 hours at a sitting in the game on average.  The mechanics of the game "should" be that an average group of 6 with 2-3 hours to invest can accomplish any single goal or encounter in the game in some fashion.<P>Let's say it takes 24 people to break Hate (I have no idea, this is just an example).  Okay, so your TARGET client base can't reasonably get into hate, or experience ANY of it's graphical content.  That's not really an issue.  The issue is .. is there equipment/quest items/spells/ingredients that are EXCLUSIVELY available as drops in PoH?  If so, then this is a game design/business flaw.  <P>Uber encounters should produce a greater QUANTITY of drops ... but nothing EXCLUSIVE.  Otherwise, you're pandering to very small, exclusive clique of players .... and guess what?<P>Your claims to the contrary notwithstanding, most of your customer base can SEE that you are.<P>The very fact that uber encounters exist, AND drop exclusive and necessary loot for many aspects of the game, demonstrates that you are indeed pandering to that tiny segment of your customer base.<P>NOTHING, essentially, meaningfully, should be out of the reach of an average group of 6.  Might take longer, and require more patience, but the game should be designed around the average 6-person group, not the uber elite and THEIR gaming habits.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, just read thru most of this and I have to agree with <P>Absor,Miir, and Grimstaff on some of their comments.<P>  Absor and Miir (Supporting a FoH comment, I must be mad)have valid points on the tuning of High lvl zones. Uber players need a place to play also and like EVERYONE said. this is only 1% of the game. Sure, I would like to raid VP when I reach 50+. But even if I dont get to there is still plenty for me do.<BR>  Although Grimm has a very valid point about the retuning of PoF and PoH. These are the first planes we get to raid, starting at around lvl 46. This is where we learn how to do the raids. Retuning these denies us this opportunty.<P>Now I'm lvl 46 yet, but I sure as heck want to go there when I am.  These 2 planes should left as is. Who care's if FoH can empty them out at will? If it is that easy for them they will get bored and move on. Then a group will clean it out for a while.<P>Sorry Grimm, but I have to agree with Absor on the NERF thing. No, I dont like it, But it really only affects that portion of players which were abusing it. <P>It would be nice to think that everything that makes it into the would be perfect, but that is just not realistic. There is always going to be case where minds more creative than those at VI will find a way to exploit something.<P>Ok, I'm getting a headache from the thought that just defended Absor and FoH..<P>Absor - get back to wizzy thread..<BR>FoH - Hmm, You give me problems. I just leave you alone. (NERF THE UBER GUILD...JK)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I read the summary on the EQvault page.<P>I think there are points on both sides however I must disagree with Absors assertion that guilds can kill the dain and tormax they just choose not to.  <P>He is saying that there are many guilds that can easily organize to kill these mobs and that the content is there for them to take it , sorry they choose not to.<P>Then when people complain that SOV is too *high* end i.e. much harder than Sebilis, but unlike sebilis its not an XP situation, its  raid multi group situation.<P>Absor then mentions that you have to take all of Norrath when comparing content.<P>Here is my view.<P>Kunark has more XP zones for lvl 51+ than SOV, and I think we all agree  that SOV is mostly Raid oriented.  Abosr then mentions that kunark has all kinds of high lvl content that is non raid style.<P>Here is the problem for us high lvls<BR>When we log on we can choose a couple things<P>1) try and get an XP group going<BR>2) join/start a raid<BR>3) other non killing activities (questing, chatting, powerlvling friends, trading, skills , dueling, RPing, games , non killing events etc..)<P>Most high lvl players choose 1 or 2.  Most players that I know choose 2 for a couple reasons.<BR>Joining a raid is often easier than getting an XP group for the following reasons.<P>1) there are more high lvl raid zones than XP zones.<BR>2) the XP zones are often far away and need gating, <BR>3) many many XP zones need a key which involves a quest to get the key and many players dont bother with keys ( i know i dont, sebilis is one of the only keys i got and that was apain)<BR>4) because so much of SOV is raid content, you dont really have a choice.<P>Given a choice I would prefer to XP 5 days a week and raid 1 time every 2 weeks.  30+ players coordinating a mass event, yah its fun, but its taxing, its like work.  In another RP environment, say Pen and paper RP usually its just a few friends hanging out, I never did a whole lot of PnP RPG but enough to know that getting 30 people together is a HUGE pain in the arse, not to mention when you have 30 people in the same area, its laggy, people argue etc..<P>I am planning a raid this weekend, and at least 4 people signed up have conflicts, with others, I am already playing peacemaker just so we can enjoy some high lvl content.  I have to deal with getting 30 people to the same zone coordinated, dealing with Linkdeaths, mass wipeouts, lottos , organizing groups, coordinating attacks.<P>Its a hassle! 30 people , maybe 10 at MOST willl win something useful, the raid *IF* succesful will take many many hours, possibly 16 hours if we want to clear the whole zone.  My girlfriend is going to hate me , my arse is going to sweat.<P>All this to enjoy a little high lvl content.<P>What about zoning into a dng with a mix of players say 4 friends and fighting! its gone!<P>Sebilis? More frogs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> i am tired of frogs, and even if i want to do sebilis, NO ONE will go there without a cleric chanter and evacer.<P>Chardok? Raid zone now, not to mention another cleric only zone<P>Howling stones? Key, no safe zone in<P>Karnors? great zone, possibly the best zone in Kunark and because of this it is the most overpopulated.  Also tends to green out around 54-56.<P>You know what people have resorted to? Farming the plane of hate for XP.  Yes single groups will port up to hate and lvl 59 players will farm for XP and let the armour rot.<P>I realize that hate is going to be changed, but this is a sympton of Raid burning people out.<P>Last night I logged on and checked with some friends in other guilds.  I group was in Kael, they didnt know what to do, they had logged there yesterday after a raid but now didnt have enough for a raid, so they wer just trying to find somewhere to get XP without having to do massive CR (kael is CR hell)<P>Another was camping a rare spawn for a quest, another was running a growthplane raid.  Everyone on the raid was late night players, (prolly kids or college students) he estimated 5 AM his time for the raid to finish, so that was out.<P>I ended up doind a little outdoor mob XPing, no cleric around so me and a friend did the same thing we did at lvl 9 when we were camping dervs.  75days played later and I am camping outdoor spawn.  Whats the difference though? it takes 10X as long to kill the mob and I get less relative XP for killing it.  Meanwhile the rest of the night I am in tell hell writing down names for people on the raid, trying to figure out groups etc...<P>I am a gad dang politician, trying to get people to get along, leading a huge raid etc..<P><BR>I just want to log on get 3-4 friends and go explore something but I cant, exploring at lvl 55 usually means long CR afterward, and if you dont have a cleric, or the key to a zone etc...<P>Look at Velks lab, went in there one time to explore, HORRIBLE CR followed, now look at the zone, its a raid zone 100% of the time I check it</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, Eudin.. I normally think you're no more than an obnoxious troll.  I've disagreed with the majority of what you've posted on these boards when I've read it, but bless me if you haven't found something I can agree with.<P>You're right, it is ridiculous that the game is oriented towards those kiddies or no-lifers who can spend 16 hours a day glued to the computer monitor, or for whom 8-hour chunks taken out of their day-to-day aren't a big loss. <P> However, these are the same people who have been griping, grousing, complaining and saying, "Wait for Shadowbane/UO2/Anarchy Online/ DAOC!!"  These are the people who will be leaving in droves as these games are released.  After that, I imagine we might see actual decrases in downtime and all the other issues those of us who have struggled over a year to even reach our high 40's have had problems with.<P>  If not, I'm sure willing to pay $15-$20 a month to another company who does give me this.  Heck, I'll even go back to playing text-based MUDs. <P>As someone pointed out, it's the professional gamer view, unable to reconcile that some people just don't want to waste their lives at a monitor all day.  And yes it is a waste, there's no gain from playing for 16 hours, if anything you're losing out on more than you're gaining.  Perhaps they'll get to a phase in their life where they realize this, perhaps not.<P>   For the rest of us, shrug em off and consider moving along.  Remember, once it's not fun anymore it's not worth the $10, even as a contact for virtual friends.  That's what E-mail and ICQ are best at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
