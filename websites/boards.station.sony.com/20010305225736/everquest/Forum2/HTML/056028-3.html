</FONT><HR>I have had this happen to me.  I feel that there is a problem which this player has pointed out.<BR>  <BR>It is one I have pointed out to service, a gamemaster and the service section of the message boards.  You do not get a drop warning when something falls to the ground during a trade.  This is a programming flaw that should be fixed.  When you try to drop something you get all sorts of warnings.  When you don't try to drop something you don't get a warning.  Something is wrong with this.<P>Not everyone is aware of this flaw.  I wonder how many times this has to keep occuring before the problem is fixed?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is not a programming flaw.  It is as intented as indicated by the creation of a messages that tells you that there is no room and the item has fallen to the ground.  This is a conscious decision by the designers or else they would not have created a message to inform the player of the event.  If it were not, they would of designed it that the trade fails if all things could not fit.  Not a difficult option to implement.<P>If you separate your desires from the design you will see that.<P>Should the design be changed?  Well that is a different matter entirely.  I think the prevailing opinion is that it would be desirable that the "if there is no room for an item in a trade, its falls to the ground" design should be changed.  <P>Personally, I don't.  I don't want to be protected from myself at the time.  I like that there are negative consequences to my mis-action.<P>So to say this is currently a flaw (aka bug) is wrong.  Its not, its doing what it is designed to do.<P>To say you desire it to be changed, is an entirely different matter and is a valid request.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;only because I am tireless at trying to clarify a point&gt;<P>"Net according to the buyer there WAS room in his inventory, that is my point"<P>Yes, I understand that you both THOUGHT it was going to go down correctly.  But, at the end of it all, the fact of the matter is that a Wurmslayer needs an open inventory slot because it does not fit into the standard containers (save, perhaps, a large sewing kit or other similar unusual container).  Therefore, the space requirements for the trade were not satisfied.  And since it IS the design of the trade that an item that does not have its space requirements satisfied, falls to the ground, that is precisely what happened.<P>Anyway, I am repeating myself. If you don't see what I am saying then that's that.  It will be pointless for me to try any further and actually it doesn't matter much.<P>I am happy that the "victims" have been compensated by the guild.  It is still a travesty that the guild had to bear the burden.  But, I guess that is the price to be paid when one of their representives goes rogue on them and performs unlawful acts.  <P>&lt;Okay, lets hear from the conspiracy theorist now...oh the Guild was in on all this, they just wanted the good publicity.

</FONT><HR>Hello all.<BR> Just a quick post to let you know that the Wurmslayer not fitting into a regular backpack or regular-sized container is not a bug.  It is as intended.  It is the responsibility of the player to know of this requirement of a large backpack that can accomodate the Wurmslayer (or an open main inventory slot).  The player who is trading it to another should make sure that the recipient has enough room in their inventory before trading it to anyone.  This is especially true in an area where a lot of other Everquest players are in.  A good suggestion is to do these type of trades off the beaten path so to speak.  So if an item such as the Wurmslayer is dropped, than it won't be as difficult to avoid someone else picking it up.<BR>Auric. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What kind of lunatic babysits the person they're trading with sooo much that they say do you have an open spot for this item?  First of all it is a TERRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL game mechanic the trade should cancel if the other person's inv is full.  The way it is now it's like if the person you're trading with has his hands full you just toss the item on the ground.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ummm Auric,<BR>The character that I obtained the Wurmslayer with had 3 open inventory slots.  Therefore, the weapon was either in my character's primary hand or in an open slot... How was I supposed to determine that it wouldn't fit in a bag at that point in time?  Rather moot point now, as the code has been chaged ~ kinda supports my argument to begin with though.. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
