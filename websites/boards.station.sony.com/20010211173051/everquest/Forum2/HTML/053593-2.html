</FONT><HR>My main character is a level 60 monk on the Xegony server. I'm very happy playing a monk, I think they're a very enjoyable and entertaining class. However I think there are several issues that need to be considered when attempting to balance them with other melee classes.<P>First of all, I think monks should be able to taunt. As a monk I have a lot of difficulty taunting a mob off a caster who has agro'd it, much more than any other tank class.  Would this be unbalancing? No, and here is why--ALL other melee classes have taunt, with the exception of rogues (who are designed with anti-taunt in mind, fighting an enemy from behind while it is attacking someone else).  I have good ac and hp's when properly buffed, and my defensive skills are very good as well. However groups I'm in usually have to rely on a "taunting tank" in order to feel secure that the casters wont get shredded the moment they agro a mob.  Warriors, paladins, shadowknights, rangers all have the ability to taunt and get a mob's attention; monks can only beat on a mob and hope their melee damage causes agro to change at some point. Yes, melee damage does have a taunt factor, but it works nowhere near as fast as the taunt skill and agro caused by spellcasting. If a monk is expected to do all his taunting through melee damage then they need to have their damage output scaled up to be closer to a rogue's. Also there are now weapons available to other melee classes that allow them to approach, if not surpass, a monk's melee damage output so I don't think giving monks the ability to taunt would unbalance them.  If monks were given the taunt skill they would be able to be balanced with other melee types as a group's tank and main damage-taker.<P>Another issue I have is with the near-total inability to interrupt casting mobs. As a monk I am at a severe disadvantage when fighting a mob who casts dangerous spells such as gate or complete heal. Monks need some type of stun attack to interrupt in these situations (yes we do get a discipline at level 59 that has a chance of stunning, but it only works every 10 minutes or so; basically this gives us bash with a 10 minute recycle, as opposed to other classes who have their stun/interrupt skills recycle every few seconds). My solution to this would be to give one of the monk's auxillary attacks (kick, round kick, eagle strike, tiger claw, dragon punch) a stun component. This way a monk would be able to choose between the greater damage of flying kick, or the ability to interrupt casting with the lower damage skills. If a warrior is able to kick with stunning potential, why would a monk not be able to do so with their much more powerful kicks and strikes?<P>Another issue I have is with monk enhancements at 55 and 60 compared with what other melees get. Warriors get stun kicks at 55 and triple attack at 60.  Rogues get double backstab at 55 (making their damage output soar far above anyone else, period) and randomly lethal backstabs in certain situations at 60.  Monks get....1 extra hitpoint per tick while feigned at 55, and another at 60.  This is completely and totally insignificant, as no monk spends enough time feigned to notice any real effect from this. If a monk needs hp while feigned he simply waits for mend to recycle. My solution to this?  Monks should be given the ability to double attack with auxillaries (flying kick, dragon punch etc) and should also get a higher minimum damage to flying kick (kicks for 3 are embarrassing when a rogue is backstabbing for hundreds); or they need to be given some type of stun with one of their special attacks, as mentioned above. Another possibility would be to make the monk special attacks independent of one another (allowing a monk to use both flying kick and dragon punch, for instance) instead the way it is now, where all specials are greyed until the one last used recycles.<P>Another issue has to do with shiverback armor from the plane of fear.  Quite frankly it stinks.  Monks are the ONLY class that does not look forward to getting their planar armor.  Other classes drool from newbiehood at the thought of an apothic robe or indicolite breastplate etc, however monks typically dont even wear their shiverback, much less treasure it as their best pieces of equipment.  I wore my robe of the lost circle (that I quested for at level 37) over a shiverback jerkin when I finally got it, simply because it is a superior piece of equipment. The same goes for nearly all of my inventory slots--I wear some random piece of all/all gear with good ac and/or stats simply because shiverback isnt competitive (I'm not talking about amazingly good or rare stuff here, I'm talking about stuff I've had for 30 levels like azure sleeves or gatorscale legs). I know this is a touchy issue because you dont want monks to have ac that outclasses warriors, but I think something should be done to at least make shiverback armor desirable (maybe give it some rightclick effects since monks got no rightclick kunark armor like other classes, or extra bonuses to resists perhaps?) to the monks who are just becoming planesworthy but not looking forward to improving their gear like other classes.<P>About the epic fists--I love them (although I do think the quest is too easy compared to the other epics, sorry guys but you know it's true, it's not even close). I think they're wonderful, they allow a monk to solo very easily, and have a very viable alternative to grouping. However when grouped the effect is hardly effective at all.  Every haste buff overwrites it, so whenever I get aanya's quickening or speed of the shissar I have to sacrfice the 54 atk and 12ac granted by the fists effect in favor of greater haste.  What should happen is the fists should be made to work like the robe of whistling fists did, namely that it should still grant the atk/ac bonuses while allowing the monk to get haste from a faster enchanter buff.<P>Another issue is with the level 60 discipline, Ashenhand. As many may not be familiar with it, what it does is make the next eagle strike landed do surprising damage (usually around 300, sometimes more/less), and in certain situations has a chance to outright kill a mob (this has NEVER happened to me or anyone else I know who has used this discipline btw). This discipline is much less effective than others; I can sometimes do around 2k damage in 10 seconds with innerflame, and it recycles more than twice as fast as ashenhand.  I'm not sure what should be done to improve it, but I think it should be changed in some way to make it a desirable addition to the monks repertoire of disciplines, most of which are quite nice in my opinion.<P>I hope some of these issues are addressed, and I appreciate the effort that has gone into balancing the classes so that most people will be satisfied to a reasonable extent.<P>Ronne Obvious<BR>level 60 monk, Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Udila<P>Please dont post what you know nothing about.  You only serve to show your own ignorance when you do this.<P>But since some of the people reading the board may have the same understanding of the monk class as you do, I will take it as an opproutunity to explain.<P>First of all.  Feign death has been changed on post 35 mobs specifically is bugged several places.  Feign pulling does not work in the mid/later game as the monsters remember you when you pop up.  This utility does not exists.<P>There are some bugs in feign.  Sometimes, green mobs will not quit attacking on multiple successfull feigns.  A deepwater croc for example shouldnt still be biting you on your 9th successfull feign when you are level 44.<P>Sometimes after standing after a feign you are immobilized, and must sit and stand.  This often happens in conjunction with the aforesaid bug, and gets to sting if you are hit while you are sitting.<P>Moving on, to damage.  Monks were intended, according to the Vision, to be masters of mele, and were intended to outdamage a fighter when utilizing hand to hand.<P>Kunark changed that, and weapons came into the game.  Now monks are on par with fighters damage wise, and less than rogues.<P>This thread is supposed to be class balance.  IF the mele classes are balanced, one could assume that each would have a balancing attribute.  A possible way to look at this is consider you are in a balanced group and looking to add another member and are choosing between a monk, rogue and a warrior.<P>Warrior:  Good damage, Great Tank.<BR>Rogue:  Unmatched conditional damage, lesser defensive assets (hp, ac)<BR>Monk:  Good damage, lesser defensive assets.<P>One can see a viable toss up between the warrior and rogue (their strenghts and weaknesses are reasonably balanced).  What, however, would make you chose to pick the monk?<P>They can feign pull.  (no, we really cant past the mid game)<BR>They can save themselves in a fight.  (again no)<BR>They are the masters of mele and do more damage (well, we are supposed to, but we do no more damage than a warrior)<BR>They will become masters of throwing?!?!?  (God no!  Really, that is rogue area and veriant has stated time and time again that they dont want any class to be a stand off fighter)<P>There are a lot of suggestions in this post.  The crux of the problem i think has been stated and restated simply as:<P>If the monk class is balanced, what offsets their lack of defensive skills?  If our damage is increaced to offset this and move in line with how The Vision of monks has been explaind to us, how does this not become a death sentence due to the increaced agro and limited usefullness of our suposed safety net 'feign death'?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm not sure what should be done to improve it, but I think it should be changed in some way to make it a desirable addition to the monks repertoire of disciplines, most of which are quite nice in my opinion.<P>I hope some of these issues are addressed, and I appreciate the effort that has gone into balancing the classes so that most people will be satisfied to a reasonable extent.<P>Ronne Obvious<BR>level 60 monk, Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Udila<P>Please dont post what you know nothing about.  You only serve to show your own ignorance when you do this.<P>But since some of the people reading the board may have the same understanding of the monk class as you do, I will take it as an opproutunity to explain.<P>First of all.  Feign death has been changed on post 35 mobs specifically is bugged several places.  Feign pulling does not work in the mid/later game as the monsters remember you when you pop up.  This utility does not exists.<P>There are some bugs in feign.  Sometimes, green mobs will not quit attacking on multiple successfull feigns.  A deepwater croc for example shouldnt still be biting you on your 9th successfull feign when you are level 44.<P>Sometimes after standing after a feign you are immobilized, and must sit and stand.  This often happens in conjunction with the aforesaid bug, and gets to sting if you are hit while you are sitting.<P>Moving on, to damage.  Monks were intended, according to the Vision, to be masters of mele, and were intended to outdamage a fighter when utilizing hand to hand.<P>Kunark changed that, and weapons came into the game.  Now monks are on par with fighters damage wise, and less than rogues.<P>This thread is supposed to be class balance.  IF the mele classes are balanced, one could assume that each would have a balancing attribute.  A possible way to look at this is consider you are in a balanced group and looking to add another member and are choosing between a monk, rogue and a warrior.<P>Warrior:  Good damage, Great Tank.<BR>Rogue:  Unmatched conditional damage, lesser defensive assets (hp, ac)<BR>Monk:  Good damage, lesser defensive assets.<P>One can see a viable toss up between the warrior and rogue (their strenghts and weaknesses are reasonably balanced).  What, however, would make you chose to pick the monk?<P>They can feign pull.  (no, we really cant past the mid game)<BR>They can save themselves in a fight.  (again no)<BR>They are the masters of mele and do more damage (well, we are supposed to, but we do no more damage than a warrior)<BR>They will become masters of throwing?!?!?  (God no!  Really, that is rogue area and veriant has stated time and time again that they dont want any class to be a stand off fighter)<P>There are a lot of suggestions in this post.  The crux of the problem i think has been stated and restated simply as:<P>If the monk class is balanced, what offsets their lack of defensive skills?  If our damage is increaced to offset this and move in line with how The Vision of monks has been explaind to us, how does this not become a death sentence due to the increaced agro and limited usefullness of our suposed safety net 'feign death'?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IKSAR POSTION ON EPIC<P>Just a note on my perspective of removing the ability to kill the brothers for Robe of the Lost Circle. I play a 51 Iksar monk.<P>There is no way I will do the Epic quest if I can not kill for the robe. Why? Unlike humans (who from my experience are the only ones really complaining about this) iksar have to gain faction to do the sash and headband quests. I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours getting faction so I can do head band quest. The amount of time it would take an iksar to get faction for the sashes and headbands is greater than the time required for a human monk to do raster, targin, zephyl, and qwinn (which is still an insane amount of time).<P>Getting the guild together to kill one of the brothers isn't always easy either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail Verant,<P>I'm lazy or stupid...maybe some of both but I have a hard time on remembering to even "use" my damn disciplines! Change em? Why? Just get rid of them. I'd rather have my true worth be measured by increased damage/defense as I describe below a bit.<P>I admit I only have two of em' but I only use stonestance if it looks like a fight is going poorly and I may actually get whooped on by some MOB's or sometimes during a nasty pull where I'm stunned. TKick? It's a joke and I could care less about having it. I'd rather kick for 3pts in silence than kick in public for 24. If you want me to use this skill for anything other than making the group giggle the damage table for this skill should be from 100-300 and strongly weighted around the 200 mark. It doesn't happen all that often and would not create an imbalance even if it was every kick for the duration of the /disc as some have suggested.<P>In short, I don't care about the /disc's they were a poorly thought out patch when you couldn't figure out what to do with us post 50. Same for all melee really. The true rewards are the inate skills you gave the classes like the regen, the double backstab and even the never firing triple attack.<P>So here are some ideas to ponder...<P>What I'd really like to see is Monks get a "better" damage table than other melee. Either make me hit on a higher percentage basis (I'm sick of hitting 66% of the time) maybe make it 75%? Or make me hit harder. Either both hands get a higher damage modifier or add one to the offhand that is half the primaries? Why the wishlist? If you want reasons behind ideas here you go...<P>This will put us where we belong regardless of race or choice of weapons/hth. Also it would scale with your level and help the young guys out a bit. Maybe more than you want to be helped? I remember just before Kunark when the only thing taunting off of me was a Ranger if he was lucky. Either way one of us was in trouble for we were not tanks =) We rightfully should fall between the warrior and Rogue while grouped as far as damage goes.  Several have stated that we have a price to pay for that damage and indeed it is reflected in our hp's and poor survivability if a primary tank.<P>For the defensive side I agree with the posts to up our skills to the maximum the engine allows or 252. Also, disarm and FD should hit these marks.<P>I'm all for a one second per 2 levels after 50 reduction in the FD recycle time. Or FD in 9secs at 52, 8secs at 54, 7secs at 56 etc. etc. etc.<P>I have no problem with the mechanics of FD however, leave it alone. If I was a dreamer I'd say let me save myself when 8 things are frenzied on me in a dungeon and I'm at 50hp's.<P>In summary... up my damage!, either percentage wise on hits or thru damage bonuses attached to each hand. Up my defensive skills to match, if this can't be done please give me a makeshift "evade" function as Tanks will have a hard time keeping the MOB's attention. Tweak FD reuse time.<P>Last note, reduce the weight of our weapons, especially the 2hb monsters. They are Monk only and there is no way they should weigh what they do. It's an insult from Verant. Why ould Master Wu attach his name to such a heavy beast, I'm sure he could've done better?  A 2hb should weigh approx 50% more than it's 1hb counterpart. Example being the Wu's, a Trance at 1lb. should equal a Quivering at 1.5 to 2lbs. Also I just read up on the keys and agree 100%. Lower the weight of the keys to .1, it's bad enough having to burn slots for them.<P>Sincerly,<BR>Ssyn 52nd Disciple Tribunal<BR>Sorolman A'Hurtin 52nd Disciple Bristlebane<P>Obviously I care about Monks and in general enjoy them quite a bit.  Having played an Iksar and Human to level 52 I must add that I feel no Race issues need addressing other than some misunderstood envy some may have.  Trust me it is misplaced envy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are some very good posts in this thread.<P>There are also many silly ones, and some that appear to be from other classes (the guy who suggested making the epic quest harder is either a mage or has gotten his epic and wants to be exclusive: the CF quest takes many, MANY hours of camping, and the final effect is not stackable!!! with almost anything.  If VI STILL wants to nerf it, they should make the headbands NO DROP and make killing Zephyr impossible.  Then at least, ALL MONKS will have to quest each part (this is VERY tedious, it takes many days to finally get the two final headband/sashes through the many quests needed, added to the long Targin/Raster, etc. camps, but this is ALL they should do, IF they feel they MUST nerf it).  <P>Whether they do this or not, they should still fix the effect, to be 1) stackable with all other spells (except the haste effect of it).<BR>2) permanent when worn(no constant rightclicking).  THis is not the most important thing but would be nice. <P>The following is a list of what monks really need for balance.<P>1) SERPENT SIGHT added to the TREANT FISTS. Also add about 4 AC (to make it 12ac) and reduced weight (from .7 to .1).  Treant fists take an INSANE amount of time to get, with the various mobs needed to be camped (some for days [the two dift. alchemists]), and the cross-continent travel needed to get them, and need something like this on them. Since they are human only (as they should be, since Iksar monks get the Iksar only Shackle quests) the effect that should be added is SERPENT SIGHT, an important effect that humans can really use, and in fact need to see on more items.  The weight should be .1 and the ac 12 to compete with RoK gloves (Iksar scaled (ac 12 and stats)for example, easy to obtain gloves), two things monks can really appreciate, higher AC and lower weight.<P>2) More RESIST boosts and gear. <BR>An earlier post stated that monks are the worst class on pvp servers.  To the extent this is true it is because of 2 things.  Lack of ability to STUN, and the fact that with our "nakedness" (using our body, not gear as a weapon, etc.)we have very low resists.  Even with all our jewelry slots used up for resist gear (something that hurts TREMENDOUSLY, we need those slots for AC and HP gear like all other monks on blue servers need), EVEN with that, our resists are WAY BELOW a warriors, rogues, and any hybrids.  <P>This allows casters to chew us up and spit us out.<P>For example, many melee classes can equip the runed bone fork (10 Sv MR,CR,FR, range slot) and the CHEAP bs mantle (10 MR and stats, shoulder slot) and the dwarven ringmail tunic(costs 20 plat, provides great CR,FR,MR and some AC) and all types of other resist armor (most of it CHEAP!!) that at least gives them SOME caster protection.  But monks can't wear this stuff.  There's alot of other resist gear too in the game, but monks can't afford to wear it, either monks aren't listed on it or it's all too dang HEAVY!! We have to try to be at 14 weight (slight increase post 50) or our ac drops HARD.<P>I know pvp is a low, LOW priority with VI. I can appreciate this. But resists are needed by ALL monks, in general and because one of their main class defining skills is PULLING.  We get nuked HARD when we pull, with all kinds of spells.<P>Do 2 things for us. <BR>1) Give us an extra 10 to each resist at birth.  And give us resist increases naturally, that go up another point every level or 2.  This won't be overpowering, it will only allow us to START approaching the type of resists available easily to all other melees, who can use high (and easily obtainable) resist gear (a great deal of which has very nice AC and stats on it too).  This will allow us to better fill our class defining role as pullers, allow us to do better on pvp servers and in duels, AND help us stay alive longer vs. casters in general, with our inferior hps (same hp as rogues, but rogues (and all hybrids) can use all the MR gear and much more that I mentioned above).<BR>2) Give us some great monk only no drop high resist gear that weighs either 0 or .1.  Make us quest for some of it.<P>3) STUN: Monks should be able to stun.  A lvl 5 warrior can stun.  Pvp is still unbalanced towards casters.  Allowing melees to stun at least gives them more of a chance. The stun doesn't have to be great, but at least enough to interrupt casters. Give monks a chance to stun with each of their specials, with a very large % chance to stun with flying kick (which monks finally achieve at lvl 30).  Make the chance to stun get even greater as the various specials' skills increase.  <BR>Stun ability for monks will help monks substantially on all the servers, not just the pvp servers, as it increases their effectiveness vs caster mobs in particular, thus helping the group.  It is amazing that a lvl 5 warrior can stun with kick, but currently, a lvl 55+ monk can not.<P>If necessary, make STUN a SKILL, that must be trained by completing a quest.  Make the quest available to all level monks though.. it can be hard, just available to all monks.  If this is implemented however, please make the stun skill a SERIOUS skill, that monks can be very proud of as it gets higher in skill level, that can really stun for a number of seconds. This would not be unbalancing, it fits right in with the monk approach (blindingly fast melee skills that shock and STUN the opponent) and perhaps will help make us more desired in the 50+ game, as a valuable ability of the monk in particualr, the best stuns perhaps.  Monks need something defining post 50, as all the Kunark and Velious weaps and gear have allowed the other melees to soar past us.  I suggest that this should be it.   <BR>In fact, one of our best staffs already has a renowned stun on it, so this is a monkly thing to do (that staff costs 75-100k when it is rarely sold, and is quite difficult to get and has some drawbacks(huge weight is one ofthem) but of course it's a dream staff for any monk)<P>4) The Iksar/Human issue.  Granted, the humans being able to exp now with no penalty is nice.  Iksar monk penalty was cut in half too though, from 40%(20 race 20 monk) to 20% race.  20 % isnt too bad.<P>Good race faction is nice too.  However Iksars can fix their faction with work, and in fact, I know of some who can hang out in Kelethin, Qeynos, Freeport, all because of faction work.  <P>Iksars get natural regen and a HUGE AC boost over humans, so much that at lvl 60 they have 90 AC more than a human. (Not to mention infravision, forage, better stats and hyper swim skill).<P>This boost was so large, the Monk BoTB had to be altered to allow gear to be worn so that humans could merely compete with Iksars (after extensive testing of the matter was done).<P>Iksars can work hard and get what humans have, good faction. Allow humans to work hard and get some of what the Iksars have, especially, Serpent Sight (solved by the treant fist quest change I suggested above), and most importantly, higher AC. Give humans a quest, a Velious quest that allows them to gain an inherent added AC equal to Iksar AC.  This is NOT unbalancing, the human EXP advantage is still offset by the Iksar regen that they RAVE about (tremendous soloing boost, in combat and mostly, does away with ALOT of downtime, can cut it in half or better vs human natural hp regen). <BR>Make the boost be granted by a quest NPC who states something along the lines of "Your superior devotion to the Order of the Whistling Fists is admirable. Unfortunately I am a poor, ice ravaged monk who can give you nothing. However your path to me was treacherous; surely you have honed and toughened your body from the journey, as is our custom."  <BR>High lvl human monk AC in uber gear is only about 1080 or so, this would only add another 90 or so to that (bringing us close to Iksar monk AC) so it is not a HUGE increase but will nevertheless balance us out some so future BoTB's won't need some adjustment to compensate for the "weaker, punier" humans.  Also it will help all human monks and groups with human monks to survive just a little longer.<P>My final requests are the following:<P>1) SOLIDLY DEFINE monks and their role.  One great way to do that would be to allow monks to do more dm in a monkly fashion, by making opponents (mobs, and pvp opponents) unable to parry, riposte, block, or dodge monk attacks, or at least make them much less likely to be able to do this.  This will increase monk dm without increasing their aggro, and still keep monk dm way, WAY below rogue damage.  Since all other melee classes can wear better (more HP and AC)gear than monks(largely due to the weight limit), it won't overpower monks in pvp.<P>2) Feign Death:<P>1) change FD so casters stop casting on a monk when he fd's. As it is, if a mob caster gets the cast started before the monk hits fd, the spell hits, PLUS the  mob KEEPS CASTING! This is wrong.  A player would stop casting and save his mana as soon as his opponent fell to the ground, (apparently dead), mob casters should behave similarly.<P>2) Change Velious, it has made monks way less desired in the game.  Make mobs walk back singly like they do elsewhere. Velious will still be much harder than everywhere else, don't worry about that. =)<P>3) Allow FD to wipe aggro COMPLETELY after say, 2 or 3 feigns.  Make FD WORK even when monk is below 2 bubbles health, in the areas where it's not working in that situation right now.<P>4) Unbind the special attacks so they can each be used one after the other.  Casters use many spells in later levels that they acquired earlier, warriors later use many skills they got early on, it should not be that only monks have ALL their acquired specials become OBSOLETE as soon as the new one is gained. Unbind them, so they can be chain used.<P>5) Add a disc to replace lvl 52 disc, or just ADD a new disc, that is like a flurry, in which monk breaks out all specials in a row and they do 1.5 or 2 times normal damage. Make it so that it recharges relatively quickly though.. if you need to keep the dm kind of down to do this, do it..This would be so fun to use (visually and otherwise) that monks would like to use it alot, rather than have it do more dm but have a longer recharge time.<P>LASTLY, please DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING:<P>1) DO NOT give us triple attack. <BR>2) DO NOT increase our throwing skill. Throwing is for pulling only.  1 point damage from throwing is fine.  We want to do our damage up close and personal. It is the Way of the Monk (tm).<BR>3) (a reiteration) DO NOT nerf the CF quest.  It take ages.  It is not easy. In the end, our CF's have an effect that needs to be constantly clicked, and is NOT STACKABLE with most of the good buffs in the game.  If anything, make the headbands NO DROP, and Zephyr unkillable. Thus monks will have to actually DO THE quests themselves. If you do this, even if you don't, PLEASE make CF effect stackable with all the other spells (except the haste portion of it).<P>And finally my obligatory DREAM (fantasy)REQUEST:<P>Monks are the masters of their bodies- so give them questable slippers with good stats and ac that let monks run SLIGHTLY faster than sow speed.  It can be a hard quest.<P>Bard song with a choice percussion instrument ( Nostrolo tambourine or Selos drum of March or Puretone disc) seems to be at high lvls about 2X or more the speed of SOW.  Monks don't want to step on bards toes or anything.  Just give us these slippers, after a hard quest, that allow us to outrun SOW by a slight margin.  We are masters of the body. This is in keeping with that.  Why would we want this?  Because we are pullers. It will give us another reason to let us pull.  Plus it will help balance us out in terms of pvp (slightly more running speed gives us SOMETHING anyway, good for escape or attack).  Finally give it to us because it fits our image, as a class that tones and trains it's body to do amazing things.<P>A second dream change would be a quest, available to human monks that gives them the inherent ability to have serpent sight.  This can be a 50+ quest; humans can have to suffer blind through corpse retrievals to level 50 to have a shot at it. But after 50, wold be nice to havea quest to shoot for, that allows us to CR in a more monkly fashion (with our superior, toned and trained skills...plus we are crucial in group CR with our FD skill so this fits right in with that).<P>Wahn Tahn <P>Thanks for your attention.<P>Wahn Tahn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are the issues I would like to discuss:<P>Weight limit:<P>We need to loot as much as the next person to get items and pp.  The money pouch needs a better ratio on and and quest related weightless bags would be great.  Monk specific armour and weapons should not be heavy.  Take the adamantite bo stick, nice dam/del on it but the weight is too high and a AE spell that effects the weilder is just ridiculous.<P>Also, our AC and HPs are already too low take and AC hit if we are lose AC going over the limit.<P>Armour:<P>Shiverback is a joke in the sense of AC, alot of times we are almost dead from taunting a mob in a fight, while a warrior has twice as many hps as we do.  Take shiverback amour for instance, the bracer has 0 AC, come on stats are nice on stuff, but a planar item without AC.  Not good. <P>We need to be able to get our AC and HPs up a little higher IMO.  The only other answer to this brings me to my next topic FD.<P>Feign death: <P>Hmm, I have died 4 times in a row now because I was taking the most damage in the fight, cleric went oom, I turned off attack and feigned, no message that I fell to the ground and boom the mob is still hitting me and I am dead.   I petition and the GM says, oh the mob has a chance of seeing you when you FD, but u wont know unless he keeps hitting you.  What is wrong here, if it fails, tell me it fails.  And the fact that it failed everytime I was in that situation tells me, that if you are down under 2 bubs of health and in melee with a mob, run for the zone cause FD will not save your butt.  Nice lil nerf there that I never encountered till the mid 40s in solb and guk.  If it was like that b4, I never noticed it and my monk is 49 now has 27 days played.<P>FD pulling:  Lets face it, this a valuable asset to a good group in a lot of situations, til you successfully pull a good FD split off and have to tell your grp to fight the mob cause you will re agro the rest of the mobs.  For something like hate, this doesnt matter you have plenty of ppl there to kill the mobs, but if splitting mobs in a group of 6, well, just wish them luck until agro is cleared or you /q.<P>Attack:<P>I like the damage I do right now, but I really think there should be more emphasis put on a monks fists.  Sometimes weapons are nice, like the Wu's trance stick and stuff like that, but using a mace or something is wrong.  How about more gloves with effects or dam/del ratios better than fists, or weapons that are used by the martial artists like numchucks and weapons of that sort, but a mace doesnt seem to fit monks.  Jade mace and stave seem to be the best 1hders out there right now for 50 plus.<P>The only other issue I have about monks attack is of course stun.  Why not just give Flying kick/thunderous kick a chance of stunning.  That is our highest damage skill that would make sense to have a stun, except for some of our other disciplines which I am unsure of since I am not at that lvl yet.<P>Disciplines:<P>I dont know much about them yet, but I laugh everytime I see a monk land a thunderous kick for under 50, what a joke, there should be a minimun on this discipline.  <P>Also, the disciplines that use tiger claw and eagle strike.  If we aren't going to use these skills after a certain lvl then why make them part of the discipline.  Bottom line is we moved up to using flying kick because it does the most damage and thats the idea in a fight, to kill the mob as fast as possible, using least amount of mana and thus having less downtime.  Now we have to use skills that are barely going to do any damage.  Doesnt make sense.  Either that or the skills should be set up so when you get the level to upgrade your skill, you have maxed out the previous one.  Not have to keep using the old one that hardly does any damage.<P>Well, I hope I have gotten my point across and hope that you consider all the valuable posts here about this class.  EQ is a great game and the monk class is a great class that could just use some fine tuning.<P>And for those of you that didnt understand, this is the monk general discussion board about monk issues.  People in every class have issues they would like to be looked into, some valid and some, well a little outrageous.  Either way, its about balance issues amongst the iksar and human monk along with balance amongst the other classes.  You dont have bash other ppl for their posts and you dont have to come to this board and bash ppl that posted their opinions about their class.  Grow up and get a life and let ppl be and say their piece, right or wrong, verant is going to read these and make decisions based on what their "views" are for where they want the game to go and take some "constructive" critisism about their product and hopefully use it to theirs and their customers advantage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Comment on iksar vs human AC:<P>The iksar exp and faction penalties certainly hurt.  However, they can be overcome with work.<P>Humans have no way to ever catch up in the AC department.<P>Implement quests, human only, to allow us to catch up in the AC department.  Make them as hard to overcome as the iksar exp and faction penalties.  I.e. pretty darn hard.<P>(BTW the logical slot for this is arms...most monks wear azure sleeves)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just have a general question and commment. In what I've read so far I keep seeing comments about the damage output of monks. Absor said "The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues."<P>I'm sure many of you remember, several months ago Abashi discussing the role of Monks and telling us that Monks were supposed to be the master damage dealers and be able to outdamage Warriors in every case except a Monk using the worst possible equipment and the Warrior using the best possible equipment...Abashi even went so far as to run some tests to make sure the Monks outdamaged the Warriors as expected.<P>So my question is when did Rogues become the masters of damage instead of Monks? How did it become an issue of making monks do more than warriors but less than rogues? At the time of the tests Abashi did, he made it quite clear that monks were to dish out the damage and the balancing factor was our lack of HP and AC.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My only Problem.  <P>FIX Feign Death.<BR>It fails to much.  <BR>Mobs seem to always remember.<BR>It can creat a train even minutes after you "thought" your multiple feigns erased you from the mobs hate list.<BR>If a Mobs goes away after I Feigned, it should have forgoten me.  This usually causes trouble for everyone.  I have actually ben told to just DIE cause I aggroed something.  People would rather have me /q or die(and get rezzed)  than to believe Feign Death worked.  Isn't there a problem with that?  Why CAN'T I be 100% sure that mob is not comming back?  Why SHOULD I have to resort to continually Feigning Death?  Or /quit?  Or getting killed in a corner and wait for a rez?  This just doesn't work for me.  I don't think FD SHOULD work this way.  And FD can fail so many ways.  Sometimes you are hit while your falling down.  Sometimes a mage blasts you cause you feigned as it began to cast(AoE will also make mobs re-aggro if it hits you).  And there are just timies the mobs keep hiting you for no apparent reason, even if you succeded and none of the above occured.<P>Now on to my other complaints.  <P>-We have many skills that upgrade another and make them useless.  Anyway to make them more usefull?  <P>-Mend should do something more after 100.  Heal another?  Heal a bit more?  Recycle faster?  Have a "chance" of healing 50%?<P>-Treant Fists Quest reward.  Almost exactly Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.  How about Giving them some "monkish" effect that makes them more desirabble?  maybe up/change stats a bit?  add a small haste factor?  summon food/water/shuriken/bndages?<P>-More weapons that don't look like "sticks". How about more weapons, with which even when equipt, still make us seem as if we carry no weapons?  Or just up the fist damage or lower delay?<P>-A minimum damage cap for Flying Kick.  I hate hitting a "3" more than once in a fight.  How about the cap at something like Half your level?  Level 60 min cap would be 30.  Any thought?<P>-Instill Doubt is pretty much worthless even at 200.<P>-Most(if not all) Monk-only armour is a joke.  I don't have to go into details.  This is one of those topics that has been around for a while.<P>-I don't know where I read this, but I like the Idea of making monk "srikes" and "kicks" have diferent timers.  Thus you could Kick AND strike a mob at the same time and each would regenerate ad their own pace.  It would be a nice alternative to "stun"<P>-Weight Bonus.  I would also like to get SOME bonus when I hit 50.  Its hard enough as it is to get to those level, but to have to wait to 55 and 60?  A tad much.<P>-Raster of Ruk still take toooo long to spawn.  People have actually killed Zephyl with high level friends instead of going after Raster.  The robe is not really worth the trouble in my opinion(its stats aren't that good), its the FACT that you NEED it to get the other robe that kills me.  Just make Raster a bit more common. <P>I think that is all if not most of what I have to say.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monks.<P>What does not need adjustment.  Our raw defensive skills and ac are fine.  With proper equipment I'm rapidly approaching 1100, that's warrior level ac, and it's fine.  <P>We do not need stuns.  Nope, we don't.  There is no compelling balance reason to give monks stuns.<P>What does need adjustment.  The intinsic damage level of monks is falling behind.  Instead of the implementation of new weapons to increase our damage potential, we need an upgrade to the class defining skills we get.  Flying Kick, achieved at level 30, needs to be upgraded for the post 50 levels. Put in some new skill point raises for the 50+ level, skill points which when achieved add a minimum damage component to flying kick, and raise it's max, and perhaps even lower it's reuse time.  This will realistically raise the INTRINSIC damage of all monks post 50, which is where the gap is most noticable.  OR .. perhaps implemented by a quest for upper level monks, put in a skill upgrade for Flying Kick.  I believe in Beta at some point there was a kick above flying kick, that was removed for balance reasons.  Reconsider putting it back in the game.  However, I think option one makes the most sense.<P>Feign Death.  This skill does not scale well for the post 50 levels.  It never gets any better, and it's not even close to perfect when it's maxed currently.  This skill defines our class just as much as our special attacks does.  It should scale, improve, all the way up to 60.  Again, give the skill some new skill point raises, that at each point increase it's power in some way.  Increase the chance to have mobs forget you, or reduce the chance for a fallen message, or even reduce the reuse time.  This skill is suppossed to be our gift for remarkably LOW hitpoints in a melee class.  If used properly it can serve as an evade, a life saver, a weakened form of invis .. it's a very class defining skill.  It only makes sense that it should be allowed to improve as our class increases in power, not forced to stay the same.  <P>Finally .. take a look at the monk class, and the rogue class.  Tell me how we are different, really.  With all the upgrades to the rogue class, monks have become something of a "second best" in the end game.  A rogue can deal more effective damage that I can.  I rogue can avoid damage better than I can.  A rogue can enter dangerous areas and come out unscathed better than I can.  Monks, being reliant on weapons now to produce reasonable damage output, are slowly being realized as nothing but second best rogues in the endgame of eq.  We have no capability or characteristic that effectively translates into a unique game purpose anymore, since feign pulling has been essentially eliminated in Vellius and other modern zones.  I don't have an answer here, but if you want to make the monk community happy, this is an excellent point to consider.<P>Oh, P.S. .. it has been stated repeatedly by the people you work with Absor that monks SHOULD be the masters of damage from the front side of a mob.  We should be out damage warriors, and only rogues should have any more damage POTENTIAL than us, given optimal backstab conditions.  So we didn't just make this up heh.  Oh ya, and please, do SOMETHING with Thunderkick.  No discipline should make my whole group laugh every time I use it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No neccesarily balance issues but...<P>Since the Gem Inlaid Gauntlets quest was fixed about three-four months ago, they are very easy to get. The Treant Fists, on the other hand, are comparable gloves but much more difficult to obtain. I think the Treant Fists can stand some upgrading. There seems to be "room" between the GIGs and GoFMs to upgrade the Treants, perhaps adding +3 str/agi/dex, +5 magic,a few nore HP and a wt of 0.5 for instance. A small bump in AC, to 10 , would help as well since Treants are human specific. I'm proud of my Treants, but after the GIGs, Treants seem a lot of work now. Where's the "risk/reward" ?<P>You could also look at the Collar of Neshika quest and perhaps make it into an item a Monk would actually want. As it is now it can't even be considered a Monk item at a wt of 1.5. The Collar of Undead Protection is practically free, so I feel the Neshika item should be an upgrade from that. While you're fixing the weight make it Human Monk only and give it more AC. Will help fix the Iksar/Human discrepancy. Right now it seems like a lot of monkeying [pun] around for a worthless item.<P>Drop the weight of the Drolvarg mantle to 0.5. It's really sad to see Monks in their mid thirties to low 40's [like me] lugging around this heavy gear because there's no good upgrade from the cured silk item they got at lvl 14. Perhaps a Crescent piece could be added.<P>With regards to balance...<P>	Put the FD skill back to the way it was in the "old days".<P>	One would think that as a Monk progressed he/she would be able to perfect their mend skills to a higher level. Seems odd that it peaks at lvl 20 and never inproves. Same for ID. Both these could work similar to the built in haste, so that they got better as time went on - assuming you kept them maxxed out.<P>	Flying Kick should have some realistic minimum dmg.<P>	As mentioned by a few folks earlier a Monk should be reinstated as master dmg dealer or have the various restictions lifted. Verant took away our dmg, took away our Feign, but left us with all the restrictions. Then they gave us a bunch of heavy weapons w/o enough weight limit compensation. As a real life example I own a Rattan Bo, 2 meters long that weights 19 ounces. My 2.5 meter Ash Bo weights 54 ounces. Compare that with the weights of the Bo and Greenwood Bo. A Monk shouldn't have to put up with this for 50 levels. One could argue the wt issue for the effect weapons, but the non-effect wepons - BoF, WQS, SoB, Peacebringer,etc,  seem heavy, RFS is borderline OK.<P>I don't need to bind, I don't need to 'port. Have asked for a bind once. Have yet to ask for a teleport [ but I'm not lvl 46 yet either  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ] It's OK that Iksar have regen and vision, but a Human Monk ultravision quest might be worth looking at - maybe a lvl 30's type quest - or not. The Glowing Stone Band doesn't quite get it.<P>From my point of view a Monk is pretty close to right. Most of my concerns center around getting Monks back up to being the number one damage dealers. This could be done by making the weapons stronger/lighter [increasing AC] or the fists greater dmg/delay by a tad bit. Perhaps looking at the built-in haste of Monks above lvl 30 would be enough. I suspect most Monks would put up with some grief to regain that top dmg dealer spot. Either make us "Masters of Melee" or take away the grief. <P>I suspect others will offer suggestions as well. Tough job, Good Luck.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My 2 cents as a 60 Monk:<P>CLASS BALANCE DEFINITION<BR>"Class Balance" is a vague concept to most and so for purposes of this post, I am going to define it as I understand it:<P>Class Balance is achieved in everquest by giving each class capabilities that make them desirable for player vs. environment encounters, since progression (exp/loot) in the game is achieved through overcoming environment based obstacles.  When one class is given too many capabilities RELATIVE to another class, this creates a state of imbalance.  This imbalance results in reduced desirability for the less endowed class and reduces game play enjoyment stemming from:<BR>1. no defined and specialized role for the unbalanced class; and <BR>2. less participation in gameplay through reduced acquisition of the unbalanced class for raids/exp groups.  <P>**The proportion of capabilities then is the key to achieving class balance.**  <P>For those not inclined to read a long post, here is a summary of the detailed discussion below.  Please skip ahead to DETAIL if you are inclined to read everything as SUMMARY and RECOMMENDATIONS are repeated at the end:<P>SUMMARY<BR>1. Warriors dealing nearly identical damage to monks have capabilities (AC/HP/DISCIPLINE) that allow them to remain active in encounters longer than monks<BR>2. Rogues dealing considerably more damage than monks have a capability (EVADE) that allows them to remain active in encounters longer than monks<P>RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>1. Increase monk damage relative to warriors<BR>2. Provide monks a capability allowing them to stay active in encounters while still dealing damage<P>There have been MANY suggestions in this thread on how to implement both 1 and 2.  I think the simplest would be to:<P>A. increase flying kick damage in a substantial way post level 50 (making the damage increase non-equipment reliant); and<BR>B. change Feign Death so if used during combat, it does NOT require turning off auto-attack and works 100% of the time unless the Fallen to the ground message is received.<P>DETAIL<BR>I have played a monk to level 60, and below is my understanding of the areas of imbalance RELATIVE to the other classes I compete with for a SIMILAR role in an encounter: namely warrior and rogue, the other 2 primary melee classes.<P>There are two main elements to melee in everquest:<P>1. Damage absorption aka TANKING<BR>2. Damage dealing<P>The first area, tanking, has always been the domain of the warrior.  The warrior, given many hitpoints, and their defensive discipline as well as taunt, serves the encounter by <P>A. keeping mob attention on the player who can handle mob damage with taunt; and <BR>B. absorbing damage with an abundance of hitpoints/AC.<P>Looking at monk balance relative to a warrior for this role, we see the Monk is not equipped to shoulder this burden for the encounter.  In my opinion this is appropriate.<P>Looking at monk balance relative to a rogue for tanking, I find rough parity, the rogue having access to better armor (chain class vs. leather class) and the monk having more innate damage avoidance skills.  Again, in my opinion this is appropriate.<P>Moving to area number 2, Damage dealing, we must compare the Monk to BOTH Warrior and Rogue.<P>Damage dealing is a function of 2 things: a. damage output and b. time in encounter.  Lets look at how the monk is balanced RELATIVE to the warrior for these two items.<P>For A. Damage output, we see that the monk, based on the weapon ratio of the BEST monk weapon obtainable, the Celestial Fists, has a ratio of .56.  Lets look at warrior weapon ratios from weapons that can be obtained without great effort.  <P>With a 10/18 from necropolis a warrior can obtain .55, for 12/22 from Kael quest (takes 1 item to do quest) .54, for 13/23 scimitar from Skyshrine .56, 11/20 from necropolis .55, 10/28 from Wuoshi .55, and the list goes on.  I am going to assert for this discussion that Warriors can obtain weapons of similar ratio to the monk epic rather easily.  <P>For B. Time in encounter, we have already established that a warrior has HP and AC designed to keep them alive in an encounter while getting attacked.  The monk does not.  So with comparable damage output and greater resilience to damage, the warrior will actually do more damage in an encounter since they will remain active and dealing damage longer than a monk.<P>THIS IS THE FIRST AREA OF IMBALANCE.  Monk damage in an encounter should exceed warrior damage.<P>Now lets examine the rogue relative to the monk for damage dealing:<BR>  <BR>For A. Damage output, I am going to assume it is well known that rogues can achieve nearly twice the damage of a monk in a group setting, without breaking down weapons and special attacks.<P>For B. Time in encounter, the Rogue has the evade skill, which allows them to lose accumulated aggro preventing the mob from attacking them while they dish out damage.  The monk has no capability allowing them to remain active in the encounter if the mob takes a liking to them.<P>THIS IS THE SECOND AREA OF IMBALANCE.  Monks should stay active in encounters as long as rogues.<P>Lets review:<P>1. Warriors dealing nearly identical damage to monks have capabilities (AC/HP/DISCIPLINE) that allow them to remain active in encounters longer than monks<BR>2. Rogues dealing considerably more damage than monks have a capability (EVADE) that allows them to remain active in encounters longer than monks<P>CONCLUSIONS<P>1. Increase monk damage relative to warriors<BR>2. Provide monks a capability allowing them to stay active in encounters while still dealing damage<P>There have been MANY suggestions in this thread on how to implement both 1 and 2.  I think the simplest would be to:<P>A. increase flying kick damage in a substantial way post level 50 (making the damage increase non-equipment reliant); and<BR>B. change Feign Death so if used during combat, it does NOT require turning off auto-attack and works 100% of the time unless the Fallen to the ground message is received.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They suffer night blindness. <P>Iksar Monks get a 20% race exp penalty, super fast swim speed, forage, nightsight, a natural heightened regen, and better ac than human monk ( the difference gets higher as you level; it is about 90 more AC than humans at 55+.)<P>------------<BR>Proposition:<BR>------------<P>Let humans keep their no exp penalty.

I know of Iksar monks who do just that.  It takes work. But it is doable.  This allows Iksars to gain, through work, something that humans naturally have at birth.<P>Give Humans a quest that likewise lets them gain something that Iksars naturally have, a heightened AC.  Make it take work, but let humans change, through time and effort, just as the Iksars get to fix their faction, through the same.<P>I mentioned in a previous post a proposed Velious quest for human monks:<P> "Iksars can work hard and get what humans have, good faction. Allow humans to work hard and get some of what the Iksars have, especially, Serpent Sight (solved by the treant fist quest change I suggested above [note: I suggested putting serpent sight on Treant fists]), and most importantly, higher AC. Give humans a quest, a Velious quest that allows them to gain an inherent added AC equal to Iksar AC.  This is NOT unbalancing, the human EXP advantage is still offset by the Iksar regen that they RAVE about (tremendous soloing boost, in combat and mostly, does away with ALOT of downtime, can cut it in half or better vs human natural hp regen). <BR>Make the boost be granted by a quest NPC who states something along the lines of "Your superior devotion to the Order of the Whistling Fists is admirable. Unfortunately I am a poor, ice ravaged monk who can give you nothing. However your path to me was treacherous; surely you have honed and toughened your body from the journey, as befits a monk."  <BR>High lvl human monk AC in uber gear is only about 1080 or so, this would only add another 90 or so to that (bringing us close to Iksar monk AC) so it is not a HUGE increase but will nevertheless balance us out some so future BoTB's won't need some adjustment to compensate for the "weaker, punier" humans. [This happened in the last BoTB; after testing in duels, it was determined that Iksar AC was too much of an advantage so to offset it some, gear was allowed to be worn; Iksar AC was still higher even with gear].<P>Suggestion:<BR>Make this a quest ( this is everQUEST). Make humans work for this boost.  But let them have this opportunity.  How can we justify letting Iksars change their inherent drawbacks through labor, but not allow humans to do the same?  Make it as hard for humans to get as it is for Iksars to get good faction in the cities mentioned.<P>But make it an option. Thus the races can be considered more balanced, thru effort perhaps, but such, that Humans won't need "training wheels" to be able to compete in BoTB vs Iksar Monks. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
