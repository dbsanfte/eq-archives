</FONT><HR>Okay.  I agree with alot of what is being said here and just want to add my 2 cp.  Here goes:<P>1) Closer binds spots. Hey , at least I'm not asking for the bind affinity spell here.  <P>2) I agree that our taunt could use a bit of a "boost" somehow. Maybe just so it is "quicker" on cycle.<P>3) Damage output could use a bit of a "boost".    Nothing like being outdamaged by the pet of the Necro you have in your group. <P>4) Do something with disarm.  I honestly have no suggestions here but this skill sucks IMHO.<P>5) The Dwarven Racial armor just doesn't seem to be on "par" with some of the rest really.  Just could be me.  Some stats besides +FR would be nice.<P>Okay well that's about it.  Sorry for being so basic.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Number one problem is the damage out put of warriors its lacks so much i cant even taunt off the same level monk/rog with about the same weapons.This will fix the "taunt problem" by doing it this way instead of just making taunt better you give warriors a chance at soloing something that isnt green.<BR>Do are massive HP's make use better then monks/rogues ? no IMO HP dont mean much when you have all the HP giving buffs/gear that are around now days/ oh but warriors have awsome ac ?......With the super loot introduced in Kunark and Velious (SOS etc etc) a monk can come up with a respectable AC ... oh yea but monks/rogues dont have taunt? hmmm i refer the the above problem they taunt the mobs anyway with thier massive dmg...<P>Biggest problem of them all the non balance of Large race Vs /medium ,small race possible fixes as i see it? make AGI do something.... introduce better small/medium race only items.... give us a special ability that big race cant, after all they do get bash.......The faction excuse for teh big races is simply a joke Regeneration + 40 attack +300 hp Ability to bash just dont balance out with what you call the Advantages of teh small/medium Verant has to realize that not every warrior is a twink and knew what stats/race would be best<P>and last but not least the Laughable stats on the epic compared to the other pure melee classes i mean WTH they dont even come close to being even somewhat equal, and the difficulty is much greater ?!?!? i dont understand</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>  In general, I'm happy with the warrior class right now.  One of my high level characters is a level 60 warrior, and I have seen a couple of things I would like to comment on.   <P>1.  The level 60 warrior discipline (aggressive) is bugged.  It is supposed to increase your damage output by about 30-35% and also increase the damage mobs do to you by about 15%, and last for 3 minutes.  Based on quite a bit of my own testing, it does not add ANYTHING to the warrior's damage output, but mobs do hit the warrior a lot harder (It appears to me that the damage the warrior takes  may be increased by a lot more than you guys intended).  Basically, we get the bad part but not the good. <P>2. Drop rates on cobalt bracer and (ESPECIALLY) cobalt helm are too low.  Cobalt bracer drop rates are just a little to low, IMHO, but cobalt helms almost do not drop at all.  With RoK having been out for almost a year now, I still have only heard of ONE cobalt helm dropping on my server.  There may be 1 or 2 more that I don't know about, but that's still too low.  I know quite a few level 60 warriors (some of them in uberguilds!) that are still wearing a skull-shaped barbute, because anything better than that is extremely hard to get.  No level 60 should be using a SSB unless he recently lost his corpse.  <P>3. Taunt does not work as well as it should post 50.  A warrior's entire usefulness to the group depends on his ability to take the hits.  Post 50, ALL of the classes that get taunt have this problem, but at least hybrids can taunt with spells in an emergency.  Warriors can do nothing but click the taunt button and hope.  This means that the warrior's ability to taunt in a real emergency is the worst of the tank classes.  Monks and casters get ripped to pieces in many cases because we simply cannot taunt.   <P>4. Warriors got absolutely nothing new post 50 in Velious, while all casters and hybrids got new spells and/or abilities.  If you felt that warriors were too powerful and needed to be "stealth nerfed" I can understand (although I don't agree that warriors were too powerful).  However, it would have been nice to at least get a FUN new ability post 50, even if that new ability is useless in combat.  One of the rough things about playing a warrior is that gaining levels usually means nothing but a few more hp,  some skill increases, and a discipline that often is useless.  It would be nice to have one new ability post 50 (even something that is useless in combat) that would be just for fun.  Maybe a warrior-only animation that would look ferocious and scary?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   <P>5. Although I am currently happy with the warrior class, I am a bit concerned about the recent incredible series of hybrid enhancements.  Before I say anything more, let me say that I play a paladin at high levels also, so this is not just a warrior speaking that is trying to make his class powerful.  Many hybrids right now are asking to have their hp, ac, and melee skills increased to be nearly the equal of warriors.  The warrior class is very good, but they are a one-trick pony.  People invite warriors to groups right now because they are the best tank in the game.  Hybrids are more of a jack-of-all-trades type.  My concern is that if paladin and shadowknights get any enhancements to their tanking ability the usefulness of the warrior may quickly evaporate.  After all, who would want a warrior in their group when a paladin could tank almost as well, and also offer the following: 90% experience res, root parking (very nice for crowd control when no enchanter is present), superior heal, stun, buffs, Lay on Hands (vastly underrated ability -- even clerics do not get a nearly instantaneous heal that heals far more damage than  superior heal does.  Paladins may be the best class in the game for saving a player who is on the verge of death).  Again, don't get me wrong on this one.  I'm happy with the balance between warriors and hybrids right now.  I just don't want to see changes in the future that might weaken the warrior class more than you might realize.  <P>I apologize for the long post, but I've been playing a warrior almost every day since release, so I can't help but have a few ideas and thoughts here.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>From a SK's perspective, the main area where warriors need a serious boost is in their Taunting ability.<P>Whenever I find myself grouped with a warrior of about same lvl, there's no doubt he should be the main tank. Still, if I ever land a couple of DoTs or debuff spells a warrior will have a hard time getting a mob off me, even if I'm not Taunting at all, and using a 2-hander and he's using low delay dual wielded weapons.<P>And when it comes to an emergency and we have to get a mob off a caster FAST, a SK or pal are the only ones able to do that with a reasonable chance of success. A warrior has a well-below average chance of succeeding.<P>And it's not only against ubermobs, the problem is also there in 1 group situations.<P>An AE Taunt discipline or skill would be an interesting idea too, along that line.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are only two things that I think could be better with warriors, and I'm using a troll warrior specifically.<P>First is taunt. Taunt is not nearly effective as it should be. I realize that mobs want to go after the cleric to prevent me from getting healed, and that they really hate it when a caster hits them for an obscene amount of damage and then sits down. However, being a troll specifically, I am so much bigger than most mobs, I should be able to postition myself in such a way that there is no way they can get past me.<P>Maybe improvements to taunt could come in a different fashion. Maybe a skill called "hold" which would recycle about 1/2 the speed of taunt (or about the same cycle time as disarm) that has a rooting effect if successful. Or, along the lines of a 'instill doubt', I would like to see a "throw" where you move the mob back a few feet. It just doesnt seem that I, a 300lb+ troll (and thats a rough estimate, there don't seem to be any scales in EQ, at least not the kind I'm talking about) should have problems keeping a 115lb frog from attacking my cleric/caster. Maybe a taunt bonus for larger races against smaller mobs? (all you halflings shut up =p)<P>Next is Regen bonuses. Instead of baseing regen off how much hp per second (I.E. 2 Hp a tick), I think it should be based off a percentage of HP per sec (2% of your HP regened per tick). So in other words, if a warrior with a max of 2k hps and a druid with 900 hps were both at 1hp, they should both get back to full health at the same time.<P>Of course, you have to sit down to get this rate, as if you were able to do it in battle it would be severly imbalancing.<P>Just my thoughts =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If anything warriors are a little overpowered compaired to several other classes. We rank up there with rogues clerics and enhanters. <P>Warriors dont need anything to make them any better.<P>Just a couple of things that would be nice for all tanks(warriors, SK and paladin) would be an AoE taunt. Fighting multiple mobs makes it hard for a tank to keep everything on him. Bards and healers tend to get all the adds.

</FONT><HR>I LOVE BEING A WARRIOR!! LONG LIVE OLD SCHOOL HACK N' SLASH!!<P>As far as a balance and fun for warriors(i.e. more things to do) I have a suggestion. Everyone keeps complaining about the effectivness of Taunt, so how about a "specialized taunt" at level 30ish.<BR>Here's my idea:<P>You are the tank of a party casters, so your doing as much as you physically can to control the beast and have it focus on you. Melee and Taunt are your weapons to keep them damage free. But when things get hairy and a wizard is getting pummeled for obscene amounts of damage you use your new skill "GRAPPLE"<P>GRAPPLE - Level 30ish Skill in which a warrior full out throws him/herself at a mob. Effect is a doubley effective Taunt that has excellent chances of the monster focusing on you getting you off its back. <BR>The balance? Because your throwing yourself into this move to break him off, you can't deal any real Melee damage because of proximity so The Melee and Range Attack buttons are greyed for say 2 attack rounds. You can still kick, slam, bash, and taunt some more I guess, but you pull the mob onto you and give 2 free rounds of attack as if you were stunned, meaning no dodge or parry, just the chance it will miss you.<P>I think it's a cool concept, course that could just be me wanting to do more with my characters =)<BR>   I like a lot of what was said about high level HP increase, but I definetley don't agree with God specific skills or bonuses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow.  Incredible amount of great ideas running around out there.  Just one other small tidbit.<P>I play a dwarven warrior.  I'm still trying to figure out why.  Not sure why people would play a small/medium race warrior anymore.  In order for me to be as effective as a large race warrior, I have to sacrafice my offhand weapon for a shield to bash with, while they can continue to slam.<P>Would it be possible to enhance warrior kick for small/medium races to effectively slam/stun a MOB?  Basically kicking his knee or ... umm ... well, you get the idea?<P>Aside from that, I'll just reiterate what I agree with above:<P>Taunt increase -- allow us to get more attention<P>HP increase per level (be it all levels or specific or even over specific levels) -- allow us to take more damage<P>AC increase -- not sure if it could be tied into level or agility also, but a higher means of taking more damage<P>Ability to complete heal!

So for nearly the warrior entire life all he has to do is push auto-attack,tuant,kick,disarm....wait for the buttons to repop!Now i must admit, that can get a little on the boring side.I think the way that you could make a warrior and monks life more intresting and to take more skill is by giving very small abilitys (3) threw the thirtys and fortys, something that when the battle goes sour or just in a regular battle that the warrior must MAKE A DECISION and not do the exactly same thing over and over and over.<P>Hawin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I resent Absor's comment that warriors are fine the way they are.  There are far too many things that make us valuable in groups, but simple unable to get anything.  <P>There was an earlier post about a haste belt with +WIS,  now that is a ridiculous STAT to add to a haste item.  WHY are HASTE items ALL/ALL  since only a melee would want one?  or possibly a hybrid.  I don't often see Druids with a FBSS on.  <P>Next the Spell effects on the Cobalt armor is laughable at best.  Two pieces worth while are the bracers-effect:shrink(UBER rare drop) and the leggings-effect:invis(7 day spawn   AND rare drop Venril Sathir).  The CHESTPLATE is horrible.  Stats are nice but effect is laughable (LESSER SHIELDING)  come on!.  I don't see myself bothering to take on Trakanon for it. <P>I have not made 50+ yet, so I have no comments on disciplines. And I have only completed part of my epic quest. at the dragon scales part.and planar part.<P>I also agree with an earlier post, MORE warrior only weapons!<P>More HP's more AC, and bind wound...  sheesh this sucks!   takes me 40 bandages to get from under a bub to half health.  that is just terrible.<P>I agree that taunt needs to work better..  takes 3 or 5 or never as many times to get a big mob of my caster...<P>--------------snip--------------------<P>end rant!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i play wa warrior myself and i just want to say there are a few things that need inprovemnt, but not many. Look at our hps, we have pleanty we dont need more BUT without a cleric in your group your healer goes OOM just healing you after a fight, and god forbid you dont have a healer, bind wound sucks abut 2 stacks of bandiads to get your from 1 bub to 50% hp, and then you are just that, at 50%. Unless you have about 20kpp to spend on a regen tunic you can not fight effectively without a cleric/shaman/druid in your party! so here are my suggestions<BR>1) at lvl 25-35 give us a diciblne that gives us +10hp regen per tic for 7-15 mins with a 12 game hour ruse time, would let us kinda heal ourselves.<P>2) we are susposed to be the dmg kings but monks/rouges out dmg us, so i suggest like crips/crits we get a random ablity like say being able to do a "mortal wound" were we do about as much dmg as a crip + we inflict a dot on it that does a buncha dmg (not to much though) in like 10 rounds, and make it look like blood or someting fly outa the mob heehehe<P>3) we are fast enough if you take the time to learn how to vector (moving foward and strifing most normal mobs cant hit you, but giants/lions/shaman/druid type mobs can. no need to make a new quest for fast boots.<P>4) give us a super tuant...that makes the mob stick on us...givce it like a 5-10 min reuse time<P>5)many peeps get things (spells abilitys etc.) that give them more Ac then us, give more ac..please....pretty please with lil sprinkals on top..?<BR>_______________________________________________<P>now a few things that you proably wont do that would be cool.....<P>1) let us turn into a werewolf.....yea....<P>2)take the 100max skill in bind wound cap off us heheehe<P>3)give us a sword we can use that looks like the firy advanger(our epic lightsabers are cool but not that cool <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4)give all warriors on the inny server full quest armor from that dwarf city...yea thats a GOOD idea...and a CoF....hehe...oks mabey just a rusty dagger....<P>well thats all for now hope you read this hehe....<P>-Flippy Di`Virr<BR> -34 warrior on inny server<BR> -HALF ELFS RULE NORRATH<BR> -WARRIOR POWER</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is off a post from the Everlore Warrior page.  I found that it contained a number of good suggestions and thought that it should be posted here.  It was originally written by Ugglie Bogmonster from Quellious and posted on Everlore at http://www.everlore.com/guides.asp?ID=323258<P>--------------<P>I’m suggesting that warriors get a makeover and get a few skills on each of the timers (the kick/slam timer, the taunt timer, and the disarm timer) that they have now. I’m not asking for a bunch of extras, or unbalancing uber-skills, or anything like that. I’m suggesting that Verant substitutes out a few of the automatic skills (critical hits, crippling blows, and bezerker frenzy in its current form), and substitutes in some equally useful skills, but put them on the timers. I’m also suggesting that they put our class defining ability, the bezerker frenzy, on a button, instead of having it go off automatically.<P>This way warriors are constantly forced to make small tactical decisions, which are fun, interesting, and helpful to the group. If he gets badly jumped while pulling, he hits his guard button, giving him a defensive edge while he flees to his group. If they are fighting a named uber-mob, he may use his feint skill to lower its AC, allowing it to be hit a bit easier by his group mates. If they pull a handful of mobs, he may use instill doubt to frighten one off (this is a risk!), then taunt another off the wizard (as soon as it recycles), then hit guard again to survive getting whacked by four other baddies. If half a dozen low blues get pulled, he may push the bezerker frenzy button, giving his group an edge, taking out one of the mobs early in the fight. That one will take a while to recycle, but it was a worth while decision.<P>So after the overhaul, warriors would have kick, slam and guard on one timer, taunt and instill doubt on another timer, and disarm, feint, and charge on the third timer. And bezerker frenzy is now a button (and a tactical choice).<P>In addition, my suggestions have ease of implementation in mind, so that it would not take a team of programmers two weeks to change this stuff, with extensive play testing<P>Which way is more fun? More group friendly? More hard decisions?<P>In making these suggestions, I have a concern about fun. I think the warrior class should be a more fun class to play and, well, a LOT of the skills you get as a warrior go off automatically. Riposte is a great skill, as is dual wield, and double attack, and a bunch of others. Crits and crippling blows do some nice extra damage, too. But I’m not getting to decide when to use any of these, really, and I’d just like to make a few of those ‘hard decisions’ that Gordon Wrinn has spoken about along the way. In addition, most players who choose the warrior class enjoy strategy and tactics, and allowing them to make some tactical choices during combat would be VERY enjoyable.<P>In addition to all of that, warriors go loooooooong periods of time between getting new skills. You get double attack at level 15, then riposte at 25. Ten levels later! Ack! Well, at least you only have ten more levels before you get the ultimate in do nothing skills, disarm. Good thing its only seventeen more levels before you get your first discipline. Now patience is a virtue, but this is a bit much. Putting the skills I’ve suggested for the timers into the game would lower this extreme spacing between skills significantly.<P>Speaking of disarm, is anyone of the opinion that it accomplishes anything positive? It appears to me that if I have a Hill Giant hitting me for 80 pts a shot while wielding a FS scimitar, and I disarm him, he is still hitting me for 80 pts a shot and at the same exact speed. I know warriors who think disarm is so useless, they don’t even have the button on their hot key bank. If disarm caused some beneficial effect (making the mob run for a bit, or lowering its AC, or stunning it because of surprise, or something…) we’d all love it more. So disarm could be improved a little. Am I wrong about this?<P>Bezerker Frenzy, much like Harm Touch or Lay on Hands, should be a powerful tool to use in a save-your-skin type situation. I think it should be on a timer, much like HT or LOH, and recycle appropriately. If it were on a button, I would love the ability to decide when it’s used, not have it just go off automatically when I’m down to 40% of my hit points. I would love to see it become more powerful as warriors gained in level, either in its raw power, or in the reduction of its recycle time so it could be used more often. This change probably reduces the power of bezerker frenzy (as it could not be used as often), but would be worthwhile. This change is useful, it’s fun, and when to use it is one of those tactical ‘hard decisions.’<P>I think that Verant really hit upon a great idea when it improved the bind wound skill for warriors. This post-50 skill increases the skill cap to 200, and the maximum bind wound percentage to 70% of your hit points. Simply brilliant, and perfect for a class that lives on the battlefield and would certainly have the best skills as field surgeons, medics, first aid providers, and battlefield wound dressers. The problem is that it’s not that useful in the post-50 world, but it would be at lower levels. I just think that this should be implemented much earlier, perhaps as early as level 1, because it is group friendly (reduces the group down time between fights), gives warriors something to work on during those incredibly long gaps when they are not getting any new skills, and is unique to the class.<P>I would also like to suggest that a “Guard” skill be implemented. Warrior’s who use this skill take a somewhat defensive fighting posture for a few moments. This skill is on the same timer as kick/slam/bash, and raises the warriors AC by 20. Thus a warrior has to make one of those ‘hard decisions’, and it’s a fun tactical decision. Do I go for offense, and kick? Spell interruption, and slam? Or defense, and guard?<P>I think that instill doubt should be put on the taunt timer. Should the warrior taunt the mob into attacking him, or (in some tactical situations) attempt to frighten it away? Again, a fun, hard, tactical decision.<P>Putting instill doubt on the taunt timer is, to me, the most obvious skill that a warrior could possess, and warriors should be the unquestioned masters of it. Now I know that practically no one thinks ID is a great skill, and using it has its dangers, but from a role-play perspective, is there anything in the game more frightening that an ogre warrior in full crafted with a gigantic Ex Axe?<P>I believe that feint should be introduced as a warrior skill, and it should be put on the disarm timer. In this skill, the mid-level warrior feints his opponent out of position, temporarily lowering the opponent’s AC. Again, if put on a timer, it forces one of those ‘hard decisions.’<P>I would also like to suggest a charge skill, which would raise the warrior’s attack skill for a few moments. As I’ve suggested giving up crits and crippling blows, this offensive skill should not be a problem.<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In the high level game taunt is woefully inadequate and the taunt for two handed weapons should be equal to that of two one handers, Im a warrior not a ranger I want a big mean sword to bash enemies with and dont like having to use duel all the time when tanking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the balance topics, and a chance to be heard!<P>Problem: Warriors have the longest and most hazardous corpse recovery in the game. Since we are helpless without our equiptment, and have no skills or spells to aid us in evading mobs, one death often leads to more unless we beg for a free SoW.<P>Solution: Let warriors, or indeed everyone keep their melee weapons after dying. Warriors would still think twice about picking fights naked, but at least they would be less likely to suffer a humiliating and time consuming death at the hands of a mob they used to fight 10 levels ago.<P>Problem: Taunting effectiveness low.<P>Solution: Add a skill that increases the hate factor of warriors weapons (maybe replace disarm with it). Maxing at +50% more hate at 200 skill or so sounds right.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ou're right I was wrong.  It is Effect:Invigorate on Cobalt BP, DOH!  but still the vambraces is lesser shielding is a 1st level caster spell.  Trakanon is a psuedo shaman, make it one of the Talisman series.  For something that drops off Trakanon it should be uber, look at the cleric's BP.  even though they think that should be nerfed.  I think it if drops off a high level dragon, then let it BE what it is originally.

</FONT><HR>DISARM - Hmm, make it drop the weapon in monsters inventory and enabling high-level special weapon disarming too. Put a timer on the monster how fast it can re-wield it. Maybe this would make the silly skill worthwile practicing when you get it... and you realy could implenemt with this feature damage downgrade for the time the weapon isn't wielded. <P>Mmk?<P>Tguk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
