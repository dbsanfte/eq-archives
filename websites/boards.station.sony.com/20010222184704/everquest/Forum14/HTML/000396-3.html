</FONT><HR>I am heartened to see that Verant is opening considering many of the issues and concerns raised by the player.  Unfortunately, I am somewhat disturbed that the response is more akin to a child being given a shopping spree in a candy store.  As someone that has only played a shaman since EQ launch, I would like to offer some reasoned comments on Absor's post.  While I doubt my comments will be popular with all shaman, I consider my conclusions to be well reasoned, balanced, and reflect the limitation of the game engine running EQ.   Following Alan's structure:<P>ITEM: Healing.<P>What an issue.  Before RoK healing was not a concern.  With the lower hitting mobs and less resistance to the slow line of spells it was possible for a shaman to be a healer.  Not to say the shaman was a particularly good healer, but a group could kill for xp with a shaman healing.  A support group could do dragons/planes with a shaman healing.  With the release of RoK we found mobs that attacked faster and for more damage.  Mobs also, in general, were more resistant to slow spells.  This is even worse in Velious.  No longer can a shaman keep as a primary healer.  The problem can be fundamentally traced to one thing - Complete Healing.   Now, don't think I am begrudging clerics this spell, I am not.  But the capabilities of this single spell have clearly impacted the design decisions in RoK and SoV.  The power level of mobs are tied to the healing capabilities of this spell, and nothing a shaman has to heal can come remotely close.  Now I have seen alot of clerics dismiss CH in the recent discussions on healing upgrades; I wonder what game these clerics are playing - it is obvious that encounters in the two expansions are designed around the healing potential of CH.<P>Now, the best solution would be to eliminate CH.  This is NOT practical given the level of game changes that would need to occur to balance its removal.  Given shamans a heal even close to the efficiency of CH is also not a solution.  Torpor was a pretty good solution for shaman, but it comes late for most shaman (lvl 60) and has considerable limitations.  The solutions offerred on Test, while nice, don't begin to address the problem; they are only small upgrades in efficiency (2.3 hp/mana to 2.5) or offer quicker healing.<P>I would offer the following as a possible solution:<P>-- Move superior healing to 49th level.<BR>-- Move the new chloroblast to replace superior healing at 53rd. level.<BR>-- Add a new spell at level 56.  This spell should be along the lines of celestial healing: a very efficient heal over time.  This helps close the efficiency gap without greatly encroaching on clerics.  I would recommend 4 ticks at 180 hps/tick for 200 mana.  This gives a respectable 3.6 hp/mana ratio.<BR>-- Torpor : keep as is for now, there is nowhere near a concensus on the useablility of this spell.<P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>I have not seen this happen in last year plus.  Only time I have seen corpses poof is when the person who would have be "awarded" the kill is dead/LD.<P>ITEM: Group buffs<P>I am going to broaden this to buffs in general.  I want to touch on two points:  The cost/effect of the given spells and the effectiveness of those spells.<P>I have posted elsewhere, that I think the mana costs of the post-50 single target buffs are too high (with the exception of manical strength).  These buffs follow the the upgrade progression of the previous spells in the line (roughly +9 more stat, +9 more minutes duration).  Unlike the earlier upgrades though, they mana increase by +50 instead of +20.  The four single target stat buffs (Agi Sta Dex and Cha) should all have mana cost lowered to 120 or duration increased significantly. <P>The group version - these spell are just near useless.  Their mana cost is too high for second rate buffs (3.5x single target cost).  No other class pays this type of mana penalty for a gain in casting efficiency.  At worst, the multiple is 3x for some of the cleric group buffs, but those are actually useful for everyone in the group.  Without going into a long discussion, I would suggest one of two solutions:<P>-- Change effects to those of the top level single target buff.  This would also entail swapping the levels on the single target/group charisma buff.<P>-- Keep the same effects but lower the mana cost to 250.<P>Now, on the effectiveness of stat buffs.  I am somewhat disturbed that it seems many shaman following this board think all stat buffs are worthless.  It is as if they equate not desireable all the time to worthless.  This is my take on the individual buffs:<P>STAMINA - this is an excellent buff.  The hp/mana ratio is on bar with other hit point buffs and it stacks with all other hp buffs.  This spell is excellent.<P>DEXTERITY - my tanks ask for the spell, so I gather it has some noticeable effect for them.  Not a use all the time spell, but it has it uses (especially with weapons the proc easily).<P>AGILITY - the AC from this buff is noticeable, but it is unclear how much benefit is derived form 10-11 AC.  Maybe a great buff for monks; without extensive understanding of how AGI works it is hard to say it is more than a marginal spell.<P>STRENGTH - this is a highly situational spell.  It can add from 1-5% to average damage.  In a constant pull grind situation, this can be alot and this is a nice spell.  In a raid, this spell is sort of weak except to increase rogue backstab damage.  I think most shaman's concern with this spell is that it is a very small effect over a very long time.  Compare that to celerity which is a large effect.   One thing to think on - celerity is +50% damage for 16 minutes for 185 mana.  Manical strength lasts 120 minutes for 150 mana.  For manical strength to be AS efficencient as celerity it only needs to add +5.4% damage.  Just something to consider before calling this spell worthless.<P>CHARISMA - very very situational.<P>ITEMS: Alchemy.<P>Store sell back prices do not need to be increased.  If anything the problem lies with other skills that give too much return when selling to stores. <P>The stat/resist potions should really be simplified to just give a plus to one stat or resist.  This might help with solving alot of stacking issues.<P>ITEM: Pets.<P>Lower the mana cost by at least 200.  The power level is pretty much okay - our pets were never very strong.  I am somewhat concerned that the recent pet change lowered the max dmg pet by 2, but it is unclear if this was outweighed by the other positive changes.  Also regarding pets, would be nice if the level 50 pet buff, Spirit Quickening, had a longer duration.<P>ITEM: Spell Stacking<P>This really needs to be addressed.  There are just huge stacking issues with top end shaman spells and shaman spells and potions.  This really needs to be cleaned up.  Focus needs to stack with Avatar and with the rage line.  Fixing the potion stacking with these spells would also be nice.<P>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>If Iksar get JB armor I would suggest upgrading ogres/trolls/barbarians to get a nice racial AC benefit.  I know it isn't fun to not be able to get some nice items, but iksar have so many other benefits I don't see why they should get the armor too.  Someone commented earlier giving Iksar AC bonus was akin to ogres getting no-stun from front.  It is quite obvious this person doesn't play ogres much.  The no-stun is not a huge benefit - no where near 20 or more AC.  (I don't know exact amount).<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do not know who stuck the shaman class with the master of buff title but it needs to stop.  I mean when buffs do not affect the outcome to an encounter then who cares.  <P>Here are some defintions that I will put my personal touch on or spin if you will to try and show what I see as balance.<P>Tanks = Ability to be the focus of an encounter and stay alive until the encounter is over.<P>Healer = The ability to keep tanks alive for the harder encounters.<P>Crowd control = The ability to keep the tanks alive for the harder encounters.<P>Everything else is just fluff.  This is the way Verant has designed the high end game.  While other statagies can work with special encounters those are certainly the best 3 things to have for balance.<P>Now if your class does not fit into one of those three categories then your class does not have balance.<P>The problem is there is 14 classes and to try and fit them into one of those three roles is not going to be very easy or will it make much sense.<P>Verant designed encounters to be taken out with those three strategies in mind.  Intentional or not that is how solution to these encounters ended up.<P>The fix seems to be to add more variety that allows encounters to be taken out.<P>For example:<P>Debuff the mob so that tanks now can eliminate the encounter with no heals or the pitiful ones that 2 out of the 3 healing classes have.<P>DD damage that allows the tanks to continue being the focus of the encounter even though dd damage is exceeding the melee damage.<P>I mean right now you only have Tanks(a few classes), Healers(Clerics only), Crowd Control(Enchanters, maybe Bards, maybe another class or two in a very special encounter).<P>The rest of the classes do nothing but add fluff or a better than nothing scenario.<P>Now because this is the Shaman thread I will simply say.<P>Shaman as the only tank in the group is not going to affect the encounter.  I mean the group that started the encounter is either going to win or lose with or without the Shaman.<P>Shaman as the only healer- same thing.<P>Shaman as the only crowd controler - same thing.<P>Certainly other classes can say the same thing, and they do, because of the way encounters were designed (intentional or not).<P>So in short while I see you trying to make one or two changes to affect one of the three required abilities to be balanced (that would be healing) I do not see you achieving anything close to the goal of balance, even if everthing on your list is done.<P>I know I have put a very personal opinion and assumptions in this post but that was to try and get my point accross.  The reason for changes to all classes is to try and achieve balance.  Personaly I think you would have more luck balancing the classes by adjusting encounters to be taken out with more than just the three opions now( tank, healer, crowd control).<P>Good luck in your goal,<BR>Balductum... ¥</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been "resting" my shaman for a while due to above-mentioned problems and general disappointment. The following are a few solutions: <P><BR>Potions we need to be able to make:<P>Invisible(nerfed shaman invis, regular invis, greater invis)<BR>Bind(expensive, yes...but at least as critical as sow)<BR>Heal(lesser, heal, greater)-make them expensive for balance if you must.<P>Oh, and we are shamen right? Communicate with the spirit world and all that? <BR>I believe the shaman should at least have a self-only no-exp resurrect.<P>And while I have your undivided attention, everyone knows that our root and enstill lines are just a joke...I propose a new spell called "Stun Spirit"<P>Stun Spirit:<P>Level 55 Velious mob drop<BR>Effect: stuns and roots the caster and target.<BR>Broken by melee or DD attack on caster or target.<BR>No resist check.(its not magic, it's spirit)<BR>Duration ~30 seconds, plus one tick per level above 55.<P>Yes, I know enchanters can park mobs...but all other caster classes can do basically everything we can do as good or better, turn about is fair play? Might even make a spirit stun line starting at lvl 39 or so. <P>I hate to believe that all I'm good for is "feel good" buffs before a Raid or that my sense of worth is based on how many peridots I was able to bring the clerics.<P>We can't melee past lvl 20, our pets suck, and our greatest calling is virtually a placebo.

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor<BR>(Rehash of what we have so far aside from what I've said)<P>Jilariz-Xegony said, "Most of the Iksar classes don't have any "uber" armors until Velious (Iksar Monks for some reason can wear Shiverback), and as we all know, Velious isn't an easy place. It's awfully shortsighted to require the new playable race with Kunark to have to purchase the next expansion in order to get Planar-level armor (Plane of Air doesn't count...the majority of that stuff is a waste of time, Iksar or Non Iksar). To sum up, Iksar should be able to wear the JB armor, as it's part of Kunark...same with the other Iksar classes; Iksar Warriors should be able to wear Cobalt, Iksar SK's should be able to wear Blood Ember...etc."<P>Tamarac said, "Shamen, Iksar or not, are a Chain class and Verant threw us a cookie when they made our *chain AC* class armors have a Plate graphic. It is a visual. Nothing more. Thus there is no 'in-game' rationale for Iksar being unable to wear those three armor-sets."<P>Brandon2000 said, "Iksars should be able to use jaundice bone armor.

</FONT><HR>No shaman seriously uses the buffs off of JB armour.<P>The higher racial AC/Wis of Iksar almost completely negates the advantages of JB armour.<P>Iksar can use the superior armour in SoV.<P>The JB bracer is significantly over-rated in the the higher level game (unless you spend alot of time farming green crap).<P>So tell me, we give Iksar access to JB/RE armour.  Why does anyone play any other race shaman?  With access to those two lines of armour, Iksar have the best of everything.  Please don't counter with the same argument about no-frontal stun or higher STA.  The rare cast through a stun or the extra few hit points is trivial compared to all the advantages Iksar already get.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think a very low (lure level) resist slow would be nice.  I can't imagine if such spell should have any more than about 25% slow.  To give more (like the suggested 10% less than turgurs) is just overpowering.  A 25% slow would be noticeable on high end encounters without being total imbalancing.<P>Considering we have resist debuffs, I think the DoT resists are about right.  If you are having resist problems use the appropriate debuff.  If that doesn't work, you are probably fighting something that isn't intended to be magically damaged short of lures/taps.<P>Maloxxx line:  a slight upgrade on the resist level of this line would be nice.  I would think a -5 for malosi and -10 for malosini (negative being harder to resist) would be a good place to start.  I don't think I would like to see these changed off a magic save.<P>Self teleport potions:  No real need.  At low levels you really don't need them, at high levels the price is trivial.  Would be good to foucs on more impactful issues now and deal with alchemy later.  Alchemy works as is, just needs some tweaks to work well.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Responding to some other comments:<P>I think a +ATK buff would be very nice.  But need to take care here.  Rangers just got such a buff and I don't think it would be good to tread on their turf.<P>Yeah, haste upgrades would be nice.  I sort of always wondered why celerity was so late.  I don't know if getting wonderous rapidity is really worth anything.  With so many enchanters with the FA - most tanks want Shissar and nothing else.<P>I think the intent on the RoK amours was to offer an alternative to the more stat heavy planar armour.  Hence the RoK pieces have less wis (since only two pieces even have stats).  If you go look at the SoV class armour I think you will find that you can realize the +wis you are looking for.  With SoV armour I have no problem getting to 200 wis as an ogre with a base 90 wis.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am always amazed at the silly number put up regarding the JB bracer.  If you are chaining the JB bracer, you are not medding.  A medding/cracking shaman can regen (sustainable) in excess of 300 mana/minute.  More if using a fungal tunic, bear form, or troll.  With this mana you can cast an EB and do 1200+ dmg in 42 second.  So remind me how the JB bracer is so overwhelming powerful?  The JB bracer has one useful benefit.  You can clear cut greens with them.  On any thing worthwhile it is better to sit and med than click on that bracer.  I think most higher level shaman would much rather have 40+ (or whatever the Iksar racial AC bonus is) more AC than a low level right click DD.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, don't know what to say really. I hope you make it through this post b/c I know you prob won't like much of what I am going to say. I don't mean to "flame" you but some of the terminology, well, there is really no other way to put it /sigh.<P>First off after "6" class talk threads of 150+ posts each it is utterly ridicoulous that you only have a "basic" concenpt of the shaman class. You have settled into the "abashi" role very well of stroking the classes yet doing nothing. If you are not going to be a player advocate then you might as well just go back to stroking.<P>Lets go down the list.<P>ITEM: Healing<P>First and formost it even states in the RoK manual that ships with Everquest and on the original...And I QUOTE<P>"Shaman. Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentations and offensive spells as well."<P>Do you notice the "primary focus is healing" that even verant is publishing. Your line of "There is a general consensus that clerics are the only useful healers past 50th level" is a fact not a consensus. Shaman who were to be 2nd'ary healers are left behind this has been gone over time and time again. Granted I don't want to spend all my time healing but even with the proposed changes in healing druids come out over shaman at L60. The reason for this is that they do not have restrictions on their healing ability i.e. Topor is group only snares and slowes.<P>How do you fix:<P>Take off the slow component keep the snare keep the group only. This is just a proposed compromise but druids will still be wanted over shaman for healing at L60 b/c they don't want the side effects. Do something shees this is just one of many ideas that have been thrown out none of which you have even asked would be an acceptable compromise.<P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>This does not happen any more except for rare occasions which involove the killing blow being attributed to a PC who has turned into NPC mode due to LD. Not sure why it is even listed as a shaman topic b/c well its low very low on the list. It should be addressed with all the server problems not as a class problem. Did anyone even read my 100+ post thread on the problems with the E'ci server after Brad wanted "feedback"? My guess would be no.<P>ITEM: Group buffs.<P>You have a good grasp of this concept except for the point that buffs do next to nothing. They have been parsed to death by the players and show no improvement in combat. Post your e-mail and have the players send you their research.<P>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells.<P>Don't really have a grasp on this. Can-3 is the one that most people are complaining about since Can 2 is not accessable to most players due to it being a lower spell but in L45-50 dungeon (components).<P>Fizzle problems:<BR>Tal-x line<BR>Accumen<BR>Can<BR>Rage line<BR>Heals<P>Guess what all of these except for Div uses alteration as the skill check. "All"  shaman specialize in alteration and still fizzle like mad on these spells. If we specialized in something else then perhaps we could see the reason for the high fizzle rate but come on. Yes not all shaman specialize in alt but I would say 99% do.<P><BR>ITEMS: Alchemy<P>You have a grasp on this topic more or less. Point being for example on sell back prices it cost me 23K plat to get my skill to 150 or so. Guess how much of that I made back selling to the public = perhaps a 1000pp or so.<P>ITEM: Rage Line in General<P>You do not understand this.<P>This topic is more or less split down the middle in the shaman community. Half the shaman love the change half the shaman don't. I happen to love the new way the spell works. Should it be changed yet again? No<P>ITEM: Pets<P>How many times does our Dog need to be nerfed? It has been so 5 times now. Who cares if it has sow on it or not? Not many of the shaman thats for sure.<P>Spells in general:<P>While you list a number of them I don't think you yet grasp the problem or state it so that you do.<P>THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM! L60 shaman are still having to use their L49 DOTS b/c they don't drop. Coming close to a year now after RoK was released you have perhaps 5-8 coppies of BoN per server and perhaps 10 PoX. This includes the ones coming out of veeshan peek that 99% of the players don't have access to. Either put them on the spell vendors like druid have or make them questable. But fix the problem with the rare spells. State it like you understand. If I walked into a meeting and said well the shaman think it is to rare a drop the designers will say well of course they do b/c a few don't have it. STATE THE NUMBERS or do research on it. 6-8 coppies per server after a year for BoN is stupid.<P>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>This is not a shaman issue. Those playing Iksar knew when they created the character there were restrictions on armor they can use. Get over it.<BR>Issues not addressed.<P>You made a post that was published on EQVault about handing out class abilities. Specifically about enchanter wearwolf form. Funny how you don't go to bat for the shaman Shrink line getting handed out to none other than Tanks. Thank you for your concern.<P>Sky quest items.<P>Seems you missed this all together.<P>Shaman have zero reason to go to sky unless they are a fatty and want the shoulder piece. Hell even druids get a haste belt from sky. Shaman get zippo. Every item besides the shoulder piece (only for fatties)has a better replacement in L35-50 dungeons and can be gotten solo.<P>Dunno what else to say really. I think it was a really poor job on your part since you still don't grasp what the issues are and to be honest I don't think you will.<P>I guess I can say thanks for at least trying which is something Abashi never did.<P>Targar WolfTamer<BR>58 Shamy of E'ci <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Overall, I think that this list is a good one, and addressing many of these issues would make my shaman more fun to play again.<P>While I would love to see stat buffs be more useful, I think it is unrealistic to expect that be addressed here, or at all.  A change to the way that stats work would not just balance shaman and our buffs, but would monumentally affect GAME balance.  If people posting here would stick to the list Absor presents and clarify the current issues on the table, the thread would be a lot shorter, readble and productive, imo.<P>The problem is only if Absor/VI continues to regard our primary role as "buffer".  We don't WANT that role, because it is not a worthwhile one.  If they instead realize that we are DEbuffers and Healers FIRST, and that changes to these areas are more important -- well, that is the battle I would prefer to win.<P>ITEM: Healing.<P>Saying "This is the Cleric's turf" is just not right.  We ARE healers.  We should not be as efficient, but we should be competant.  Torpor is not the answer because it doesn't come until 60, it can't be cast out of group (when at 60, you're NOT in 6 man XP groups, you are on MULTI-group raids), and Torpor doesn't stack.  Two shaman can not replace one cleric because the only spell that heals more than 1000 hp can not be cast by both of them at the same time.<P>If the changes on test go live, and Torpor is fixed so it can be used out of group (removed negative effects) or a second Heal spell is added that does comparable healing (even if for more mana), this may be enough.<P>If a cleric can heal 3-5k hp in 10 seconds, one of we secondary healers (shaman/druid) should be able to heal HALF of that in the same 10 seconds.<P>---<P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>From my experience, this is *mostly* fixed, and the problem is making players *beleive* it.  But I appreciate that you are staying aware of the issue.<P>---<P>ITEM: Group buffs.<P>On the money.  While stat buffs are marginally useful, when we cast them, people expect the best.  Make them equal to single target versions at a minimum.  Giving them a longer duration for the appropriate mana cost would be a bonus, letting us waste less time on something we consider of lesser importance.<P>---<P>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells.<P>It's Cannabalize III that fizzles too much.  Canna II is fine.  Rage, Superior Heal, Acumen, Talisman of Jasinth and Shadoo all fizzle an embarassing number of times, well past the level we obtain them, and far more so than other spells of similar level of the same "type".  <P>I can cast Talisman of Kragg (abjuration, level 55, buff) with a normal and reasonable number of fizzles, but Talisman of Shadoo (abjuration, level 53, buff) or Rage (abjuration, level 49, buff) fizzles as much as 6-10 times before casting.  <P>---<P>ITEMS: Alchemy.<P>A good description of the changes desired.  Just want to add a note to the potion stacking.  It's not a problem with the "high level" potions -- its a stacking problem with high level spells that raise more than one stat/ability.  <P>For example.  The "Null" potion, in any strength, raises Magic Resistance and Dexterity, and lowers Agility.  Null will stack with all shaman cast dexterity AND agility buffs.  It stacks with other Magic Resistance buffs.<P>But it does not stack with spells that raise Agility PLUS someting else.  The Enchanter epic Speed of the Shissar effect includes an increase to agility, in addition to its stamina regen and haste components for example -- and it overwrite "Null".<P>Null with stack with Acumen (stamina regen), Deliriously Nimble (agility buff) and Celerity (haste spell) simultaneously, but won't stack with Speed of the Shissar.<P>Since each potion raises one item by lowering another, it would be difficult to list ALL the potions and ALL the spells they do and do not stack with.  <P>Fixing this will take a serious revamp of spell stacking in general -- or just remove the negative effects to all our potions  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Rage Line in General.<P>While its true the changes to the spell line altered it from a last ditch spell to a buff, I for one LIKE this buff, mostly.  <P>I never used the frenzy line previously, now I use it regularly for the extra AC.<P>It is plagued by stacking issues, however.  It increase Str, Dex, and Agiligy, and stacks with single target strength spells, but not single target dexterity spells.  Since I cast my stat buffs on myself first, then my tanks second, so that I know when to recast them, this spell is less useful.  It should stack with all stat buffs if the spell remains in its current state.<P>---<P>ITEM: Pets.<P>Uhm -- I don't know ANY shaman that recasts thier pet until they get the best one.  If you beleive that, you are gravely mistaken.  <P>Necros and Mages may do this because they have items/spells that allow them to recover the mana spent on the pet, and can recast nearly indefinitely until they are happy with thier pet, but shaman do not.  <P>At 850 mana a pop, I could MAYBE re-summon my pet 3 times, and be totally out of mana, and would probably still not have the max pet.<P>The general increase of level in the 55 pet has been helpful.  My pet can now occasionally hit critters that are high green/low blue at 55.  However, by 60, the things shaman are fighting are once again far too high for the pet to be of much use.<P>From level 34-49 we got a new pet every five levels.  Why didn't we get a pet at 54 and 59, instead of just one at 55?<P>If the current pet was received at level 54 (and yes, its WAY too expensive, the giant mana leap from the 49 pet is a mystery to most of us) with a second pet at 59 that was a few levels higher -- not even any better as far as hit points, ac, etc -- just a few levels higher so that it could HIT the things that we fight at 59, if someone else is tanking for it -- I would be ecstatic.<P>---<P>ITEM: Torpor.<P>I am a handful of blue bubbles from level 60, so I haven't cast Torpor yet, but from reading other shaman comments and thinking about the spell, I am worried about it as my primary healing option.<P>1. At level 60, a shaman is unlikely to be in a six man experience group, they are far more likely to be on multi-group raids.  Torpor can ONLY be used in group, making it difficult to aid others on the raid.<P>2. Because Torpor is a "regen" type spell it doesn't heal if the person has a DoT on them?  This is extremely dangerous!  I understand that changes are in place on Test so that spells that do not take hold will not consume mana -- but it makes this spell (our mainstay of healing at 60!) risky to use.<P>3. Does Torpor act like the "celestial" spells and put a blinking Healing Hand in the buff list?  I already run into situations where I can not buff someone further because they have 15 buffs.  Are you saying I will be unable to heal people if they have 15 buffs?<P>---<P>ITEM: Rage Line stacking with Focus.<P>I mentioned this above in the Rage "ITEM" above.  It's the same issue with alchemy potions.  Spells/potions that raise a combonation of stats/abilities have stacking issues in general, even when the individual components cast separately stack with each other.  To track down ALL these spell/potion combonations would require a thread to itself.  Something that probably needs to be done, but this thread is weighty and lengthy enough without all the specific examples.<P>---<P>ITEM: Stacking of Curse of Spirits.<P>I beleive this to be a bug.  Curse DOES stack with these spells, but ONLY if cast first.  If I curse, then a necromancer casts "splurt" or an enchanter casts one of the Choke spells -- I do NOT get a message "your curse of the spirits spell has worn off".<P>However, if those spells are cast FIRST, then my spell does not take hold.<P>If these spells are not supposed to stack, then those spells should not be able to be applied over my spell either.<P>---<P>ITEM: Cannibalize II quest.<P>Canna II *is* less "efficient" in mana:hp ratio, but being able to take larger chunks and hit the canna button less often was nice.  (In fact, I would personally love a Canna IV at 60 that took even larger bites, efficent or no, just to save time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P>Giving an alternate method to obtain the crushed dread diamonds helped make this spell more obtainable.  However, the grayish bone chips are still extremely difficult for the level that this spell is intended to be scribed.<P>It might be nice to add a sub-quest for an alternate method to obtain the chips for those without high level friends to badger for assistance.<P>---<P>ITEM: Avatar.<P>Especially with the addition of Boon of the Garou (avatar and boon have the same recast time and duration, I beleive), this spell is even more laughable.  15pp to cast a spell that is only a touch "better" than a component free version the enchanter gets is just crazy.  In addition, its a multi-stat/ability raising spell and plays havoc with other buffs.<P>Either remove the component so that a shaman can *afford* to keep the spell on one tank all the time (given the duration and recast, one tank is all you can really do) the way "Boon" is used.  Or keep the component cost and make it last a reasonable amount of time.<P>While I personally would prefer the latter route (rebuffing every 6 minutes is going to get tiresome, I don't even like recasting celerity every 15 minutes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">) the spell itself is fairly impressive and the ability to Avatar multiple tanks on large high level raids might be a bit overbalancing in our favor.<P>---<P>ITEM: Shrink Spell.<P>This sure seems like a minor issue to me.  Potions suit me fine in outdoor zones.  /shrug<P>---<P>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>Right now Troll, Barbarian, and Iksar all have advantages and disadvantages making it a debatable choice.  While there's no compelling game reason to choose Ogre (except RP/fun reasons, which shouldn't be discounted),  there is no "best" shaman race.  A person can weigh the advantages and disadvantages and go with what they like best. <P>But like a previous poster, I think that altering the iksar wearable armor would make Iksar THE shaman choice, leaving only the (repairable) faction issues to deter the lazy and/or squeamish from choosing this race.<P>---<P>ITEM: Malo line of spells.<P>Nod.  I rarely use the "Mal" spells, although they "should" be a staple, like the Tash line.  Most of the time it is cheaper and easier to recast a spell twice to get it to stick than to cast Malx and then the other spell, because MalX is just as likely (if not more so) to be resisted.  <P>It's silly to cast Malosini two (or more) times until it sticks, and then cast Turgurs, for a total mana cost of 650, when I can just cast Turgurs twice for 500 mana.<P>About the only time I use the Mal line is when I personally am not having resist issues, but there is a lower level caster in the group that can't get thier spells to stick, and getting thier spells to stick is critical (Like a druid/ranger having trouble snaring).<P>Because Malx lowers resistance by so much more than tash making it UNresistable like tash might be overbalancing, or it might not if you consider that shaman are SUPPOSED to be THE debuffers, not enchanters.<P>Regardless, making it resist against disease would make another shaman spell line useful (our spell line that ends in insidious decay that is a disease resist debuffer only) and make it stick more often than it does resisting against magic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to add some talking points to those raised and clarify on some others.<P>New Point: Plane of Sky Quest items<BR>With all the new items in Kunark, Velious and the Hole - the shaman "quest" items from Sky are a joke. Every last one of them is inferior to something obtainable by a single group in a dungeon now. Please re-evaluate the stats on these items in light of the difficulty to acquire them and the other items available for those slots. As of right now, shaman have NO reason to ever go to Sky. <P>Item diversity: <BR>There is currently a lack of low level "good" spears for shaman - and a corresponding lack of "good" high level 1hb weapons (although there have been some added recently). Also, with the advent of the shaman epic spear and other new items - there really isn't a "good" 2hb weapon for shaman now. Similarly you see many high level shaman using the same exact items. <P>Clarifications:<BR>Healing - the proposed changes are a step in the right direction, but Remedy at 55th will be utterly worthless. Yes it is a slightly better heal in terms of ratio - but it will only heal 400pts or so - which is an eyeblink at 55th level. What is needed is an approximately 1000pt heal - similar to what the druids now are getting at 60th, anything less is a waste and I will be casting sup heal instead. By the time you start casting a heal at 55th - the monster hitting easily for dual 175s and kick/bashing for 50-60+ will have already done more damage than a remedy will heal. <P>Alchemy:<BR>Alchemy is already usefull - but only at its highest levels and the costs to get there are outrageous. The costs/sellback need to be looked at again, as well as perhaps the skill caps - as it stands now even a 60th shaman cannot hit 200 skill in this. Allowing us to make the currently store bought potions would also be a good way to fill in the midlevel potions. Stat/Resist potions are unsaleable currently because of cost and negatives - removing the negative side effects to improve desireability seems warranted. <BR>Reagents - fix the levitate and enduring breath potions to not need components<BR>Fix: Kilvas blistering flesh and kilvas skin of flame<P>Buffs:<BR>Our group buffs need to be more usefull - make them act as top of the line buffs and last longer. Also Talisman of Shadoo/Jacinth should do more - as is they are exclipsed by things like Dead Man Floating. <BR>Combination buffs - we could use a few more buffs that provide multiple benefits.<P>Malo-line of spells:<BR>These spells are resisted way too often for a spell intended to reduce resists on hard critters. Why should I bounce malosi four times off something when casting the spell I want to land 3-4 times will get it through anyways? These spells should probably check with more of a bonus or against some resist other than magic. <P>DDs: <BR>We'd like to see an reevaluation of our highest DD - it's ratio seems badly out of whack with other 50th+ DDs. Also a 50th+ poison based DD would be very nice<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Shamans have absolutely no right to infringe on a cleric's domain.<P>A shaman can solo at X level of effectiveness.<BR>A cleric can heal at X level of effectiveness.<BR>Shamans should be as good at healing as clerics are at soloing. Same with druids, too.<BR>"But it would be fun and useful if shamans could heal better than they do."  Yes, so?  It would also be fun and useful if clerics could do all sorts of things that they suck at, but it's not going to happen.  Clerics get groups easily?  I'm sure that's true.  And clerics NEED groups to do anything remotely worthwhile.  Shamans can get a lot accomplished as they are right now, much moreso than clerics in most respects.  Where did one of you shamans say "Let us heal better, but also give clerics a pet, the ability to slow mobs, the ability to convert health to mana, etc."????  <BR>I know, you don't enjoy any of the logic you see in this post.  You simply want better healing abilities and see no other side to it.  But you didn't choose to be a cleric or suffer their shortcomings, or anything remotely like their shortcomings, so you do not deserve the benefits that clerics do have.  The group that says a their shaman is not a good enough healer ought to have a cleric with them, or accept the limitations of a second-rate healer and move on.<P>Leave the healing to the clerics.  Be glad you are a class that both groups very well and solos adequately.  I'll stop this post now, rather than go into the multitude of examples of why shamans do not need an upgrade in their healing ability (when viewed as part of a MUCH larger picture).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1.  Remove negative side effects of Torpor<BR>2.  Lesser versions of Torpor at 55 and 49 perhaps?  <BR>3.  Avatar is just crappy stat buffs...add SLTW effect to it..make it interesting or useful.<BR>4.  Just remvoe stat buff spells altogether since we all know they dont do anything.<BR>5.  Talimsan of Kragg etc.. should stack with shield line of spelsl and cleric self buff.  A few hundred hit points really isnt going to make the game overbalancing.<BR>6.  Alchemy is not the most important part of being a shaman.  So dont think by fixing a few potions the shaman class has been fixed.<BR>7.  Wirgirs (if you shoudl be lucky enough to find it) is a waste of a spell.  Better off casting Turgur's.  Add a lure compnent to it or self mana or lifetap..something to make it interesting.<BR>8.  Do spells like Incapacitate actually do anything?  How about replacing it with a spell that stuns every tick/randomly or every other tick?<BR>9.  Group chloro please<P>Well I could keep going but Verant sees us as the masters of stat buffing which everyoen knows doesnt do anything so this is all wishful thinking.  There si nothing that makes us unique as a class.  Every other class can do what we do but a lot better ..excpet stat buffs...so guess everything is the way it was meant to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DeaDPooL99 said, "letting Iksar wear all shaman armor will throw everything out of whack and all shamans but Iksar will be pissed off, because their will be no down side, but many benifits"<P>No downsides?  I see, so, you've never played an Iksar.<P>Faction: Iksar are KOS by every other playable race.<BR>Quests: Iksar have access to fewer quests than any other race.<BR>Bash: Iksar shamans lack the bash skill and have no way to stun an opponent.<BR>Hitpoints: Iksar have by far the fewest hitpoints of the shaman races.<BR>Strength: Iksar shamans have inconveniently low strength to the point that full banded is a weight management challenge.<BR>...And this is just off the top of my head.<BR> <BR> <BR>At one point Iksar didn't even have mid-level class-specific armor quests.  But I suppose you thought that was imbalancing too when the stats were almost identical to totemic?<P>It was also mentioned that Iksar monks and necromancers are not limited in the armor they can wear.  Perhaps this is because of the fact that races are balanced by innate abilities and not by items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DWILGAR seems to be one of the few people who doesn't get it on stat buffs.<BR>STAMINA-Good hp buff,true but this is just a 10 point upgrade.Which means you gain 20 hp's over the previous line not 125.<BR>DEXTERITY-Some tanks want it,its more a placebo effect than anything else.Who could believe raising dex from 120 to 170 wouldn't have much effect.<BR>AGILITY-Again this is a 10 point increase from previous spell,it gives additional 4 ac not 10-11.<P>STRENGTH-Again this is merely a minor upgrade from previous strength,with perhaps a 1% increase in hitting power.If you add 50 strength perhaps you get an additional 2-3% increase in damage when you perhaps increase strength 30 percent and merely get a 2-3% increase in damage it shows how little these do.<P>When figuring value of a spell you must include increase over a previous one if its merely an upgrade.Otherwise you could for example give clerics superior heal at say 34 and then each new spell level give them new heal that heals 1 more point.A 601 heal spell is better than a 600 right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
