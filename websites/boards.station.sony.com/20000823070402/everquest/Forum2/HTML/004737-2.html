Further ensuring that no casual player will ever lay hands on "good" equipment.<P>This event is just pushing the elitest uber-guild environment.  Now a few powergamers have the opportunity to get some special title.  Great....as for me, I'll stick around Cazic Thule, Mistmoore and SolA.<P>Maybe you call me jealous because I'm not of level to participate in this event....to a degree I am.

</FONT><HR>Im sure it will be interesting to see those elite uber guild few who make it to the test server for the finals. But then again, we won't get to see the fights will we?...<P>Maybe if you enlighten us on the events you have planned for other level ranges you won't get so flamed, but by singling out such a small fraction of the community for an event of this caliber, is like a slap in the face. Maybe if you did the same thing for varying level ranges...or an event like posted above...that is PvE not PvP (EQ is PvE, not PvP)...<P>oh well i won't keep my hopes up. at least it is a start...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Let's pertend a level 55 player wins on thier server.  Why would a level 55 player be thrilled that thier title is going to revert back to when they were level 51?

</FONT><HR>Since I announced the large scale events without giving the knowledge of the others involved, it appeared that we were ignoring the other types of events.<P>Below is a complete listing of events that are coming up, but there are some non-combat events that are being worked on, but still in the testing phase.<P>The event being held on all servers with the warriors is an example of a Tournament Event.  We are taking it to the next level with the multi-server compeition.<P>Tournament Series Events<BR>&#61623; The “Tournament” Series Events are designed to be held in addition to the original “Test” series events.<BR>&#61623; These events are class specific for those not wishing to engage other classes that are of similar kind to their own class, or compete in a smaller sized event (2 hours is target length).<BR>&#61623; These events are designed to have a lower entry fee as the target audience is much more specific.<BR>&#61623; Anti-Twinking rules are currently under review, and maybe acted upon at anytime by the Event Master of Verant Interactive without warning.<BR>&#61623; All of these events are designed as single elimination, standard bracket tournaments.<BR>&#61623; All of these events are designed as player vs player events.<BR>&#61623; Tournament Series Events are being designed as the standard, and most run event on the servers.<BR>&#61623; Tournament Series Events are designed for all levels in mind.<P>Test Series Events<BR>&#61623; These are the Original Series of events that were designed to put similar classes up against similar classes for a more broad range of player involvement.<BR>&#61623; These are designed to be high entry fee (Lx10 plat), long lasting (4 hours or greater in length), and high competition events for those wishing the “Big” Event atmosphere.<BR>&#61623; All of these events are designed as single elimination, standard bracket tournaments.<BR>&#61623; All of these events are designed as player vs player events.<BR>&#61623; Test Series Events require and will always require a Game Master to be present and run the event.  Test of Tactics requires an Event Master to be present and run the event.<BR>&#61623; Test Series Events are designed for high level players.<P><BR>Challenge Series Events<BR>&#61623; These are single player vs. environment (True NPC’s) events designed to test game knowledge and “Challenge” even the greatest of players to their limits.<BR>&#61623; These are designed to be very class specific and level specific, with a low entry fee (LxL in Gold) for short timed (2 hours or less) events that many can enjoy.<BR>&#61623; These are designed as an achievement level event, meaning that players will have to overcome different levels of creatures and continue to overcome creatures to the point of death or request by the player to cease the Challenge to achieve the final score.   The character who defeats the most amount of mobs does the best in these events.<BR>&#61623; Challenge series Events are designed for all levels in mind.<P>Competition Series Events<BR>&#61623; These are single group or multi-grouped events that pit players against predetermined NPCs in a race to defeat these NPCs to achieve a time to be judged not only server wide, but game-wide as well<BR>&#61623; Competition Series Events are designed with no entry fee and no prizes, simply for “Bragging Rights” to other groups, other guilds, and other servers.<BR>&#61623; These Events are designed to be very short in length (60 minutes) at the request of specific guilds to achieve a time to be competitive against other times that have been scored.<BR>&#61623; The Competition Series Events are still in final testing, more will be released about these events in the future.<P>I hope this clears up a lot of the questions.<P>=)<P>Dae<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>*sigh*<P>Well it's really good that Verant is doing an event like this, but the event itself just sucks.  The idea behind a special event is (well, should be) to involve as many people as possible, with as few resources as possible.  Trust me, I've run enough 150+ person LARPs to how how to do that.  -- This ain't it.  Tournaments are fun for the participants and usually pretty boring for thre rest of us who just get to sit around and watch.  Only we don't even get to sit around and watch.  How much do I care?  None.<P>Let's see an event that would let anyone on a server participate, regardless of class, level, guild, etc.  It can be done if you're willing to put some thought into it.  Actually it doesn't require that much thought.  Let's take someone like Mayong Mistmoore:<P>MM has decided, "screw this vampire crap, I'm going to be a god."  To achieve godhood he needs to complete the ritual of godhood-ness at the hour of yadda in the place of blah blah.  Unfortunately the ritual will be taking place in a heavily guarded area and MM has conjured up additional forces to see to his victory.  His fortress has been made almost impenetrable by magical shielding and there is no way anyone can get in to stop him.<P>However (insert name of person here) has discovered that Mayong is calling upon ancient magics developed by the Combine Empire.  These powers can be defeated by expending massive amounts of magical energy and channeling it through a device.  Unfortunately that device was split up into pieces that have been lost for thousands of years.<P>Thus begins the "Dance of the Seven Pinecones" (term used when a bunch of people have to collect a bunch of things to solve a quest).  Scattered throughout the game are various chunks of the artifact that must be found, recovered, and reassembled in time to defeat Mayong.  Chunks of the artifact can be scattered across damn near every zone so people of all levels can participate in the "scavenger hunt" part of the event.  Maybe the device will work if the entire thing is not built, maybe there are parts to make more than one.<P>Now, I did say that this device requires massive amounts of magical energy, didn't I?  Well there are fortunately several dozen sites across norrath that provide focus points for magical energy.  Devices could be constructed (or perhaps there are existing artifacts) at these locations that will channel the energy into the central artifact.  Now, unfortunately, Mayong knows this as well.  As the PCs start to activate the items to call forth the magic, his minions will assault them and attempt to distroy the various artifacts and disrupt the attempt to thwart their master.<P>Of course Mayong can't afford to hire hordes of incredibly powerful bad-guys.  Perhaps a war-band of goblins ( &lt; lvl 10) would attack in one location, some orcs ( lvl 15 to 20) in another, and all the way up to creatures you'd normally see on the planes in other locations.  Naturally the most difficult fight of all will come when Mayong's magical protections are stripped away and his keep must be assaulted...<P>What you have there is a real event people.  Something that could entertain the entire population of a server for a whole weekend.  Each segment of the event is broken up into appropriate levels so that EVERYBODY can contribute its success (or failure).  Natrually, the final assault is going to be the most glory-grabbing, but that final assault can depend on something joe newbie found out in Crushbone.<P>Can you imagine hacking down hordes of Gnolls out in South Karana, while you wonder what is going on in Mistmoore?  If you fail then the party assaulting Mistmoore has no hope, but the Gnolls won't stop coming until Mayong is defeated.  Oh dear...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Interesting idea, I'll be curious to see if all of the cynical speculation perpetuated here holds true. However, I do have one suggestion.<P>Allow players not participating to view the event.<P>Ideally it would be great if you could set up a server devoted solely to these events (NOT test server) and give people logging on "participant" or "spectator" privilidges. The former would have their characters copied over, the latter would have no physical form, but would be able to F9 (change camera views) around from various present camera spots in the Arena and/or from the perspective of each of the combatants. If such a thing was implimented, I am certain that TONS of the player base would attend in the hope of gazing upon some high lvls duking it out.<P>Now, if that isn't doable (due to server load and/or programming limitations) the next best solution would be to post MPGs of each battle on www.everquest.com so that people can watch the events after the fact.<P>I love the idea itself, but I think that one of the two options above needs to be implimented so that any EQ player can get some level of enjoyment from a tournament such as this.<P>All thoughts, comments, and flames are welcome =)<P>-------------------<BR>-Zekris Shadowblaze<BR>"May the shadows never succumb to the light.."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Tournament Series Events<P>Just wondering, why are most of these events geared toward awarding people in uber guilds over talent/skill?...This series of events will most likely be won by an uber guild member(s).<P><BR>Test Series Events<P>Sigh. More PvP. Can you honostly tell us every class has a fair chance at winning this? I can think of several, the way PvP works right now, that would lose 9 times out of 10.<P><BR>Challenge Series Events<P>Just curious how, lets say, this would work for a Rogue? The absolute least soloable class in the game? Or a Warrior? Both of whom cannot heal at all. Maybe they can get 1 kill, then they would die.<P><BR>Competition Series Events<P>Sounds like this would be really fun. On another note...this could be the most fun, and has the most relevance to Everquest as a game, and yet there is no prize for this series of events specifically?...<P><BR>75% of these events are solo events. 99% of Everquest is grouping. I am just curious as to why the imbalance is so large? Granted these events will be very fun to observe on PvP servers, where solo fighting for your life happens on a daily basis, but on blue servers where most of the game is done in groups?...I hate to keep sounding like i am shooting down your ideas Dae, i really do like the attempts and thought put into all this, but for Everquest grouping and PvE is the core of the game, these events ignore that fact.<P>I can only think of one more event btw =)<P>Groups vs Groups ... PvP. I agree, it isn't PvE...but at least it is more multiplayer (in this multiplayer game) than 1on1 fighting...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok I'm in a pissy mood so I'm going to throw in my 2 cents here:<P>1) Most of these tests are nothing more than highest level & Item holder takes all.  It's been evident in the past, and will hold true in the future.  In a few rare occasion, tactics might be involved, however with the higher level folk, there is nothing that will make a difference against a foe more than a level or two above you other than pure equipment availablity.  <P>2) Where are the EVENTS.. you know the ROLE PLAYING KIND... Seems they are quick to announce the PVP stuff, but thier "CLAIM" on why they wont' announce the roleplaying stuff is because the servers can't handle the number of people that would attend.  DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHIGN!  People don't want to see 1 on 1 Ogre warriors fighting each other, they want Roleplaying events which they can particiapte in, wasn't that the "Motto" of Everquest way back when?<P>3) If you must spend resources on "Player vs Player" events, and want to make it interesting , equip the warriors with the SAME items, SAME levels.  That way you'd be sure to keep it truely the 'BEST', (OF course you may realize that the test is nothing more than a simple roll of one lucky die, but then again you know that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>4) The only GOOD event I see there is the "Group" event, at least there you can have a varied tactical force to oppose.  Who'd win a group of 3 mages or 3 necros? Do you include a cleric or a shaman?   Etc... So long as the level requirements are TIGHT (mabye a level or two max difference) then the games would be somewhat fairer as any piece of equipment can be overcome and defeated by the appropriate classes, after all interdependency is what the entire EQ engine is based off of.<P>Meraxes Glibilskym<BR>Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I can see the possibility for entertainment here.  Unfortunately I think it will boil down to the random number generator for the Warriors (and of course the choice of equipment will be huge).  For some casters it could be even funnier... two Necros wasting bags full of EEs (remember the characters on test are just copies, the originals will persist) could make for a bit of a show.  In fact, the Wizards could be the funniest  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Ever wanna play a round of guess the other guys resistance gear?<P>Hehe, this should actually be good fun regardless of the outcomes.  One question though... can the combatants in the wings watch the others fight?  Oops, two questions... can you bring an extra set of gear or is it come as you are?<P>Good fortunes on this one and good luck keeping the Arena free from intruders. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To the people who aren't supportive of these events:<P>Just because you're not excited about it, doesn't mean that other people aren't. You might not agree with how Verant is trying to increase their involvement in organizing events, but it's a good first step. Most of the current "quests" in EverQuest are very one dimentional [deliver X to Person A] or [Kill Person B and give dropped item to Person C]. For some of the first Verant overseen "quests", a tournament isn't a bad start. Just because PvP doesn't appeal to you, doesn't mean that the next thing they decide to do won't be something more to your liking. Give them a chance before beating the organizers into the ground.<P>PvP isn't for me, so when it comes around to my class and my turn to battle it out, I probably won't participate either. For warriors and tank types, smackdown is probably ok - but what about for clerics? Or enchanters - how many mobs can you mesmerize? But just because I choose not to participate (and it is a choice), doesn't mean that I think the event as a whole is a bad idea. Just not my playstyle, and I don't think you should begrudge those who WOULD enjoy it, their day in the sun.<P>To Lady D:<BR>I cannot urge you enough to seek Players, Guides and GMs who have quest writing experience and incorporate them into your staff - perhaps have a seperate section in the Guide application, or a seperate application altogether. I know for a fact that many, MANY players once played MUDs to which questing and quest writing was an integral part of the game. I myself know several "wizards" who wrote EXCELLENT quests for MUDs who now play EverQuest. Shadowjack from BatMUD, Kinslayer from 3K (and other 3K wizards, I'm sure), and the list goes on and on. These people have had experience in doing what you're doing, and could be a great asset to your team. Please consider it. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hello Lady D!<P>Sadly I am too low for this event and now Warrior either, but like someone else sad, this is promising.<P>Another matter: Did you know that the website has an Events section? Can you make someone update it? Guess it would do some good to announce events in the Events part of the site, not only just in forums...<P>g'luck with the event!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I Agree with Zel45:<P>"EQ is a players vs environment game. Why are you expending all this effort on a pvp competition? Combat is determined through forumlas based on levels and equipment. This isn't a game like Street Fighter where a series of 1 on 1 matches would actually prove who is a better Ryu player. How does a competition like this prove who is best of the best? Who the hell cares anyway? <BR>Ask for groups of players, then send them on a scavenger hunt on a test server empty of players. Then reward people who did it fastest, least deaths, etc. "<P>"Maybe do it on a live server with each 'group' being a guild. Competition brackets being determined by guild size, level distribution. "<P>"since you want to give level 55+ characters spomething special, setup a under-used dungeon with higher level mobs and see which group of 6 can crawl the farthest."<P>"I applaud your efforts to set up events, but pvp matches are out of place in a pve game."<P>I also agree with another poster asking for an Arena Server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Never seen this many whiners in my life... Anyways, should be interesting to see if the winner will be an uber player from a blue server that just does dragons every week and has any choice of gear, or a skilled PvP player...<P>BTW, the best roleplaying comes from the players, not the GMs.<BR>Man all you blue server people love complaining that there is no roleplaying in PvP. Laugh! Your style of PvE isn't roleplaying; having trouble getting the item for your quest in Guk because it is infested with evils that want to kill you is (and i dont mean the frogs). But anyways, I've always liked a challenge so this is fun for me.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004737-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004737.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004737-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004737&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004737&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
