</FONT><HR>Slayer:<P>Get a clue...clerics don't pay for jack-squat because you don't wait for hours on end for a group and if you DO then you have far more serious problems then just having a monopoly on healing post 50.<P>Take your thumb out of your mouth when you talk next time and maybe you might actually make some sense.<P>Clerics will ALWAYS be the choice of healer.  Period.  Clerics are the most efficient (as they should be) but they should NOT be the only choice.<P>You have such a narrow view.  Take off your blinders unless you like being led by the carrot.<P>Druids and shaman pay for their versatility by not being the most powerful in anything.<P>Try proving that by moving sup heal to 49 and reducing fizzle that these SIMPLE changes will all of a sudden bring the cleric class to its collective knees.<P>You can't you know why?  Because that would not be the result.  You would *STILL* be more efficient in healing plus all of your other advantages that you bring.<P>If all you do is sit/heal/med then you losing out on a whole lot of other experiences.  (Not to say that there aren't times when that is necessary but for the most part it doesn't have to be a full time situation).<P>And if YOUR so jealous of all the druids/shaman *other* abilities then go play one.  Lets see you get turned down night after night for groups because you can't heal anymore (get told that repeatedly now).  Our *other* abilities are NOT required nor desired so you tell me again how your  *losing* anything.<P>Your not.  Your getting extra efficiency from your "backup".

</FONT><HR>Would it be too much to ask to get an 800 mana CHeal for Druids, Shamens, and Warriors? hell, even make it a level 60 spell for all of them.<P>At least we three classes will actually be able to do SOMETHING on raids. Druids and Shamens can't DOT for fear of poofing, and can't DD because of insane resists. Paladin's can't tank worth %)#@ without a decent disc. Don't worry; you'll still PL better. :-P (That was a JOKE, not malicious...please don't let that get in the way with what I'm saying.)<P>Just curious, how long do you stay LFG, usually?<BR>When's the last time you didn't get an XP res?<BR>When's the last time you've seen 2 Hybird healers do as well as you? (Mind the fact that they take twice the amount of xp, loot, and group slots than you do, even with twice the mana bank.) Paladins have it even worse due to the fact that their heals inherently heal about 10% less than Druids, Shamens, and Clerics. (Or at least the reported spdat values.)<P>I'd find it very unlikely that a Shamen or Paladin in ANY case would A) Level faster than a Cleric  B) Be more desired on raids than a Cleric. Granted, Druids (And Shamen to a lesser extent) can solo, but once you're level 60...what are you going to do??<P>Clerics are going to go kill Dragons and Gods, that's for sure. :-) Unfortunetly, Shamens, Druids, and Paladins can't come along due to the heavy Linkdeath cost they bring.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hmmmm more bashing going on... Lets quit talking trash on either, and work out some facts. I'm a Cleric. Should druids/Shamans get CH? no I'd quit the game if they did. Should Sup heal be move to 49? Yes, i think it should. The problem is, is that there are so many more Shaman/ Druids out there than clerics. Verant would have to make sure, that a Shaman/Druid combo wouldn't be more viable, and that Clerics wouldnt be reduced to Rez machines (please insert 100pp and select your rez) I think that could be accomplished though... but let me tell you this, all you druids/shaman out there... you want some of our monopoly? then do this... get into a group, and sit on your *ss stand up, hit one spell, sit back down....  have fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not even gona explain why I came up with this idea but for what its worth.<P>Shammys and Druids want better healing. They dont want to be the best healing class in the game. Clerics are afraid they will no longer overshadow Shamys and Druids when it comes to healing. I think thats about right... but then again I dont really care.<P>So. Why the healing concern? I guess ppl like to live on and fight alot in the game. So if the issue is really Druids and Shmmys getting more healing power, why not give EVERY SINGLE CLASS IN THE GAME a healing boost? Thats right. Every class will now heal that much more. Druids and Shammy will get the bonus they wanted, Clerics will get the same so they wont feel raped. Every other class will have shorter recuperation time between battles which I would like to see. Maybe everyone is happy.<P>Wait, no. That would make the game much faster pace and would make it totaly unplayable right? Yes, its because of the &lt;insert reason I dont get as to why recuperation is so long here&gt;. Without the &lt;insert reason I dont get as to why recuperation is so long here&gt; players would get to lvl 60 in half the time it used to take (ie : half an obsene amount of time rather than a whole obsene amout of time).<P>For an ongoing world, this game is looking to be the one I'm gona play for the shortest time...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Some are bad, some are good... from what I can see, something that would help a lot is to just fix the darn poofing issue.... nec's and shammies, and druids for that matter, shouldnt have to worry about using thier strongest spell line (dots) on mobs, and having it poof cause of line dead... that is just plain wrong, and can't be that hard to fix... and also... it would at least help you guys out..

</FONT><HR>I support and have supported these threads everytime they have come up.  There simply is no substitute for a cleric in the high level game.  I am a Paladin, so most of my supposed versaitility comes from being able to give clericless groups some additional buffing... that has become a complete joke.<P>I cannot remember the last time I did an area that wasn't incredibly easy (i.e. the lowest of blues without ever the possibility of a multi pull coming, i.e. almost never) without a cleric.<P>Yesterday I grouped at the Sebilis Zone in with a Monk and a Warrior.  3 man group attempting to kill single frogs that are 10-15 levels lower than me.  I say, np, we will have massive downtime while we wait for more people but I will heal you Mr. Warrior and maybe we can kill 2 or 3 in the next 30 minutes before the rest of our group arrives.  I then proceeded to fizzle 5 Superior Heals in a row, and we nearly died.  I am a Level 58 Paladin, can someone tell me how this is a necessary fizzle rate?  The fizzle rate of this spell is seriously greater than 50%.<P>If you do nothing else, please fix the fizzle rate on Superior Healing for ALL classes that receive it post 50.. it is currently utterly rediculous.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a lvl 60 warrior I felt that I should post my views on this.<P>I have a bit over 4khps buffed. Now your telling me that a cleric who can cure me completly with one spell will be hurt by giving the druids and shamans maybe a 1khp heal? Im sorry but I totally disagree with that idea.<P>I hate grouping with druids when they are the ones to heal me. They cant keep up. Sorry when a mob is hitting me for 4 times a round for around 200dmg+ a hit a 500hp heal just isnt going to work. For all those wondering the SoV mobs hit very very hard for their lvls.<P>The only combination I will take is if there is a shaman/shaman or a shaman/druid combo in the group. This is ONLY because the shaman can slow. Once a target is slowed a shaman/druid can keep up with healing the party.<P>Why are clerics so against this? I havent seen one post yet to prove how this would hurt you guys. I hate sitting my big ogre arse at the zone because I cant find enough healers or ONE cleric. Please..I mean lord I would hate to see an improvement to the game that would make the game easier on us all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Stop the fuggin whining. If druids and shamans COULD replace clerics as healers, then not a single soul would play a cleric. I like versatility and that's why I retired my level 51 cleric. Clerics are as "versatile" as warriors (well except that they have a gate spell). They are just mobile bandaids and imho incredibly boring to play (then again I would find a warrior boring too). <P>Shamans and druids get better utility spells during their first 9 levels than clerics ever get.

</FONT><HR>Some of you guys give clerics a bad name.<P>First things first: Druids are NOT the #2 healers in the game, Shaman are.  Shaman get the regen lines before druids to (and a level 60 regen druids don't) not to mention the slow line is damage negation druids have nothing similar to.<P>Realze that the level 55+ game is all about one thing: Cleric management.  You can't do planes without a cleric, you can't do raids without a cleric, other than in a few areas where you can fear-kite you can't even exp grind without a cleric.  You sure as heck can't camp any good equipment without a cleric.<P>Pre-kunark a druid/shaman could act as the primary healer in a group.  Yes, the pull rate would be slower than with a cleric and the chances of death were higher, but it could be done.  That is the way it should be.  For any 55+ clerics who think they don't have a monopoly on healing, I suggest this experiment:  Go to any dungon where you would exp grind with your group.  Set up and start getting pulls.  Invite a druid or shaman into the group.  Now, with everyone having full CLERIC buffs, full HP, and full mana, sit back and wait for your puller to bring in that perfect single pull.  Sit down while you watch the druid/shaman fail to be able to heal the main tank.  Please be nice and res your group after they all die.  Once that is done, try it with two druids/shaman, or one of each.  Wow, did everyone die again?  (You do have the 56 res, right?)  Imagine how much faster they would die if they had to rely on only Druid/Shaman buffs.<P>Druids and Shaman do NOT want CH, we don't want Res.  We want to be viable as the primary healer in a group, even if that means the group has to slow it's pull rate, wait on us for mana, and risks an increased chance of dying.  We will still need clerics on raids and planes, and likely even deep in dungons where multi pulls are all to common.  Why are you clerics so afraid of no longer being required to group, period?  I seriousally mean that.  At 55+ no cleric=no group.<P>--Demonspawn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my 2¢.  Before anybody calls me biased, let me invite you to know that I am biased.  I play a Cleric, he is currently level 54, and I love my job.  Sometimes it's stressful, and it contains lots of guilt when one of your members dies.  It's a hard job, and we're made for healing, we can't do crap (nor solo in the post-50s) about it.<P>I don't think the Shaman or Druid class should take over healing; heck, I don't even think that Shamans or Druids should have got superior healing post-50.  Why?  They're utility classes, and they are VERY helpful at what they do.  If Verant were to give Druids or Shamans an upgrade say......at level 60, like complete healing, then I would protest, and make Verant give us utility buffs, like spirit of wolf, or teleports, or something that helps balance it out.<P>Take this for example.  Strip your Druid from fire/ice nukes, take away his damage shields, his spirit of wolf, his DoTs, and what do you have?  A cleric (to some extent).<P>But.......I agree with you, a_mocking_clown to some extent:  Verant has totally unbalanced Clerics' when Kunark came out, and they EXTREMELY unbalanced them when Velious came out.  Level 60 Warriors that have completed quests in Velious can be fully buffed to upwards 5000 hitpoints, and this is *EXTREMELY* overpowered when a Cleric can complete heal.<P>I feel for you Druids and Shamans that feel that you can't heal worth a darn post-50, but that's not your job, mmmkay?  Give me your buffs, your teleports, your Spirit of Wolf, and I'll gladly let you have my Complete Heal.<P>Jaldarith Raynoari<BR>54th Vicar of Hate<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jaldarith, wether you believe it or not, druids and shamans ARE healing classes. Sad thing is, they can't heal effectively. Clerics are the only option for a groups healer. That is what is unbalancing. Before around level 40, shamans and druids could do ok as a healer, but cleric was preferred. This is no longer the case. Now clerics are the only option, if your cleric logs, the group dissolves. <BR>I think the best solution is to give shamans and druids a percentage based heal (no, not complete heal). I think a 50% heal would be ok.<BR>All you clerics who think you deserve something from shaman/druid line, guess what, you already got it. Celestial healing/celestial elixir. Shamans get Torpor at 60, which is similar but inferior to both of those spells. You want more? How about group charisma?

</FONT><HR>Clerics are the primary healers. I doubt that anyone would dispute that. But by making the one heal spell Shaman get after lvl 34 fizzle so much that you cannot rely on it, and at the same time, allowing warriors to reach 5000 hp, they have severely unbalanced the game. Nobody but a cleric can heal someone effectively when they have 5000 hp. And there is far too many times when there are no clercs around. And this is not just a post 50 problem. Think back a bit. How many times before lvl 40 did you group up with a group of players and there were no clerics in the group? My experience was that it was more often than not.<P>And even when there was a shaman and/or druid in the group, they were the first ones to scream "Grab the cleric" when there was a slot open and a cleric was looking for a group. Why? because groups are more effective with more classes in the group. You can kill more mobs in less time, which means everyone benefits.<P>Allowing Shaman to get Superior Healing at 49, and then something less than CHeal at 54-55 would be reasonable. Maybe a new spell that heals 1500 dmg at lvl 54-55. And the fizzle rate *MUST* be less than the current Superior Heal fizzle rate. It takes roughly 1 minute to meditate a bubble of mana. To then stand up and fizzle so many times in a row that a full bubble of mana goes poof is insane. Whatever the logic was that was used to decided to do this is beyond comprehension. We are masters at Alteration. Most of us have also made Specialition Alteration as our primary specialty as well. How is it that we suddenly fizzle more than a lvl 1 Shaman ever did when using this skill?<P>Shaman have really been hurt by Verants lack of attention to them lately. Its obvious that nobody at Verant plays a high level Shaman regularly. Its obvious that raids are taking less and less shaman with them. Its obvious that shaman are not using their highest level pets. Even with the latest pet enhancement, how is a level 39 pet supposed to help against a mob 16 to 21 levels higher than it? And 850 mana? what were they smoking that night to decide to jack the mana cost so far out of sight? Oh, and lets not forget the nerf job on the Rage line of spells. Even after they "fixed" this, its nothing more than a wimpy self only buff now. Its a shame they wont ever make this what it used to be. They took yet another thing shaman used to be able to do and effectively tossed it into the garbage can.<P>Hi, I am a level 60 Shaman. I can no longer heal worth a damn. I can not DoT on raids or on planes raids. On rare occasions, I can harm with DD spells. On rare occasions debuff *SLIGHTLY*. My STR/DEX/AGI buffs are useless and have no effect other than to place an icon on someones screen. I would SoW you, but since most raids are in dungeons, I cannot do that either. Oh, yes, I can shrink you. I can summon a 100% worthless pet if you would just give me 5 mins to med afterwards. Would you like to invite me to join your group?<P>Wake up VERANT!<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok guys,<BR>the flamers need to chill out a little, mmkay?<P>Do you want to know what most of my guild clerics complain the most about?  That in a group, all they can do is heal.  Is it because they have poor nuke spells?  Nope.  Its because if they are caught doing ANYTHING other than healing then they are shunned.  Why is this?  Because NO OTHER CLASS CAN HEAL EFFECTIVELY.  What does adding better heals to other classes mean?  Diversity for clerics (omg..I said that D word).  Therefore, clerics COULD nuke/melee if they wanted to and get away from the boredom and monotony (ESP after they nerfed MoK).<P>Now, clerics get 2 short term regen spells which are pretty neat.  Unfortunately, they overright druid/shaman regen (so I have been told..correct me if I am wrong).  Out of curiousity, why were clerics given regen?<P>Now to the meat of my post...<BR>EQ is basically a copy of almost every RPG out there.  I think it probably most resembles D&D so here is the point.<P>Druids versus Clerics...<P>Druids...master of nature and it's creatures<BR>Clerics..master of life and death<P>In the D&D world, Druids are a specialty class of clerics.  They get the EXACT same healing spells throughout the series.  The differences come in on WHAT they can control.<BR>Clerics get power over undead..druids dont (same with EQ)<BR>Druids get fire to burn..clerics get magic to damge (EQ)<BR>Druids and clerics both have buffs (SoW,DS and chloro is the only one used in group if a cleric is present).<BR>Druids get ports...clerics get Rezz<P>Honestly, I dont see HOW a cleric would be "crippled" if the other healing classes got the same heals.  Its not like druids/shamans are UBER GODS of damage.<P>Oh..speaking of uber..Druids job in a uber raid (brought to you by super resists and 6 lvl spell cap).  Damage shield and MAYBE heal the casters (DD's tend not to stick against kunark+ uber mobs unless you are in the "spell range")<P>For crying out loud, giving druids and shamans better heals would give clerics a chance at something they complain most about..DIVERSITY.  You could walk into a group with a druid and say, "Hey bub, you mind healing today.I'm feeling kinda FRISKY!!"<P>As a compensation to clerics, I say make their AE heal better.  I think it is RARELY used as it is now.<P>Isaah Deprophet<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I must say that I do have to agree, move when drOOds/shammys get SupHeal, and lower the fiz rate.  No problem there.<P>But I have seen the flaw in the argument here.<P>They are complaining because they lost a role as primary healer due to RoK/SoV.  Gee, maybe that is because those two parts of the game world have been made HARDER?<P>The mobs in the old world are tough, but shammys/dr00ds could be good healers..why?  The mobs didn't hit as hard.  Ok, I agree there.<P>Now, when RoK/SoV came out, the mobs were tougher, and hit harder.  Now, since many dr00ds, since they tend to kite, or fear/kite, are getting plastered, they want a better heal, to bring them back up as a primary healer.  And shammys also want a better heal.  Not saying a new spell, but regular spell, better cast/lower fizzle rate.<P>The case in point is, yes, even in fantasy, both druids and shamans are healers.  But going back thru playing D&D, I never saw them getting as great a heal as a Cleric.<P>I agree with everyone else here that say this is a class envy post.  The 2 classes in question could get CHeal, and a lot would probably still complain.  They could get a Celestial Heal type spell, and many would still complain.  They could even go so far as to be given a resurrection spell.  That would probably stop the complaining, because they would then be a CLERIC on top of everything else.<P>I am happy with the way that Verant has separated the classes.  I play a cleric, and yes, they can be boring as hell.  I rarely if ever do anything except buff, and heal.  Usually, if I ever try to blast, I'm quickly removed from the group, and told to F off.  The Rez line is nice, but only once you get to the top of the line.  It is rare for people to want a lower level rez.<P>But, if a shaman or druid ever became a primary healer, then I agree.  There would be no reason for players to play a cleric at all, since shamans and druids would be a healer/utility class.<P>Just my 2 cp's</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I really want, is the fizzles fixed. Post 50 groups dont even use a secondary healer much anymore. They use res sticks. The cleric FA is one of the easier FA weapons to get. Dmg shields? druid =24 mage =32 AND has a buff. Regen? Celestial healing overwrites it now. Sow? doesnt work indoors and rangers can cast it. Snare? Rangers, Sks, wizzies, necros, bards can cast. Ports? wizzie can cast AND they can damage the mobs other nuking classes cant touch. The sad thing is I have seen more groups turn down druids and shammies since this all came up because it outlined VERY clearly that you could get better results with a different class. Poor clerics. Already their armor has more ac than shamans and FAR better than druids. That was the original price. Now its that the other two classes are completely screwed post 50. Have fun finding ports to get a cleric to you for a res. I am heartily sick of begging to just get my spell to work in 2 casts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
