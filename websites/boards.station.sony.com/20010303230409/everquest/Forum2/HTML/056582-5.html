</FONT><HR>Poison:<BR>- Rogues are the masters of poison and handle it all the time. They should build up poison resistance based on their poison making skill. Warriors have magic resistant, rogues should have poison resistance. This would also encourage poison making. I know some lvl 30 rogues that have not touched poison, to expensive and to hard.<P>- Make Poisons stackable or reduce the number components required for poison. You WILL NOT give a rogue a big fighting advantage by doing so, only make it so they have enough room for basic poison parts.<P>"oh you wanna fight crocs now, ok, I have to sneak out of this zone at turtle speed and run to the other side of the planet to get parts. I can only carry one type of poison at a time in any quantity, even with 10 slot backpacks. Oh, everyone will have to pitch in 500 plat for the parts."<P>Attack Skills:<BR>- Please be careful with evade, it is the only thing that keeps a Rogue from death in every fight. A rogues aggro level is effected by many things. i.e. disarm, backstab, overall damage, poison damage etc. (maybe even emotes)<P>- Disarm almost never works, maybe twice in an evening of fighting.<P>- Instill Doubt is useless! It should work as often and a well as fear spells, based on lvl.<P>Other Skills:<BR>- Try going into grobb with hide and sneak. A guard lives at the entrance. Impossible.. Invis works thru zones, so should H&S. <P>- The sneak button should invoke hide also. When do you sneak and not hide?<P>- Pick locks and disarm traps all but useless.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>a few more things:<P>1.  I see a lot of people saying that disarm/sense traps is worthless because there are no traps.  While this is incorrect (they obviously just haven't been to the right zones), I would like to add a caveat.  It only makes sense that a rogue would disarm a trap for more than 30 seconds if he bothered to do so at all.<P>1. Sense Traps:  Extend the range to 'see' them.  Make it 75-100 feet, -or- even better, have sense traps work like sneak (in that it's mashed down) until you let up on it, and have it reduce your movement in the same fashion that sneak does (again, can move half rate up to 50, then an additional 5% per level to 60, where you can move at full movement and still be sensing traps), and then when you get within your 'sense' range, you get a warning when there is a trap near.<P>2.  Disarm traps:  I can't begin to describe how tedious it is to stand around disarming traps while people run by, or while you sit on a spot with a trap.  When a rogue disarms a trap, it should destroy the trap (forcing the trap to wait for a respawn, perhaps 20-30 mins).  This does 2 things: reduces the tedium of hitting disarm trap every 30 seconds, and forces a rogue to be more "smart" about his disarming (ie: once a trap is found, he can't just sit around and disarm it, he has to be on his toes, and figure out trap respawn times, etc.)<P>3. Throwing: The only thing here would be range.  I'd really like to see the Mrylo (or assassin's) bracer pick up a spell that summons daggers with a longer range, or perhaps make a quest for a container/pouch that summons daggers (probably not possible, as a right click on a container opens it, and wouldn't cast a spell, it could just be an item with a pouch icon.  *shrug*)  I see a lot of people asking throwing to do more damage, or backstab damage.  Please *don't* do this.  For those of us who pull as rogues, this would be unbelievably harmful (try to imagine pulling a mob that summons if you just did enough damage to make it start summoning with a pulling throw...)<P>4. Hide/Sneak: For the love of Bristlebane, make these two skills work across zones.  You have no idea how stupid it feels to ask for an invis when you need to cross into siren's grotto.  I would also love it if the hide/sneak speed increased underwater as you leveled as well, but hey, I can suffer at "swimming" at 2 ft per minute i guess... It would also be nice if hide/sneak worked *better* than the camo/sneak combo that rangers/halfling druids have.  Something along the lines of mobs with "see invis" capability only have a 50% chance to see a rogue that's hiding/sneaking.<P>5. Pick Pocket:  You know, I'm not seeing how unbalancing it would be to have rogues be able to pick magic items off of mobs that are of the appropriate level.  It would return some of the ability to be roguish.  As I recall, this "fix" was originally put in to keep rogues from walking up to nag/vox and stealing "uber" items from them.  With the level cap on PP, it's not possible to pick uber mobs anyway.  Perhaps put in a flag that doesn't allow a rogue to pick no drop items, but allows them the ability (however slight) to pick items that are magical/lore).  I believe Bilbo stole items out of Smogg's lair, did he not? *wicked grin*<P>6. Evade: Do what you gotta do, I'm tired of arguing.  Just don't be surprised when you see a lot of dead rogues, and a lot more whining here. In any group, i can easily climb back to the top of the hate list before hide recycles.  Rogues currently bring 1 thing to a group: damage.  Seems silly to remove that from them, eh?<P>Lozoria Shinkicker<BR>Hobbit Assassin<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope Absor makes it down this far, and doesn't abandon the thread as a result of some of the inflammatory posts which seem to be sprinkled through it.<P>There are a few inconsistencies I've seen on the board, and I wanted to try and clarify them, in addition to summing up what I think would help the class.  Most of it will have been seen before, so I apologize if I'm being repetitive, but I think it's worth it, in order to make sure there are no misunderstandings.<P>As far as evade goes, my empirical data is limited to the moderate and low levels of play, as my rogue is not quite 30th.  I do hope that the testing groups responsible for checking evade's effectiveness will have done so at a wide range of levels, however.  Evade works so seldomly for me that it's almost useless, but at my level it is not so important, as the mobs I am fighting are not yet to the point of being able to kill me in under 10 hits.  I'll reiterate other rogues' points however:  I soloed my way to 23rd level, (blech), and used evade constantly for most of it (on the off-chance that it would increase, like a skill) and never ever had a mob decide to chase off after someone else.  This includes times where I even forgot to turn auto-attack back on!  So essentially we had a 20th level rogue standing toe-to-toe with a mob, hitting evade every time it came up, and not attacking, and yet the mob still stayed on me.  Again, at my level, it does not matter so much, but the problem of evade scales with level; at higher levels, if a rogue is unable to evade, they are dead.  I know that your plans for evade will likely be implemented regardless, but wanted to voice my opinion on it.<P>Now to the meat of this post, a summary of the requests I found worth discussing:<P>(1)  Stackable poisons.  As mentioned earlier, the important thing to realize here is that we are not asking for the ability to apply multiple poisons to a weapon... we are asking for the ability to have our manufacture poisons stack in our inventory.  Poison has enough negative aspects, (hunting for every ingredient, a one-shot 'whee' factor, etc.), that simply carrying the results of your labor should not be so difficult.  This was argued before with alchemy, and eventually the bearskin potion bag was put in, and potions were allowed to have charges, if not actually stack.  I won't bother mentioning the 'bandage-auto-kneel' aspect of applying poison, because I think you already got that point, and it may end up implemented.<P>(2)  Hide/Sneak across zones, when link dead, and when camping out.  While some no doubt would disagree, I feel that hide and sneak is one of our class' defining characteristics; we are the only class that can be 'invis and invis to undead' at the same time.  There are enough mobs at the higher levels which see through invis that the skills are balanced; I don't feel adding a convenience factor like persistence through logouts and zones will alter that balance.  Currently, if a rogue is concerned about zoning into a dangerous area... he gets an invis, so as to not die as soon as the new area loads and his sneak/hide is gone.<P>(3)  An excellent point regarding stats was mentioned earlier.  I know the chances of something like this happening are roughly one in a thousand, but, given that you all have made some pretty sweeping changes to things that 'would never ever change', (like experience), I hope that you'll at least consider it:  re-evaluate stats.  A number of people have made half-elf, wood elf, halfling etc. rogues, because those races fit the traditional ideal of a rogue.  Even looking at Verant's concept of a rogue, it seems like a more agile and dexterous character would be best suited for the class.  However, when it comes to combat, the only thing that really matters for a rogue is strength.  Allowing a barbarian to backstab for more damage (due to higher innate str) is fine, and even logical, but there should be a tradeoff inherent in choosing strength over agility and/or dexterity.  Please make these other two stats more useful!  I don't really care how it's done, (but just saying 'dex already affects procs' is insufficient), but I feel that these two stats very much fit the swashbuckler image that Verant has crafted for the rogue, and therefore they should figure far more heavily, both in combat (backstab, evade) and utility skills (poison, traps, etc).  We cannot all be barbarians and dwarves, and, like everything in Everquest, there should be pros and cons for every choice (you want to be a dwarf rogue?  Fine, your high str and dex are invaluable, but your low agility means you won't do XXX as well as a more agile rogue...  you want to be a wood elf rogue?  Fine... your agility is very helpful, but your backstabs will never be quite as powerful as a barbarian's until you max out your str with stat equipment...).<P>I'm not looking for new commands or skills, or for the ability for a rogue to solo effectively, (I now exclusively group).  I'm just looking for refinement of our current skills, and perhaps a re-evaluation of what role stats play in a rogue's existence.  <P>Thanks,<BR>Skaal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello, I am a newbie rouge, of only lvl 16,so maybe Im a bit inexperienced to be talking, but I read the response that said Evade is too powerfull.  In that message it stated that if a rouge attacks a mob, and then uses evade, the rouge will be put at the bottom of the hate list, making the mob go aggro on someone who hasnt hurt it but just has low faction with it...This is wrong in many ways.  Lets take a look.  Ok first of all this makes evade appear to be perfect, that it works every time, it doesnt, lots of times evade fails, and even with a high skill if you get hit it will fail no matter what...the message also fails to state the recycle time of evade, when it fails rouges are going to take a beating and lose the few hp's that they have, I accept the hitpoints currently because I love backstabs, and being sneaky ( the rouge way ), and I think the class is good the way it is. The part of the message where it says if I use evade the mob will leave me alone is a flat out lie... I've tried going solo before, as the example implies and have tried to use evade to get the mob off of me, but it doesnt work unless another player is attacking him, If I stop attacking and stand there for 1 hour with no one else hitting the mob, and for the duration of the hour continually hit evade, I can promise you that the mob for the whole time will keep after me, it wont go trample off and not hate me any more...thats just fact.  Furthermore even if it were possible to get a mob off of me while solo, the mob certainly wouldnt suddenly go aggro on someone accross the zone, ever, unless you made that in your game, in which case logically you would fix that, not the evade skill...any ways evade doesnt do anything unless the rouge has someone attacking/taunting the mob, GO TRY IT...TRY SOLOING AS A ROUGE, GO ATTACK A MOB AND THEN USE EVADE FOR 1 HOUR, THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW OFTEN THAT MOB WILL RUN OFF TO CHASE SOME GUY WITH LOW FACTION A MILE AWAY...this kind of thing just doesnt happen with me, or have I ever seen or heard of that happening, I would very interested where you heard a tale about that...just go test it your self, If you do anything from reading this post, please let it be that you go test evade, and see how true that statement was...no matter how wrong anyone thinks any one else is, we pay money to play this game, its only right for you to go try it yourself. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-LoZoRiA- had a VERY good point about Sense/Disarm traps. I applaud that idea that sense traps act much like sneak in movement reducing (possibly even let hide function with it and/or sneak but without even more slow down in speed) and have Disarm Traps force the trap to have to be respawned later.<P>Very good call -LoZoRiA- !<P>One more thing..

This may include adding the new breed of traps so rogues and possibly even bards are more likely to join in.<P>And PLEASE for the love of the very word QUEST in the name of the game, make Ravenscale a quest armor just as Lambent, Crafted, Ivy Etched, Totemic, Ro Armor, Cleric Armor, Darkforge, and Even various caster robes, spells, and hand held items around the 20-40 range already is for ALL the other classes. Yes, I jealious that they have quests to do. Burning rapier is done.. and I just suppose to level up like mad now to do Ragebringer?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok.....as a rogue on a production server i feel that the rogues are pretty balanced as far as malee and everything goes.   instead of evade  give us feign death.  it would make more sence. Rangers and Monks have track and they have done well thus far.  i believe feign death would be a better fix for the evade problem.  Enough said.<P><BR>second.....as was said in a preveous note, Rogues are poison masters, we should get a poison resist plus each level. makes more sence. And poisons should stack like potions do for the shamen.  <P><BR>we are a hard class to play effectively. the only way i can level now is in a group givin the damage i can put out, but we havent the Hit Points to take alot of damage.  We are not tanks by any since of the word. Our best armor at level 20 is banded with the exception of some decent leather.(no complaints on that one) but we need something to get a mob off. <P><BR>and last......  i feel the same on the sense traps thing.  Its almost pointless to use given the range of sencing.   Make it like the tracking skill,  it grows in range as you get better at it.  that would make the skill workable and worth the time to master.<P>I hope this is read along with all the other notes that everyone has posted. We are a good class to play, but the balance needs to shift a little in our favor instead of Verants.<P>Elbareth Gilthonial<BR>32nd rogue of the Povar server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That can make it extreamly hard to get equipment. <P>What i would like to see is the Mask of Deception as a Quest item that can be obtained in diffrent citys for the diffrent teams.<P>More illision masks.  It would be fun to be a Goblin and to bank in Runny eye<P>I would love for there to be more quests and more story lines implemented for the rogue.  <P>And about the Ragebringer graphic it would be cool if it made you apper darker.  At night or in shadowed area you would be almost invisiable.<P>Why is it that rogues cannot use some of the great pircers in the game.  The dragonHorn of ykeshia would make a great rogue weapon but it is ranger only. Whats up with these harpoons?  Are we gonna back stab a whale?<P>Make some creatures non-backstabable.  being that some do not truly have a back.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Evade was a bandaid in and of itself. I didn't like it when you put it in. I like it now. Now you speak of changing it to drop us between 2nd and 3rd? That is pretty silly if you think about it, with the speed at which we climb the hate list dropping to 2nd and 3rd is a waste of your efforts and my time.<P>Even with us dropping to the bottom of the list...Velketor I get a successful evade and with a few hits a tentative backstab I am being hit again, I hit /disc nimble and attack for 7 more seconds then turn off attack and hope someone gains more aggro. I also try and hit the ol' evade but of course "You must be standing perfectly still to hide." pops up.<P>Seriously think about it. Don't make it for the party of 6 efforts, make it for the party of 42 efforts where the mob quad hits for 850 (Velketor), or where the mob quad hits for 540 AND RAMPAGES (another quad 540 to everyone in front of it, not just one target) (Klandicar). Evade is imparetive now with these types of encounters and still the "You must be standing perfectly still to hide.".<P>Or worse...<P>"You succeed" to evade yet the mob never turned off of you and continues to pound you to pudding.<P>Or worse...<P>"You successfully hide." huh? What? no no not hide evade /sigh as she's pounded into pudding again.<P>I think you all over evaluate evade and what you propose...well just go back to the days before evade rather than waste your time and effort in coding this and my time in trying to utilize it.<P>--- As for some fixs ---<P>I'm with the ones above posting for a more usable applicable utility to poison. I tried to use it in the ToT II and fankly...beyond the first use there was no way I could get another dose. Put yourself in a real fight scenario and that inital dose is all there is...the return on investment and the return on effort really really poor here.<P>Maybe some interesting poisons that have a greater duration ... zombie poison ... if successfully hit upon a mob that mob becomes "charmed" for 2 minutes. Is your zombie. Works within the guidelines of charm for equatible leveled enchanters.<P>Hide/sneak, aka stealth, should hold true through zoning. Only an idiot would move one step forward revealing himself (who cares if the system causes you to PLEASE WAIT WHILE LOADING...). Seriously?<P>If you can not evade the nerfing of evade then perhaps evade should drop you down 50% of the hate list? In a 6 person group effort this is the third position (like you've already stated) but in a 42 person effort this is down to the 21st position. Might manage to live a bit with it vs. those quad hitters.<P>Utility. Since the rogue isn't an assissin, thief, or other worldy considered "rogue" then more utility would be nice. Lockpicking my way into Vesheen's Peak, Sleepers Tomb (seems right in line with a rogue), etc. would be nice. Really would put more "rogue" into the EQ "rogue".<P>Pickpocketing efforts. I know that it's gone round and round about the level and items one can do but ... what a for gone skill. LORE ITEMS, MAGIC ITEMS, should be pickable imho. 5% chance? Dunno but zero is pretty silly. This again would be a nice "utility" for a rogue, making him or her more "rogish". The level suggestion formula for determining who can and can not be pickpocket...sure but in a "real world" or even a "fantasy world" roleplay scenario this doesn't really mesh. How many stories do we read in the fantasy novel relm where the "newbie" rogue managed to "pilfer" or "pick" some item of the "doom bringing bad guy of the novel"?<P>I've always like my rogue, started one in beta and have been at it pretty much exclusively ever since. Have not been vocal about it but ... I guess I'm getting tired of being jerked around. I liked Rogues from day one.

</FONT><HR>I don't post here much - the reason for that is pretty simple: I'm a happy player. I like the game. My primary character is, and probably always will be, a rogue. Right now, he's a 41. My typical group is myself, a 41 ranger (my wife), a 54 Warrior, a 53 Druid, a 51 Cleric, and a 54 Wizzy. Ok, so I don't get allot of exp with this group, but they're my friends and I play primarily for the fun of it. Anyway, you’d think with a group like this, I’d stay near the bottom of the hate list quite a bit. However, that’s quite untrue. For some reason, a 54 warrior with a Wurmslayer (and usually some blunt weapon) and a 41 ranger with a Yak and a Wurmslayer can’t manage to keep mobs off quite a bit of the time – even though they taunt like mad. About 20% to 30% of the time, I manage to evade (you know how hard that is when the mob is hitting you? Sometimes I think one more “you must be standing perfectly still” message and I’ll scream, after all, I didn’t move, the mob hit me…) which, about half the time causes the mob to turn around and bang on the warrior for a moment, but only a moment. As soon as I land a backstab, boom! I’m the guy again. I guess what I’m getting at here is that I think things are working pretty much as you guys intended originally – it might not be the original design, but it is, I think, the original intent. By that I mean, a skill that occasionally allows you to make the mob turn away for just long enough to get in a backstab and then have it jump on the rogue again. If that was your intent, you have succeeded and there is no need to change the skill at all.<P>As for the rest of it, I suggest that you leave the rest alone as well. Rogues work. Rogues are balanced with the other classes. <P>We are, at heart, a low AC, high output class. By scaling back on evade, you make us a low AC, often dead class, IMHO.<P>Thank you for listening.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Hopefully I'll have a list of items for you this week.<P>As for the evade thing...  Well, we have no intention of destroying rogues.  That would just be silly, now wouldn't it.  We are spending a lot of time testing this.<P>I certainly understand your concerns on the matter.  But we have no reason nor desire to make rogues ineffective.  Yes, Evade will be slightly less effective, but that's because it was a bit broken before.

</FONT><HR>I just read an item over at castersrealm where Absor says they are going to make the change to Evade, and that it will not hurt the Rogue class.<P>I think what we have is another one of those times when Verant is looking at what they THINK evade does, versus what it ACTUALLY does.  <P>Anyone who plays a Rogue KNOWS that evade is not all powerful like Verant is saying.  <P>Example:  I am with my guild killing giants.  There are 3 full groups.  We have nearly every class there, warrior, shadowknight, paladin, ranger, monk, wizard etc...  Ok, we engage the giant, and after waiting a few seconds for the other melee characters to build up some hate, I jump into the fray.  Upon my first backstab, I become #1 on the aggro list.  So evade.  Dammit it failed.  Now I leave attack off and try to find a corner to hide in.  Evade comes up again.  Fails again.  I figure its been a while now, the other characters should have passed me on the aggro list, so I try attacking again, not backstabbing, just regular attacking.  The Giant IMMEDIATELY turns around and starts drilling me.  Now I am a mana sink, as I need a heal.  Evade comes back again.  Finally it works.  I jump back in the fight, and as soon as I hit backstab, the mob is back on me again.<P>Now according to Verant, evade is supposed to put me at the BOTTOM of the hate list.  Why is it then that with ONE backstab, I am above the Warrior, who has been attacking continuously, and taunting the whole time, on the aggro list?  <P>ONE BACKSTAB?<P>Remember this has happened before.  The players say something is broken, and Verant swears on the bible that it isnt.  But then a few months later, Verant FINALLY admits that OOOPS it is broken after all. <P>Evade does NOT work like Verant thinks it does.  Whether they want to admit it or not.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I"m afraid I might know where the evade nerf might have come from at least in part. If you read the monk threads they are always talking about how uber the rogue damage is, not saying they want to do better by any means, it was just a reference point. I think maybe Alan read that and thought that maybe rogues were doing too much. <P>Someone earlier mentioned this "nerf" intending to get rogues to back outa combat...well that's exactly what monks have to do with feign death and that was mentioned several times in the monk talk as a way to indicate that their damage dealing ability needs to be upped somehow to compensate for the multiple lost rounds. Well maybe Verant thinks it's easier to just make rogues have to do the same thing so monks and other classes can feel better.<P>Now whether or not they actually think of it that way, it makes you think, eh?<P>-May<BR>Something nice, sugar and spice.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone.<P>Personally, I have difficulty accepting that the description of the way evade works is a truthful representation, by making you as hated as someone who has done little to no harm.  In my experience, I've had to succesfully evade multiples times in a row, to turn the mob away from me.<P>Rather than looking at evade, maybe you should be looking at taunt, and make certain it in now way has the ability to lower the aggro.<P>Cleric has 200 aggro<BR>Warrior has 2000 aggro (could easily be paladin or shadowknight)<BR>Rogue has 2300 aggro<P>What happens if the rogue evades?  He should then have an aggro of 0, and the warrior should receive the undivided attention of the mob.<P>Unfortunately, the rogue can quickly reattain the top of the aggro list.  Why?  Given the description of how evade works, the rogue would have to dish out an enourmous amount of damage to manage to out-taunt the warrior, given that the warrior has been beating up the mob for the last 2 min, whereas the rogue is coming into the fight fresh.  This seems very unlikely, but it is nonetheless what happens.<P>What happens if the warrior taunts right after the rogue has evaded?  Does the warrior retain his 2000 aggro value, or does he now have 201?  I say 201 because it could be that the taunt code looks at the highest aggro value, without taking into consideration the warriors, which would be the cleric in this example.  Then one is added to place it at the top of the aggro.<P>Given this second scenario, the rogue could easily regain the top of the aggro list, since the top of the list is not as high as it used to be.  This sounds like a plausable scenario.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dear Alan dear Verant,<BR>this is my second post in this thread, but I think you should read this.<BR>I wrote some of my testing yesterday and some Ideas and these aren´t Ideas like "give me give me" they are well explained how they should work.<P>My opinion and testing to Evade:<BR>Yesterday I (lvl 36 dwarf Rogue) grouped at Icetooth codiak caves in great divide with a balanced full group. Most of them were much higher than mine in lvl. I must say without the 42 Warrior it would be desaster for me or so called instant death. I know I would never pull an NPC because of an aggro list and I know to wait 2 sec before going in the fight. (I played myself a Wizard in former times and know how to avoid the aggro list!) So you called Evade pushes us rogues to the lowest point of Aggro list ? Really sure? Try test it before the change please, it could be you must fix it to this before you want to change it.<P>So I go in into fight and duel wield and backstab as much I can do and I miss a lot of backstabs (works around 65% normally). But every try to Backstab (even if missed) raises much more the aggro list then every try to taunt. There is one thing I do not understand:<BR>The Warrior (as said above) is much higher in lvl trying to taunt and has normally done with a double attack around 180 dmg. (Much more then I do) but when I miss a Backstab I am the number #1 on aggro list ? Okay, I evade succesfully, wait 5 sec and only move near the NPC (without attacking it), I just loose my Evade/Hide because of moving and what happens ? The NPC attacked me !!! Hmmmm, just to remember you: Haven´t you said I would be on the lowest point of aggro after an succesful evade ? Don´t think so! But I do my personal trick to avoid NPCdmg and move to a farer distance attack range than the warrior (Good luck I got a spear and not a dagger in my hand) and what happened? I can attack without being hit or aggroed! If me think, aggro hasn´t anything to do if you are on a aggro list it has something to do with the range to the NPC. Just tell the Tanking PC (everyone is better than us) to stand toe by toe with the NPC, and when we stand 3 feets away we would be Mr. Perfect ! Then we don´t even need a skill like evade ;-)<BR>Something more for all rogues complaining here about evade:<BR>I test it hours for hours and nothing seemed to function like it was planned or said above from Alan, so every "nerf" should be better than this malfunctioned skill. <P>Other Ideas from me to you Alan:<BR>"Tradeskill" Poison: You said it was our defining skill... hmmm... because of costs and rarity and the ability that poisons don´t stack I do not use them at all... (Like many other rogues) If it was a Tradeskill why we have not got Vendors selling all kind of poisons?<BR>Even if the costs are insane for a class defining skill (5pp for one lower Poison / better around 1 to 2pp) I would be with vendors selling these often use one. You can even say that the rogue Vendors are specialized in their poisons. For Example: Vendors in Mysty thicket sell Wasp Poisons, Vendors in East/West Commonlands sell Snake poisons, Vendors in Karanas sell Spider poisons, ... Vendors in Kunark and Velious sell all kind of poison to a little higher price than on the old Kontinent.<BR>It would be a nice customer service (after we waited a long time even to make poison) if we got a "Fullfill Pack" (worth 100pp) to make stackable poisons. (could be made by Tinkering skill and pop got another idea for these seldom used skill ggg)<P>Throwing:<BR>Hmmm, one thing I can´t imagine: The highest dmg weapon in throwing is a throwing boulder, but hmmm only one Rogue Race (Barbarians) can use it! Why? I am thinking myself a dwarven Rogue working as a younger rogue most of my time at the dwarven mining corporation 628 and have a higher Strength then most of my fellow Barbarian rogues but I am not able to move/throw a small boulder ? That does not fit to me at all. I can imagine a gnomes (always using robots for their Work) cant throw anything weight more than a dagger but a dwarf ? Please look at this.<P>Disarm:<BR>Only useful (even less) in an PvP melee combat after lvl 25 because all NPCs have Magic weapons. (&lt;- Moreover think of our Aggro list)<BR>It should work on NPCs also, only put the magic weapons they swing in their Backpack. Do not work on Dragon or Special NPCs where the loot could be more than they carry before disarming.<P>Many thanks for listening and I hope I find your ears hearing me,<BR>Dikus Dunkelbier, Dwarf Rogue lvl 36 on Vallon Zek<BR>Officer "Die Ringtraeger"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, I have one simple wish, i would love us Rogues to have some kind of Sprint ability, atleast Rogues die to easy to green con mobs , and traveling at low levels is a pain if you go hide/sneak, and somethimes you agro anyway, in those situations it would be nice to have a sprint  ability 15 sec spirit of cheeta (or what the name is)? At my current level i dont miss it but  i have misssed it for all my carriere, the only thing that might save a alone rogue,when agro something unintentional is to make a quick sprint to safety (zone). It would be nice if it was not a discipline but some key that pop every 90 min (lay on hand).<P>I think Sprint would be a  good Roguish skill (ability), and would save us many times from die unessesary when agro things we never would engage by purpose.<P>Ainienu Trainbringer<BR>Wood Elf Assasin<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You don't need to "nerf" anything on a rogue.<BR>First, you want to look at class balance, and with Verants Vision (tm) of grouping together and working together, you will come to realize that the rogue is not to be used as a tank.  Rogues are a support role in the group, doing their own abilities to assist the group as a whole.  The evade ability is one of those things that helps us use our other ability, called Backstab, in a group PvE environment.  Now, if you nerf evade, then how is a rogue suppose to backstab?  Again, a rogue is not a tank.  If you want a tank, bring a warrior along, so the warrior can tank and let the rogue do his job on dealing damage as well.  Sure, a rogue can do some tanking, but not very much.  You would be wasting a cleric's mana in a party trying to have a rogue do a warrior's job.  <P>If you want a rogue to be able to tank, then up our HP and AC.  <P>I think the real issue at hand is the inability for people to work with rogues.  Rogues are a unique class, and you have to learn how to work with them and use their abilities to benifit the group as a whole.  Most of us that play rogues on a consistent basis have accepted the fact that we are not tanks.  Now, the rest of the EQ community has to accept that fact as well.<P>Don't nerf our evade.  If I can't backstab something for you consistently, then it is only going to get me killed, which in turn will get you killed (you casters).  Bring a tank along as well.  A tank and a rogue are a very lethal combination.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I only have one question.  And everyone knows it's about the Evade nerf.  With the optimal equipment for rogues 50+(new assassin stuff, rage bringer, css).  When a rogue is at #1, after SUCCESSFULLY evading a mob (prolly turns to another rogue in a multi group raid, one of the big problems i have with this), how long does it take to get to #1 again, considering all the other classes are doing what they're supposed to (SKs clouding, Warriors Taunting, Monks Kicking, etc.).  If the rogue seems to get to #1 2-3 seconds before another evade attempt can be made, then you got to drop him off down the hate list a little more.<P>You guys should have a chart where you can monitor this kind of stuff.  Just make sure a rogue pre-evading and mashing the backstab button is always at least 2-3 slots behind the main tank, ALWAYS.  <P>Your guys do make sense in a way.  But I don't understand the fix.  If pre-vel, we were getting dropped to the bottom of a list containing 6 (ie: slot number 6) why can't we be dropped to slot number 6 of 60 (or however long the new hate lists are). *shrugs* Hope U guys don't ruin it for me.  This is my first character I've ever played in EQ and loved it.  If it gets drastically changed and ruins the fun i've been having, I'd doubt I'd start another one.<P>45-60 Rogue (guess) on T.P.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
