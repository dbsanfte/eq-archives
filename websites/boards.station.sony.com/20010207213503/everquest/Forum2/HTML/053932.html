</FONT><HR><BR>Hmmm how? The burden of proof is not even on ebay, it is on verant. <P>Verant would actually have to go to court and have a decision made that virtual items could be copyrighted, and thereby could not be sold on ebay due to copyright infringement. Actually they'd have to prove more than that since people do sell copyrighted things on ebay.<P>See the problem is that verant would really have to go to court and actually define just what it is that gives them the right to prevent such sales on ebay at all. There is no current body of law which deals with virutal game items as far as I know.<P>Ebay, however, has to do nothing. The burden is not on them. Verant has to go to court and try to prove something in order to have the grounds to be able to prevent ebay from having such auctions on it. Ebay does not have to prove anything. So ebay could send the flunkiest lawyer they have to court if verant tries to take them to court.<P>Its taking someone to court over the selling of something that does not really exist. This is pretty new territory I think. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ah to clarify, in order for it to be copyright infringement it has to be a copy. For example, people can sell all the pikachu figure on ebay that they want. However, they can't sell a drawing THEY MADE of pikachu. That is them profiting from copyright infringement. But they CAN sell a licensed drawing someone made of pikachu, such as pikachu on a trapper keeper notebook.<P>You are not selling a copy of verant's intellectual property on ebay, you are selling the item. So again, some sort of virtual item law has to exist for something to be even decided. Is there any?

</FONT><HR>It's always seemed to me that Sony owned the servers that the game is run on.  Each item you get in the game is a little bit of data on those servers.  The fee every EQ player pays each month is for access to those little bits of data.  The player does not own the little bit of data.  Sony owns that little bit of data.  I think Sony is fully justified in prohibiting the sale of their collection of little bits of data, considering the sellers don't own them in the first place.<P>However, the "you are buying my time" arguement throws a wrench in there.  Although, if you burn a CD of Diablo 2 and sell it to someone for ten bucks, it seems to still be illegal even if you say that you're just selling the time it took to burn it...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Copyright infringement is actually pretty straight forward.<P>Firstly, anyone who takes a copy of a screenshot from something inside EQ or from a manual [art, text, etc.] now has a copy of something that has the potential to be covered by copyright law.<P>The next question is "is the material already in the public domain?".  In simple terms this means has Verant already waived its protection under copyright.<P>Lets look at the clause in the EULA:<P>*******<P>You may not copy (except to make one necessary back-up copy), distribute, rent, lease, loan, modify or create derivative works, adapt, translate, perform, display, sublicense or transfer the Software. You may not copy any of the written materials accompanying the CD-ROM.  You may not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Software except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. The Software may contain license management software that restricts your use of the Software.<P>******<P>WOW!! pretty sloppy, but even so it may be good enough.  This clause clearly states that the writtent material with the CD is prpotected under copyright.  In the case of the CD it refers to the software.  It does not explicitly refer to to the written and graphic material contained therein.  Nor does it say whether you are allowed to print a manual if you so desire.  It is definately unclear in this area and Verant should proably change the clause.<P>Before we dig a little deeper please be aware that there is a difference between breach of contract and copyright protection.  Breach of contract can only arise between two individuals that have signed a contract, copyright protection is granted to the owner of the work and can be enforced against third parties that have not signed a contract. [sorry to state the obvious if everyone knows this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">]<P>So we have two cases.  Things that Verant can do to individuals that have signed the contract and things they can do in general to protect their assets.<P>If you have signed a contract with Verant [the ELUA] and you a in breach of contract then Verant can take legal action.  Doesn't mean it will get them much money but they certainly could stop you doing what you are doing -- "cease and desist"<P>Lets look at the copyright side of things.  Certainly Verant has protected its software, the physical CD and the printed material.  However, it has not expressively protected the content of the software, or, more importantly, limited and specified its use.  The content is the names of characters, story line, graphics, information on how the game works etc.<P>Given this we just have standard copyright protection and it basically has a conept called "reasonable use".<P>For instance, printing the manual would be considered reasonable use, selling copies of the manual to others would not be reasonable use.  Writing a new manual that contain significant portions of the old manual and selling it would not be reasonable use.  Writing a completely new guide with new text and selling it ...... *hmm* it might not be protected, its a gray area, and I will explain why.<P>If Verant aggressively went after anyone printing, showing or using their material on any web site I think they could make the point that their items are still protected by copyright.  However, they have not, in fact they work closely with many sites and certainly don't have a problem with guild web sites.  They also clearly have a feature for taking screenshots and seem to have no problem with people using the feature.  They seem to have no problem with people displaying these shots on their web sites.  Sorry Verant, I think you have let this into the public domain -- very sloppy.  You should have at least forced people to always include a Sony copyright statement on any graphic etc.<P>This is a shame, if Verant had better protected the content they could have shut down Ebay on copyright infringement alone [the text and graphics used to describe the sale of items would have been an infringement.<P>In most cases reasonable use means "limited use" and not used to generate profit  [more complex than this, but this is the simple view].  Since many of the bigs sites are clearly making money from explaining and using Sony material and Sony has taken no action I think they have let this material into the public domain.  For instance, I could give you 20 screenshots of the game and get you to pay me $20 for the time it took me to assemble them and this would be pretty legal [a little gray, but in the end legal].<P>So, an eBayer is not doing anything illegal on Ebay offering in game items for "sale".  Even the showing of copyrighted materal is OK because Verant seems to have allowed them to go into the public domain [slap Verant on the wrists for not being a little more careful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">].  The only thing left is breach of contract.  So if the person making the EBay sell is a person currently using EQ with a signed contract they may be in breach of contract.  Since the ELUA does not expressively forbid selling ones time while playing eBay it is unclear whether it is truly a breach of contract or not. However, when the person in the game actulally makes the exchange it may get a little clearly [not a lot, but a little clearer].<P>In the state of California Verant would be on shakey ground having a contract that expressively says that third parties cannot gain personal income/profit true selling time of expertise that in anyway is derived from their knowledge, use or exprerience in using EQ without the express permission of Sony...... blah blah blah.   <P>So, can you protect virtual items?  Yes, but Sony has not done a good job in this case.  Read the copyright stipulation son a music CD and you will see a well written piece of literature.  The ELUA should be rewritten to expressively protect content and to clearly state what is reasonable use and what is not.  At the moment it is a mess and the mess is of Verant's own making.  It may be too late to fix this in EQ, but someone should get the legal side of this worked out before the next gen games arrive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If Verant deleted your character tomorrow there would be nothing you could do, except cancelling your account. The complicated series of steps it took you to get that character and his FBSS are technically not different from the complicated series of steps it takes to reach a highscore in Tetris. And you don't OWN a highscore in Tetris.<P>Have a look at other online games. Last month a bug turned up in Asherons Call that allowed people to create endless amounts of money and the economy collapsed. So the company not only fixed the bug but ROLLED BACK TIME and put the backup they made a week or two earlier back on the servers. All the experience and items you gained during that time were lost. Even worse, corpses had not been backupd and if you were on a corpse run at the time of the backup you lost ALL of your items. The same thing could happen to EQ. In the same way that they can change the properties of your Donals BP they can say "Hey people, there was a bug, we have to delete all platinum pieces/FBSSs/Yakashas/Whatever".

</FONT><HR>Stoopid question I'm pondering over....<P>Ebayer_01 purchased EQ.  He did not purchase the Kunark expansion, or SOV.  Ebayer_01 has automatically downloaded via patch the ability to use/own & view equipment & items found only in Kunark or SOV.  Ebayer_01 is given a wurmslayer by a friend in-game.  Ebayer_01 sells wurmslayer on ebay.<P>Now, since Ebayer_01 is not selling, transfering or altering any software or part of the EQ game he purchased, is that still technically a violation of EULA?  There is not an option to play the original EQ game minus the kunark & SOV item patches, and you pay in advance the monthly fee.<P>For the record, I'm an avid opponent against eBay'ers, and would very much like all EQ item ebaying to stop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Stoutfoot:<P>I tend to disagree that what you say is the end-all-be-all of the Ebay argument.  <P>You say that Verant owns the servers, owns the data, owns the virtual item.  I agree with this.<P>Where the difference comes in is that when you get an item in EQ you basically are earning the right to use that item.  You don't own it.  So what is happening is someone else is selling the rights to wield an item in-game.  The other person still doesn't actually own the item.  The just bought the right to use it.<P>To use an analogy:  I buy a membership to Bally's Fitness center.  I don't actually own anything in the gym.  I can't walk out with their dumbells.  When I leave the gym I have to leave everything that was there in the gym.  I have only purchased the right to use their equipment at their site.   Bally's allows you to sell your membership to someone else.  That person hasn't purchased Bally's equipment.  They have only purchased the right to use that equipment.  Now, if Bally's was extremely crowded and was no longer issuing memberships someone might be tempted to purchase a membership off of someone else at an inflated price.<P>The question is does Bally's legally have the right to not allow you to "sub-let" your membership?  Does a landlord have the legal right to prevent you from sub-letting your apartment.  Does my bank have the right to prevent me from selling my leased vehicle to someone else as long as the payments to them are made?<P>What's being sold is not ownership but the right to use an item.  That is what needs to be argued against.  It's such a simple argument to say that no one can own an item in EQ since it's true and everyone knows it.  What you need to argue is the real issue of selling the lease of those virtual items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Ebayers think they have a loophole, but time is not a commodity that can be bought and sold.  It has no legal value.  So if Sony wanted to go to court this issue would not impede their success.  <P>Also, from what I understand Ebay is complying with Sony's wishes, just not pursuing it as ardently as some might wish (i.e., they delete the EQ category, but there are still auctions in other places).<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But Ebay isn't going to spend their resources to track every auction since they have no legal reason to do so.

</FONT><HR>Aidann, your analysis was great up to a point, but then you missed the obvious.  Let's take a look at your analysis line by line:<P>&gt;&gt;It's always seemed to me that Sony owned the servers that the game is run on. <P>Correct.<P>&gt;&gt;Each item you get in the game is a little bit of data on those servers. <P>Correct.<P>&gt;&gt;The fee every EQ player pays each month is for access to those little bits of data. <P>Correct.  To be more precise, the fee we pay is to gain access through our account to the game itself.  The right of access to those little bits of data is attached to your account.  <P>&gt;&gt;The player does not own the little bit of data. <P>Correct.  Players just have a right of access.<P>&gt;&gt;Sony owns that little bit of data. <P>Correct.<P>&gt;&gt;I think Sony is fully justified in prohibiting the sale of their collection of little bits of data, considering the sellers don't own them in the first place.<P>You trip up here.  The little bits of data are NOT being sold, are they?  They still remain subject to the control of Sony, and exist only on Sony's servers, right?  The "item" remains in the game world, right?  No one is making a copy of the item or bits of data and selling that, right?<P>All that is being sold on ebay is the right of access to those bits of data.  Quite a bit different from selling the bits of data themselves.<P>&gt;&gt;However, the "you are buying my time" arguement throws a wrench in there. Although, if you burn a CD of Diablo 2 and sell it to someone for ten bucks, it seems to still be illegal even if you say that you're just selling the time it took to burn it...<P>The analogy of burning a CD doesn't apply here because no one is making a copy of the "item" or the bits of data and selling them, are they?  Even if you disagree with the conclusion above that only access rights are being sold, and maintain (somehow) that an "item" is being sold on ebay, the "item" being sold is not a copy of that item, but the original item itself, right?  Or, in copyright terms, a legitimately obtained copy of the work.  <P>Under copyright law, you can sell a legitimately obtained copy of the work and profit from that sale without violating the copyright in the work. It's called the "first sale doctrine."  You aren't burning a CD of Diablo II, you're selling the original Diablo II CD you bought.  This is why you can sell used books, CDs, DVDs, posters, pictures, artwork, etc. (most of which are copyrighted works) without violating copyright laws.<P>The only arguable copyright infringement in these auctions is the use of a screenshot from the game (which consists of copyrighted artwork).  Which is why some auction sites are recommending not using screenshots in your auctions.<P>So copyright law isn't really a consideration here.  Which leaves us with the issue of breach of contract (i.e., we have the right of access due to our contract, but the transfer or alienation of such rights can be restricted by the terms of the contract)....  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you guys interested in how Supreme court distinguish private Web contents and public web contents, please go to Yahoo, do this search "Reno v. ACLU".  There is a step by step description on what is considered as private and public domain.  All laws, regulations, and policies have to be applied equally.  So, if Verant want to stop all auctions and ban those who sell and buy anything related to eq. They will have to track down everybody since the very first auction.  In order for them to be able to do so.  They will need to get a court order and ask all those auction sites to release the seller and buyer information.  Verant cannot pick and choose who, what, and when.  Auction sites don't really need to do much.  All they need is the court order, Verant have to do just everything else.  If Sony is the part who want to head for this suit.  Then the picture is even larger.  Do you know how many Sony products are been sold by none Sony authorized dealers? This is nothing less than impossible to do.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aandaie—<P>EverQuest and everything associated with it is Sony’s property.  If I make money off of someone else’s property without their permission, they can sue me and win an award equal to the amount of money I’ve made.  This is the simplest explanation of how the system works.<P>MyrrLynn—<P>Actually, they do not need to expressly protect their rights.  Under the current copyright laws in this country, all of that is assumed to be copyrighted unless they grant express permission.  <P>Trademarks which are not protected may be lost.  The same is not true of copyrighted material.  VI still owns the copyright and has the right to exclusive possession and control of the material, which they may invoke at any time.<P>Chief_Wahoo—<BR>“The question is does Bally's legally have the right to not allow you to "sub-let" your membership?  Does a landlord have the legal right to prevent you from sub-letting your apartment. Does my bank have the right to prevent me from selling my leased vehicle to someone else as long as the payments to them are made?”<P>Yes.<P><BR>The real key to the whole eBayer issue is whether or not VI has a right to prevent other people from profiting from VI's property.  This is one of the most fundamental property rights in our legal system.  The issue is not complex.  The law is clearly on VI's side.<P>Okay, thanks drive through.<P>--Ix</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Smendle<BR>According to EULA, Verant claimed that we as players/customers spent our first $39-$52 as payment for lease of a product.(EQ)<P>From very start, we don't own it.  The only problem is that we don't see this claim printed on the game box.  Since we cannot return the game once the box is opened, there is no turning back.(Fair practice violation?)  <P>Anyway, with such EULA, It is like you've paid $35k to lease a car. The best part is that you cannot return the leased car when lease is up.  Why? Because Verant is the one who tells you when the lease is up and they have the right to take the car away without warning or notice.(Fair practice violation?)  This is the question I sent to the New York Consumer Affair lastnight.  Will see what the result is. hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is the simplest explanation of how the system works."<P>--I'm not saying this is true or not but I have a very hard time believing it.  Sony is not losing the rights nor ownership nor ablitily to profit from their property.  <P>If you own a house and I charge people to take you to the front of your house and let them look at it you can sue me?  So all those tour buses in hollywood get repeatedly sued by celebrities who value their privacy?  Those tour buses are making money off of property that is owned by the celebrity right?  <P>I highly disagree that the law would be on Sony's side.  In no way by ebaying something do they lose their ability to profit from their property.  You are not infringing on their rights in any way.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
