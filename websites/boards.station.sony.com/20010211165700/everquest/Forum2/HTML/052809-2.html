</FONT><HR>This was pre written the night before this thread was schedualed.  As a result, I think one of the ideas already mentioned is repeated.  My apologies for this<BR>-----------------------------------------<P>thanks for this series of topics.  Not only is it good PR, but, some things are going to change and that would be great.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I'll be first to admit that warrior is a very well defined class, that has recieved a ton of positive upgrades since retail realease.  As for our slot in the class hierchy, we are wanted in groups, essential at high levels for raids, and an entertaining class to play.<P>But, that's not exactly what you wanted to hear, so... here is my list of complaints, suggestions, and requests.<P>First off, I wanted to talk about the warrior's epic weapon.  It can be changed from a 2 hander, into two 1 handers, and back again.  This is a great ability, however, the 2hand 'proc' debuff and the 1hand 'proc' debuff do not stick together.  Sometimes it seems that the 1 hand procs wont stick together either :/ This is a major problem when you are in a raid type situation in which multiple warriors have their epic weapon (my guild has 4 warriors with it, so I experience this often).  The slow speed of the main hand weapon, as well as the ratio of the weapon make the proc damage ESSENTIAL to keeping up with other melee classes with their epics.<P>I'd like to propose the removal of the debuff all together in favor of just about anything else.  Make the weapon faster, add some damage to the proc or something to that effect. the debuff doesnt seem to taunt (which I think was the oringal design of it) as well as speed, damage, or anything else does.  By improving the speed and the damage on the proc, your certainly creating 'taunt'.<P>Secondly, I'd like to talk about HP regen.  Casters get meditate to help in mana regen, which is their means of life.  Well, our means of life is our HP and our HP only.  When travelling, or when without a cleric, Healing to full can take just about as long as a lifetime.  I feel that adding some hp regen, scaled by level, to all warrior classes would certainly help eleviate the 'we MUST have a cleric' mentality... as well as remove some of the binding melee whine.<P>Third, I know its a dead topic, but binding is an incredible issue with the class.  We have no movement enhancing spells, we have no means of healing ourselves, we are unable to hide, sneak, mend, invis, feign death, or anything of the like. Travelling is exceedingly difficult with this class when trying to retreive your corpse.  Consider returning the now out of game item 'Locket of Escape'.  Obviously with this item, a warrior was able to target themselves and bind themselves to a spot, even if it wasnt in a city. This is a nice perk for the people high enough level to obtain one or two of these items.  Personally, I was bound at sebilis as soon as I got my key using this method... it made corpse recovery amazingly less time consuming. Consider making it either purchasble for a large sum from vendors, class creatable, or a drop in a very difficult zone on random mobs (or perhaps a on a 'all 60+' random table). If none of these options are possible, put a no drop item of 50+ charges on an epic mob (not a dragon/venrilsathir, please, but a mini boss of sorts) that can at least grant a _few_ of us this ability.<P>Fourth, lets talk about taunt.  The recent improvement to make it work _sometimes_ on 60+ mobs is good, but, its not what we were really looking for.  With the addition of certain weapons for other melee classes it has become nigh impossible to taunt off of some of them, even with _our_ epic weapon.  An improvement on this skill would be very welcome.  I mean, as a level 60 warrior, I really should be able to pull that krup knight off of a paladin who proc'd one too many times with their new Plane of Growth sword  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Also, several of our disciplines either do nothing, or are horribly weak.  Specifically when using the level 60 discipline, does it even have an effect, or is it broken?  Even when the damage has been parsed, there is so little improvement with that discipline its impossible to tell if it was marginal error or the discipline at work. The refresh times on our disciplines are horribly out of whack, I think and should be reviewed.  Also, what happened to velious disciplines?  I'd hoped we would have gotten one or two new ones (hello flurry and rampage, those are awesome) but that was overlooked.  Yes I'm aware we got the same ones all the hybrids got =P  <P>Now lets talk about balance.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>What is a warrior's role in the vision?  is it to be the most 'damage absorbing' class?  is it to be the one that makes complete heal most effecient?  is it supposed to be the class that should do the most damage over time, because they will survive longer?<P>First, I dont have a clue about 'damage absorbtion' because its been a secret on verants side of the world since the game was retailed realease.  We know from beta that there is 'avoidance' ac and 'mitigation' ac.  We dont know which is which, how much of each we have, or whether or not it caps at some point on either.  This basic understanding of how the game works is more vital than any peice of knowledge a warrior could know.<P>as for 'balance' an iksar monk, a half elf paladin, a troll shadowknight, and an ogre warrior all have nearly the same ac at 60 with their 'best' gear.  Sure, it varies from 1150 (iksar monk with a few velious items) to 1200 (Furor's base ac, unbuffed, from FoH) but how big of a difference is that 50 ac? Is it mitigation or avoidance ac? IF that monk has '1100' and the warrior has '1100' is it the same? How does it affect combat? is there an ac 'soft cap'? If so what is it?  <P>Knowing all of these things is integral to playing the class.<P>Also in the same vein of 'absorbing damage' should we gain natural resists in all 5 areas?  I mean, our job is to be poiosoned, diseased, frozen, burnt, and blasted in place of everyone else.  After 60 levels, you'd think I'd have built up a resitance to some of it other than just magic.<P>Secondly, if we're supposed to take damage, we _MUST_ be able to taunt mobs. This is accomplished by improving the 'taunt' skill, by speeding up our weapons to be faster than most other classes, or adding 'hate' procs to our most common weapons.<P>If its to do the most damage over time, by surviving longer than most.. Well, I'd say we're close to that.  Some tweaking, as well as some 'warrior only' weapons that compare to some of the other classes choices would be advisible in this area  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>If its making us the best person to 'complete heal' then, we do that pretty well too. We do have on average more HP than any other class, we thank you for it.<P>In closing, I'd like to make a 'wishlist' set of requests.  <BR>Please consider making the AC display OPTIONAL so we can understand avoidance/mitigation ac, as they did in beta.<BR>Please consider putting in a few quests to make the most popular shields (especially the warrior only ones) back wearable.<BR>Please consider once again reviewing and perhaps improving the warrior epic weapons.<BR>Please consider the HP regen idea as mentioned above  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Please consider adding some 'ATK' and 'AC' to our berserk state.  improving this, scaled by level, would certainly add to the class.<BR>Thanks for reading this 'War and Peace' sized post.  I certainly hope to hear your words on parts of it (or all of it!)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My only beef with the warrior class is the small races. They are really at a disadvantage to the large races. I dont think it would be unbalancing to add minor bonuses to small races. Particularly their base stats, or give them a natural minor haste. Say 1% haste increase every 20 lvls. A lvl 60 inkie warrior would have natural 6% haste. As it is right now there is no reason (imo) to play a inkie, gnome, wood elf or halfling warrior. I plan to make a inkie warrior soon, but I know already that I am going to get the inkie XP penalty(on par with ogres from what I hear) for lesser STR and STA. Right now it seems that VI wants you to play a large race if you make a warrior as they make by far better tanks. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here's my two copper:<P>1) Can you think of ANY other class that's practically begging you to get beat up more? Throw us a bone, make taunt more effective!  I can't think of ANYBODY who will complain (except maybe Monks, but everybody knows those guys are crazy) if the warriors are getting hammered and they aren't.<P>2) Warriors don't get many skills past 25. How about a few new ones?  One suggestion: at level 40, a skill called "Pin."  On the same cycle as bash/kick, but if you successfully pin something, it stops moving and attacking.  The catch is, the warrior stops moving and attacking, too.  Add a BIG taunt component in there.  With this sort of ability, the warrior can literally wheel around and pop a pin on a mob that's trashing a robe, saving the caster's life at the expense of taking a pounding.  To avoid abuse, make it recycle at half the speed of kick/bash.  Hella hard to get this bad boy up in skill points, but very worth it when you need it. <P>3) More hit points!  We warriors LOVE our hitpoints! We want so many hitpoints that when we tell other classes, they gasp in amazement!  In all seriousness, a larger difference between warriors and other classes would be nice.  HP's and AC are pretty much all we got for bragging rights!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4) Keep the nice items rolling in! Warriors live and breathe their gear.  We love the toys, keep them coming!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5) A bigger "purple bar." You know, you get knocked down, and sometimes there's this purple unconsciousness bar of hit points before you die?  And if you are very lucky, a heal lands while you're on the purple bar and you can pop up and keep wailing on the critter?  In many groups, in many situations, if the warrior goes down, the rest of the group has to evac or die.  I suspect warriors and everybody else has the same size purple bar, and I wish we had a lot bigger one than everybody else. (And no jokes about big purple bars, all you perverts!)<P>Okay, all kidding aside, Warriors are fun and needed, but we pay a hefty price for it.  We solo poorly, we don't travel well, and going exploring with a warrior usually means you die.  (No escape options, at all.)  Just keep us pure, and let us do what we do, and we'll be plenty happy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off:  <BR>Warrior epic (hehe).  Couple complaints first being the difficulty of obtaining the items to complete the quest.  If you have the power (Guild/friends) to take down mobs such as Chardok Queen and Maestro, well then you should get the damn blade/hand.  Drop rates on these two items is pathetic at best.<P>Warrior Epic stats:  Two 14/24 swords? Yea these are nice, but come on its supposed to be an EPIC blade for us -- I got a 14/24 mace (warding star) within the first week of kunark.  My suggestion is to increase the +HP and Lower the DMG/DLY (100hp per 1h blade, maybe change dmg/dly to 14/21) Thus this will increase the taunt factor and not require adding haste.<P><BR>Second off:<BR>Taunt has been mentioned before, look into it - when I hit that &lt;Taunt&gt; hotkey I sure as hell want that mob to get off my cleric =).  Possably give us a new skill/hotkey that is a 10 second refresh that is &lt;Taunt All&gt; whereas it allows us to taunt everything in a radius of say 50'.<P>Third:<BR>Disciplines -- THEY WORK NICELY LEAVE THEM ALONE DONT NERF US PLEASE (Kidding), only thing I would ask for would be shorten the refresh times (or increase use time) - most 'good' disc's only last 8-9 seconds. =/<P>Forth:<BR>Let abashi duel Zrazzt, because Zrazzt &gt; Abashi (Still) =).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>1) Invisibility on PoG greaves ( Beserker's and quest) - Of all the spell effects to not make it to Velious from cobalt, invisibility is the most useful and desired.  Currently, cobalt greaves are a rare drop off Venril Sathir, a week long spawn that is highly competed.  Many classes have spell efects on their PoG armor, warriors only have a spell on the bp.  That's fine, but the invisibility is a powerful enough reason to always take cobalt over the new armor, for the legs.  For this reason, VS remains a highly contested mob, and I think part of the reason for the new armor was to help alleviate some of the contention for Trak and VS/<P>2) Beserker's Helm - Graphic does not seem to be implemented yet for all races.  Not a big thing, but people keep asking me why I'm still using an SSB at lvl 58 :0P<P>3) Give us reason to equip a shield.  Maybe make some of our old shields, like the Nautilus, equippable as a back item.  Currently there is no reason for any warrior to use a shield post 55 when we get stun-kick.<P>4) Raise our max piercing skill to match our other weapon skills?  There are some nice piercing weapons, some warrior only, that get less use because of the lower skill cap.  Is there a balance reason to this?  I'm curious.<P>5) Jboots - Not a warrior specific request, but still an idea.  Currently, jboots are the equivalent of a lvl 15 shaman SoW.  Why not make the effect increase based on the level of the player clicking the boots?  Maybe at 60, have the jboots be as fast as a lvl 40 SoW or something.<P>6) Haste items - Please quit making great haste items that are ALL/ALL and have wisdom.. or mana, or something.  It's very frustrating to be a warrior in a guild raid, watch a spectacular haste item drop and realize that your guild won't let you roll because a ranger can use the wisdom on it.  Hell, just make them hybrid only and save us the agony  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>That's all for now, maybe more later.<P>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>58 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>1. Warriors are completely useless in a CR situation and defenseless when travelling.<P>Solution: Sprint skill when travelling to get ahead of mobs chasing you down- Quick burst of speed that drains stamina. Dunno for CR- sorry just no ideas here. <P>2. (More of a general thing) 2h weapons not only do less damage overall, but taunt is laughable.<P>Solution: Warrior hits from 2h Weapons generate 3x the 'taunt' factor of similar 1h damage.<P>3. Sitting waiting for HP to regen is boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. And Warriors have the most of it and no way to regen by themselves. They have more downtime than any other class. Did you say Bind Wound? Dont make me smack you. Regen BPs are totally out of reach for all but the most uber of powergamers. <P>Solution: Every other RPG in existence has cheap healing potions.. WHY NOT EQ?!?! Make them stackable and completely unusable in combat (after all- warriors have no channeling skill so a hit of 1 dmg would interrupt drinking potion)<P>4. Critical strikes are too rare and inconsistent to be anything but eye candy- and dont do much more damage. (bonus to crit for 2h? see #2) Crippling blows are almost unseen unless during discipline. Frequently critical hits can be less damaging then max hit of a normal attack. Crit/crips during bash/kick are a waste. <P>Solution: Overall increase of chance to crit. Exponential increase with higher dex. Additional bonus for 2h weapons. Critical bash=guaranteed stun+longer stun (memblur maybe? see #1). Critical kick=ubertaunt+knockback. <P>5. All skills/effects are barely effected (if at all) by stats. Halfling Warrior with 150 AGI should be dodging 10x as frequently as Ogre Warrior with 75 agi. Wood-elf Warrior with 125dex and 2 1hs's should parry 5x as easily as Barb Warrior with 80dex+a big 2h axe. This just isnt the case.<P>Solution: All skills should scale more realistically with the appropriate attribute.<P>6. Epics- very kewl looking!

</FONT><HR>The melee classes in EQ are under-powered. Actions and game design by Verant strongly suggest that they have known about this issue for quite some time, yet have not outwardly acknowledged or made moves to fix the problem.<P>Case 1 (PvP and duels):<BR>In PvP (duels) spell and pet damage are greatly reduced. Why? Because the spell classes are far out of proportion to the melee classes. Why else would you tone down spell effects? Why aren’t all classes on the same relative power curve? This points at a huge design flaw in the various character classes.<P>Lets use an example of a warrior vs. a wizard. Now, I do agree that a high level wizard with good equipment should be able to defeat a warrior of equal level with good equipment (provided the wizard has at least a little space to move around in and doesn’t have to stand right next to the warrior). So what has Verant done to make this encounter "fair"? They’ve toned down the effectiveness of spells (and pets) when fighting other player characters. This is admission by Verant that the classes are completely unbalanced, plain and simple. Hmm, we can’t have a player caster take down a player warrior in one or two spells, so we’ll just handicap the casters. Did you guys ever stop to think that maybe the current power level of the casters was just about right, but that the melee classes are instead horribly under-powered?? There should be NO change in power of any sort when people duel. Spells should NOT be toned down. Pets should NOT be toned down. The very fact that these rules exist means that other classes should be toned up to match. Again, I still believe that a HIGH level wizard SHOULD be able to defeat a warrior of equal level. The general power-curve of a typical caster starts lower but ramps higher than the power curve of a melee type (which should be pretty linear). However, what you have is a power ramp for melee classes that stagnates at the top of an S-curve. Poor design.<P>Case 2 (Soloing):<BR>High level melee classes can’t solo a damn thing. In fact, even monsters that con "green" are often too powerful for a well equipped warrior to solo. Meanwhile, druids and other spell casting classes are not only soloing "blue" creatures, but even quad-kiting them! On top of this, even if I do find the occasional "blue" mob that I can solo, the recovery time from such an encounter is about 10 times the recovery period of an equal level caster. Wow, talk about well-balanced classes on Verants part (sarcasm intended). Now, I understand Verants desire to make people group more. In theory this is a noble goal. However, what Verant is actually saying is, "We just want melee types to group more". In reality, I enjoy grouping in EQ. However, the CONSTANT need for a group in this game is at times REALLY ANNOYING! Sometimes I just want to sit down at my computer and go kill some monsters without the setup time it takes to form a party and find a camp.<P>Case 3 (Armor Class):<BR>Two of the most fundamental attributes of the warrior are AC and Hit Points. Interestingly enough, Verant doesn’t actually seem to think warriors should be able to acquire the equipment needed to attain excellence in these attributes. Now, I’m not complaining about the best armor we can get in the game. What I take objection to is an equal level shaman that can attain AC equal to or better than myself and NOT NEED THE ASSISTANCE OF ANYONE. What is up with this rip-off? A caster can, by himself, get armor that nearly equals my armor that took AT LEAST one full group to acquire. Give some melee types a break and spread the armor around a bit more. On top of that, it seems that all the best warrior armor has to be some of the more rare-drop items in the game. Compare some top-of-the-line shaman armor or bard armor to some top-of-the-line warrior armor and you’ll see a price difference of at least 2x. True, there is a greater demand for the warrior items because there are more warriors. And why wouldn’t there be more warriors? You need a ton of them to be effective because they are so under-powered. If they weren’t under-powered then why decrease the spell effects and pet power? We’re all on the same level, right?  (Again, much sarcasm intended.) One possible solution to this problem is to adjust the frequency of dropped items based on how many people in the game can use the item (pretty simple really). The current configuration of the game creates an unbalanced game economy.<P>And speaking of twisted economies: People use to sell EQ items on E-Bay. At one point I saw a Cobalt Breast Plate (warrior) and an Elder Spiritist Breast Plate (druid) up for auction at the same time. I did not bid on either item, but I was curious to see the final prices of these two highly desired pieces of armor, as there are a large number of people playing these two classes. The final prices were:<BR>ES BP: $535 (approx.)<BR>Cobalt BP: $1008 (approx.)<P>Wow. Nice economy you guys have created. From this, I’d say both druids and warriors are getting screwed, but warriors are really taking it hard.<P>Proposed solutions:<BR>1.  Increase the number of hit points for melee classes. Warriors should be granted a substantial HP bonus. Rogues and monks should be granted a smaller, yet still significant, bonus. In fact, I would consider raising the HP of most classes with warriors receiving, by far, the biggest gains. An alternative to this would be to GREATLY increase the level range of "blue" creatures for the melee classes to actually represent the REAL challenge that a monster poses and grant experience accordingly.<BR>2.  Change the drop tables to reflect the number of characters that are going to want that particular item. This will create a more balanced EQ economy across all classes.<P>Addressing complaints from other EQ classes:<BR>No, I am NOT saying any of the other classes are over-powered. I’m not saying anything bad about the other classes whatsoever. I’m not saying that ALL of the really good warrior items are harder to get than the items for other classes. I have played many of the other classes in this game, and have friends that have played all the classes I’ve never touched. I’ve seen the power balance in EQ and, quite honestly, it sucks. The melee classes have clearly been ripped-off in my very educated opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*****************************************<BR>I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem. But how to do so without making Warriors completely uber? I came up with two ideas.<BR>Idea #1<BR>As far as I know, all races and classes experience a penalty to AC when attacked from the rear, and as far as I know this penalty is equal (I have not seen anyone suggest otherwise or do any particular study on this). What if we remove or reduce this penalty for the Warrior class? It would only make sense that Warriors would know how to guard their back better than other classes. If removing the penalty entirely is too much, then it could simply be reduced, say by 50 percent, or added as a discipline.<P>Idea #2<BR>All Ogres are immune to melee stun from the front. What if we extend this ability to all warriors? Right, the Ogres are going to be outraged! To make them happy, give the Ogre Warrior immunity to melee stun from the back as well. Okay, this does seem like a pretty large improvement to the Warrior class, and I can understand if this gets a flat no. But a gift like this to the Warrior class would let you give an equally good gift to the SKs and Paladins.<BR>*********************************************<P><BR>this sounds like a good idea, give all warriors post 55 the immune to stun and give ogres immune to stun from the back as well.<P>Improve SK/Pal defense and give lvl 57+ pal/SK 50% reduction in being stunned.<P>Hybrids get a bone, warriors get a parallel buff and everyone is happy.<P>Dont worry with a small increase in defense and a slight reduction in the chance to get stunned warriors are still going to be wanted on raids and hybrids will still be looking in from the outside</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

When it's in effect, every time you press the Taunt key, every NPC in melee range is automatically taunted with a much larger lead in the hate list than a successful Taunt normally gives (you know, long enough to hit you once or twice before going back to pummeling the Monk).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a whole I think warriors are fine but I think there is a few areas that could be tweaked a bit to balance the class out.<P>Warriors in general are a fairly basic class, we do not have spells to cast or any other unique talents unlike the other classes (I guess we do have crits and crips), which means effectively we are pretty much dependent on our weapons and armour for our effectiveness.<P>So my first point to indirectly balance our class is to make our warrior specific armour and weapons either easier to obtain or the stats beefed up respectively.<P>Lets look at the Cobalt armour first, now I'm not sufficiently high enough in level yet to even begin to try and obtain the armour but from listening and reading other fellow warriors, this armour is nigh nearly impossible to get. The drop rate is far to low compared to the other classes high-end armour and yet unarguably Warriors are the one class that ulitmately depend on their armour for survival.<P>I won't repeat what the others have said about the obtainability of the Epic Weapon but I think the others that have mentioned making certain drops common instead of rare would be beneficial.<P>Likewise, I definetly think the effectiveness of Taunt needs to be addressed. If we are supposed to be the meat shields of a group, please make it easier for us to keep mobs on us. I find it nearly impossible when grouped with a Rogue and/or a Monk to keep the mob on me instead of it on them. Makes me feel like I can't do my job properly if the healers in the group have to heal both the Rogue and Monk more then me becuase I can't keep the mob interested in me.<P>I like the idea of a skill that worked like a AE Taunt where once used all attacking mobs would turn and concentrate on us instead of having to madly run around and try to select the correct mob to taunt them back onto us.<P>Another thing that concerns me and many others in the amount of times we miss hitting a target. If we are meant to be the masters of weaponary and warfare, why oh why do we miss our targets so much? It makes a mockery of our class and our description, what sort of weaponmaster is it that misses their target all the time? I don't think we even deserve that title if we can't live up to its description. You would'nt even have to consider increasing our damage output if we are able to hit creatures more often then we currently do.<P>Thats it for now but I'll see what others come up with. I would just like to reiterate that warriors are purely dependent on their equipment, so disregarding any concerns about our equipment and only contentrating on our inate abilities may not be beneficial.<P>Kullnan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is something that i have long puzzled over playing a warrior.  We are supposed to be the masters of melee.  Yet monks and rogues can outdo us in damage dealt in melee.  I don't remember a discription of warriors being 'you can take a hell of a lot of damage but are only mediocre at dealing it out'.  SKs and Paladins look for more balance and look to be better tanks but keep in mind that being a tank is the ONLY thing we can do.  We have no spells and no special mystical abilities like monks.  If you start to consider all of the other things that other classes can do that warriors cannot then having those other classes close to warriors in HPs, AC and melee capabilities is a slap in the face.  I'm not even counting the disciplines which are rather useless for the most part because of the insane reuse times.<P>and i'm sorry, the ability to use all weapon skills is not a good argument to use when pointing to our 'abilities'.  We can only use two of those skills at a time (maximum) and doesn't help us anymore than other classes.  We are masters of melee, why do other classes have higher caps on these melee skills... doesn't make sense.<P>I won't touch on other subjects because they have already been brought up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is too a reason to play a halfling warrior. But you'd have to play one to at least the mid-levels to find out what it is...<P>But I will mention this for free: hide and sneak (especially sneak) are very handy things to have. And I think a little bit of haste wouldn't be too unbalancing.<P>My issue is taunt. When a monk is in the group, I want to be able to taunt the monster on to me ANYWAY. Without having to ask other players to stop fighting. I really consider taunt to be the class-defining skill of the warrior. When I hit taunt, I'd like to see that monster staring right at me (unless it's tall, it would have to crouch...)

</FONT><HR>Allen, <P>I understand that at this point you are just scanning the posts for their main points.  I urge you to read this one more closely.  <P>My biggest problem is that for some reason evaluations for warrior items and skills are made as if every warrior goes for strength.  This is simply not the case.  I for instance am a wood elf warrior my natural strength is 75.  My natural agility is 125.  With gear my strength is only 110 and my agility is 174 with dexterity of 123.  Do you see my point?  Warrior armor is too heavy.  I like the quest for crafted that can size it to small.  That was great.  There should be more of that.  Also improve warrior gear and skills for those of us small races that want agility or dexterity rather than strength.<P>Also, I know you saw, when talking about shadow knights and paladins, that they all want to be warriors that cast spells.  They want the AC and higher skill caps.  You even had to tell them in a few posts that all those things are reserved for warriors. <P>That brings me to my next point.  Stop giving hybrids everything they ask for.  I know some things need to be fixed, but they now get disciplines and they are demanding more things that I feel infringe on my role in a group.  Almost every class in EQ has a slight solo capability; however, the warriors cannot solo.  They depend on group play.  I like that idea.  I like being in groups, but when hybrids infringe on that it bothers me.  And please do not give me the simple response of "oh but warriors are the supreme tanks by far" because you know that is not entirely true.  Yes warriors are the best at tanks, but not by as much as you think.  This is compiled by the fact that a lot of late level mobs quad hit in the 300s.  Perhaps more ac or hp would help that??  <P>Another problem that I have, and you should have read it many times by now is taunt.  Taunt does not "work as intended" because anything higher than green just won't taunt unless of course a warrior is almost dead.  Taunt really should be increased for warriors.<P>Those are my main problems.  Just in case you did skim through and not read, I will restate in summary.  NOT EVERY WARRIOR IS AN OGRE OR CONCERNED WITH STRENGTH.  DO NOT OVER COMPENSATE HYBRIDS SO THAT THEY INFRINGE ON WARRIORS ROLE OF TANK.  ALSO UPGRADE TAUNT.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally I like my Warrior (level 45 Barbarian).. The class over all is very well balanced and it is fun to play.  Yes, binding sometimes is a problem, so is the travelling issue.  But on the otherside of the coin, I've been a grunt most of my adult life (see my handle?), so getting where I need to go on 2X is not something I really consider a problem.  I can always ask for a sow or pay for a port if I need to get someplace quickly.  However, I have seen some good ideas here and would like to add my 2 coppers worth to them.<P>1.)  Warriors Battle Yell.  I like this idea for the following reason.  Your average skinny caster standing in front of a charging Troll is going to have at least a momentary heart stopping pause if they hear something like a Banshee screech as this enraged Troll-Warrior comes charging at them.  This is something that maybe should be race based, maybe not.  But there are other things that could be done for Warriors of different Races.  Personally I think that the Warriors of different Races should have something that makes their particular race different from Warriors of other races.  Trolls/Ogres get a Charging bonus.. Barbarians get a Berzerker Bonus (i.e. Berzerkers usually SCARED their Opponents into retreat whether or not the opponent was fresh meat or not).  Humans, better at 2 handed wield (i.e. hit more often and thus cause more damage).  Wood/High Elves have higher dexterity and hit more often and are harder TO hit (ok so there's not ALOT of diff between humans and elves).  Halflings/Dwarves are MUCH harder TO hit for creatures/npc's/PC's that are of Troll/Ogre size and larger, plus maybe they get one special Critical hit (being smaller they can get access to places on an opponent that a Barb/Troll/Human/Elf couldn't) maybe this could have the same effect as a Stun spell or better.<P>2).  Make the Disarm work better.. I've seen Rogues at 10 levels lower than me disarm 3 times as much and my skill level is definately higher.<P>Anyway lol, not wanting to start a novel, but that's my 2 coppers worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I’m going to take time with this thread because I have been on the warrior front line since beta and not a week since have I not played my character. I’m typically very brief to make a point and get out but since you asked I will share my feelings on the warrior class.<P>We have come a long way, a very very long way. For that I think you. I recall a time when our zenith was equal to a ranger with more HP.  I won’t go on about the past, as this thread is to address the future. Warriors are a remarkable class now but there are a few very minor things to seal them up forever as far as performance issues go.<P>-----HIT POINTS ------<BR>We lead in the HP and remain the superior tanks; there is no doubt about that. The only issue here is that Stamina and HP items of superior quality are not as readily available as the mana counterparts. Items with 20 mana do not equal 20 hit points. I think Verant has been a bit singy on HP items generally but specifically for the warrior class. The best single items for a tank imho so far (as far as individual items go) are Djarns Am Ring (80 hp) and the Degas (Ac 20, 100 HP). Very hard to get but married to the life blood of the warrior HP!! I would suggest more items breaking the 100 HP + for all classes and with hope, 200, 250, 300 + HP?  I don’t know about most tanks, but being hit in the plain of Growth for double 700 would go down a lot easier if I had 2 300 HP items. Make them hard to get but please give us buffers. It’s one of the few things we could ask for and it’s so very basic and yet conspicuously absent. Like I said, more HP for EVERYONE but perhaps a larger warrior only version with a higher amount.<P>------EPIC ------- <BR>Make the hands interchangeable. One is good for tanking, one is good for procing, let us decide what goes in the main hand yea? <P>Green scale: should be on Wushi in the Waking Lands.  If you look at the flow of the warrior quest the only massively critical stop is on Sev in EJ. A 3-4 day spawn with the occasional chance the scale will drop is causing way too much animosity among the warrior community. Even though I have my epic now I look back that the major hurdle and it’s the green scale. Either make Sev drop it 100% or add Wushi to the drop list. Wushi is once a day so the odds go up yet it retains the same degree of difficulty. Don’t change the queen, she is the last great epic battle for the blade and to hold the room is the allure of the challenge.<P><BR>------TRANSPORT-------<BR>Can I tell you, as melee the one thing that injected new life into my character was the discovery and useage of the Workers Hammer that ports to Overthere and then the boat to Tim Deep to  use the fire pots. I can be anywhere in less than 30 min (outside of velouse) and I feel like a new person with that kind of liberation of zoneing and walking. More port options like this ARE HIGLY ADVISABLE.  Also more port potions that are dropable make life so so so much more enjoyable. I have never heard a druid complain that they didn’t get to port me from West Wastes to Ferrott because I used a potion. In fact all the wizards and druid I know are sick of the “taxi” label, making my job harder getting around.<P>So in short, my suggestion would be to make the Eye Totems in velous some type of port tied into a fire pot kind of situation. Even better would be to also activate the white symbols and quest in some place to port to and fro. In my minds eye the best scenario would be this:<P>Party forms in West Waste I’m in The Hole.<BR>I proc to over there<BR>I boat to fire pots<BR>I click on the pot that is in Nariack<BR>In Nariack I say some phrase or click something that takes me to a velous symbol next to an eye totem<BR>I click something on the eye totem and cycle through all the location they key into until I come to a stop in West waste.<P>That make sense?<P>And finally, more binding location, and a way to solo bind (pay an npc or something). Blah blah blah. Don’t really NEED it but it’s one of the droning requests that I fee obliged to put down. <P>TAUNT – <BR>Yea, I know it was “fixed” but as a warrior with max str and haste with epics, I still cannot taunt off monks =/<P>Perhaps if taunt layed on a different hate layer with phantom damage? Damage not actually there but the mob receives with every taunt. Crank that puppy up a few notches hehehe.500-800 pts of phantom damage a taunt should do it.<P>Area Taunt – Very good idea. A high lvl skill that would work on a group of MEZED mobs while you continue to fight on the main target.<P><BR>------DISIPLINS------- <BR>/dis is fun but I think the timer on them is a bit silly. Where I don’t think they should be available all the time I don’t think there is a single /dis that is soooo powerful that it can be reset in less than 20 min. The best one we have is defensive and it’s reset is almost perfect at level 60. Can we loose the 1 hr refresh already? I have used repost a total of twice and find it, in fact, kinda sucks. Same with charge, aggression, and fortitude. Each one should just be 15 min and have a very unique flavor to them. Right now they are either very good of kind of lame. Let me break it down:<P><BR>*********************<BR>“EVASIVE (Level 52):<BR>The warrior is hit by his opponent less often, but also will hit his target less often. “<BR>*********************<BR>This is not noticeably the case. In a perfect world this /dis would make warriors hard to hit not take damage off the top. Right now you get hit the same but for a little less. This SHOULD be the /dis to use against MOB’s like Venril Sather where actually getting hit means life or death, not still getting hit but for less damage. 15 min refresh would be fine if this worked as it sounds like it should.<P>*********************<BR>“CHARGE (Level 53):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent. “<BR>*********************<BR>This is true and it is a nice dis. However  over time a few things diminish it. First of all, as your skill goes up the odds of you hitting all the time also goes up, rendering the /dis about useless after lvl 55. Second, you only get charge for 14 seconds… then you have to wait  around 30 min again? That makes it not worth it right off the bat. Charge should be something that is a throw away. At 60 it would be nice to charge to be sure to hit all the time for 30 seconds or so to get the agro back, but the recharge in no way should be over 5 min. Take a lvl 60 and hit a mob for 30 sec normal, then hit it with charge and see what bonus you get for your 30 min down time… I’m willing to bet under 5%. So, 30 second charge, 5 min recharge, throw away /dis.<P>*********************<BR>“MIGHTY STRIKE (Level 54):<BR>When using this discipline, all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows.”<P><BR>MUHAHAHAHHAHAHA. I love this one. I don’t care if I crit for 10 I love to see a string of hits! This works fine, my only suggestion is to refresh in line with defensive at 15 min. Now we wait an Hr. for a string of hits that is MAYBE 6-8 long if we are lucky, 1-2 if you’re not.<P>*********************<BR>“DEFENSIVE (Level 55):<BR>The warrior takes less melee damage, but also deals less.”<P>*********************<P>This owns. Only criticism is that as velouse comes to it’s own we see these uber long fights and defensive runs out a lot of times. Maybe extend the time on it every other level? 55 = 3 min, 57 = 4 min, 60 = 5 min?<P>I love defensive, perfect function, perfect timing, perfect everything. And because of what it does this /dis will never stop being useful. <P>FURTHERMORE, I would suggest giving this /dis to Shadow Knights and Paladins.<P>*********************<BR>“FURIOUS (Level 56):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes.”<BR>*********************<BR>This one is ok. My only real issue is that compare to:<BR>*********************<BR>“FORTITUDE (Level 59):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes.”<BR>*********************<P>Those 2 make no sense in that order. At lvl 59 I’m basically invincible for 9 seconds AND I can repost but at lvl 59 I’m only invincible for 8 seconds and have to wait LONGER? Ummmm, what? I’m surprised no one has brought this up as lvl 59 is surprisingly lame. Especially since if you are running for zone and hit this you most likely will be summoned anyway so really, why bother? My take would be to refresh each at 15 min and swap them in lvl order or get rid of the lvl 59 one and give us something else.<P>*********************<BR>“PRECISION (Level 57):<BR>The warrior will have a greater chance to hit his target, but will also have a greater chance of being hit. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes.”<BR>*********************<P>This one is a lot like charge, kinda nice but has no real purpose on it’s own and is no where as apparently productive as the other 3 min /dis defensive. My opinion is that it should be refreshed to 15 min and give a 3 min window where you are favored to Critical hit. Like Fell Strike but not 100% sure to crit but over a 3 min span. Maybe a 25% chance to Crit on each hit over 3 mins? That would give this an awsome life of its own.<P>*********************<BR>“FORTITUDE (Level 59):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes.”<BR>*********************<P>I like it but it lacks the eye candy factor of fell strike. Also 8 seconds for 1 hour? Come on… 15 min refresh and 20 seconds long. Remember that every level is a hell level and 59 is the worst possible hell imaginable. 60 min of a discipline seems silly on principle.<P>*********************<BR>“AGGRESSIVE (Level 60):<BR>The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed, but will also take more damage as well.”\<BR>*********************<P>This is FALSE of broken. The description read like you hit for 30, 35, 40, 46, 70, 80, 89, 95, 100, 200, 300! But that is not the case. It would be awesome if that worked that way but it doesn’t. Right now it’s a cut and paste version of the level 57 PRECISION. Look into it please as it seems to be busted.<BR>Now I hit for marginally more damage but it’s not incremental. This is the pinnacle of the warrior /dis. This is what we waited and waited for make it meaningful. Hitting for more and more would be amazing even if it was only for 2 min.<BR>You may think if it worked like that you would see hits for 100000000 but that’s not the case, warriors still manage to miss a lot thus resetting the damage to 0. Strings of 30, 40, 50 ,60, 0. 30,40,50, 60. Would be cool but not more than 4x the base I’d wager.<P>------HASTE ------<BR>Finnaly I would ask that there be items that approche the 60% haste so we can meet enchanters closer to half way as far as melee speed goes.<BR>Also, more locations on the body for max haste! I am hateing life now that the belt of four winds has to compeat with the belt of dwarf slaying.<P>Whew, thanks for staying with this post, I know it’s long but I think it’s a pretty unbiased and educated look at the areas of the warrior class that are not technically broken but could stand to polish our beautifully constructed class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ooh I have had this idea for awhile and this seems the perfect place to share it. <P>What I propose is not a change to Taunt but add a new combat skill 'enrage or Insult or something of that sort' which would be trainable once you hit level 50. This skill would be useable once every 2 or 3 minutes and would be a near unresistable super taunt. You could use still use taunt for most situations but if ever it became imperative for you to take damage over someone else you would use this skill. <P>This skill would make level 50+  warriors VERY happy without changing their role in any way.

</FONT><HR>Most of my list has already been posted, and Absor asked us not to repeat ourselves over and over, so I'll only touch the ones that haven't been listed already.<P>Increase the rate of critical hits (already mentioned) or increase the damage (already mentioned), or allow random critical hits to become crippling blows, even when not berserk.<P>Berserk is currently only an indication that I will either die soon or get healed.  Other than that it has very little use, since crippling blows are quite rare in normal berserk situations.  I would like to see our rate of crippling blows increased while berserk, along with a much larger strength increase, and immunity to fear, and increased double attack/dual wield percentages.  In short, I'd like berserk to become a useful and desireable state, balanced by the fact that you have to be at 40% health or less.<P>Allow us to berserk at higher health percentages at higher levels.  For example, starting at level 40, +1% per level up to 60% health at level 60.<P>And one thing I'd like to see for all melees:<P>The ability to double attack on secondary attacks. Rogues can do this with backstab at 55, and backstab is the most damaging of all secondary attacks.  Why not allow the rest of us to double bash, and double kick, including monk's flying kick?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>The warrior class is a very well balanced class when viewed from the big picture.  I'd go so far as to say that there really are no fundamental changes needed to warriors.<P>1) We are highly desired in both standard 6 man group fighting<BR>2) We are highly desired in any type of large scale raid<BR>3) We are effective in combat from level 1 all the way to level 60<BR>4) What we do best (tank) we do better than anyone else<BR>4) We are fun to play<BR>5) We get all kinds of fun toys<P>I could spend quite some time arguing why a large number of ideas brought up in this thread (faster healing, aoe attacks, binding, travelling, etc) are completely unneccessary but I'm sure the EQ team will reach the same conclusions.<P>Having said all that, there are a few tweaks that I sure wouldn't mind seeing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>1) Epic Quest -- Most of the points have been made (queen blade, delay on main hand weapon, etc.).  I'll just simply say I agree.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2) Cobalt Helm and Bracer -- Again, ditto what everyone else has said about the drop rates.<P>3) Disarm -- Useless...then again, so what?  It would be nice if this could do something useful, but it's not a big deal that it doesn't.  It's certainly not hurting our class.<P>4) Taunt -- As others have mentioned, a warrior's primary job is to taunt.  The changes made to post 50 taunt abilities were great.  I think they are almost sufficient.  The fact is, if all warriors could taunt as well as we want to, a lot of encounters would be trivialized.  The difficulty in taunting some mobs is what makes some encounters difficult.  So I feel any wide ranging improvements to taunt would be unbalancing.  <BR>What I think would be neat is a taunt discipline, that improves the performance of taunt for a short time (not unlike the SK harm touch discipline).  It could do something as simple as remove the higher-than-you level cap on taunt.  Perhaps it could raise the success rate of taunt.  It could possibly even make taunt succeed 100%.  All of these are viable depending on the duration and reuse time of the discipline.  By improving taunt through a discipline, you avoid unilaterally increasing the effectiveness of taunt for all combat, and force the warrior to make the tradeoff between increased taunt and increased tanking (defensive) and increased damage (fellstrike, aggressive, etc).<P>5) Piercing skill cap -- Warriors are the masters of armed combat, skilled with *all* weaponn types. Why is this cap lower than the rest?  With the introduction of 2h piercers, and the large number of high quality piercers introduced in Rok and Sov, this needs to be raised to match the other caps.<P>As I mentioned above, the warrior really is a balanced class.  We are fun, we are desired, and we have a role in most situations.  Any changes would simply be gravy on top of what I feel is a great class.<P>Durgo<BR>53rd Dwarven Champion<BR>&lt;Letalis Ericius&gt;  E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>L54.5 warrior checking in...<P>- Epic item. Yah, I know this is on class balance, not epic quest balance, but at L55+, folks start giving serious though to epic items. I can live with having to deal with some of the tougher mobs (2 kunark dragons, spiroc lord, queen of chardok), but the rare drop on a nasty guy seems... well... excessive. The dragons are on fairly long timers, which will limit the number of blades anyway. Perhaps you could toss us a bone and at least make the items from Maestro, Chardok Queen, and Spiroc Lord drop every time? In 6 killings of Maestro since the epic quests went live, I've seen the hand drop once, on another guild's raid. I've got friends in a few other guilds that would give numbers closer to 1 drop in 10 or so. That seems... excessive, since on most servers, it's about 2 months between Hate raids.<P>From the few warriors on our server that have the epic (I've spoken to 2 of the 3 I'm aware of), the taunt seems good IF the weapon procs. Might not hurt to adjust the dmg/dly to increase the taunt when it doesn't proc.  Just a thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>- Shields: someone else suggested making them useful. I'd agree. At the moment, sure, you look the shield from Fear, but I think I've worn mine exactly twice: once to see how it looked, and once when tanking an extra one of the seahorses in Kedge. Other than that, about 9 months of lugging it around.<P>- Weapon Variety: at the moment, most of the good weapons are swords, with the jade mace as an exception. Maybe a little more variety, even if the weapons are of similar stats to existing weapons? "Jade Brawl Stick", or "Jagged War Axe", etc? Be nice to see a tad more variety in warriors so we don't all have maces or lamentations in hand (or Wurmscrapers).<P>- Piercing Skill: I'm curious why our skill caps lower for piercing than for other weapons. It would seem that there's as much finesse in wielding a scimitar as in poking someone with a spear or dagger. Not a huge thing, though, since most warriors will end up gravitating to swords and maces give the current weapon selections.<P>- Taunt: Outside of the very high-end areas, I'm not sure that there's a huge problem here. Might be nice for taunt to work on Even-con mobs (currently seems to be ignored for anything but blues), and be a tad more effective on high-end blues. Not a huge issue. I always thought AE taunt would be interesting, but I don't think we're unbalanced without it.<P>Overall, I think we're in pretty good shape. I don't think we need HP or AC overhauls (though I admit, the rarity on some of the cobalt pieces _does_ mean that there are SKs and Paladins with equal or higher AC, well, prior to the introduction of Velious armor). We're not very flexible, but we're very good at the little we do. We don't need built-in SoW (potions aren't that expensive, and we're grouped at L50+ anyway, other than getting to/from a hunting area).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Taunting ability is a huge problem for warriors.  The taunt skill seems to just about always work for me (ie the mob turns to me instantly when I press the button) but it keeps the mob on me for all of one hit, and then takes quite a while to refresh.  Rather than tanking, I'm saving the casters from one blow each time the taunt button refreshes, whoopee.<P>The fact that number of hits (or even misses) has a much bigger taunt factor than sheer damage is also a problem.  In my 20's and 30's I wielded a mithril staff, a fantastic warrior weapon.  It will probably always be my favorite weapon, and I applaud the efforts in Kunark to include a variety of excellent warrior weapons of every skill type, rather than just two flavors of slashing.  However, I found that in most groups I was in, I was forced to bag the staff in favor of a vastly inferior damage output dual wield combo simply because I couldn't taunt effectively with a 2 hander, and the dual wielding rogue, monk, or ranger would end up taking the damage.  I would like to see some sort of increase to the taunt factor associated with high damage hits, although I'm not really sure how this could work without causing serious problems for wizards (and backstabs, and flying kicks, and any other class who nukes regularly).  I would think that logically, if say a rogue using fast piercers (what else?) and a warrior swinging a huge 2 handed axe were to attack the same monster at the same time, the monster would be annoyed by a dozen little prics for ten damage each, but he would be PISSED when someone took out a huge chunk of him in a single hit for 100 damage with a big axe.  I would really like to see the game reflect this.<P>An AoE taunt ability is also something that is very much needed, and at the same time would probably LESSEN the demand for warriors and enchanters, making more group variety possible and opening up some room for classes that are considered less critical.  The reason I say this is that as it stands now, a double pull for a group with a single tank and no chanter to mez is usually a death sentence for at least one caster.  If that caster happens to be the group's only healer, it's probably a death sentence for the entire party.  A tank can pull 2 mobs that the party easily has the damage output to drop and the healing capability to survive, but as soon as the first heal goes off the mob the tank wasn't focusing on takes off after the casters, wiping them out one by one while the warrior fights the other without any spell support.  For this reason, groups often require 2-3 tanks, leaving very little room for other classes.<P>An AoE taunt would allow a single warrior to fulfill the group's tanking duties on larger pulls, and would be fairly balanced as well.  It would cause problems if not used carefully, causing additional mobs to aggro, perhaps even ones that would have otherwise been friendly to the group.  It should be added probably at lvl 20, around the time when a warrior should be grouping regularly (and if I remember correctly warriors get no additional skills at 20).  This would be a new taunt skill, allowing the warrior to choose between targetted or AoE taunting in a given situation.  It would be nice if both checked off of the same skill, as it would become very difficult to keep both skills maxed otherwise.<P>Another major issue is HP regeneration.  I am NOT in favor of recieving any sort of increased natural regeneration as it would make warriors a more effective soloing class and that is something we were never meant to be.  However, we do have to travel to get into groups, and there is no class in the game for which travelling is more dangerous.  Random encounters do happen, and they hurt!  Every other class in the game has a way to escape, be it magical speed, invisibility, gate, root, snare or feign death.  We have loads of HP, and sometimes enough to last us to the nearest zone line, but what then?  I'd almost rather die than zone out with a sliver of HP left, as it will take me less time to regain the experience of lost than to sit and naturally heal that much HP.  Again I'm not sure how to fix this without making warriors a solo class.  Any sort of mid-battle regeneration or healing is clearly unbalanced.  Perhaps an increased HP regen rate for warriors only when sitting?  Bind wound might also be a good answer if it were altered a bit to become a viable skill.  As it stands now, the amount healed is a joke for anyone with 1000+ hp (capped at 100 skill till level 50, so 25 hp per bandage).  By the time the cap is removed, even a 200 skill is completely ineffective (yay, I just healed 50 hp, only 1950 more till half health!).  Removing the 100 skill cap and perhaps increasing the effectiveness of the skill would alleviate a lot of boredom and frustration, while the 50% cap would keep downtime long enough that it couldn't be used as a tool for efficient soloing.<P>Finally, there's the epic weapon.  The quest is hard, but others are much harder, so no real complaint there.  The problem is that the reward just isn't worth it.  I'd love to have the epic right now, but at a level where I could obtain it, there are much BETTER weapons for me.  I may be wrong, but I can't think of any other class that would want to discard their epic for something else.  Warriors, however, have at least a half dozen better options for their main hand, as the epic is just too slow.  Sebilite croaking dirk, jade mace, lamentation, crafted velium warsword and a variety of other weapons all taunt more effectively and, with their lower delays and the damage bonuses given to a warrior of sufficient lvl to obtain the epic, probably have  a better overall damage output too.  It is, IMHO, the coolest looking epic in the game, but that's about all it has going for it.<P>Long post, and I know I'm missing some things.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well this is partially a Warrior issue as I play a large sized character. For the amount of problems the large sized characters get I find it disappointing  that there are so many items that are limited to small and medium sized creatures and so few items for the large sized creatures. With so few people playing large sized creatures except fo rthe occasional Shaman and SK you need to do something to spice up the races to make them more attractive to players. <P>Also the biggest problem with Warriors is their ability to be twinked. Almost every high level caster has made a twinked warrior and power leveled it. Twinking a caster is far more difficult as the casters true power comes from their spells but I hate seeing a Warrior in his low teens with godly armor and weapons fighting things that I had a hard time with when I was ten levels higher. While I know NO DROP items were an attempt to stop the twinking there has to be a way to limit the items by level.<P>I wont bother going into detail on the comments that everyone else has decided to focus on (taunting, epic quest, bind wounds, lack of usefull skills after 25, bind points) but I do think that they all need to be looked at. <P>The warriors are a fine class but they lack the pazzaz of the other classes. SOme more funky warrior only items would be appreciated to help diversify the class but I understand that when ever you add things to teh game it always seems to anger someone. Warriors are one of the few classes that are good from level 1 to 60.<P>Thanks. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all-<P>In no particular order, and likely things people have already mentioned:<P>-fix taunt, and the way it works, or give back the weapons like the mossy twig that taunted well.  Maybe give taunt an additional "anti-jolt" effect equal to 2x the level of the warrior... i.e. if it succeeds, taunt = top of hate list + 2x warrior level "phantom" damage; or just 2x warrior level "phantom" damage if it fails.  How about a taunt DoT skill/effect?<P>-make warriors immune to low green frenzy.  ALL other character types have some safe travel options (via speed, invis, skills, etc), except warriors.  Getting aggroed by super green mobs is just pointless and annoying beyond words; I don't want invis, or sow, or FD, just to be able to run across iceclad or FM or even upper guk without pulling a train of green vermin.  They CAN'T kill me, why do they even try??<P>-"soft cap" on AC at 1100; if this exists (rather difficult to statistically measure, due to number of variables and the non-random number generator) please explain why, or eliminate it, especially if the wis/int soft cap is lifted as well.  With mobs that quad attack for 800 and up, we NEED higher AC to stay useful.<P>-disarm is almost totally worthless now; yall fixed disarm/find traps, how about fixing this one?<P>-no skills from 35-50 (and no useful ones from 25-50, see disarm above).  No skill gain from 41-50.  Very boring.<P>-melee binding; yall had a perfectly good solution to this (locket of escape) in a good, reasonable spot (chief in droga) and it got nerfed away.  WHY?  I could definitely see even making it a nodrop in addition to being lore, but was it SOOO imbalancing it had to be eliminated??<P>-magic resistance; any chance this could be extended to general fear resistance?  Running like a screaming girl just doesn't fit the burly warrior genre.<P>-pumice. You nerfed pumice.  The replacement is worthless in melee (even with a timed slam to stun, it's basically impossible to get a cast off vs a GREEN mob without an interrupt).  So a green mob with a damage shield does more damage than most blue mobs without.  How is that balanced?  If you ABSOLUTELY will not change it back, or at least put it on a drop table somewhere LIKE IT WAS PROMISED WHEN IT WAS NERFED, how about giving warriors the same channeling as bards get?  For balance reasons, unless there are super magic/spell resistant green mobs, there shouldn't be super "melee resistant" (via ouchie damage shields) mobs either, ya think?<P>All I can think of off the top of my head, thanks for asking/listening-<P>RdT.<BR>a.k.a.<BR>Remf da Troll<BR>lvl 60 warrior, karana<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Playing 2 warriors, I feel I've got a pretty firm grasp on 'em.<P>The one thing I'd really change is bind wounds.  At 40, the cap is 100.  At 51, it is suddenly 200.  Bind wounds should be scaled to increase from 1 to 60.  Additionally, as others have said, you should be able to bind over 50% health sooner.  A cap of 70% is fine, but once past 100 skill, you should be able to bind 60% or so from 101 to 199.<P>A second gripe, which is about the game as a whole, is stats.  <P>Dex should have a bigger impact upon the chance of getting critical hits.  Right now, dex has very little impact upon the amount of critical hits.<P>Agility should not be a situation of diminishing returns.  Increasing from 100 to 125 gives more benefit than going from 175 to 200.  This is wrong.  It's a problem of most of the stats, really.<P>Stat caps:<BR>They should go.  They were meant for when the game was 1-50.  We now have 10 more levels.  Readjust all stats to be soft capped at 250.  Up until that point, every 10 additional points chucked into the stat should provide greater benefit than the previous 10.<P>Minor things, all.<P>Warriors are fine, really.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I don't have any problems with the warrior class in general aside from the binding issues.  But I have a problem with Iksar high level armor, I know that we can use some of the new plane of growth armor, I know I'll get my set.  But not everyone has the expansion and IMHO Iksar shouldn't have to get the expansion to get their high level armor.    <P>     If you don't want us to get the full AC for planes armor or kunark armor, just put an npc somewhere that trades the planes and kunark armor for scaled Iksar versions with appropriate AC. Just so we have a reason to go the planes.<P>     Also, I'm only going by what I've heard here but the thurgadin warrior armor apperently doesn't allow Iksar war's to wear them aside for the helm, but it seems the shaman and shadownight armor does.  This doesn't seem right to me.<P>     Anyhoo, that's my contribution  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Posting here as a 56th warrior, I agree with most of what has been said here, though I will admit some of what you guys are asking for is way out of line. Remember they are trying to balance warriors, this would not include giving us stuff like new skills (other classes have suggested the same thing in their "talks" and been turned down.)<P>What I propose, aside from the usual epic, cobalt drop increase, taunt increase, hp, ac, yada yada suggestions is an upgrade to how critical hits work. Currently critical hits still can and do less than your normal maximum hit. I know this complaint has been seen before, but why not fix it now? C'mon, it's a CRITICAL hit...it should do no less than at least 1 point higher than your normal max damage hit. If my max hit with a staff of battle is say 150, then a critical hit should do no less than 151. Makes sense to me. Perhaps also decrease the percent of critical hits with kicks? I dunno, but sometimes I see more critical hits with kicks than I do with my normal weapons.<P>Another suggestion I have is to make a final upgrade to 2h weapons that comes into effect at level 45. This would not effect solely the warrior class...it would be an upgrade to anyone who can use 2h weapons. What I'd like to see is an upgrade to the minimum damage. I just hate seeing a 19 point slash with something such as an oggok cleaver with a damage of 44...don't you hate that too? What should be done? Well make a simple change that makes the minimum damage NO LESS than the damage rating of the weapon. Therefore, as long as you are 45+, you could do no less than a 44 point hit with that oggok cleaver you have. This would actually help out 2h weapons a lot I believe, and the level limit would prevent it from being unbalanced in the hands of low level twinks.<P>Aside from that, I cannot really think of much else I'd want, as the warrior class is pretty well balanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, I remember what I missed, small race warriors.  I am one, and I'm proud of it.  However, we suck.  Armor is just too heavy. even with all my loot, food, water, spare arrows and weapons etc in an evil eye bag I'm always begging for a strength buff just to avoid encumberance, and this is with 34 points worth of STR gear.  I could get better STR than that, certainly, but I'm unwilling to sacrifice AC for a relatively worthless stat just so I don't fall to the ground under the weight of my clothing.  I have resized all my crafted armor, which helps a bit but not enough.  I'm finally at the point where I can start thinking about cobalt and such, but I'll never be able to wear it because it is just too heavy and has no resize option like crafted does.<P>We once again get the shaft when it comes to slam vs. kick.  Bash is simply not an option when it requires a shield.  No warrior in their right mind would give up dual wield or the use of a 2 handed weapon just to be able to bash instead of kick.  At lower levels not being able to slam doesn't hurt as much, because kick does more damage anyway.  We lose the ability to stun, but it's a fair trade off.  However, once we reach the cap on kick, which is an incredibly low 150, this skill just sucks.  "Ghetto bashing" (swapping to a shield as bash recycles and then back to a weapon before the weapon delay cycles) is an option, but it seems to be an abuse of game mechanics, is difficult to pull off, and is just not worth the effort and wrist strain.  Small race warriors pay their penalty in terms of worsened stats and lack of ability to stun.  Kick should be capped at the same level bash is, or some offhand weapons should be able to be used in place of a shield for bashing purposes.  This would in no way make small races better warriors than large races, it would just make us good enough.<P>I'm not asking for small races to be as good as large ones.  A barbarian should make a better warrior than a gnome, it's common sense.  However, every other class/race combination in the game can make up for their disadvantages with the proper equipment (stat gear, infravision items, regen tunics, etc) while a small race warrior can never make kick more effective or gain the ability to bash without a shield.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was one of the coauthors of the revised EQ strategy guide, so I think I know what I'm talking about.<P>Please read nillon's post on the first page. That's the best summary of issues I've read so far.<P>I'm going to extend on two of the points that have been brought up.<P>-Epic Quest Design in General. You will notice that there is a strong dislike for rare drops off of super nasty mobs. This is, imho, poor quest design. You can make the mob as nasty as you want, but don't make it a rare drop! The well implemented epic quests (Cleric, Rogue), are CONSISTENT drops off of VERY HARD mobs. This is good quest design. A person can rally a group of friends, and ask them to help him with his epic. Everyone feels good about pitching in to help. However, a warrior does not feel good about asking his friends for the seventh time if they want to kill the chardok queen. Or the spiroc lord. All epics should be re evaluated based on this criterion. Rare drops on super hard mobs is a very bad idea  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Territory infringement. Every class brings this up whenever another class gets a boost. Warriors, however, have a strong claim to be scared about this. Warriors are fine with monks and rogues doing significantly more damange than them. We understand this. Rogues and monks are not tanks, they are damage dealers. I am happy to see the rogue do double my damage. However, it *is* worrying if Paladins and SK's, who already have comparable AC to Warriors, have also close to the same HP and, defense skills. We would like to stay the "masters of tanking",  and we would like there to continue to be a compelling reason to play a warrior instead of a plate hybrid. Significant AC/HP/defense is the the current compelling reason. Please have it continue to be so.<P>I'll conclude by saying again that nillon's post is the best I have read so far, and deserves a printout by verant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all, I play a SK, but I want to help my parent class out.<P>First off to be fair, I would like some help/opinions from you guys. What does 75% Warrior mean? 75% of their Skills (ex not as high defensive and offensive skills), 75% of abilities (ex get abilities at a later time), 75% of discs (meaning getting 75% of the # of them), 75% of power (ex get same discs, abilities, and/or skills, but less powerful) So what do you guys feel SKs should be?<P>Next, UP the HP of Warriors drastically, hybrids can't last nearly as long as Warriors, thereby making it reasonable to give most hybrids more HP (I disagree with SKs getting more, but that is under their talk) DON'T up AC. I didn't remember the last time Warriors were given magical powers, meaning they aren't the "holiest" of people and have powerful armor that has imbued "powers" from their god as a gift for being a Warrior. Warriors should be THE ONE AND ONLY MASTER OF TAKING A BEATING AND KEEP ON BREATHING. How many views are there to Warriors MANY. IMHO Warriors are the "Meat Shields" and are not the smartest of fighters, but use their extensive skills to get them through. DEFINITELY UP the defensive skills of Warriors (reasons stated before) and give them more discs big time. Discs should be spread throughout their entire life (ie 1 every 5 levels?). Well I hope I helped out the Warriors a bit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have been told that once I hit lvl 45, my sword of skyfire will be useless. If warriors could turn off their procs, it would help us get along better with our fellow chanters, and it would make more weapons avadiable to us at higher levels. Also, I have noticed that at high levels, 90% or higher of ALL warriors dual wield, and use Bloodpoints in both hands. Can we get some weapons that are similar to the stats on a bloodpoint, just for some Variety? An Ogre in Full Cobalt/Indico with two little pokers in his hands looks pretty dumb too.
