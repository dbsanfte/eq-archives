&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, after going over the posts, and playing a wizard up to 50th myself, here are my 2 cents worth.<P>We have two defining characteristics as a class:  <BR>1.	Taxi Service<BR>2.	Magical Direct Damage<P>Taxi Service:<BR>Ok, I love this as a defining attribute for our class.  Being a "walker of the hidden ways" has a lot of appeal.  Sadly, Druids do it as well or better.  I have no problem sharing the glory, but if that is fully half of our appeal, at least let us do it right.  I saw the new translocation spell as a serious step in the right direction.  Now all we need are two additional capabilities:<BR>1.	Allow us a spell to port the entire party to OUR bind point.<BR>2.	Give us a secondary bind point.<BR>This would allow us the capability to scout out an area, then bring in the rest of the team.  By no means a safe operation, but definitely in keeping with the lore of the wizard class as finders of the hidden ways.  Also, the second bind point vastly increases our capabilities to shuffle people from one hard to reach area to another.<P>Miscellaneous Taxi notes:<BR>The Cazic gate is ok where it is.  You port, you die, you learn to wait until you are 30th to port there again.  Skyfire is similar, but I would still move it or reroute traffic.  The WK port location is just silly.  Yes, I have heard the "Evil PC needs a safe port" argument, but that is nonsense give the Cazic gate location.  Move the WK portal to Qeynos Hills and make it useful.  'Nuff said.<P><BR>Direct Damage:<P>I agree that pre-Velious we were fairly ok as far as damage was concerned.  Sure, I would burn out my mana and die on a regular basis, but hey, that is the game, right?  Now with the uber mobs it is obvious we just can't contribute diddly anymore.  There are two ways to repair this:  <BR>1.	Increase our firepower<BR>2.	Make our existing spells more capable<P>I really like the suggestions I have heard for #1, to provide a percentage based damage spell.  While this could be tuned to minimize the impact of existing old world zones, it would at least give us a competitive shot at the larger critters in the new world.  I also don't see a chance in Tartarus of VI implementing it.<P>The other option is more subtle.  The key to ALL of our DD capability is not the spell itself, it is the fact that we cast the spell, spend our mana, and we are out of the game.  Having more mana, or a way to effectively get it back in a long battle, would go a long way to making us a more reasonable class.<P>My overall suggestion is to institute a line of familiars for the wizard.  These could act as the focus items of other classes.  A good start is the Eye of Zomm, a familiar that grants distance vision.  As levels increase, familiars could have additional durations and capabilities, including graduated additions to HP, total mana, mana regeneration, and increased capabilities of damage categories.  Not a pet, per se, that attacks or defends the caster, but a summoned being that grants additional capabilities until it is killed.<P>Ideas for the familiar's capability include:<BR>	Level 4: O'Kiels - autocasts O'Kiels radiation on you on a timer <BR>Level 8: Eye of Zomm - as is<BR>Level ?: Adds minor HP/HP regen<BR>Level ?: Adds minor Mana/Mana regen<BR>Level ?: Adds % fire damage<BR>Level ?: Adds % lightning damage<BR>Level ?: Adds % cold damage<BR>Level ?: Adds to evocation specialization<BR>Level 34: Harvest - autocasts Harvest effect for you (without stun) on a timer<BR>Level ?: Adds % chance for critical damage on cast<BR>Level ?: Adds major Mana/Mana regen<BR>	Offsets to these capabilities could include reducing our resistance to elements (trading damage for vulnerability)<P>Miscellaneous DD notes:<BR>Make Harvest a skill, not a spell slot.  Having 1/8th of our total capability taken up at ALL times is a total waste.<BR>Give us more spell slots.  As casters, and only casters, give us the capability to pick the right spell for the right situation.  Giving us the capability to make the right, if subtle, choice of the right spell in combat is only reasonable.<P>Miscellaneous:<BR>Our AoEs are, in my experience, totally useless.  Since some seem to like them however, simply leave them alone and fix the more core issues.<BR>I don't want our class to buff others, it is not our style.<BR>I don't want pets.<BR>Remove the Melee Range to Hit rule.  This is just senseless.<BR>Definitely show damage to group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Obviously Absor, the most thing Wizards are concerned about is our mana usage versus our downtime or regeneration.<P>We are not efficient by any means.<P>Options are...<BR>1) Increase mana pool - by far the worst idea<BR>2) Decrease mana cost - by far the best idea. All spells in all levels should have their costs adjusted to compensate for the fact that we are our mana.... You have become better at sitting(21999) /guild guess what guys, I'm about to break 22k in my sitting skill  /cheer<BR>3) increase availability for wizards to get a mana regen buff. This would be difficult because of balance, but as there are tons of ways for tanks to regen their hp, we only have two avenues for mana regen.<BR>4) Give us something to contribute to the group. Someone suggested giving us a group version of Harvest.  That sounds good.  More people would be more likely to invite a wizard into the group for that free mana.  It's at least SOMETHING we could contribute.  Tanks might even like seeing their mana bar go up and down half a bub. :-)<P>Another thing that I want to bring up. Verant selectively decides when to go with the flow on what the definition of a wizard is. Forgive me if I haven't read enough fantasy novels (and fantasy novels are most of the books I read, and I've read a lot of them), wizards have ALWAYS been a powerful creature, possessing powers that generate both fear AND respect. They are not a force to be taken lightly.  I think Verant has bastardized the wizard title. Nothing and no one fears us, and nothing and no one respects us as a class.  Nobody thinks we're powerful; nobody thinks we are worthy or our title; nobody fears--or even worries--about stepping on a wizard's toes.<P>Make our class into something that generates respect for our class. Give us something that will ensure that post 50, we'll be able to keep fighting with our friends.<P>And at least for class balance, at least LISTEN--not just HEAR--to what we have to say, like you do for the other classes. Listen to what we're saying.  We have had many GREAT suggestions, none of which I have seen addressed by Absor.  Most of the 'fixes' that you propose don't seem to have been gotten from those of us that play this class, but from your staff.  And I think you really should introduce this 'secret' you are talking about with your colleagues. This is a discussion. Why can you not ask us what our opinions and suggestions are? Isn't what this thread is about?<P>Oh yeah, I forgot.  The wizard class is balanced and unbroken.  Verant knows best.  We just don't know what we're talking about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Ok ? you are asking for input on how to make Wizards more balanced, so in my opinion, here goes. I figure I have only this one shot at grabbing your attention. I will try and make this short and sweet. I play a 49 Human Wizard on Veeshan.<P>Role ? Please have VI define our role within this land you have created. Our definition has changed numerous times since I purchased the game. Can we once and for all define our role in Everquest?<P>Experience ? I have heard it said, that you truly do not understand someone unless you walk a mile in their moccasins. Alan ? I challenge you to play a Wizard on a "normal" server with "normal" people to level 50. No twinking, no special gimmicks. Only then could you ever understand how the class works, plays, and interacts with others. I have found and have read posts by you and other folks that talk about how a class plays and looks ON PAPER and in hypothetical situations. We can all crunch numbers and mana ratios, casting times, yadda, yadda, yadda. But until you actually have to use those in a REAL battle on a REAL server, it just does not wash.<P>Honestly, I think that you do really want to fix the issues regardless of what class. And I know that it must be difficult for you to try and comprehend some classes that you might know about on paper, but have never played on a daily basis. Quite frankly ? I am always learning about them myself as I interact with them.<P>Suggestion: Have a member of Verant create a character on a normal server ? not a test server, and play that character with real people (customers) from level 1 to level 60. Have one represent each class and they can choose whatever name they want, but have them be an advocate for the customers. Obviously ? their true identity is hidden. I honestly think that if you were to play a class through the majority of your life in real world situations, you would understand why they ask for what they ask for and what the real issues are, all things considered. This class advocate could be the voice of the customer to VI. Rather than focusing everything through you and having you attempt to try and understand each classes intimate details, this seems to make more logical sense to me. You can interact with this person who could speak fluent VI language and explain the reasoning behind some of the classes issues and complaints. Again ? classes on paper or in the designers desk look good, but playing them on a daily basis provides more indepth knowledge that is quite different than any designer can imagine.<P>Group friendliness ? Currently, VI has increase the exp modifiers for dungeons, hybrids, and groups. I think this is great overall, but it will now focus on a larger issue. Group friendliness. If folks now want to get more exp, they will seek out folks to start grouping with more frequently. VI wants people to group ALL THE TIME. That is ok ? I can understand that and I do like to group. But what I now find, is that it puts even more pressure on certain classes to appear group friendly. What does each class have to offer? What makes a Wizard sought after for grouping? Evacs ? yes. Damage ? maybe, depends where you are. If you are in Velious ? forget it. Against UBER mobs ? yes, but how often in your normal life are you going up against UBER mobs in Kunark? I have yet to see a one, myself. So that means that 100% of my time is trying to find a group. I happen to think I have a decent reputation on my server and know a lot of nice people. That helps me get into groups. However, I am also passed by quite a bit, due to the fact, that what I have to offer is often offered by another class with extra benefits. Let?s look at the group friendliness of a Wizard. What do we have to offer a group:<P>1) Evacs, Ports ? Druids offer these as well to groups, but also can DoT, Backup heal, Regen, SoW, damage shield (for tons more that our pathetic lil ones).  Question ? given this ? why have a Wizard in your group?<P>2) Fast Damage ? supposedly we are the Kings in this area. This is why I started a Wizard way back when. We can do damage fast, but at a price ? high aggro and burning through our mana quickly. With the recent weapon updates and new weapon clickable procs for melee classes, we are now becoming obsolete. Why waste a group slot with a Wizard, when your bracer, BP, or weapon can proc a Wizard spell? The trend I see is adding an extra melee class to the groups as they can do steady damage over time. The need for "fast damage" has become no longer sought after. Obsolete. Since this is our claim to fame ? you can see why Wizards are miffed to say the least about the direction the game is going in with regards to our effectiveness. We have become a "fluff" class. Not really needed, but nice to have around. Healing and melee damage are the heart of any group. Without them, you cannot have a group.<P>3) Overall damage output - There is also a question of damage overall. Casting classes with pets can aid groups far more than a Wizard can. If we are out of mana ? the game is over. We sit and med. Mana regeneration is the #1 issue with Wizards as we rely on that solely for our ability to do what we do best. Since we have an INT cap, the hunt goes from INT equipment once maxed to equipment that has +mana. Anything and everything is geared for us to increase our mana pools as high as possible to increase our effectiveness. For those of us that are not in large or UBER guilds, most of this stuff is not available to us. Having an additional melee class in the group is more advisable as they can continue to do damage overall and at the end of the fight, actually out total damage a Wizard that had a full tank of mana. With the advent of Complete Heal, the issue becomes more of a mana issue for the Cleric. Again ? the choice? Not a Wizard, but another melee class. Easier to deal with ? less problems. CH that melee class and we are going again. Wizard is still medding, Cleric too, but at least they do not have to wait as long as for a Wizard.<P>4) AC and Hit points ? Wizards gave up strength, Armor class, and Hit points in order to gain the skills in fast magical damage. We are extremely fragile and if a mob is aggroed, do not last long even with shielding. In a group setting, this can get tricky and actually shows the skill of the Wizard. You learn not to aggro the mob by experience. But at times it happens. It is a hard edge to walk. Melees get tired of taunting off a Wizard and Clerics get tired of healing a Wizard. This creates the concept that Wizards are more "baggage" that what they are worth. The damage output compared to having to aid them due to their frailty is sometimes more that what other players want to deal with. Better have a melee with armor or a caster with buffs than a frail Wizard.<P>5) Perception ? What I find to be another issue in balance is perception. With most classes, players know what their role is ? what they do. Clerics heal and buff. Melee classes fight, Enchanters give buffs and mez and clarity, Shaman buff and dot and offer a wide variety of player assisted spells. The list goes on. But what does the Wizard offer others? Well ? we are basically selfish. Even our Epic weapon is a self buff only. Does not aid anyone in the group at all with damage output or a buff. It just saves us money from buying those darned expensive Peridots!  J  Almost all of my utility spells are self only. I cannot share my toys with others at all ? well with the exception of invis and levitate. But these really do not aid players during a battle. Wizards perception is all guesswork from players that do not play them. We are mystical. Folks do not understand what we do. This is an issue that VI needs to address. If VI does not know how we fit into the grand scheme of things, then surely the players do not either. Countless times I have had to educate group members on what I can do and show by example what I can offer the group to aid them. I have to consistently PROVE my worth based on my effectiveness, more so than any class. I consistently get rave reviews about my play style (on good days! /grin) and have opened some eyes as to how effective a Wizard can be. But this is a daily struggle. I also play a Warrior and a Cleric. I do not have to explain anything to anybody with them, as basically everyone knows what a Warrior and a Cleric do. That is a no-brainer. It is 10X easier for me to find a group playing either one of those classes. They are not easy to play, mind you, all classes have their difficult areas, but I have found so far that they are more enjoyable and rewarding to play. They are also more sought after. So ? what is the perception of Wizards - whining, fragile, not needed, teleporters, and aggro players. How to change that? I am not sure ? but VI has added to the problem greatly with their lack of direction for the class. If VI is unsure about the direction of the class and it?s perception ? how can we blame the players for not knowing? I can only change players minds one at a time ? and with your high subscription level for the game, it will take me quite a bit of time to get around to everyone.  /grin<P>Suggestions for the Wizard class:<P>Other before me have posted quite a bit of great information in regards to spell line changes. I will not post about those as you probably have the hint by now.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>If VI wants the game to be enjoyable for Casual and UBER, if you have not guessed by now ? I am a casual player, then something needs to be done not only for Wizards, but for every class to make them more unique and sought after in groups. There is no spell that is solely a Wizard characteristic. Now that Translocate is in the game ? this is a spell that no other class has. I am ecstatic to see this as it adds a uniqueness to our class just as Call of the Hero added uniqueness to Magicians. These spells have their good and bad points, but at least it shows that there is something unique and desired from these classes. We need to see more of this, and with the understanding of the balance I know you want to see in the game.<P>My apologies for such a long post. I had wanted this to be short and sweet, but I ended up writing a novel. My balance issues we more philosophical as many others have pointed out specifics with spell lines and usefulness. <P>This game is meant to be fun and enjoyable. I love my Wizard. He is great and I enjoy interacting with other players. Having you take the time to look into my class has filled me with some hope that maybe a few things might get changed for the better. If not ? I have a decent Warrior and a Cleric I can play. My goal is to have fun, but I would rather play the class that is closer to my heart ? the Wizard. <P>Thank you for your time!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, I have not Solo'd even once, after level 5. I always have at least one other person (My Sig Oth) grouped with me. My perspective comes from a Wizard who ALWAYS groups to some degree. I have no comments on soloing or kiting and how it affects balance.<P>My concern with my Wizard is that I do not do enough damage fast enough in relation to other classes. Right now, I feel like I should have been a Mage, a Rogue, or a Tank. <P>I don't want to be a proc buffer for a tank as some have suggested, I want to cast on MOB's.  If I wanted to be a buffer. I would have been a Shaman.  And I don't want a friggin pet, or another dot in the form of a flying sword.  No dot's, no pets, no buffs, I want direct damage.<P>I want to see one thing from my Wizard, I want the satisfaction of seeing the hp bar of a mob move down faster when I hit that Mob. Up my damage for DD's. Nothing fancy, more damage.<P>One minor change you might make that may help, which isnt really about balance, its about perception, that may help us get groups:<P>Show the group the amount of damage spells do when they hit (as a default "on" setting)<P>I know what damage a melee type does... I can read it. If one has never played a Wizard, they may not respect just how much damage we do, because they don't know (I assert very few people, relative to the whole eq population, know much about classes they haven't played.) <P>One other suggestion, change the aggro/distance from mob relationship so that distance results in even less aggro then it does now, or at least increase the range of my spells. I can cast more times on a mob, more often, if you do this.  <P>My 2 cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some Ideas for Improvements For the Wizard Class<P>Specialization's in general should increase the mana efficienty of spells to a greater degree<P>Channeling a spell that you specialize in should have the cast time decrease to a larger degree, when compared to casting spells you dont specialize in.<P>Gaze line of spells.  This line should be totally re-worked in the followin manner.  The resolution should not change, but the casters view should be at a point a givin distance ahead of where he is standing.  this should last for a fixed duration, or untill cancled or the caster moves, and as the spells go up in level this distance should increase. This whould have the effect that the spells where intended to, that is give the caster a view 'over the horizon' as it were.<P>Wizards only have a quest item from the temple of solsek ro to debuff an opponent, the staff of temperent flux. this could be enhanced to debuff at a increaseing level as the wizards level increases very easily, say  from the initial 6 points fire and ice at level 24 to 24 points at level 60,  and change the magic type to disease instead of magic.  also make it usable from a inventory slot so it can be hot keyed.<P>AOE Rain spells sould be changed to single target spells, that are fixed on the target that they are cast upon, they sould also have there damage increased to reflect that they are single target now.  Basically this changes rain spells into a 3 turn high damage dot spell, but the target get a chance to resist or patially resist each wave of the spell.<P>Column aoe spells are curently the best value for the mana wizards have, the only problem is the mana efficientcy should be increased with spell level and there are no upgraged after level 34.<P>Al'Kabor spiral line, the only current use for this line is chain casting the spell to cause another player to lag out and go link dead, needs major renovation, maybe converting this line to a dot like 3 wave single target line, or changing the whole line over to a column line of spells, thus providing upgrades after level 34, would be an effective use.<P>Point blank aoe spells in general need ther range increased slightly and the whole line of spells need to be adjusted so that they too increase in mana efficientcy with increasing spell level, which they do not at the moment.<P>Fade/shadow step/yonder line need to have a minimun trasport distance added to the random distance you are moved, too may times the spells don't move the caster any distance at all.  Another upgrade would be to eleminate the random direction feature, and transport the caster always in the direction he is facing at the time of the cast, but keep the random distance.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<BR>I actually have to say that you've did a pretty good job on wizards.  I really like our spells, I love what you addded in Kunark but here is some things that you need to take into consideration. <P>1)  Damage over time is just not there for a wizard. This is even more apparent in SoV.  This is part of the reason why wizard can never get in a group.   They just can't deliver damage over a long period of time.  That's is what a wizard is suppose to do.  We don't buff, we don't heal, we don't tank, we don't have pets, we're suppose to do damage.  You have given us great spell IMO to deliver damage but you haven't given us the means to use them.  <P>Solution:  Increase the mana regen on wizards as they increase in levels.  If you let us med faster then you don't need to do anything else.  Are spells are great but we are always waiting to use them. This solution is SIMPLE and it's the single biggest problem with Wizards.  Let us use the goods and make wizards desirable again.<P>2)  Spells:  I think that you guys have did a pretty good job on these.  But there are some things that I would like to see.  <P>   a) Why don't we get a high lvl MR spell like Sunstrike and Ice spear? I just find it strange.<BR>   <BR>   b) Why don't we get a upgrade in the lure series for fire and magic?  Lure of Ice is a great spell but is very limited.<BR>   <BR>   c) Shield of Magi, Manasink, and Atol's fizzle way too much.  Please look into these. <BR>   <BR>   d) O'keil's is a joke and a buff.  Take it out of the game for wizards.   It was a mistake in Beta and doesn't need to be in the game.  It's nothing but a distraction for the class.<BR>   <BR>   e) Rain spell are great damage to mana ratio when they work.  Not going to go into detail on this one because there is a million post already on this topic. But please fix it.<BR>   <BR>   f) WK port is a joke.   Please move it to the other side of the zone.  <BR>   <BR>   g) Concussion:  Great spell and I don't even mind that it's hard to get.   But please let it work like a lure spell.   It gets resisted on every high level mob in the game and I swear it adds taunt. <P>   h) Harvest:  I think you realized that we need to regen mana faster with this spell.   But 300 mana at lvl 60?  Come on that's not even enough to cast a lure.   If you made the simple solution and made wizards med faster.  YOU COULD GET RID OF THIS SPELL. I know I wouldn't complain about getting to mem 8 spells again. <P>   i)  I don't even want to talk about the Al'Kabor line of spells.   Get rid of them, they are all useless in every practical sense.  I tried using them in every way and still haven't found a use. Give me the upgrades in the lure line and get rid of all these spells.<P>   j)  SF evac are you for real and I thought CT was a death trap.  Nothing like evacing from a zone into more danger. <P>   k) Tishan's and Markar's should work anywhere and not just in a Kunark dungeon.   This only helps speed up the travel time of the game. It helps everyone in the game out and makes people happier not having to run so much. <P>IMO you could make the wizard class very balanced by just doing one simple thing.   You don't need to make our spells hit harder, you don't have to give us more buffs, you don't have to give us pets, just simply allow us to med faster.  The solution is simple it's just up to you to fix it.<P>Kriket the Arcane<BR>Lvl 60  E`Marr<BR>Da`kor     <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I  play a 44th wizard on the Tribunal. I must say that i have used Cazic gate since near 20th. I simply had someone help me learn th way there from the courtyard, invis of course. Then wouls  port in and 3out of 5 times I could invis on top of the tower with no aggro, occasionally I would get hit a few times and gate and come back. I died maybe once or twice if gate failed. To be abl to do this wizards have damage absorb sheilds to give a couple extra chances to gate. And if their Dex were high enough then they should be ok. I think Wizards Should be a said the masters of Direct damage. I like to play a wizard for that reason. I can give up having a  pet or group buffs as long as I know I am with out a doubt the highest Damage dealing force to be found. I think we should be able to accopmlish more dam then we do. % or just more damage either way as long as we can do somthing. <BR>As far as the current spells. I tis true the mage and echanter spells come close to our damage, and they take a little more mana and maybe a little longer to cast. Well by around 12 or so a wizard has to learn to pace his casts so that he doesn't die. So we can cast faster but for a large part of the time we have to wait anyway. <BR>I know it is hard to read all the same tuff over and over. I would just like to see wizards truely out damage other casters. I mean I don't want a pet as a wizard but if your pet can deal a lot aof melee dam why do you need to do the same (almost) magical damage. A familiar would have to be only for scouting, seeing purpose onl. We should do enough damage not to need a pet to help. One thing I don't see wizards with is any clairvoyance spells or items. I know new stuff isn't likely but the few things wizards are suppose to be capable of is a least limited clairvoyance, possibly with a smaller effect outdoors as not to impede ranger track. and to a certain degree indoors, also wizards would have a counter spell or deflection but that is pobably to hard to implement. Finally what about wizard lock / unlock. There are locked doors for Rogues to pick why not magic locks for wizards to unlock. An example Phinigel is a wiz his door would be wiz locked requiring a wiz to break the spell. Those last are too new I know but food for thought anyway.<BR>Drozz Zcannonz 44th wizard Phoenix Risen on the Tribunal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brief statement of some concerns about the wizard class.<P>The biggest negative concerns about the wizard class.<P>1) Many wizards do not feel that they are adding much if any value to their groups.<BR>2) Wizards are not ‘pulling there load’ vs. velious uber mobs, 100k+ hit point mobs make the damage a wizard can deal, very mute.<BR>3) A wizard has a very hard time staying in a battle due to very long med times.<BR>4) Due to many of the enhancement in the various melee classes, wizards can no longer keep up with the damage being dealt by some of the melee classes, both in speed and damage.<BR>5) Wizards lose a lot of power due to not having a pet, though giving us one is not a solution many wizards want, or what I am going to ask for. Pet classes at least can offer their pet as a source of value to a group even when they are oom.<BR>6) Downtime due to medding is the single biggest drawback, and a down fall to this class. I can agree to some of this to some degree.<P>I would like to point out some of the positive points of the class. Which I don’t feel any more change is necessary in to obtain or maintain balance. A change in any of these areas I feel would create over powering in one area or another.<P>1) Equally fast Evocation spells to other classes, the 3 second cast of DD spells, and 2 second cast of PB AE spells, is enough to fill the wizards role as masters of quick damage, in any group AE or single pull situations.<BR>2) Spell Damage compared to other classes is slightly higher then most other classes spells or has a lower cast time and mana usage factor, therefore this maintains are title of masters of evocation.<BR>3) AE spell Damage or delay is exceptional nice, so for the extremely rare groups where these spell work we fit nicely.<BR>4) Overall efficiency of the class is good, compared to battles against single mobs with DD spells or multiple mobs with AE spells.<P>What can be done to the wizard class?<P>Make a change to the way Harvest works. Bare with me please this is slightly different then most ideas you have previously read.<P>Cut the mana regained from Harvest in half to 150 maximum, but then also cut the recast time on the spell to 4 ½ minutes. This is not really any different then the spell currently works, however the real change needed is below. <P>Have Harvest take the number of members in the group and multiply it times the amount of mana normally gained if not grouped. So for example, if I normally gain 150 points of mana from Harvest (solo), if I am grouped with 6 other people I would Harvest 900 points of mana.<BR>This is 4 nukes, or 2,652 extra points of Damage every 4 ½ minutes at level 55, which is about the same amount of damage a mage or necro with there pet is going to out damage me by in this time frame. <P>Before I go any farther someone other then me came up with this idea and the good reasons why, but I liked it so much I decided to make sure someone reads this. I edited the whole thing but only slightly, so this may or may not reflect the orginial authors ideas.<P>1) This will help us to keep up with the tanks and pets in damage output.<BR>2) From a role-play sense, we gather mana from are surrounding. So this should be the people and the magical items around us, the best and easiest measurement would be how many people are in are group.<BR>3) Doing so would not allow us to solo something we couldn’t before.<BR>4) Encourage us to find a group.<BR>5) It doesn’t become a PvP issue.<BR>6) Its more fun casting nukes then sitting on are butts doing nothing, holding just enough back for evacs.<BR>7) Would help us stay in the long battles with Velious Uber Mobs, battles lasting up to a hour.<BR>8) Would not be over powering on previous mobs, as I feel a gap is becoming larger, between melee efficency and caster. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, we thank you for this opportunity to voice our concerns. <P>*** Quick Note on Concussion/Brain Bite ***<BR>       (This Relates to BALANCE)<P>I think you misunderstand Concussion. This is a class-defining spell. This spell is so useful as to be considered a fundamental necessity. It allows wizards to do their job. Why should a class-defining spell like this be tied to a quest that nobody under level 45 can think of doing? Wizards are Unbalanced without it. They are (relatively more) balanced with it. Shall we simply ignore the pre-45 wizard, allowing them to be unbalanced?<P>Make no mistake. This spell is not just icing on the cake. On occasion, it affords wizards the opportunity to demonstrate their true specialty--chain nuking. Good stuff. Don't cut off so many wizards from this vital spell.

However I'd like to point out something many have missed regarded our cries for more damage to Scar's Urbur mobs.  I agree that we should have some type of percent of total hp bomb.  However no one has address the agro factor.<P>How are we going to cast a spell, which does a percentage of total hp damage and results in something like 7500 of damage or more and not die a horrible death?<P>One suggestion I have is to take our joke of a pet and make him our personal bodyguard.  By that I mean give him either an insane amount of hp's or make him able to cast some type of concussion spell or memblur so that we are beaten to a pulp.  The pet can do no damage at all.  Only for defensive purposes.  Also if it was buffable we would be able to blast away without fear of being destroyed.<P>As it stands now, such a percentage of damage spell would pop us right to the top of that agro list and nail our coffin.<P>Just a thought..<BR>Poet 60th Circle Wizard of Prexus.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that most problems with wizards fall into two categories; one is play balance, and the second is the "fun factor".  Let's talk about play balance first.<P>I have a 53 necro, a 52 wizard, a 46 cleric, and a 42 warrior, so I have broad play experience.  Wizards are seriously inefficient in two ways, that are making them less effective than they should be.<P>First, wizards are totally dependent on mana for doing damage, and dealing damage is their primary reason for existence.  However, they are by far and away the most inefficient class in the game.  It isn't even close.  Let me give you an example.<P>My necro hunts seafuries in OOT a lot.  With pet, bond of death, lich, and pact, I can kill about 20 seafuries an hour, and stay full mana mostly.  A seafury has 5K hp, so I can do about 100,000 damage an hour, over a long period of time.  And the pet is never resisted, and bond of death is never resisted, so all the mana I spend is well used.  With my wizard, it takes 5 ice comets to put down a seafury, assuming no resists (a big assumption).  It will take me about 30-60 seconds to kill the seafury, depending on how many times I need to root it.  Then I am OOM, and must med for 10 minutes to get back my mana.  So, I can kill 4, or maybe 5 seafuries solo in an hour.  This clearly shows how unequal the classes are.  Now, I don't have a problem with wizards being less efficient than other classes, that is part of the price you pay for SPEED.  But a 400% difference just totally sucks.  I could see a 200% difference being barely acceptable.<P>And yes, necros rock.  But so do mages, with those huge damage shields.  And enchanters get clarity, and they can charm one seafury and make it beat up the other.  All of these tactics are FAR more efficient than wizards.<P>Second example:  the high level druid AE spell does more than twice as much damage to a single target as it costs in mana.  Multiply that by 4 targets, and they are close to 12:1 mana efficient.  I can't think of a single wizard AE spell that does more damage than it costs in mana.  And without a truly effective snare, we can't cast them fast enough to get them off against multiple targets, so they can't be used for kiting the way druids can.  We've all heard the complaints about resists to Atol's, but few people make mention of how easily the spell is broken.  Seems to me it breaks like root, that is, any time you damage the mob it has a chance to break free, which is not true of snare.<P>Of course, shamans get pets, and huge dots, which are far more mana efficient than a wizard's best DD spell.  I have also seen SKs soloing seafuries, using fear, although this is a bit more risky.<P>So, currently, while other group members in a fight can continue doing damage, and are effective over long periods of time, wizards are mostly a one shot deal, and limited both in their effectiveness in groups, and in their levelling ability, since other classes can outdamage them over time.<P>Now, pre-Kunark, wizards were able to at least do damage faster than anyone else in the group, and this did have some usefulness.  If there was a bad pull and no enchanter for crowd control, a wizard could sometimes burn down one or 2 mobs fast, and let the rest of the group handle what was left.  They were also useful in killing casting mobs quickly.  But Kunark and Velious have changed this.  The major new weapons have drastically increased the firepower of melee classes.  This has not decreased the usefulness of enchanters, but all of the other int based classes are suffering in comparison, because we have not seen comparable gains in what we can do, and this is more true of the wizard than any other class.  High level pets have gone up in power, damage shields have gone up, necros are mroe efficient.  Wizards have gained a little bit on our top end damage, but almost nothing on our mana efficiency because the bigger spells cost more to cast, and nothing really on speed either, because the bigger spells are slower casting.  All we really have is a bit more total mana as we gain in levels, and so a bit mroe total damage that we can do before our mana is exhausted and we are rendered comabt ineffective.<P>When you combine the efficiency problems with the huge inrease in hit points on mobs in Velious, wizards are next to useless there.  They aren't even very useful for transportation, because of the poor locations of the wiz ports there.<P>Now, why is the wizard epic item a WEAPON?  What are we going to do, supplement our direct damage with melee?  I suppose it gives us something to do once we are OOM.  Seems to me a spell focus or mana regen item would be better, like a ring.  Where are our rings of power, anyway?<P>To fix this problem, you should do 3 things.<P>One, increase the damage our spells do, by 10% across the board.<BR>Increase the damage of the 51+ nukes, by 10% per spell circle.<BR>Reduce the mana cost by 20% across the board.<BR>Increase wizard mana regen, as we are the only class that is soley dependent on mana.  Our mana regen rate should increase with level.<BR>Expand the draught line of spells.  Add some lower level spells, that cast quickly, but cost less mana and do less damage, to give us more versatility in our choice of nukes.  For example, I'd love to see a level 39 spell that does 250 dam for 125 mana, and casts in 2.0 seconds.  This would not affect the total amount of damage we can do with our mana, nor would it really affect the speed with which we can do that damage.  It would let us get our spells off more easily when we are being hit, or giving us a better shot at cutting down that runner before it gets around the corner and we get that "target out of sight" message.<BR>Add a new line of spells, that cast slower, but are HIGHLY mana efficient.  Basically, we trade speed for efficiency.  This would let us remain effective in a group for a longer period of time, for long fights.  For example, the level 51 draught does around 650 dam for 215 mana, cast in 3.0, about.  The more efficient spell would do 600, cost 50 mana, but take 9 seconds to cast, with a slower spell regen as well.  Wizards are the masters of direct damage, so give us some serious versatility in what we can do.<BR>Get rid of the useless point blank spells, and add more DDs of different types of damage to each spell circle.  We should always have a spell of the proper type within our current spell circle, or at worst the previous spell circle.<P>Second, our transportation is lacking.  The locations of most of the wiz ports are silly.  What is the purpose of putting a wiz port out in the middle of commons, or north karana, or west karana?  Or in any of these places?  As a wizard, if I was researching and creating a spell, I would want to port near somewhere i wanted to go, like a city.  Druids get a great port in steamfont, near akanon.  My nearest port to my home city is 2 zones away.<P>Why is it I can evac to south ro, but I can't gate there or portal there?<P>I think the "evacs" in Kunark are lame.  Who would ever create a spell you can only use in a dungeon?  And only in particular dungeons?  The whole concept is silly.  Verant talks a lot about "game immersion".  Well, silliness like this really disrupts that ole immersive experience.  All it does is breed frustration and anger.  between the downward spiral of our effectiveness in groups, and being next to useless in porting, what is left to us?  Levitate, binds, see invis and invis, ports to hate and fear.<P>Wizards port to places of habitation, or to where there was habitation.<P>Move the west karana port to qeynos hills.<BR>Move the west commons port to Kithicor, outside Rivervale or highpass.<BR>Add a wiz port inside Akanon.<BR>Move the dreadlands port nearer to karnor.<BR>Make the kunark evacs usable from anywhere.<BR>Move the velious ports so people can use them without getting stomped on.<P>Why do the spells in the fade line move you in a random direction?  I think they should move you in the direction you are facing, up to line of sight, or the max distance the spell will take you.  That is the kind of spell a wizard would research and create, one that is useful.  We are supposed to be in part the travelling class.  A spell that will jump you closer to where you want to go is the kind of spell a wizard would create.<P>I agree with something an earlier poster said about feedback.  We see all the melee damage that group members do, why don't they see the damage we do?  It makes no sense.  Provide this information to everyone in range.  This is a big deal towards how a group percieves our activities.  My suspicion is that this info is not shown so that wizards don't see how much damage the other casting classes are doing, so we don't know just how close they are to wizards in comparison.  For example, clerics get a level 44 DD that does 500 damage.  The level 44 wizard nuke does like 625.  Seems to me a wizard should compare much better than that to a cleric.<P>Finally, get rid of silliness.  No wizard wants a pet, not really.  And damage shields are not really our cup of tea either.  Although, if we are going to continue to have damage shields, then as masters of damage, give us GOOD damage shields.<BR>Fix manaskin.  If I am currently targing a low level mob or player, it is making a level check against the target, even though the spell is self only.  I am getting a message that I cannot cast the spell on such a low level target.<P>Make harvest a skill, not a spell.  Increase it's effectiveness with level.<BR>High level casters should gain spell slots.  We are mroe experienced, we should be able to remember more spells.  For instance, add a 9th spell slot at level 29, and a 10th at 49.  I think ALL casting classes would applaud a move like this.  It will not have a major impact on game play, it would just be nice to reduce the amount casters have to keep sitting and switching spells all the time.  This definitely falls under teh topic of "fun".  Tedium is not fun, and the game is overly tedious, in many ways.<P>A final thought:<P>I saw a post under another topic, about doing server wipes, the kind of thing that happens on muds.  Ys, I know, verant is not going to do this, I am not going to suggest it either.  I am going to ask a question:  if Verant ever did do this, how many players would rebuild from scratch, and how many would move on to another game?  Seems to me a lot of people keep playing simply because of the time they have in, and what they have accomplished, and they would not do it over again if they had to start from scratch.  I know that I wouldn't, I'd go try another game instead.  I would like to see Verant change this, to make the game more fun, so I'd continue to play even if something like that happened.  I'd really like the game to be that much fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Looks like many things are being addressed by lots of players so i'll let some of the things that just blow my mind a little about wizards remain unaddressed at any length in my post. First of all i will say i am a lvl 54 wizard, not the highest of levels granted but high enough to understand some issues concerning a class i love.<BR>"Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals."<P>Masters of strongest form of defense??? /boggle. NOT. We are not the masters of damage, with limited mana, low hps, interupts of spells left and right with the slightest shift of wind or movement on our part, and FIZZLES out the yazzoo. bah pfft /rude on fizzles and all that bull crap. Solutions : welp you could start with fixing fizzle rates, fixing interupts, or allowing us to have better buffing to avoid being bashed so dang much so easily. <P>Could not resist shooting EQ guys with own gun and bullet on that one.<P>Now supposedly we are masters of travel as well.....rrrrrmmmm NOT ! with useless ports WK comes to mind, lack of overall number of ports to zones we should be going to more, anywhere else in Kunark would be nice, boggle that one, also further west towards qeynos would be valuable to us as a class transporting peeps around, evacs that are absolutely useless, sigh.<P>Short version of last two paragraphs, I agree TOTALLY with SO many of these posts. HOWEVER, there is one thing i missed seeing addressed at any length.<P>INVIS TO UNDEAD. Why give it and take it away which i KNOW is what is being toyed with in your minds. That is just plain against what you said is the purpose of a wizard. To be the master seekers of knowledge which is the FIRST statement in your own words about wizards. /SIGH ! FINALLY you enable us to gain knowledge about zones, seek out information for our fellow group members, travel about, yet you toy with idea of us not having it. We cant stack it with invis, we are still in danger in most zones from non dead creatures as well as ones that see through it, we have no pets to protect us, our ac is pathetic at best to allow us to take a bruising, our hps are the lowest of the low already, yet we cant even seek knowledge by means of stealth. BAH PFFT. I can hardly believe that we were finally given an aid to travel and now you are toying with the idea of removing it. <P>To all my fellow wizzies... Do you really think any of our words here will be dealt with in a way that will improve the class or will we be right back at the same point we are now when they are done gutting us? I mean really now, be honest. Sure some stuff will be changed but we'll probably be right back at square one... rarely needed or wanted in a group... not able to port to anywhere really useful... still not the masters of dd and travel/seekers of knoweledge. I mean comon... who are we kidding?<P>IN the RARE instance that this post is actually read by anyone at the station, i can say that i have had good service from the gms lately. On two issues that affected me in game they helped me in a just way. I was very pleased... overall i like eq, i enjoy playing, i dont want to quit the game like i know a lot of people talk about or toy with in thought.... i would like to see a game that i love be better... that is the only reason i posted. Im not a disgruntled raving mad player that hates verant.

</FONT><HR>Hi, first time I've given thoughts on my class (Wizard), I've played one since day one till now, I am lvl 60 and have always been among the first to do or kill something.  Well, the lure line of spells were nice, although with my lesser resist rates I find myself using normal spells for the mana ratio, and when lure is absolutely needed, my best Lure of ice (825 dd) which isn't always usable, it micro damage compared to my tank counterparts.  My rogue friend does more damage than that by clicking backstabe =p  Well it's true though, I am a master of fast damage.. usefulness?  Well I had to say fast damage since in a raid almost every damage dealing class does *more* damage than me, even shamans.  <BR> Before I forget, our al'kabor/ AE spells are VERY well proportioned, seriously.  Although I don't agree that our AE spells (ie. pillar of flame) can only hit up to 4 targets, the extra mana thus for the al'kabor line, which are considered PB (point blank) spell line, is very acceptable to hit unlimited targets.  here is an example: in dragon necropolis there are some traps that release swarming beetles upon you in a cluster, the tank pulls it to me and I cast winds of gelid (1260 PB spell), 14 targets hit with 1260, do the math for damage in 1 spell. I am quite pleased, but I will agree that our rain spells should not work how they do, not to repeat what is stated, the targets it hits varies and if there is a pet in the range it counts as a target.  Also rain spells do not seem to extend our lesser resist rates.<BR> Hey wizards, don't argue about the portals *compared* to druids, I'd have to say it's fine, unless you really want to be the main gatewhores.  I like that we have portals in different spots, even the dangerous ones.  But that last topic was matter of opinion.<BR> Now for my main point, I definately would like to see damage increased for my class, even if it is plaved in a SoV only restriction or only works on NPCs over lvl 55,  getting to 60 we are often forced to solo being unwanted in groups (snare helped that a lot, but that wasn't till after I was 60), and now at 60, all I'm needed for are my Lures on named (and PB spells in necropolis, I love that zone).  heh, you're welcome to try my wizard out and see for your self we need a damage upgrade, make us just a little more defining and useful compared to mages, and uber dots from shaman/necros.<BR> 2 last things, I would like to see the skin drop issue addressed here, we have waited long enough.  There are over 20 rogue epics and over a dozen cleric epics on my server and atleast one of everything else, why can't we get our skin, it's all I need to finish and trust me it was hard enough without the no dropping skin with rarities.  Only one in the top of my class with no epic, feels horrible.  And I also saw the sorcerer's robe addressed here too, 29-30 sec cast for a 325 lure or was it 365, I forget, but yeah please reduce this cast time that I could actually use it a few times when tanks yell "don't nuke too early!" or finish something off when I have no small nukes memmed<P>Thank you for concussion, snare, harvest, translocation, ITU, improved invis etc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They already have DD spells that are almost as good as wizards.  Now with their healing abilities improved, wizards are the worst class to play.<P>Give us higher damage dd spells.  We are completly usless in SoV.  Give us a % based DD or Rain spell.  <P>Decrease the harvest time.  <P>Just to let you know, no one really plays a wiz anymore.  Not worth the trouble.  I stopped at 51 with mine and it's just a porting mule now.  <P>Cause in raids, we run out of mana too fast to do any helpful damage, and we can't join groups cause no one wants us.  <P>There is too much that needs to be fixed with wizards and I doubt you will be albe to in the near future.  I pretty much consider them a lost class now.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Read your post and thought about it for a while.  Most of the things there are fine points to bring up.  However, I don't seem to see anyone at Verant defining what a wizard is supposed to be.  I gave a very plausible definition:  magical monk.<P>Wizards are supposed to dish out more damage than any other casting class.  Given a specific target, a monk/cleric should be able to dish out more damage than a warrior/cleric.  The same should be true for wizards.  Given a specific target, a wizard should be able to dish out more damage than a necromancer, or a magician, or a druid.  Period.<P>We don't get (and I don't want) a whole line of "group-enchancing spells".  We need to do efficient damage and we need to do it fast.  That is the balance to the class.<P>Since you don't like the idea of a increasing the mana pool the only option left is to increase the efficiency of the spells.  (Increasing the time to cast the spells should *not* be a viable option.)  I am fine with going out of mana in a big fight and then meditating to help out later.  I am not fine with having another casting class end up dishing out more damage in the end.<P>It would be a mistake for you to point to the "spells vs. spells" damage and say, "hey, you get lures and stuff and can obviously dish out more damage in a big fight".  That is not the whole of it.  I trade doing purely magical damage for not helping the group do a greater amount of damage as a whole.<P>That is what I do not see being addressed.<P><BR>Nitewave Mojomaster<BR>Level 54 Dark Elf Wizard<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wanna add my own spin on this, since I play a wizard primarily (49th level currently).  I'm ripping the Absor quotes from EQ Vault, as I don't have time to go through the 600+ posts on this (Absor, I commend you for having the patience to do so).<P>I admit that the % damage spell idea is interesting. And it does target the problem a lot more specifically.<P>Make it Velious-only too, if you wish, since that's where the problem really is.  Unless you intend on retro-changing old world mobs to break the 32k barrier too, that is.  8000 damage on a full burn is a LOT of damage to an old world mob (25%), but 8000 damage to a Velious dragon tis but a scratch.  Of course, you could always re-instate the 32k limit, and be done with this whole mess  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>+ Al'Kabor line of spells: The consensus is that this spell line is far less useful than the parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells. <P>The only time I ever use ANY AE spell is when I know it's gonna kill every target with one hit.  I, personally, only find them useful for taking out super-greenies for faction reasons (ie - Gravity Fluxing bandit camps in WK).<P>+ Harvest: The feeling is that this spell doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50.<P>At 49, I'm seeing this already.  It's free mana though, so I still use it (and intend on using it for as long as possible).<P>+ Rain Spells: I agree that we should think about taking pets out of the equation. <P>Yes.  Though, I admitted to not using AE spells....<P>- Okiel’s Radiation and the other one: <P>(O'Kiel's Flickering Flame, FYI).  I have experimented with Flame a bit, and found it marginally useful.  I find my mana better used with a solid nuke, as shielding the tanks eats up too much mana.<P>+ Atol's Apectral Shackles: As a level 51 spell, it fizzles too much<P>Not 51 yet, but this concerns me...  Mana is our life.  Without it, a wizard truly is nothing.<P>? Snare/Enstill: It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare… Tell me, would you rather have a group or a single target snare in that spell slot? <P>Personally, a single target would be perfect.  Bonds of Force (BoF) does give wizards an amazing ability to solo though.  Can easily blitz through the 30s and 40s with it, and you don't even need SOW (though it helps).  The AREA part of it has snared me (and killed me) several times though, and I consider it a trade-off for the amount of flexibility it gives me.<P>+ Invisibility to Undead: I, honestly, don't know why wizards have this spell. I want to find out why. <P>I can't believe we don't get this sooner, actually.  Wizards are supposed to be the seekers of knowledge.  Our sight spells give us that (well, they kinda do....).  Invisibility gives us the ability to sneak in and find arcane knowledge.  Invisibility to Undead gives us that same ability, only now we can get past hordes of undead.  I know necros and clerics (especially clerics) are mad that we get this spell.  So I propose to keep it SELF-ONLY.  That way we don't cross over into their territory too much.<P>+ West Karana: Move this portal to the other side of the zone. <P>Please?  Pretty please?  Pretty please with sugar on top?  While you're at it, fix the Qeynos Hills to West Karana zone bug (get zoned bounced if someone is standing there).  Make everyone happy all at once.  I'm sure the argument is that there should be SOME danger in crossing the continent.  WK is not a dangerous zone to most wizards.  Even those of us that are KOS to the guards can cross it all day long without incident.<P>+ Cazil Thule Gate: Mana of you think this is in too dangerous of a location.<P>It is a valid argument really... Most of the other wizard spires are a safe spot.  The only other dangerous one is in NK, and that's only under certain circumstances (trains, KOS to guards, etc.).  Tox, Fay, Ro, Commons, etc. are all perfectly safe.  Kunark evacs however......<P>+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder: These spells have problems going vertically. I'm not sure that this can be fixed, but if it can, it should be. <P>I hope it can be.  This spell can be a life saver.<P>+ Epic Quest: I'll ask them to review the Cazic skin and the whole difficulty of this quest. But keep in mind that I am in favor of these quests being very hard. <P>Then make them all equally hard.  I'm sorry, but I have a problem when a dozen rogues can get the weapon in the first month, and wizards can't even find a certain hiding NPC we need to talk to (talk about a leap of faith).  The Wizard quest isn't a quest at all, IMO.  It's camping a few WEEK long spawns in hopes you win the rare drops instead of all the other wizards.  It truly is ridiculous.<P>+ Concussion spell scroll: This is believed to be too hard to obtain. But, consider that this is a great spell, and having to earn it is a good thing to me. The question is, is it too hard to get. <P>Either A- make the quest easier or B- make it a level 50+ spell.  It's a level 39 spell that requires trips into 3 50+ areas.<P>"BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <P>Now THAT is an interesting idea....  Could be bad too, in theory.  Could just as easily "blink" us into a mess of mobs.  That would keep up the player death quota Verant loves so much  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (I'm kidding.... sort of)<P>Well that was nice and long.  I hope to have helped the cause out somewhat with this.<P>Ebdain Ahriman<BR>49th Nuclear Technician<BR>The Renegades<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Power:  We apply so much power so quickly that the MOB is disoriented for a brief time.  Make every unresisted wizard spell stun the target.  Every one.  It can be a defining characteristic of the class's magic.<P>It helps with the aggro problem.  Others in the group will continue to hit the beast and pass us on the aggro table before the stun wears off.  <P>It makes us more group friendly.  <P>It doesn't overbalance us in solo situations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
