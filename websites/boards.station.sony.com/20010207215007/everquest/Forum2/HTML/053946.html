</FONT><HR>Variant,  you just lost the support of 2 more players after your Senior GM's practices today.  I have played your game since beta, being a ex-cyber cafe owner since 1996, I had the fortune to play often.  My wife started playing in April of 2000 (note this date) and whe loved the game for its artwork and wonderful sounds of the beach.  She was known by many as Managirl Beachbum.  She refused to get help from her much higher level husband, that was just her.  <P>Everyone knew her in Oasis, for she pretty much would never live the place, she called it home.  She did however move to gain more experience, she really did care about EXP though.  She is a busy gal in RL and a few hrs here and there was her time to relax, enjoy the sounds and beach in Oasis, that was teh only reason she played really.  She ventured off to Lake of Ill Omen and made 25 last night, she was very excited.  But all must come to an end I guess in this "world"  that will never seem to be "Ours".  The Senior GM of Drinal (I will not mention his name, but it starts with a "V') come to her as she is in a Group.  Tells my wife "hi, you must change your name"  my wife does not understand, thanks it is a joke.  He tell her it is a Violation of the Naming Policy?  Not being an everyday gamer, she does not understand.  He tells her to "change it now please"  She asks "why, this has been my name for almost a year sir"  He does tell her again "I do not make the rules"  in 3 minutes, my wifes character is Named Matemp", she breaks down in tears.  <P>This was more than a game to my wife, it was her time to relax.  I have seen names in this game that violated sex, religion and race, but Managirl must go.  No warning since she created this second skin in April, all gone in  a 10 minute conversation.<P>I am done everyone, I have such a horrible taste in my mouth seeing my wife cry after a Senior GM using this so called "Naming Policy" to upset my wife so for no reason at all.  I am done with your police tactics in game that make us all, your paying cusmtomers, walk on egg-shells.  I am done.  <P>You expand on this, telling us what we gather, quest and camp for in game "is not ours, but yours"  your "intellectual property".  <P>I owned a cyber-cafe, 4 years Variant.  That is a LOT of gamers I have personal contact with.  They all LOVED my wife and believe me, they will not be happy with your actions.  <P>I bid everyone a good Night.  Play fair in game and in life....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sir I suggest you do as I have done in the past...Take this to customer service via email.  I had a similar thing happen to me many moons ago...be frank to the point as you have been in this posting...when they reply with the first canned response "we are sorry we cannot do anything to help you in this matter" do not be disappointed...at the bottom of it will be the names of their bosses and email addresses...remain professional and keep going till you can't...I had a gm change my name in the past and I'll agree it's your identity in the game and you are known for it.  It is truly sad in a game such as this that is more a 1st person shooter than true role playing game that they seem to cling hopelessly to that rule.  I have seen many many names that violate the naming policy and personally...only the offensive ones should be changed.<P>Unomee Donchoo retired 50th Enchantress<BR>Eyama Bunnystrangler 16th sk<BR>Whillit Everdie 20th Mage<BR>Tawdry Annajones 21st Gnomish Rogue<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Xymarra on this one.<P>You should have warned your wife that this would happen.  There was just NO WAY that name was going to stay forever.  GMs will only bother you if someone in game petitions your name.  And Managirl is just not going ot last long.<P>My son started a Troll Shaman with the name Melikestoeat - then added Dacrunchygnomies as his last name.  I warned him but he decided to go with  the name anyway.  Eventually he got a visit from a GM (who almost busted a gut laughing when he saw this huge Troll and the name he had) responding to a petition concerning the name.  Hey he liked to eat the crunchy Gnomes in game.  Go figure.  But even though the GM thought it was a very good name it got changed because technically it violated the nameing rules and some lame jerk petitioned it!<P>Such is life in Norrath!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There are no regular controls or anything. You can live a year and more with an invalid name.<P>Until you have your first dispute with a jerk about "who owns this camp" or something like that. Then the naming policy becomes a weapon of vengeance.

Actually Managirl Beachbum has a very nice ring to it.

Now, you know what annoys me, when I see some moron running around called "Slimshady"   yeah...  is that a "no-no" in the naming policy, probably not.

I like the concept: a gal surnamed Beachbum who spends most of her time hanging out in Oasis.  But it's a game, nothing to cry over.<P>Oh, to those who say, "why do names like this get changed when "Blowmedoll" or whatnot doesn't?": remember that the vast majority of name changes come from petitions by other players.  The remainder come from a CS type just noticing at random or interacting with your character.<P>And yes, it sucks when someone uses the naming policy against you.

Managirl clearly consists out of two real life words describing her. Remember the first name is supossed to be her given name. If they would allow this name, they must also allow names like "Monsterkiller", "Wyrmmaster" and so on and from there its only a small step to "tHebaDDuDe", "yOuRmoM" and so on.

</FONT><HR>I think the problem with the naming policty is that it doesn't state the INTENT.  Aside from trying to keep people from having offensive names, it is there to TRY and keep the setting of the game together.<P>This is supposed to be another world, in a fantasy setting.  Verant doesn't want people naming characters after real life things, or use their names to be descriptive.  Would you name your child "Twelvevoltman"? (yes that was a name I saw once)  Verant wants the names to stay within this fantasy setting.<P>Now on to the part of this that will get me flamed:  It sounds like your wife has problems...she cried over a NAME...in a GAME?!  She uses this to relax..ok, how does a different name change this?  Tell her to calm down, take a step back, and play the Sims...name her Sims whatever she wants.

</FONT><HR>From the naming policy:<P>Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy). <P>Names that contain sentences, phrases, or more than two words. (Ikillorcs, Ontop, and Petcarbob, Diediedie) Descriptive compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer) <P>In the first rule, while "girl" might not be thought of as a title, it can be based on loose interpretation.  As far as the second rule, Managirl is obviously in violation if you reference the example of "ontop."  By that same rule, Managirl would have been an acceptable surname, but not a first name.<P>As far as the protocol of changing the name:<P>For categories 3-10, the Senior staff member will contact you to initiate a discussion about the name change. When you have chosen a new name and have looted any outstanding corpses, the CS representative will perform your name change. Please be aware that if you do not choose a name within a reasonable amount of time, a new name will be assigned to your character. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to inform the Senior staff member of the existence of any unlooted corpses that you own. After your name is changed, those corpses will not be lootable, and no reimbursements will be given. <P>It sounds as though protocol was followed.  The Senior Guide (whom is not a paid Verant employee, by the way) made contact, asked her to come up with a new name, at which point she argued rather than thinking of a new name, then it was changed a further "three minutes later."  Perhaps she would have been given more time had she said "OK, but let me think of a new one."  Instead, she argued the point.<P>As far as her current name of Matemp, she can get that changed to something else by petitioning and explaining that a Sr. Guide changed her name to that, and she had now thought up a new one.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
