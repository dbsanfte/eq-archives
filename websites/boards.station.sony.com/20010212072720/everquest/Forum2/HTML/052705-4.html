</FONT><HR>Enchanters are considered essential in kunark because that is the MOST EFFICIENT WAY of fighting in many zones there.  The mobs are tough enough and the penalties for failure are high enough that it comes down to that.<P>Power gamers want the MOST EFFICIENT WAY all the time, and casual gamers lose too many weeks (months) of exp if they don't adopt similar tactics.<P>It IS possible to do without (had a friend in OS doing so well that the Enchanter in the group was meleeing with his epic)...  It just takes a really good puller, but a really good enchanter is easier to find because SOME of the good pullers are in Velious, but enchanters have little reason to go there except to trash greens...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I?ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes.

This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman.<P>.....<P>Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn?t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer.&gt;<P>I totally agree with the "I am very much against such homogenization of the classes" statment.  Enchanters are the master of illusions. STOP GIVING OUR ILLUSIONS TO OTHER CLASSES!  don't bother with the semantics "it's not an illusion they change into it"... BS... Chanters have NO illusiojn other than minor illusion, a FIRST LEVE spell, that isn't had by other classes, or can be gained through items.  I think you're lookig at it backwards.  NECRO, DRUIDS and SHAMANS are NOT the masters of illusions.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this will help or not because he already posted his reply and I sincerely doubt that any of these ideas will be used, but I have a few suggestions that sound like they might be agreable to some of the posts that I have read(I know this is long winded).  1)Enchanters could be given/had altered a spell that would be a 50%(not sure about%) chance to hit spell that would lower a percentage of the monsters Magic Resist(or perhaps reduce M.R. based on difference of Int.of the caster and the monster),also doing a remove-agro-on-caster effect.  2)Perhaps a buff that will increase armor class based on the amount of armor class they had prior to the casting of the spell(or something to that effect).  And last but not least, this one is just an idea for ALL CLASSES...when you right click on someone and hold for xseconds, you see a list of all their current bufs in the chat box(sort of like checking what an item does while you are in your inventory).<P><BR>Hope someone likes these though I doubt that they will.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings Absor,<P>I would like to share my impressions and some suggestions to alleviate the pressures and tedium of the high level enchanter game.<P>55+ Enchanting is TEDIOUS.  Raid enchanting is nearly torture.  A good pulling team, can/should take apart any zone in the game.  A poor pulling team will bring the raid to a grisly halt regardless.  Under nominal circumstances, the chanter is reduce to timing the next round of buffs.<P>AREA OF EFFECT BUFFS would eliminate a lot of the tedium.  Rather than the hassle and frustration of finding specific types of characters, simply order the melees to stand on one side, casters on the other and blanket either side with the appropriate buff.<P>GROUP VERSIONS OF POPULAR BUFFS would also eliminate tedium.  Group int/wis and group augmentation are excellent candidates.<P>EXPANDED CHARM ABILITY would increase the viability of "combat" activity for the enchanter.  I think charm is an incredibly powerful tool, but unreliablity and low level cap make it "too risky" to encorporate in most guild activities.  For this I recommend a dictate-like enhancement of the 53rd level charm.  Give it a base 20 second duration and otherwise leave the randomness of the duration intact.  Raise the level cap to 53 or 54.  Most boss-level mobs are arbitrarily assigned 55th or 60th level con ratings, probably because they are round numbers or for resistance ability, so raising the cap to 54 wouldnt allow us to exploit uber mobs, but would give us unparallelled superiority in the field.<P>I sure hope you read this.  I think these ideas would be a really big step to revolutionize both the class and the scope of EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that.<P>Enchanters are not essential.  Enchanters make things easier.  People like to make things easier in the game.  That's why people camp.<P>I was the only enchanter in my old guild and they managed going to the crypt area in Sebilis with a bard, cleric, necro, shaman, and 2 warriors.  It isn't impossible.<P>It is a popular idea that enchanters are essential just because people have come to believe it.  Enchanters make fights easier... people saw that and tried hard to get an enchanter in their group to make fights easier.. other people saw this method and started copying..  now enchanters are 'essential'.<P><BR>Sure enchanters are useful.  We can reduce a fight of five into a fight of one.  We can speed up mana regen and melee fighting.  But people have to realize there are other methods.  No one uses AoE spells when they are one of the best methods of killing pulls of 4 or 5.<P>There is nothing to change unless you can brainwash everyone to have enough confidence to traverse a dungeon without an enchanter.<P>---<P>In addition, if you decide to nerf enchanters so we aren't as useful in groups (yes, this will be a HUGE nerf), give us some skills and spells so we can solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I read somewhere in here that one of the items requested is that illusions stay on when you go link dead.  One of the reasons it does drop is because of the necromancer lich line.  If the illusion would stick, we would be helpless until the server kicks us, continually losing hitpoints while nobody could heal us.  If there was a way to stop the loss of hps but keep the illusion im all for that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Please Read&gt;&gt; I Read most of the posts here and I have one real concern and its the Tash line I have below, I think it will solve most of the ENC problems.<BR>     Tash line spells--the agro on this spell is outrageous, Tash line spells were made to lower MR because enchanter spells are all based with MR and are quite resistant, the agro should be lowered to that of the Dispell line of spells or even lower. After all the purpose of Tash, is to lower its MR so I can cast another spell, such as mez, slow, debuffs ect. currently I would have to wait till its at 70% health to even 40% health before I can cast tash without tanking the mob(uber mob), then it defeats the purpose of getting slow in...for its so low on life anyways, it didnt make as much as an effect as it should of. I can see alot of agro on the mez line of spells, but if we mez it, we have the time to cast memory blurr, where with tash, its pointless to cast mez, tash, then mem blurr, because we need the tash for the mez, not for a possibility to nuke it at the very end of a fight. And if your to argue we can mem blur after tash? heh no, because we got a mob hitting us for 300`s while a whole guild tries to taunt it off, but cant. As well with uber mobs, we cast it around 40% and we still have to hope it doesnt eat us(but it usually does), Also Tash should lower more MR than it currently does, our 44 should lower it to 65 and our 57 tash should be near 80+, for we cast it and like all of our spells are still resisted but slightly less than before. Exspecially for Duels(anyone can get 90mr or so and my spells are like 90% resisted, if they get like 105 or so its over, and yes this is after tash so there mr is like 50 or so..this is so sad)The ENC botb tourney is gonna be first to make a pet or first to kill the other person pet(however rules go) and then enchanter pet should have commands over all other pets..for ours is one of the weakest. At least have a /pet attack so we can send our pets on mobs without having to out taunt the tank(which isnt that hard with our outrageous taunts) and wind up tanking the whole fight(taking away from another class right to tank) and then theres SoV-the anti enchanter expansion. But I beleive doing these changes with Tash will solve the ENC problems and make us uselfull but still not overpowering, for the mobs that cant be mezed no matter what wont be effected.<BR>     Mez line of spells--mez line is pretty good, except for the uber mez glamour of kintaz and rapture bliss. These spells need to have either its mana really reduced, or, have it have twice as much mana and have a duration twice as long.<P>Boon of the Garou--this spell currently cast werewolf form on a party member, but it has 6min duration and a 3 min recast time..this is nuts, ok, keep it at 6 min duration, but let it be instant recast time, so an Enchanter could keep it on 2-3 of his tanks in the group not just one. With 6 min duration the enchanter would still have to keep it memed in a spell slot(assuming keeping it memed was the goal of this spell) or you can make it a group spell like it was originally going to be, but decided to change, and keep the current recast/duration.<P>Illusions--there has been lots of talk on illusions, ENC need a new illusion, something like in the minor illusion series, but with creatures(maybe while in illusion your automatically kos to everyone) or something so we cant cheat through zones. ENC are suppost to be fun type class. Or maybe an illusion we can cast on others, maybe no effect on it but still something for fun, like ogre illusion seeing 40 ogres at a guild raid would be funny heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">just something...also I love the illusion Corpse, make it like the FD spell but while under the illusion the enchanter could not get healed or anything and make it a short duration, sorta like the cleric/paladin divine aura series but an illusion of a corpse..to help keep mobs off of us(after all were not suppost to tank) either this or make are gear ac equal to hybrids(slightly less)...I doubt that will happen but the illusion corpse is a really good idea id like to see...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Boon of the Garou - get rid of the annoyingly short duration and long recast time. Instead, Boon of the Garou should show up as a buff on the enchanter as well as the target, each tick the spell would take one mana point from the enchanter to mantain the Boon. The spell should last until you zone, or until someone clicks to remove the buff. Basically it would allow the enchanter to designate a champion to fight his battles for him. <BR>(kind of like when the Master Control Program shares his power with Sark during the big showdown in Tron) :P<P>Absor said... Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I’ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don’t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all.<P>Fine, get rid of Illusion Wolf and give us Illusion Will-0-Wisp or Illusion Eye of Zomm instead with the effect of SoW, Levitate, and breeze. Since it would not stack with Clarity this spell would be usefull for travelling without improving our ability to kill mobs. Normal SoW would be a much more desirable buff but sometimes I don't feel like standing around shouting for a druid.<P>Anyone have any other suggestions or comments about these spells?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is amazing to me that Absor can read all those posts and not mention MR in his list of comments. It seems pretty clear what the reply is then. Post 50 enchanter's, I don't think Absor gives a crap. We'll get some minor BS changes to "quiet" our grumblings for a while...like illusion gender(ooohhh), illusion face(I'm trembling at the potential utility here!). Expect some random words and false empathy from Verant on our plight. The real issues will become as convoluded and buried as our "defining abilities" have become. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the comments...<P>   Illusions and Link Death: Can we make it so <BR>   that Illusions remain up during a link death    <BR>   (not during zoning, though). <P>Why?  In scanning through (admittedly I didn't thoroughly read every post) I only saw one rationale given by someone else.  They didn't want to gate into another city and be KoS.  I find I have the reverse problem FAR more often.  A scenario:<BR>   Heading toward Grobb, my little gnome looks like a tasty treat so he uses illusion troll to get past the guards.  It would be nice to be able to zone in but I have to stop, cast invis, zone, check that the zone edge inside Grobb is clear of guards, then recast illusion troll.  If, as happens far too frequently of late, at least, there is a guard spawn camping the zone edge then I have to wander about invis just hoping the invis doesn't drop suddenly.  Look for a place with no trolls too close and hope there isn't one on the opposite side of a wall since they can see and attack through walls or, when they don't bother running through the wall, allow you to cast then track you down and kill you even though you are now illusioned to look like one of them.<BR>   I'd MUCH rather have illusions work across zones.  I don't understand how having them work across zones is too powerful?  If its just an issue of players forgetting, well, you can do that anywhere.  I forgot once, and only once, to turn off illusion troll and ran by the oasis gypsies.  They taught me my lesson and I learned from it.<P><BR>Religion--<BR>   I had the benefit of experimenting with an enchanter in beta 4 so when I first made my enchanter to play EQ when it went live I already had some information to workwith.  I knew to make him agnostic and I knew better than to attack orcs in Crushbone if I wanted to easily walk through Neriak.  I chose the race of gnome because they are at least tolerated almost everywhere (except Grobb, Oggok and later Cabilis) without having to slaughter innocents to raise faction.<BR>   This was all done as a valid means of remaining neutral.  While I don't agree with having everyone's religion tattooed on their forhed for all the NPCs to see, it has been used in the game as a consistent mechanic throughout.  I am thoroughly against giving us (enchanters) a means around religion.  It demeans those of us who did go through the effort of being neutral.  I'm positive that if a means around religion was given that Verant wouldn't go back and allow agnostics to rechoose their religion.  Its annoying enough to have religion-based spells popping up for non-clerical types LONG after we were given the choice of what religion we had.  Sure, religion should have some benefits but adding them after the fact is frustrating.  The benefits of religion should be the faction it gets you.<P>Muddletupper</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Bard Lute: We should at least look at this loot. Even if we don’t remove it (it is a very rare item), we should keep it in mind when making new items. It gives a key enchanter ability to another class.<P>Voice Graft: We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters."<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>I don't understand how Lute of the Howler grants us a "key" enchanter ability yet the Guise of the Deceiver, Mask of Obteneration, and Iksar Hide Mask don't.  I didn't realise that illusions were a key enchanter ability since bards and rogues have shared the abiltiy to assume (certain) racial illusions since day 1.  What about necromancers assuming skeleton and spectre form or shamans assuming bear form or druids assuming wolf and tree form?  Tell you what, I'll give up the ability to turn into a werewolf (as a bard) if enchanters give up all clarity spells (bards had mana song first and enchanters were only given it at a later time to make them more viable in groups).<P>Voice Graft is a key necromancer ability.  While it is purely a fun spell and has no purpose, it makes sense for necromancers to have it from a certain roleplay perspective.  Necromancers are raising the dead to do their bidding, infusing their will into the evil creation they have just summoned.  Magicians, druids and shamans are summoning a spirit from another realm to aid them for a time, and such should not be humiliated by having their temporary master usurp their voice (roleplay, mind you).  Enchanters merely enchant weapons to protect them, nothing more.  They cannot even issue commands to their pets, they certainly should not be able to talk through their pet.  It seems extremely odd that you're advocating taking away bards' werewolf illusion (key enchanter ability supposedly) while granting other classes voice graft (as much a key necromancer ability as illusions are to enchanters!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello<BR>I will post my opinions about Alan's summary:<P>---<BR>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to ... &lt;cut&gt;<P>You speak about encounters where a large group of people is supposed to take down a small number, or a single mob - I don't think we have any problems with being left out in these encounters, we see the reasoning there - we don't see the reasoning in being left out of whole zones, like it is the case in Velious.<BR>Enchanters, like stated before, reduce the downtime of a group, that is why we are wanted - we do it with buffs, and with crowd controll - groups want us for both of these, they would take us for either, but we play Enchanters for the Crowd Controll aspect (and for the fun part sometimes), since that is what brings fun and excitement, without it we feel useless, bored.<BR>I usualy only go to raids or zones where buffing is my only job because a very very good friend asks me to do so - but else I am always in Kunark - Sebilis, Charasis, Chardok, places where I can have fun.<P>---<BR>The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. <P>They are considered 'essential' because it's the way of the least resistance, if you pick a good enchanter - you can also pick a bard, they do not bad in the jobs we Enchanters do, but not as well.<BR>Also many find them quite a pain to play, twisting songs and such, so there aren't too many around (at least on the server I play on).<BR>But still, they are an good option to Enchanter - just not seen often - Especialy if you can have both, Bard and Enchanter, they reduce the so much unwanted downtime even more if together - assist each other in the crowd controll part only rarely though, because their spells/songs do not stack.<P>I play a warrior besides my enchanter (At least I can have fun in Velious that way) and I've been in alot of groups with a bard and without enchanter - we were doing realy well, not much we couldn't do, but what was doable with enchanter, you just need to learn how to do it, and it often takes more time and work - there we see it again, people don't want to spend more time on something than they have to, they want to take the way of least resistance, quite understandable.<BR>---<P>Could write more, but need to sleep now, mayhaps more later today (even though  I know my writing skills aren't good)<P>Thintalle<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why not make lull spells like mez?  And this of course would include but not be limited to druid lulls for animals.  Hear me out.<BR>Please keep in mind, for the purposes of being able to deliver the example most successfully, i will use a druid as the character here, but I am keeping in mind all classes with lull spells.<P>With druids in particular you get harmony.  Sure, not quite as nice as mez, but still, not so bad.  Then you spend your money on lull spells, hoping that one day they will get the attention they deserve.  What lull _should_ do is act as a mez to a particular mob_type.  i.e. lull animal?  wouldn't be a singular version of harmony vs an animal. (why waste the money and mana when you can keep harmony mem'd).  instead, you could actually mez an animal with lull spells and of course the effectiveness of said lull (mez) spell would increase as the level of the actual spell increased.  That also said, invisibility vs one mob_type, beit animals, undead, whatever, (since it doesn't stack with other invis's) should remain on the character as a buff until the duration of the spell is gone.  In other words, let's say you have invis vs undead on and you want to go through kurns a bit, but not have every skeleton in the zone getting jiggy with you.  You would cast invis vs undead and now, even though you are fighting, you are still invis vs the undead.  And if it's not too difficult to code, (thinking balance here) you could automatically strip the flag if you attacked an undead.  <P>I know I'm getting off topic here a tad, but please bear with me for just a few more words.  Climb/Recover skill for melee classes.<P>Climb, of course would allow you to actually....well...climb out of pits and things that normally you couldn't get out of, and every tick or so would roll to see if you fell.  If you did fall, it could do a roll to see if you recovered and only took partial damage. (not wanting to totally make safe falling worthless).  <P>I have stated this before, but I think now that things are being balanced out and rethought, perhaps this is as good a place as any to address this particular issue: KoS.<P>Iksar.  I don't play one anymore, but honestly, in my opinion, they don't need to be KoS to evil races.  Sure, when they first hit EQ they were incredibly nice.  But aside from a monk, I can't think of one of the iksar classes I'd play over another race.  Sure, warriors get the nice regen.  Big deal.  They can't wear a fraction of the things the bigger evils can wear, but regen and swimming hardly offset that.  I'd choose ogre or troll any day of the year over iksar simply for the fact that I'm not KoS to _everyone_.  So the evil races will have access to twice as many banks in kunark.  big deal.  iksar atm has access to how many?  Nod.  gg.<BR>Also bear in mind that dwarves, wood elves, and high elves are all in very close proximity with one another, so banking can't possibly be the one thing to sway this in the negative.  <BR>Oh, and sure, things could go on the way they are now.  Faction is obtainable.  But this is the time for the betterment of the game, not the continuance of things that just don't make a whole lot of sense.<P><BR>btw, I'm sure this goes a bit against the "grand storyline" that is in the book for the expansion set to Kunark, but honestly, there is a point in the story where the book stops and we the players become the authors.<P><BR>Thanks for your time on this matter,<P>Visidru<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One good thing upon returning back to EQ is that Enchanters now have Breeze at lvl 16. This was a very nice and great addition that I appreciate...I also like that you changed harm touch for SKs...<P>I'm not as high level as some of those who have posted here. However, I do agree with most of the concerns. I enjoy playing an enchanter, but now I am playing a necro more. He can do everything my enchanter can and more it seems. It's not my purpose to discuss why necros are better than enchanters--but I do know I die a lot less being a necro than an enchanter. Necros have several spells that they can do when the battle is going badly. Shadowstep, life taps, feign death, harmshield...but my enchanter often presses "loc" so he can find his corpse again! Yeah, sure *if* I had color flux memorized and memory blur memorized, I'd stand a chance. But enchanters have such a wide range of spells (buffs, debuffs, DOTs, etc.) that the limited number of spells being able to memorize really hurts enchanters. It would be wonderful if we could memorize more than 8 spells! Also, a spell that we can use to get out of trouble. I'd *love* a spell that gives us increased movement rate (like illusion wolf with SOW)--but I understand this may be off the table. So let's be creative. What about a quick casting phase spell that phases the enchanter in and out? During the phase in phase, the enchanter is able to be hit cast spells, etc. -- phase out he is out of action and invisible. This would be a cool spell!! <P>Not every enchanter has a mentor. A friend of mine has a level 20 Plus enchanter. She did not pick out agnostic as a religion. So should she restart? As an enchanter myself, I don't have a higher level enchanter to mentor me either. A spell changing religion is needed. <P>I understand that mobs were made magic resistant in Velious and immune to enchanters. Fine. Why not make some MOBs immune to weapons, magical or otherwise?? :-p  Would you be prepared to listen to the tank types howl then? <P>I too am annoyed by my pet getting into my line of sight (sigh). But I'm especially annoyed that in a group...I do not soothe, because it will often be resisted and lead to my death. Masters of traffic control indeed. I'm not twinked, and one time mez'ing several mobs, I only achieved 50% success with blue mobs. I've given up soothe and mez for the most part. It would be very nice to have these spells upgraded. I've played a druid and it seems their spell harmony works a *lot* better than ours. Since druids are supposed to be "jack of all trades" it doesn't seem fair to make them better than the supposed master of traffic control... It's gotten where a successful monster mez'ed and not being hit by my party prematurely is an intense source of pride to my enchanter. It happens rarely. When it does, I feel I can finally point to something obvious combat-wise useful I'm doing...Ya know, it would be *nice* to have a sister spell to mez...perhaps not as long lasting that the MOB is mez'ed but is also immune to attacks. This would be greatly appreciated by enchanters who play in pick-up groups and are frustrated because mez'ed monsters do not stay mez'ed because someone whacks them. This would be a step in educating the other players to not do this, because when they whack a "frozen" mob--this mob has been frozen and is IMMUNE to your attack! --message could be shown on their screen. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>CountBrass - problem with charm on unmezables is they're also unstunnable. Even with the fast-casting boltran's agacerie, it can be next to impossible to recharm a non-caster - dungeons don't often afford you the oportunity to kite them. Charming clerics can be dangerous because of them breaking charm and beginning to cast complete heal - which can't be interrupted when they're totally unstunnable. In addition, the level cap on boltran's is pretty low (53) and dictate has too many drawbacks to make it practical in many sitatuions.<P>ABSOR - <BR>The argument that enchanters being able to effect things with spells trivializing an encounter doesn't generally hold water. In many of these encounters, there are less efficient but still very strong methods of controlling these npcs - none of which an enchanter does very well. The simplest is just having a warrior break off and tank one down while being healed. With a good number of clerics, this is rarely a problem at all - on some high resist npcs, my guild agreed it was much more efficient to do this than to have the npc beat the tar out of an enchanter trying to mesmerize it. Keeping the enchanter alive as he tried to put under a high resist mob was far more expensive to clerics than keeping a warrior healed for the entire duration of him tanking it. Root parking on non-magic-immune npcs is often more efficient than glamour of kintaz or rapture. You'll hear of many high level enchanters who confess that their favored manner of crowd control on sebilite juggernauts is just that. Despite us being able to mez them, it's not efficient to do so. The problem here is that you can name a large number of classes better at root parking than enchanters due to higher ac/more hps. Bard/necro spells not having the same checks for unmezzables just seems to be an oversight, not really intentional - but it's worth pointing out that these abilities have been in play for a long time without "overpowering" them. When was the last time you heard someone say, "Gosh, good thing we had 5 necros for crowd control - those were a breeze!"? I know I never have. There's other tactics, like kiting the npcs around, that are specific to certain areas - but again, enchanters aren't very good at this.<P>Make Glamour of Kintaz(level 54) effect giants/other unmezzables. I can't think of a single raid-style encounter this would trivialize, as all npcs you need raids for are higher than GoK's level cap. It may actually make xping in places like Kael or Skyshrine worthwhile as an enchanter.<P>Give Rapture(level 59) a chance to land on magic-immune npcs, as well as giants/other unmezzables. All bosses in Kunark and Velious are too high level to be effected by this spell. Even in the old world pre-Kunark, I can't see how this would overbalance encounters - Vox and Nagafen would boot characters out of the zone, and Deathtouches from Innoruuk and Cazic make things slightly problematic to 'hold' them. I guess it would make Kedge and Hate easier - but any level 59 enchanter in those places is essentially bottom-feeding. Alternately, just make it not work in the old world. You may not realize it, but our spells function much differently in Kunark, Velious, and Plane of Sky - things in the old world over level 52 are unmezable -and- uncharmable, as they're all considered to be bosses. Lots of fun with rock golems in the Hole that can be up to level 53. Whoops.<P>Give Dictate(level 60) an instant recast, or a cast time equal to its duration, much like how rapture works. Dictate sounds really strong until you consider that in most cases where it's used, the enchanter is turned into paste about 50 seconds after it is cast. On level 53 or below npcs, we always just use boltrans - enchanters can keep a level 53 npc charmed for hours in the right situations. On higher level npcs, dictate with an instant recast would still be too expensive to keep going indefinitely, but it would be a more viable form of crowd control in raid situations. If it makes you feel better about it, raise its mana cost.<P>I know it sounds like we're asking for a lot. But really, we just want to be able to play too in Velious. You guys did such a great job balancing how the classes worked in Kunark (well, for the most part - I know some necros who would kill me for saying that)... it's a shame to see you eliminating the roles of classes now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan -<P>Please do not overlook the effect of your desired changes (such as to illusions like wolf and undead form) to the enchanter's pvp reportoire.  Many are the times that these illusions have saved my life when engaged in pvp combat.  The wolf form spells allow me to blend into the scenery in woodland settings and escape persuit.  The undead line does the same (not to mention both spells have significant saving throw bonuses to cold and fire respectively).  <P>The rest of the suggestions for illusions (such as sex, religion, armor, etc.) have no real impact on the game from the comments made and would be little more than eye candy.  I hope that you do not intend to provide these as compensatory to nerfs that effect real illusions that have been in game since day one.<P>It is dissapointing that the high level enchanter does no more than buff the group and use root as crowd control in high level velious or deep kunark dungeons.  I urge you to reconsider statements regarding the enchanter's ability to control multiple non-mezzable, non-charmable creatures.  At the very least do not make it worse than it exists by allowing more than one or two of these creature types per encounter.  <P>The high taunt of a mez typically results in an enchanter's death in any high level multiple creature situation, could it not taunt if resisted or if the creature is immune?  I agree with Tashania being high taunt and have learned to use memory flux to occasionally save my life, but it is expensive and unreliable.<P>The comments regarding stacking of group clarity over clarity, area mez over mez, rampage with strength, enchanter clarity with bard mana song, etc. are valid and I ask that this be done on a level basis. <P>Lastly, statements are often made that the classes are balanced.  This is not exactly true in pvp.  If any high level enchanter encounters a pvp rogue or warrior with a decent (130 or higher) MR (coincidentally the easiest to raise) then all they can do is run.  The melee can use any number of weapon procs or clickable items to render a pet useless and proceed to punish the enchanter for choosing a class that is entirely MR based in damage.  Tashania means nothing when the target still have a 100+ MR after you hit them with it.  The suggestion regarding damage output for the enchanter could manifest in some form of damage spell that is not MR based. <P>Please heed my input as my in game time is over 100 days starting with Beta where over 80 days were on Tallon Zek.<P>Leucretia Glimmermere<BR>Alliance of the Light<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>With respect to pvp, class balance and stealing of a class specific power... The egg shell pumice was nerfed, but I believe that it should be removed entirely as it further invalidates the enchanter's abilities in pvp.  There is a rod that is an NPC drop that is harder to get and I have no objection to this remaining.  However, just buying cancel magic at will seems far too easy.  I cannot just purchase cure poison, cure disease potions at will.  <P>Illustrations:  Should an enchanter get a debuff to stick on a player (or a stack of them) then for 2 plat per pumice charge they can click them away.  Should the enchanter be foolhearty enough to use charm in pvp then a pumice quickly proves their mistake in this situation as well.<P>Thanks for reading my posts.<P>Leucretia Glimmermere<BR>Alliance of the Light<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Leucretia in the above post is totally right.<BR>Maybe this is for another topic but u really shouldn't forget PvP issues in this one.<BR>One solution to the enchanter DD gettin' gettin' resisted MOST of the time in PvP could be to make the DD's save like the mez line of spells. At least then we have a chance that some might even stick, against players with high MR (which is way to easy to raise from a PvP point of view). Many of the MR raising item are worthless on blue servers which make most of them fairly common and easy to get. On PvP servers they are invaluable.

How many classes are getting illusions?<P>Second the whole religion thing is great!  It keeps things interesting, and if it's a problem that all Enchanters are starting Agnostic, force them to do otherwise.  Make more items in the game that require you to have a certain religion.  Imbue Fire Opal, though not a spell I'm going to miss is a great example.

</FONT><HR>Reveries of a Sixtith Enchanter.<P>I remember well the epic battles with scores of monsters hell bent on killing our raid in hate, fear and sky.  Beasts that were our same level or higher and lots of them to boot.  Massive<BR>scrambles praying for no resists people dying left and right and then pulling out victory from confusion.<P>All of that ended with Kunark.  Ended when crowd controlling was nuked into oblivion in high level encounters.  Any time lv 58+ mobs are pulled with the new system, kunark and velious, they better be single pulls or more then likly it's CR time.  The game has focused entirely on dragons giants etc numerous players vs one mob instead of numerous players vs numerous mobs.  All because crowd control doesnt function.<P>Face it.  Spiroc Island is a lot more fun to own then Djorn or the Overseer of Air.  Not just for enchanters.  Massive chaotic grand melee battles are what gets everyone's heart really thumping not 'buff in safe spot charge one mob beat on one mob till it dies or you die'.<P>Ok enuff with that here is a bug that pretty much sucked untill epic weapons.<P>If you cast Dazzle (49 mez) on a lv 56 mob (49 mez will not work on lv 56+ mobs) and it is not resisted you get the mesage this mob cannot be mesmerized with this spell.  Ok up to this point it is fine but then when you cast Glamour of Kintaz (lv 54 mez that works on mobs lv 56-57?58?) your spell will not take hold.  This is because kintaz will not overwrite the Dazzle that is still in effect on the lv 56 mob.  You must either dispell the mob hit the mob or wait for the dazzle spell to wear off before you can cast Kintaz on it.  Now that I have a weapon equiped it usually isnt a problem except for times that I can't seem to land a hit.<P>Just seems funny to me that verant is always encouraging us to leave single spawns in outdoor areas and go into dungeons... but the new uber mobs are mobs you must pull solo because crowd control is no longer viable since no spell now will work on any mob that doesn't con blue.  Not from resists but because of the new spell limitations.  Seems fighting single spawns in outdoor zones is the best practice anyone can have for doing a lot of the new uber mobs.<P>Yenom<BR>Storm's Fury<BR>Erollisi Marr (The Server of Love!) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This roles change essentially makes casters less good at what they do.  Warriors are a perfect example of what post 50 should be.  New abilites that no-one lower lvl has which introduce stratagies that lower levels only dream about!  Thats is what lvl 50 + should be( in my paying customer "vision") Not I can mez14 for one fourth the durration of my mez13, I can charm16 which is just as unreliable as charm2, I can buff24! Its a joke up until the low 50s our relative power increases with lvl but after that we a netting a loss in relative power vs mobs.  Lvl 40 enchanters are more powerful against lvl 40 mobs tham lvl 57 enchanters vs lvl 54s not terrible in verants vision except that its just no fun to play for so long and be reduced to a buff boy with feeble mez/charm skills hoping to get UBER loot that really doesnt do much to improve our charming mezzing loss.<P>My fix--Delevel! -now Im powerful again!!<P>My solution </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I just don't have the time or energy to start a level 1 Necro, Warrior, or Cleric...<P>Blast me if you like, We have all tried to offer constructive suggestions, but it seems as though you are ignoring the ones that matter most and only half-heartedly putting the others on the list. <P>You say you haven't done any research on Enchanters, yet you apparently believe we are overpowered. I would respectfully submit that the next time you do one of these that you actually do some research, rather than come into it clueless, but with a pre-concieved notion that we are simply overpowered.<P>Truly depressed..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
