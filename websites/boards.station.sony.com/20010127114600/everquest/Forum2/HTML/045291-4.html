</FONT><HR>Possible fix for necro on raids.  1.  Necro or caster discipline allowing for fear resistance, or increased fear resistance for 60 seconds, with a strength, or ac penalty to the pet for that 60 seconds (or whatever penalty is appropriate for balanced pvp).  It could have a reuse time of 72 minutes or as appropriate.  2.  A magic resist buff spell to be cast on the pet by other classes only so that it will be useful in groups only.  3.  (And probably the strangest idea) an effect spell cast on the pet--we'll call it Fear Death--while this is cast on the pet, if the pet is subsequently feared, he will die immediately.  It could even be accompanied by a very cool "Kobantik has been scared to death"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Masthis,<P>I liked your earlier post. Your right you start the game by selecting your race, your sex, your stats, and your class.<P>Then you start the game. You are given two spells <BR>some food a club and a book.<P>You scribe those two spells they give you the first idea what the class is all about. Thats the focus of your class the very essence of what you are.<P>Now im pretty shure that when you finally managed to get to the lvl where the conversation were having is about you will still be able to use those spells or the same line of spells in what you do.<BR>Thats currenty the problem, necros cannot. Thats why were talking about ways to make it where we can use those spells again or have some thing else to do thats "useful" in a raid type situation.<P>You stated earlier its about class envy. no its not. if it was about class envy we would be demanding the ability to melee with the troll and oger warriors out there, or Complete heal our pets, or cast regeneration spells on our selves, or a dozen other CLASS SPECIFIC things. but were not. were looking to do something we could do at lvl 1 at lvl 60. im shure if your cleric reached lvl 60 and said opps sorry its a dragon i cant heal now you would be pretty upset. or mabey your monk said hey.. im lvl 60 i can help out and dmg all the low lvl mobs and help groups out great but.. this is an epic mob i cant hit it you would be upset.<P>This isnt a class envy issue. and except for a few posts this has so far been a pretty mature DISSCUSSION on what can be done. so plz if you dont have anything constructive to add to the discussion plz stay off your wasting our time and absor's with your posts<P>Vapors d'DeathWind<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I couldn't think of anything better, however some of them might be worth noting.<P>In addition to the many automatic skills and abilities that characters will receive past 50th level, we've added player-controlled intellectual "disciplines" to the repertoires of the pure casters (NEC ENC MAG WIZ) and priest (CLR DRU SHM) classes. These disciplines are activated using the /discipline command on the command line, and have a duration and base reuse time associated with them. You cannot use any other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used discipline has expired. You can type /discipline on the command line to view the disciplines available to you, as well as the amount of time before you can use another one.<P>Necromancer Disciplines<P>RESISTANT (Level 30): +3 to all resistances increasing to +10 at 50th level. This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<P>FEARLESS (Level 40): Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". This includes your summoned pet. This discipline lasts for 30 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<P>UNHOLYAURA (Level 45): For the duration of the discipline drain type spells are unresistable. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes. This discipline has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>HERETIC (Level 51): The necromancer will not believe any promises or enhancements made by the tuning team. He is a heretic after all. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>SPECIALIZATION (Level 52): The necromancer will cast all spells as if they were all under his primary specialization skill. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>RESEARCH MASTERY (Level 53): The necromancer will be able to research spells as if he had a skill of 255. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>CONCENTRATION (Level 54): The necromancer will be able to cast spells without requiring the spell component(s). This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 45 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>DEFILER (Level 55): The necromancer is defiled. He immediately suffers the effects of being ressurected. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<P>HOPELESSLY FURIOUS (Level 56): When using this discipline, the necromancer will automatically have every attack landed on him by the opponent he or his pet is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>DUCK QUACK (Level 57): The necromancer will have the added benefits or statistics of wielding his epic weapon without actually wielding it. The necromancer will be Tormented by Shadows. There will be a broadcast announcement zonewide that the necromancer begins to quack. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>KILLED ON SIGHT (Level 58): When using this discipline, all hits landed on the necromancer will be for at least four times the base weapons damage. This discipline lasts for 12 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>NECROPOTENCE (Level 59): When using this discipline, the necromancer cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the necromancer gains additional levels.<P>WARLOCK (Level 60): The necromancer will look like a spectre, and he cannot be inspected.  This discipline lasts until he zones.<P><BR>Dadok (Rodcet Nife)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor.  I play a 56th Necro and I agree, the only change we need is concerning our usefulness in epic encounters.  I've seen some nice ideas here, but I've also seen alot of really off the wall or majorly unbalancing requests.  For the sake of all necromancers, let's be reasonable with our replies on this thread and make some real progress.<P>1.  GROUP DMF--people simply love the spell, it has usefulness, just let us use it as a group buff and most of us will be happy.  that impacts our role for major encounters to a very small degree, yet it is something that will get alot of cheers from the necro community for the minor impact made<P>2.  IGNITE/CHILL BONES--not sure on the coding on this one and whether or not it would be easily implemented.  Have the spell use a 72 second recast time and have the spell produce a sort of "land mine" with the decay time of any object dropped to the floor.  The mob when passing over this will "feel his bones ignite" and take the obligatory 500 damage<P>3.  GROUP FEIGN DEATH--it could be fun, it could be moderately useful, it's certainly not anything that would be overpowering.  i think Verant's concern is that with the implementation of this spell, they'll open up Pandora's Box for some sort of exploit down the road.  Let's give it a try, if it's not to your liking, nerf it out of the game<P>4.  PANDEMONIUM--AE player based, small radius.  Mana cost of around 380ish, must be a low casting time, no more than 3.0.  Removes AE Fear type spells from players.  This would make the necro sit there and med and then try to position himself near as many players as he can for when the Fear is triggered.  I see this type of spell to not be too powerful, heck....if you implement this Verant, you have my blessings to make epic encounter mobs AE fear MORE to make up for it.  This is the best idea I've seen on this thread thus far and I really doubt it's that hard to implement for you guys.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had another wonderful first time EPIC encounter.<BR>Myself and another Necro(59) went to help a friend with her Epic Mob in Lava Storm. THis mob's Loc is in Lava pool near SolB entrance. Our total contribution to this raid was cssting DMF on the people that didn't have a Fishbone earing. Had somebody had some fish scales on them they could have gotten by without that.<P>We didn't land one spell, was no need for mana pumping as cleric had plenty to heal group. Was no need to run Lich for extra mana. Necro make a Mental note the Epic Mob in LS just carry a few fish scales to pass out. <P>This Mob is level 55 Level 60 & 59 Necro cant touch him with any spells..I dont think there is a npc level 30 or higher that i could just stand there and be 100% resistant to damage.<P>The Guild i'm a memeber of has 5 Necros 3/60's 2/59's three of the Players don't play but very rarely. For this Necro the same will happen after I do my part to assist the 10-15 final members obtain level 60. <P>Norrath will continue fine without a few high level necros, you only really need level 39 Necro to summon corpse and they will be around cause they are still having fun . <P>I think there have been some real good and thougt out suggestions which you just basically say will never happen.... May I suggest what they do in school ... <P>Alan think outside of the BOX!!<P>My last comment and suggestion will be:<P>Change the resist on the Bond series spells does not add any power we dont have in regular play.<BR>Adds a total of 800-1000 damge per mob from necros<BR>and gives us the option to perform our new Uber/epic Roll.<P>Thx Alan <P>60 Warlock (almost Retired)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Might I suggest that necros just accept that they cannot do raids very well?  Clerics and melee chars can't solo very well, and necros can.  Why should necros expect to be useful in both solo and raid mode?  If necros expect to be useful on raids, then I think clerics and melees have every right to expect to be effective as soloers.  Just accept that you have trade offs for every class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This may have been said in this thread already, but I'm not going to read through 166 posts to check.  I know for a fact it's been mentioned in another thread. <P>For our support role to work in the uber encounters, since all we're really able to do is weak heal and dump mana to other casters, our taps need to work so we can do this.  We transfer our hp's to mana, plus our hp's to another.  Both of these cause us to loose hp's that we can't get back without being able to tap.  So without our taps or DoT taps being usable, we can only heal 2 maybe 3 times (not to full mind you) and transfer 1 and 1/3 bubs of mana.  That's sad.  Very sad.  Please give us back our taps and a lot of complaints would end.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor,<P>IMO as a necro who's been on many a high level raid (and boss mob raids IS *THE* MAJOR PART of post-50th lvl life), I'd say the only thing that actually needs to be changed is ignite bones and chill bones effect on those boss mobs.  That's the only thing that has a chance of landing on mobs like Trakanon, etc. <P>Would it be possible to have the effect be not active *ONLY* on boss mobs?  <P>Everywhere else isn't a problem, and as you said, the discussion is about what necros do during the actual fight.  Well, we send in pets and then sit there.  Sometimes we'll cast resisted spells, other times we just go afk and use the can or something.  It'd be nice to nuke on it instead of just waiting for it to die.<P>Besides, 100 ft long dragons turning into human skeletons isn't very roleplayish. =)<P>Oh, and pets are rarely a problem on raids if you keep em on a short leash and pay attention to what's going on.<P>Nodda Duma<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Cats In Hats<BR>Drinal<P>p.s. yeah the sig says SK...the necro's my other char.

</FONT><HR>I have said this 100 times and I will post it here again. I play a 56 necromancer and I love playing the class. I dont like the fact that we got screwed for solo hunting areas post 55 but that isnt the issue here.<P>My suggestions for an upgrade against Uber-Mob encounters.<P>1. Remove the Illusion off Ignite Bones. If you are going to remove the illusion the effects should stay in place ie the debuff and it interupting casters.<P>2. Lifetaps not landing is the dumbest thing I have seen yet. Why shouldnt they? Maybe on Uber-Mobs they land less often but how is 330hp of damage that transfers to the necro going to make the raid unbalanced? Lets see, Woushi hit me for about 500 the other day with dual attacks, yeah I can see myself out tapping any damage he can do to me.<P>3. Group Feign Death. This wouldnt do anything for the class at all IMO.<P>4. I dont need to see more DOT stacking, they are working as intended.<P>5. What we need is a line or 2 of DEBUFFS. They dont cause damage but they need to be unique to the class and better than any other class can offer. We do not want to take Turgurs from shaman but something that makes a difference in the encounter like that.<P>6. A DD spell that causes some decent damage with low resist. Not 1000hp in damge, thats a wizards job but 600-750 would be nice. Why would we need this to go along with the DeBuff line? With the DeBuff line that would require one necro and only one necro on the raid.<P>7. Maybe a group buff (other than group DMF which we should already have). Something undeadly. Maybe a DS that is a small lifetap, very small but will help keep the aggro on the warrior? Maybe a buff to increase attack?<P>8. Essence Emeralds....I dont have a problem with our Convergence spell requiring one of these. But the other spells are useless because they require them. Change the regent to a gem that cost 50-100pp and put a recast time on Infusion.<P>Also, quit trying to pacify necros with just eye-candy. Thats what the Spectre pet, Arch lich, illusion on Ignite and Chill Bones and so on. Give us something useful. Speaking of Chill Bones, why is this POS spell so rare?<P>Lastly, for people, especially the morons who dont play a necro and have pet envoy, to say the necros are overpowered take a look at all the post 55 necro that quit the game or retired their characters. Prexus, a server that is overcrowded with 46+ level characters has 2 level 60 necro and they dont play anymore compared to about 15 level 60 clerics and 10 Enchanters and several warriors. Just 2. We have 10 level 55-57 necros that I know have retired their characters because there is no where to solo (which is what Verant says we sacrifice our group savy for) amd there is a problem with our ability to find groups where decent loot is dropped. The Risk/Reward for Skyfire is completely out of line especially for below average exp you get for hunting in that zone. Do a /who all 55 60 necro on peak time and it is in single digits, obviously there is an issue with the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's a suggestion:<P>Level 53 Lure of Poison - Lure type poison dot that does like 2300 points of poison damage over 90 seconds for 900 mana.<P>Level 57 Lure of Decay - Lure type disease dot that does 3000 damage over 2 minutes for 1150 mana.<P>My reasoning is this, the lure line was added to give wizards something to do on big raids on resistant mobs. Lures were balanced by being so mana innefficient that they are pretty much for raid level encounters. Necros are to dots what wizards are to DD, I.E. that is their forte. <P>Note, these dots would not stack and in the big scheme of things those damage numbers are not that significant as to overpower one person especially given the mana cost. But, they would give some raid usage to 2 extra necros per raid.<P>You might be thinking, "Well, wizard lures actually do less damage than their DD's, why do these proposed dots do more?" Well, the reason for that is that they are not stackable, lures are. You can have 15 wizards luring the crap out of something, you could at most have 2 necros per raid using these spells.<P>Finally, as per the requirement from Alan, the ideas should not over power necros in the single group or solo arena. I think its pretty clear from the extreme mana cost on these dots that they would not overpower the necro solo. At the level each is attained there are MUCH more efficient dots available to the necro that would stick on normal solo or single group mobs. Much like the wizard lure line isn't very efficient in every day combat.<P>Anyway, I'm not a necro (I play a paladin after having a wizard for my first character) so I just tried to objectively think of something that could be helpful without being overpowering.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Does that mean I wasted 50 levels believing my playstyle was suited with the necro only to find that it wasn't 50-60?<P>If someone wanted you to waste 100+ days of play time by starting a new character because they changed the playstyle best suited to him, don't you think you'd be pissed? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Touch of night could be revamped (slower cast, needing a recast, less damage etc) to be done in line with this, and then, our max lifetap would be 360 damage/heal.  <P>This would allow us to fullfil our other roles (healer, mana twitch, etc).<P>If not completely irresistable, then lure like resists.<P>Remember, they ARE already irresistable in all other situations.  You are looking for a solution to just the end mobs, this is it.  It affects nothing in the rest of the game, as you are extending how it works to the boss mobs.<P>We will NEVER be able to outdamage wizards, and thats what everyone is worries about.  360 every 6 seconds, or 320 every 3 seconds will never catch wizards who do 700 every 5 seconds.<P>And with the new 200+k hp mobs, 320 damage, is well, nothing.  Melee will still do more damage than casters, which is still wrong, but at least will allow us to do something.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Take both of those away (and that is the current state of affairs on ubber mobs) and all that is left is a very low grade caster.<BR>Necros need pets and taps. No one will object to a few specific mobs that are not petable or tapable.

So please dont use the argument that the ubber mobs are just a small part of the game.

Why haven't we gotten this yet?? <P>3) Give necros GROUP mana subversion.

Right now, they are all so slow.<P>OR<P>5) Give us a DOT that doesn't break Mez.<P>I have more ideas, but I am trying to be realistic.

</FONT><HR>=== Summary #1 ===<P>I have read through the entire thread and have compiled a summary that you might find useful.  I will try and add to it if something new is brought up.  Please note, the vast majority of the ideas below are NOT mine but rather those of the community at large.  I am merely the editor and compiler with one exception.<P>Changes fall within several categories<P>Lifetap<BR>1. If a tap is cast on a mob that is less than six levels above the player, then the tap will check resistance as normal, but always return the full amount of health of the spell to the necromancer even if resisted.<P>2. Really a corollary to the above in that it allows partial damage while still returning full health of the spell to the necromancer.<P>Fear<BR>3. Provide a fear protection line that allows the necromancer to make the target immune from fear for a time.<P>4. Group fear protection--similar to above, perhaps an upgrade if a line is considered.<P>5. AoE fear removal spell which would encourage the necromancer to meditate near the fray and cast this spell somewhat regularly to keep all players and pets on target.  This spell would need both fast cast and recast times to be effective.<P>6. MOB fear elimination spell which, when cast on a critter would prevent it from casting AoE fear for the duration.<P>Pets<BR>7. Make undead pets immune to AoE fear<P>8. Additional control commands<BR>   a) /no attack--pet will not defend itself<BR>   b) /sever--kills pet regardless of distance<BR>   c) /one target--prevents pet from changing       targets unless countermanded<P>9. Raid-Pets: Max pet per summon, but have very slow movement rates, are immune to fear, and suicide after MOB is killed<P><BR>General Grouping<BR>10 Ignite Bones--Remove skeleton illusion in favor of a fiery particle effect<P>11. Provide a 42 second "splut-like" debuff overtime.<P>12. Group DMF<P>13. Group Feign Death.  I think the general consensus from both necros and non was that this would be interesting to try out on test to see how it worked.  Some thought it would get more folks killed than it saved.  Given the supposed ease to code, it might be worth a test.  My personal note is that the spell would probably need to be all-or-nothing based on the necromancer's save.<P>14. Mana-Link--a link similary to shifting site, but cancelable, that allows 80% of the necromancer's mana to immediately channel to the target along with 80% of all mana gained during the duration of the spell.  This spell should probably have a relatively long duration, 2-3 mins, but also a very long recast time like 30 mins.  Part of the compensation for this restriction should be a better ratio, perhaps 2-1.<P>15. Lower level requirement for Conjure Corpse from 57 to 55.  Reasoning behind this from the poster is three-fold:<BR>a) Summoning corpses is unarguably one of the few things necros do on raids.<P>b) Summon Corpse was gained 19 levels before, which is a very long time to wait for an upgrade<P>c) Shadow Knights are supposedly getting Summon Corpse at lvl 50 and are far better equiped to carry the heavy coffins than are necromancers.  Generally speaking, hybrids do not get a parent class spell until the parent class gets any available upgrades.  At lvl 55, necromancers are still 5 lvls above the point where their child class gets the upgrade.<P>=== End Summary ===<P>Now, for my personal biases...here is what I'd like to see from the above:<P>Lifetap:<BR>1&2 combined<P>Fear:<BR>3&4<P>Pets:<BR>7&8 (8 btw..would, imho, be nice for mages as well)<P>General Grouping:<BR>10, 12, 13, 14, & 15 with 12 certainly requiring some solid testing to see how that works in practice.<P>Again..I have tried to live within the constraints you have provided.  I do not believe any of the above increases the necromancer's agressive powers against MoBs nor do they and any solo power to the class.<P>I look forward to your thoughts.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its not an overpowering spell and the only change were asking is to have a CHANCE on landing it on an epic class encounter.<P> Currently necros are being excluded from attending epic raids do to usefulness of classes and the current limits of server stability.

</FONT><HR>Why would making drain less resisted cause a balance problem?  Necromancers were made to solo, but when they can't, they should be of some use to the party damage wise.  Anything we can solo and most non-epic encounters rarely resist the drain spells as long as they are in casting range, therefore it wouldn't make us more powerful, but allow us to remain equally useful whether it be in the average lower guk lord group or a fear Cazic group.  We wouldn't be able to solo any better considering taps are not resisted often at all by average mobs, but would allow us to contribute to the major battle.  Our little damage wouldn't be that devastating compared to a druid or mage's 1k damage, or an enchanter or cleric's 700 damage, but would let us join in on the fun.  I think that this simple change would solve the problem at hand, allowing us to serve as major mana battery and yet do slight damage at battle time.  I just don't get why enchanters and clerics have more to do than us in an epic encounter when they are not meant to be nukers either, they serve other group purposes.<P>The pet commands I would also like to see implemented, but I think that this drain issue would help a lot, and would also shut a lot of us that aren't greedy up.  We just want to have fun too.<P>(Just one other question not really related to this topic:  Why is mana always spelled with 1 'm' when referring to a players mana, but is spelled with 2 'm's on Manna Robe.  I thought manna was the food that fell from heaven during the 40 years of wandering in the Bible)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(root so he doesn't go wandering off somewhere) The pet can cast while I run around and puch stuff (make laughing hotkey) use it when standing around telling jokes then become your pet and start laughing hehehehehehehe  or become spectre and run around oasis WOOT!! Mages lead SG around, so now we can scare newbies too!<P>Make a spell to turn a teammate into a skele/ something ugly! this way he is sooo ugly the monster will agro HIM. This would be great! maybe too powerful but wow! people would beg necros to go on raids. "Look a tanks about to die put Ugly Skele spell on other tank", "Caster going to die put ugly skele spell on the meat sheild!" (too powerful? give it some resistable properties!)<P>Syphon Skill! random or specific , steal the cleric res, he heals you res, steal mez whateva<P>Give skill! give others one of your abilities! nuf said<P>The DD can turn em in to skeles still just proper ones!

</FONT><HR>Absor said, <P>"Mana Transfer:  The rate will probably not be improved.  As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana.  Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana.  The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points.  That's the right ratio, really.  There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out."<P><BR>Ok this statement is mostly incorrect.  The ratio for mana transfer is close but higher than it actually is and the lich rate is wrong.  Where in the world did you get your numbers from.  If it  did work like this I would guess that a lot of Necros wouldnt be complaining on this point.  This is how it does work.<P>Repost from original thread:<P>Ok I did a little math and I understand what your saying about infinite mana pool.  However this take into the factor of time, or the fact that mana will be used for other players.  However for the sake of argument I did a little math on it.<P>Necromancers best lich converts 32 hp into 20 mana (not 1 hp into 1 mana, closer to 2 hp into 1 mana)<BR>Clerics best heal converts 20 mana into 50 hp<BR>Necros best transfer changes 400 mana into 150 mana for target (3 to 1 roughly)<P>Currently as it stands<BR>Necromancer converts 32 hp into 20 mana<BR>Necromancer transfers 20 mana to clerics 6.7 mana<BR>Cleric transfers 6.7 mana into Necromancers 16.75 hp<P>From the math, you can see that we are really in essence converting 32 hp into 16.75 hp, loosing half our hp.  Now (without the factor of time) this is how I suggest it should be:<P>Necro converts 32hp into 20 mana<BR>Necro transfers 20 mana to 12.8 mana for cleric<BR>Cleric converts 12.8 mana into 32 hp for the Necromancer.<P>As you can see the cycle comes full circle and gives you exactly what was lost.  Although as I said before this doesnt take into the effect of time or that the mana will be used for other players.  Mana cant be made instantly, unless you gave us a mana tap and then cost of casting would come into effect.  Now if the cleric and necro were just sitting somewhere and transfering hp to mana and back to hp this would be an ideal setup, but since 2 players rarely sit around and do this, it isnt.<P>Also Absor, what are you planning on changing.  You dont want to add anything new, you dont want to increase mana transfer, you dont want to make lifetaps near unresistable, you dont want to make DoTs stack better, you dont want to remove the need for essence emeralds.  Then what, are you saying that Verant is going to make no valuable changes, even against the demand of their customer base?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yes that is right allow stacking but do it the following way:<P>DOT foo  100% effectiveness<BR>DOT foo2  50% effectiveness<BR>DOT foo2  25% effectiveness<BR>DOT foo2  12.5% effectiveness  <P><BR>The point here is that you allow multiple necros have a chance to cast some damage spells.  Whether this is a global change for all levels or for 50+ mobs is up for debate by the balance team and whether they want to change the lower end of the spectrum (which most people seem to think is acceptable).  It does make more sense if the spell stacking was something along these lines and not a pure one spell only.  <P>*you could easily do some sort of exponential decay or logrithmic. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-pets should NOT get affected by rain spells from other player characters.  I don't see how hard it is to get the pet info from the group object.  A necro's own AE spells do not affect their pet so you HAVE access to the pet. There should be a parent pointer on the pet for the charm code and such.  Just access that and see if that object is a player or not when a rain spell cast by a PC occurs.<P>Right now you are fighting the mega mob and the wizards case the nice rain spell getting HUGE damage but all the pets die.

Make the necro have to plan ahead and allocate a spot in his spell list for the spell for the uber raid.
