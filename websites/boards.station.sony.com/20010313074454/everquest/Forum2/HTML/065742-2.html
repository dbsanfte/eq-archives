</FONT><HR>If you don't like that spot to bind then don't bind there.<P>By the way, if you know the spot, Iksar can bind in both OT AND FV (although I personally prefer Cabilis of course).  They can also bind in Qeynos, Freeport, and Greater Fay.<P>But if you don't like the spot spare us your whining and just don't bind there.<P>Kaesora (actually FoB just outside of Kaesora) makes a lot of sense if you're KoS in Cabilis, which is just about everyone.<P>Look.  None of these places is perfectly safe.  If that bothers you don't bind there.  A game like EQ is NOT about safety.  I DO think that by the time someone gets to level 50 or so they should be able to use their grey matter some and figure things out without having Verant hold their hands (or whining until Verant does hold their hands).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"By the way, if you know the spot, Iksar can bind in both OT AND FV (although I personally prefer Cabilis of course). They can also bind in Qeynos, Freeport, and Greater Fay."<P>LOL.  You just don't get it. This has nothing to do with where/where-not Iksar could always be bound.  Verant added a bindspot at a place so non-Iksar would not have to worry about Iksar faction.  I don't see them adding bind-locs that return the favor for the Iksar.  And yes, I know of all the whole-zone-bind areas, but kunark had similar locations (as other said anyone could bind in OT, FV, and COM) though not a whole zone.<P>This in and of itself is an unprecedented event.  <P>1.  Verant ONLY added this bind point to try to taunt players into these unused dungeons.  <P>NEGATIVE:  They should have redesigned the dungeons themselves instead of trying this.  I mean if its a bad risk/reward area, why would players *want* to be able to run back to their corpses (and die again) faster?<BR>POSITIVE: Perhaps Verant will decide they need to rework the dungeons.<P><BR>2.  To do this they compromised the gameplay *value* of having decent Iksar Faction.<P>NEGATIVE: Imagine how angry you'd be if you spent weeks working up Iksar faction to be able to bind in cabalis.<BR>POSITIVE: I hope this means they intend to provide more in-game work arounds so everyone needs to rely less on faction.<P><BR>3.  Before the change Kaesora was just as EASY to get to from a bindable spot as Guk or any *well-used* dungeon.  <P>NEGATIVE: This obviously means their is another problem with it.  I stated the zones to take earlier, and someone hunting in Kaesora will have no trouble with it.<BR>POSITIVE: Perhaps they'll add more bind spots where they are needed, and not just near places that they admit nobody uses.<P>NOTE: No matter what anyone else says... I never said that new bind-locs was an all bad idea, yes it does have bad points, which I and others point out, but that doesn't mean its bad.  <P>My main problem with the bind-locs are their reasonings behind placing them.  <P>ARADUNE: "The bind points that were put in recently were focused on increasing usage of low and mid level zones (for example, Droga/Nurga, Kaesora, Paw)."<P>So not only did they throw faction considerations out the window (so to speak), but they seem to think that location alone makes a dungeon "underused".  They ignored loot problems, dungeon zone design, problem mobs, etc...<P>So in finality: Yes - any new bindpoint is a good thing, doesn't mean I (or anyone else) have to like their altierier motives for placing the thing.  When you consider somthing, look at their intentions, not just the actions.  Obviously the "intent" here is a bandaid to overcrowding NOT a fix for melee binding issues.<P>/cheer verant<BR>I'm glad you put in more bind-locs.  <P>Now I'd be *happy* about the new bind-locs if I thought you put them in because you believed melee players needed them (and intended to place more), as opposed to using them as candy to lure players out of other places.<P><BR>Slithars/Ravshar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Anaks, no offense, but those first three would be terrible spots for bind locations.<P>You want them to put bind spots right outside the already-busiest dungeons in the game?  Don't you realize what that would DO?  /boggle   Why not put one outside Karnor's while we're at it?<P>It would be much better for them to place bind spots by underutilized dungeons, which they did.  Kaesora is a great place but badly underutilized.  A bind spot outside Chardok would make much more sense than one outside Sebilis, and a spot closer to Howling Stones (which I believe the FM spot is), to encourage people to spread out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And to be honest, MOST of the teleportation done in EQ is done by Druids, Wizards can't port anyone to East Commons or North Ro until level 39, for gosh sakes, Druids get those at 29 and 34 I believe.  When I'm the only un-anonymous Wizard in a zone (level 35 ATM), I often have to refer people who want ports to Ro or Commons to a Druid (unless they are willing to take a port to Nektulos, I got that at 34).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a Druid but you’re right, a vast majority of “porters” are druids so people don’t think of G Fay as a port point as much as they should. I left myself way open for the flaming and I am sorry I forgot about G Fay. I don’t spend any time in Faydwer and so forgot about it. This does not mean that I have no clue about anything and the balance of my post, back on page 1, stands.<P>I still don’t understand why people complain about improvements to the game. In a world with this many people, odds are they are not going to improve things in the way you would like them too but that does not mean the additions “SUCK”.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No bind points were taken away, but new ones were added.  No matter how lame one may think the locations of the new bind points are, it is STILL an addition to the already existing bind points in Norrath.  <P>IMHO, this is an improvement.  I don't see how adding bind points was a detriment to this game.
