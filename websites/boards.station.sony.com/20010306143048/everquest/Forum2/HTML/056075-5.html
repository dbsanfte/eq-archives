&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Having Read the whole thread carefully, most arguments for and against the main issues, healing, porting, forms, resist buffs, armor, charm etc have been put already, but I feel its worth listing some short personal summaries/wishlist/comments from the viewpoint of a level 44 Druid who got there a few months ago and frankly didn't feel too incentivised to move higher ..<P>1. Armor - Mid-level quests non-existent (Sol Ro .. whatever) - personally I love the look of the serp bracers and head gear pink metallic effect .. would love to see Druid capable arms, legs, bp's of same, please could we once and for all stop looking like newbies at lvl 40 plus<P>2. Healing - Why on earth shouldn't we be capable back-up healers, Complete Heal and Resus will always take Clerics into a different enhanced capability at 39, so why not help us to help them at 39 and give us Sup. Heal. Personally, just moving it from 53 to 51 is not enuff .. with what the Clerics get, it just isn't imbalancing .. also the amount of times there is no cleric to be found .. and this druid ends up trying to heal with Grtr Heal/chloro .. its kinda tough.<P>3. Scale of wolf - SoW ll would be great, but why not just make Scale something effective that we might actually use.<P>4. Porting Rings - can't understand why SFG has never had a porting ability, I'm sure there's a reason, but along with everyone else .. PLEASE could we get it ? Other potential areas, Everfrost, Warsilik woods (non evac) and amending the EJ / Skyfire. Appreciated the changes to the Velious ports at least, don't we think Kunark should have more than one DIRECT Group destination too ?<P>5. Charm - Why not make it a skill for Druids, like Lay Hands, Mend, Bandages etc .. as in type not comparison .. maybe a one time use each zone, or some time limitation .. would make sense for the profile of a Woodsman Druid to have as a Special class defining skill .. (leave the other classes with the spell line) .. thrn once charmed, leave the commands as before. Levels of Animals capable to be charmed would then relate to your ability to do so, and a faction factor maybe .. I don't kill bears or wolves, and so shouldn't I be able to make them my friends easier than anyone else.<P>6. Wisdom - As our defining Stat, shouldn't we also get the same (or better) ability to buff that stat like enchanters, since they only use to buff us or for trades, maybe call it 'Gift of Nature' .. this also would make us VERY group friendly to the Clerics and shaman's, on a par with clarity if you make it good enuff .. 50plus Group friendliness enhanced in one go !<P>7. Spirit of the Griffon - someone mentioned this earlier, I loved the idea so repeating it .. similar to Necro's DMF .. one cast for SoW, Lev and maybe some MR or AC boost.<P>8. Snared/Rooted Mob - Some change in text above head would be really neat .. or preferrable a change in text color .. or even BOTH .. reduce KS'ing considerably .. er . .hopefully !<P>9. Safe Fall - Always found this amusing, our hometown is up in the trees, and yet Wood elves don't get Safe Fall as a Racial skill .. just a thought<P>10. Forms - Would love for the higher Wolf forms to be somewhat larger, different color, more opaque .. just something .. and/or maybe a Dire wolf Form, or even just a Black Wolf Form .. <P>Thats me done, appreciate the idea and intent behind the threads Absor, and PR wise, makes me look with cautiously optimistic hopefullness at moving my 44 druid upwards and onwards .. even in dungeons .. hehe<P>Sylvar Oakenspirit<BR>Druid of the 44th Season<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, just thought Id add my two cents worth;<P>Im not really gonna say that the druid class is underpowered, and they are definitely full of variety. There are however a few inconsistencies ive noticed.<P>Port Spell to Kunark<P>We have circle of Combines, at lvl 34 I believe, but what happened to ring of Combines? Shouldnt we be able to port there by ourselves, not with a group only?<P>Wolfform spells<P>Ok, im a druid. I want to turn into other stuff to. Mebbe bearform, and tiger form. How bout bat form, ie a wolfform with permanent levitate. That would be neat and add a bit aesthetically to the class.<P>Its the little perks that can make a class fun!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To improve a Lvl 55 Druid's group attractiveness in a dungeon or raid, I suggest<BR>1.  Group strength buff  (+35 Strngth)<BR>2.  Group Attack Buff with Ultravision or Infravision w/o Wolfform for Indoor use (+50 Attack)  (Group Wolfform adds SOW and Attack but it is only used outdoors)<BR>3.  Make skin line stackable with cleric resolution spells (Shaman hp buffs stack with clerics)<BR>4.  Less fizzles on that superior heal and a better heal.  Quite saddening to watch a tank die because I cannot heal fast enough.  After the tank dies, I am the next target because I snared it and tried to heal the tank; therefore, no evac because MOB is beating on me.  No Evac means group dies except the casters who gated out while the poor druid is getting killed.  Oops, now I get to listen to complaints on why I didn't evac group. (probably has been written and experienced so much that it has become really annoying).<BR>5.  Still trying to find my lvl 39 Velious spell<BR>Ro's Fiery Sundering so I can debuff the mob better. (hopefully it will drop tonite or else you can make it some kind of quest.  Nah Druids never get quests).   BTW the only spell I found off a mob has been the Group TP spell.....ACK bought one from a vendor.  As a matter of fact, the only useful Velious spells I can see of any value are the TPs, Ro's Fiery Sundering, Protection of the Glades (1200 mana, is that a joke?).  However, I only see 1 spell (Ro's Fiery Sundering) from Velious Expansion that I can use because Wiz's can TP and Protection of the Glades is a lvl 60 spell, which I will never see in my lifetime.<BR>6.  Pls make those Dungeon only Kunark Evac spells to EJ and SF castable from anywhere.<BR>7.  Mana Regen earlier than lvl 59 would be nice.  Oops, I forgot I have Form of the howler (+2 Mana/tick).  Ackkk, I forgot again it can only be cast indoors; therefore, I will be LOM in a dungeon again.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, in response to the Raenya flames.  <P>If you want to suggest things like mana regen, more animal forms, or superior harmony or anything else(and thank you to the people who finally proposed ways that harmony could work in dungeons) be my guest.  All that I ask is that you *support* your requests.  Explain what problem it would address.  Explain why it would not make the druid class overpowered.  Explain how it could be implemented.  <P>Support your oppinions.  Instead of flaming me saying "Who are you to tell us how to post? Who died and made you god?" prove me wrong.  Support your suggestions with valid arguments.  Use examples and hypothetical situations.  If you can't come up with a way to implement something without it being overpowered, or can't see how it would allieviate problems plagueing the class why post it?  Wishlists are nice, there are things we'd all love to see that will probably never happen (like more animal forms) but until something drastic changes (like a change to minimum systen requirments) we're not going to see more animal forms.<P>On the other hand the flames did get people talking, that is a good thing.<P>These are the things I don't think are going to happen, and why.<P>1&gt; Superior Harmony, this spell trivializes dungeons.  The nature of terrain in indoor dungeons are different than outdoor dungeons.  Little chance indoors of something agroing you before you even see it.  You seldom get agro'd through walls in indoor dungeons.  The spell is beneficial.  I don't mean it does something "good" to the target, I mean that it doesn't check for magic resistance and isn't counted as an offensive (mobs do not agro from it).  Even if the target is immune to this type of spell the target doesn't agro.  Though it doesn't stop agro completly, if you avoid walking *right next* to the mob it will ignore you.<P>2&gt; Animal forms.  New animal forms aren't happening due to global space constraints.  There is a finite ammount of space in the global, that space is almost used up.  Any new models given would probably go to the enchanters, who are the masters of illusion.  It doesn't matter how good an idea for a new animal form is, it's not likely going to happen because of limited global space.<P>3&gt; Manaregen.  The soloability of druids has never been in question.  They are a strong soloing class throughout much of their career.  The druid problem is late game viability.  (The whole thing got started with the "better heals for druids/shamen" threads months ago).  Druids already recieve mana regen at high levels.  If you are in favor of mana regen at lower levels explain how it would help the deficiencies of the class without increasing power in already strong areas.<P>"I think this would be cool" posts don't add to the thread.  They are for the wishlist forum.<P>Ok. Example. Bad post.<P>"I don't think druid charm should agro the mob when it breaks, after all we're masters of nature right? Animals are supposed to love us.  I don't see why they agro us.  Make all the druid charm spells not agro."<P>This theoretical post doesn't answer a few questions.<BR>1&gt; What changes if any will be made to charm to compensate for this?<BR>2&gt; If no detremental changes are made, will the spell be overpowered.<BR>3&gt; What would stop the druid from continually recharming and  keeping a permanent pet.<BR>4&gt; What do you do about the level 55 spell tunare's request that is supposed to be a non agro charm?  It is now twice as useless.  What changes do you make to it?<BR>5&gt; If druid charm is nerfed in someway to compensate what happens to the people who already get some benefit from the spell line?  For example, if the spell line is made to not agro, but only work on non kos mobs, what about the people who use charm as crowd control in dungeons?  What about those people if charm is made to not agro but will only work on greens.  Ask anyone who has used the level 55 charm exactly how useful it is.<P>Maybe a change that is needed is obvious to you.  Maybe it isn't obvious to someone else.  What if a change would be good for the class, and for the game but doesn't get implemented because Absor didn't see it the same way you did, but you didn't explain your position.<P>Raenya Lupine 59th Preserver of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Robes. Yes, it is a balance issue. Reserach Robe of the Azure Sky, you will find a 18 ac 20 int/wis robe 15 all resists, some mana, hp etc, WEIGHT .5. Only wearable by robe graphic classes. Yes, this means halfings, dwarves, wood elves, maybe some other races, will be unable to wear this item because of the lack of a robe graphic for those races. Fair? No, hardly fair. Not when you give us a claim about weight on vermiculated and elder spiritists armor that it is that heavy because it so good compared to other class armor. (Which I totally disagree with, because if you did the research it would become quite apparent that we do not get any special advantage over any other class on their equivalent planar/kunark armor). <P>This robe is very high powered. There isn't anything on the same level for those of us excluded by the choice of wearable races on this. What it boils down to is that casters get a chest item superior to those who are excluded on this item. Its higher ac, has tons of int, wis, resists and its very low weight. It is a nice rare item to get. The solution to this is to allow those without robe graphic to wear it, make it a chest graphic like breastplate. <P>What I don't understand is, how can there not be room for a robe graphic in texture memory, I believe that was the reason, when Kunark came out, Lizard race was added, and with it, new robe graphics on the lizards.<P>Druids wear robes, its traditional. I have no idea how this chain idea came about in the first place. Its ugly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. PoG - No armor yet everyone but rangers (and paladins?) get armor there.  Unsure of PoMischief if armor drops there though..<P>2. Charm - Useless, please add monsters to the list, such as racnars? trakaraptors? wolves in PoG (confirmed by myself)<P>3. AE Snare, could this be changed to AE Ensnare? lasting 10minutes instead of 2..<P>4. Change EJ and SF ports from Kunark only dungeons to anywhere? or at least any dungeon, Regular, RoK and SoV?<P>5. Epic - Killing greenies over and over for a rare spawn? I can deal with that, but Faydewr? Please make him forced spawn by a quest with something, maybe need the other stone off VS (for the ranger) to give to someone to make Fay spawn... or at least up every 3 days or 7 at least...  I don't mind the effect, at least now before I have it..<P>6. Surefall/EverFrost would be nice, OOT?  Great Faydark isnt really needed, but theres ruins right next to Kelethin...<P>7. Please raise the length of Pack Regen/Chloro/Regrowth<P>8. Is there a use the Exile Summoned?  Slower then Scor, less damage, resists more...  Please make this 200 mana, 850 damage, 4.0 casting time, for example..<P>9. 1/2 SoW speed at lvl 39 for Indoors? or maybe 44<P>10. Skins cost so much for usefulness, such that Clerics have ones that cost less and are better..  I'm not saying up the Skin power really (im not saying you cant), but the mana cost could be lowered =]<P>11. Wake of Karana - Way to long refresh/memorize time..  I dont mind the component, this makes it from being always off<P>12. Blizzard - Sucks, resists like mad<P>Armor<P>13. Weight<P>14. AC upgrade from Vermi to ES is 0 - 2!<P>15. Same spell from the quests in SoV as ES on the arms...?<P>End Armor<P>15. You stated you will fix heals, Please Do So! Fizzle Rate is 2.6 per actual cast!   And Im 57<P>16. Lowering the lvl for Sup. Heal, added Remedy and a Divine Light at 60 sounds good =]<P>17. Stated previously, its quite effective to just root + dot then to quad<P>18. Usefullness on high lvl raids - Quite low.. DS isnt as good, Shamans can regrowth and can3 to give it out more, our str is crappy compared to shms its not considered to be used, DDs are resisted frequently or lowered in dmg, heals arent enough in hp+ and time efficiency to keep even wizards alive, no crowd control<P>19. Quests - For those that arent 50+ to work on epic/SS/Thurg/Kael armor, they have nothing of use to do as in quests<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I choose a druid as my main character because I was drawn to the myth and legends surrounding druids. I started my druid on Bertoxx when it was still a young server, so there was little problem with twinking as there is now. The misconception the druid is an overpowered class came about because people saw wolves running about, envied our ability to travel and shapechange, and created twink druids (with near 200 wisdom )doing things I would never even consider. <P>I envisioned druids being the friends of animals and masters of herbology. I believed the shaman would become animals (by smoking whatever they deemed necessary). I was wrong on both counts.. as the druid and shaman roles are, to me, reversed in Everquest. I think some people at Verant might sub-consiously recognize this as well... why else give shaman Bear Form, and druids a pet bear at 50+?<P>The fact that druids get teleports at all baffles me. The fact that we get DD spells of such magnitude doesn't seem to be very druidish at all. I find it funny that we get so many spells that increase our attack and defense (including wolfform that, irritatingly, can only be cast outdoors).. yet post 40 we are considered a casting class.  But what is written is written I guess (I think I would have made a druid a monk-hybrid with herbology and a pet).<P>I was very dissapointed when I discovered just how many druid spells could not be cast inside, as it seems any spells that might be considered class defining are taken away just by going inside. And there is the fact that any buff/heal<BR>we can cast is considered inferior to all Cleric/Shaman/mage buffs. It gets old to see 'Your spell does not take hold.'<P>I have no direct suggestions for changes to the druid character class, because Verant's vision of what a druid is eludes me. I do, however, look foreward to any changes to my first and only played character.<P>Rather than examining classes, I think it would be more helpfull to look into changes to EQ's Quest/Combat system.

</FONT><HR>It looks like there are very few things that are very important to fix<P>A) A mana regen of any sort; be it Cannibalize, an item to quest, or maybe (here's a new idea) a self-only breeze type of spell!<P>B) Pet? Why we need a pet? Unless just to pet...<P>C) Ports and SoWs (maybe a few more of both eh?)<P>D) fizzle fizzle a lot less please. I see to many Druids who make there last name "Fizzlelots" or "Fizzlealot" or "Fizzlemeister"  They didn't make this name for themselves for no reason...<P>E) Overweight clothing: we shouldn't have to add to our str stat just to wear the armor you gave us...it should be made to order, not order to wearability...<P>Yes: we are a second-best type class. We have nothing someone else can do better, but we have a little bit of EVERYTHING! As for making us groupable: why did you make us like you made us Verant if you didn't want us to solo? If you want to make us groupable you should re-evaluate most or all of our outdoor only spells, and the spells we are most asked to use! Don't play stupid you know what they are! Also, maybe some physical activity would help us. Maybe "Attack of Bear" or some attack aide would make us a little more likeable since our spells are so solo-oriented. If we can't cast maybe we should fight a little more... :P<P>One last thing....<BR>One of my best friends told me he can't believe anyone would play a non-twinked Druid. He had one and he deleted it. (It was even up to lvl 30!)<BR>Their items obtainable suck like an overpowered vacuum. I play a Druid and a Paladin, and frankly my 28 Paladin would rather have a wizard, cleric, or shaman than a druid in her group. And from how the other members of her group pick members, they agree...<P>Summary: either a revamping of Druids for grouping (which would be nonsensical), or make Druids a truly solo-partnering class!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I would like to see the following improvements in the druid class. I have arrived at these requests from my own play and by reading some of the wonderful suggestions posted here.<P>1) I don't think it would unbalance the game if druids had a line of animal form spells that mimicked the enchanter line of illusions. This would give us the ability to travel through certain lands and (at +34 levels in dungeons) with little fear of getting attacked.<P>2) Make wolf forms an AC/ATK buf that is stackable with SoW. Improve the duration and speed of SoW with a series of spells. I know the improved speed thing won't unbalance the game since I have witnessed many bards sprinting by me.<P>3) In line with the new focus of the game, provide druids with abilities/spells that work indoors and can benefit a group. I absolutely refuse to fight in dungeons right now. The only mana efficient damage spells we have are AoE which ends up in me getting 'multi-pounded' and becomming a group liability. Stacking bufs, more efficient damage, longer duration damage shields and group bufs have all been mentioned so I won't go into much detail there. I must say that I do like group regen a lot (obviously) but I think we should get this at an earlier level and with better results in higher levels. That improvement alone would make druids wanted members of a group early on and get them used to group tactics at earlier levels.<P>4) I became really excited reading a post about adding a druid skill in the charm area. The duration of the charm animal spells are rediculously short. I really like the idea of either changing their durations/effectiveness or adding a charm skill that would make an animal our true pet. This could be a skill that we train in allowing for better results at a higher level or has an extremely long refresh rate (like paladin's LoH). Other hybrids have skills that help them in battle but druids do not. Druids have some great pet enhancing spells that are worthless because we can't keep a pet charmed for longer than 10 seconds (at least I can't). In oppostion to an new charm skill, I suggest that the charm spell duration be improved but not necessarily its ability to effect higher level animalss. Also, many charmed animals will refuse to attack a high level target. This should be changed as well. When a pet animal is buffed it is a real terror. Why should it not want to attack who I tell it to? With a strong improvement here could also be a strong penelty for letting your animal die. How about a faction hit for letting your charmed animal die? This would force druids to use their improved charm in groups and other situations that are safer for the pet than soloing.<P>5) Along with 4, why aren't all obvious animals in the game animals? Voracious brutes? ****atrices? Others have named a bunch more... A change in the categorization of monsters to animals and a change in the druid's ability to charm animals may unbalance the game. If I had a choice, I would take a change in charm but I think that animals that aren't really animals is just silly.<P>6) I am an avid fan of trade skills. I spend a lot of time trime to forage the items I (and others) need for them. I think an ability to forage a certain item or type of item post skill 100 is not too much to ask. /forage water, /forage food or /forage oakbark (the oakbark thing is probably too much to ask) would make me tremendiously happy.<P>7) As others have mentioned, the restriction on the additional Kunark teleport spells is uncalled for. No other teleport spells require a location 'component' (that I know of, anyway). It would also have the side benefit of releaving crowdining if everyone had an easier way of reaching other parts of Kunark.<P>I think that's all for now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So who the hell do you think you are to say what is and isn't going to happen? Here's an idea.... let the actualy workers like Absor say what's going on... seems all you like to do is come in and flame others as if you have the say of what will happen... to the point you like shoot down others... we are just making suggestions... and sometimes if somthing is asked for enough.... it happens.... if you read closely to my post... things liek the Mana regen wasn't just for us.. I asked it for Clerics too...Shammies dealing with the animal Spirit? HELLO we follow the goddess of the animal!!!! the shere embodiment of the outdoors plants and animals alike!!!! So why wouldn't druids be able to infuse themselfs with animal spirits? &lt; SPIRIT OF THE WOLF &gt;  Seriously also... you need to read closer.... Alot of my post were possible problems I see mostly asked to be looked into or considered....I consider your talk on Naggy funny... you should be the healer.... Riiiight... last time I healed in a naggy run... good ol' naggy killed the guy off faster than my heals could bring his health back... and then there does come a point where NUKE is called.. where all nukers ... NUKE naggy... or Vox &lt; espically Vox &gt;... I don't see problems with new Forms... though all I am asking is if shammies are so intouch with animals they get all thoes spells.. and druids are animal masters.. then they each should get the forms... you know the changes Bear form grants? +10 wisdom to start.... WISDOM... how does looking like a bear make you wise? and I know that on raids where I switch out Wis gear for resist gear.. and lose a large amout of Wisdom for it... I would love to be able to take a form that grants me some extra wisdom... As for the token pet... I would have rather have a more useful spell... somthing that at lvl 55.. would be USEFUL.... a new buff... a dd spell.. SOMTHING that I would actually USE.... &lt; sighs &gt; Anyways.. before I let this flame go 500 pages long &lt; and it would &gt; Rae... do us all a favor.. stop acting like the CEO of the boards and let the actual people who matter do the talking </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>As a druid of the 41 season I can say that there are some small changes that need to be made to make Druids a more beneficial part of a group.  These ideas are based on my own experiences as well as feedback I have received from group members and other Druids.  Most have been mentioned before by others, so I only wish to reinforce those ideas so that Verant realizes that they are issues that need to be addressed. <P>Finding a group as a Druid seems to be almost impossible since 39.  I have been hunting in Dreadlands, Great Divide, and Eastern Wastes since 35 and each lvl I gain, the harder it becomes to find a group.  Now in my 41st season, finding a group is impossible unless I have my Enchanter friend with me, then it's easy (Hummmmmm, wonder why? 8-P).  Verant keeps saying how they want Druids to group more, and that's great, as I for one love to group, but something needs to be done to make druids a VALUABLE asset to a group, so that when we look for a group people will WANT to have us there.  As stated many times Shamans have better buffs, clerics have better heal and "HP" type buffs, Wizards and Mages have better nukes, mages have their pets and Wizards can EVAC or TP, Bards have good buffs + the Mana song, and Tanks have the AC and can deal out good damage.  Then there is the Druid.  Why would anyone want us in a group at 39+?  We can't heal more then one bub of a tanks HP's in a cast, the Bards speed song is faster the SoW, Shaman have better buffs and the same Greater Heal, Wizards have better nukes and can Evac or TP the group and it takes two Druids to have ½ the healing power of a cleric, so you have a Druid as a healer, you need to have two cause one will not be able to keep the group alive easily.  <P>Now that I've thrown out my 2cp worth, here are my ideas.<P>First and probably most important, we need Superior Heal at 39, clerics get it at 35 and get complete heal at 39, so it's not like we are "stealing" any of their healing powers, plus they get 50% rez at 39.  Superior Heal should also be given to Shamans at 39 as well.   I can't count the number of times our group has shouted for a cleric some where close to our level to join our group and not one can be found.  So we had to use another spot of the group for another Druid or Shaman to be co-healer.  Being able to heal only 1 bubble or less of your tanks HP's is not only a detriment to the Druid and Shamy, but is also endangering the entire group.  It's not like we don't want clerics around, it's just that there are no where enough clerics (at least on veehsan) for us to have such a crap heal at this lvl.  And get rid of all the fizzing and interruptions! There is no need to have a spell that takes you down 25% of you mana on fizzing or that gets interrupted soooo much that it takes 30 sec to cast as your tanks and your group will be dead by then.<P>Next big benefit to the group would be an EVAC to the druids bind point.  This has so many benefits to the group that I won't even start.  The only thing I ask is that it clears the agro of the mobs.  This would be a good 39 or 44 lvl spell.  To offset the huge benefit of this spell, some kind of rez effect could be added that would drop all of your groups buffs.<P>Sow…Bards HATE SoW, cause it is slower then their movement song by a lot!  To make SoW better change group SoW to be faster, make it like 10% slower then the bard's movement song or something like that.  This would help everyone and keep the Bards from getting angry at us for using group SoW.<P>Someone mentioned something like this and I liked the Idea so I just wanted to expand on it more..  We need to have more Pack buffs to make us better additions to the group.  These pack buffs need to combine some of our individual buffs and add a bit to the + amount.  What I would like to see is this, have one group buff that stacks that adds Skin like (and have it stack with cleric buffs), add + to the attack in one buff.  Have another buff that adds +STR, + agility, +dex in one buff.  Then have another buff that adds +Sv Cold, +Sv Fire, +Sv Magic in one group buff.  Then Add + Sv Disease and + Sv Poison in another buff.   This would make us more valuable to the group and save the limited buff space that we all have.  These buffs would all work inside and would take the place of the group wolf form with out the speed increase that someone mentioned. <P>I would like to see some form of "tree form" that is a pack spell, which would make the group "agro proof" while in the form.  It would add a better regen and would make you unable to cast or move unless you click the effect off or if you do cast the effect is removed like invis.<P>Armor…  *** is up with druid armor anyway?  Get rid of my Velium Stone Etched mace and my CGS and I look like a firggin monk (no offence to monks :-p)!  Come on guys, make some good looking Druid armor (either quest or droped) that has some good AC, good stats, good looks, and will not weigh as much as warrior armor!  Also, we REALLY need some low, to mid range quest armor that is good for those lvls.  Better weapons that have good damage, good looks, and +WIS, +mana, +Agil would be nice.  Make some new mid lvl droped and quest weapons and then make some new high lvl, High Damage weapons to help us finish off the mobs.  Also we need some +WIS items for the Range slot and some better boots for human druids for mid lvl too.   Mid to upper mid lvl (30 -50) druids don't have any good quest armor to hold us over till we can get some of the better but HEAVY stuff available around 50.  PLEASE add some good items for us at lvls 30-50!!! <P>DD's, Rain, and DOT seplls.  Hummm, biggest problem here is how often our current spells get resisted.  PLEASE make our current spells less resisted (this includes ensnare and root) or give us some new ones that are less resisted.  Last night I was in Wakening Lands and we were fighting BLUE giants.  Most resisted EVERY cast I made. I used ½ my mana and was no benefit to the group other then to damage shield the tank and sit and med for heals if the cleric got LOM. COME ON!!! If you want us to group, you need to let us be able to do something for the group, sitting there for invis, or SoW, (we had a wizard so she could EVAC), is not really worth "using" that spot for me as the Ench or Wiz could invis, so I was there basically for SoW and back up heals (which I never needed to do BTW).<P>Well, there are my ideas for now, there are more, but these are the ones I consider important to my lvl.  I'm sure as I gain lvl I will find more changes that need to be made at higher lvl, but since I'm not there yet, I will leave those comments to those of that lvl.<P>Thanks for reading, and Safe Hunting!<P>Radoen Riftcaster &lt;Knights of Salvation&gt;<BR>Druid of Norrath<BR>Servant of Tunare<BR>Veeshan Server<P>"I do not feel obligated to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect as intended us to forgo their use."<BR>	-- Galileo Galilei<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Khnemu of Bertoxxulous - Level 48 druid<P>I cant believe there are so so many replies to this topic! Verant, this is a testament to your creation, Gratz!<P>The posting is a bit too long for me , i skimmed some of it... Really like that spirit of griffon spell, except how do you explain why griffon's dont like us so much?? Here are some more thoughts on how our class would be more balanced, or at least more fun to play.<P><BR>Druids - Leader of the Pack<BR>** Pay attention to these ones. More group spells = more druids who group.<P>1. Top of my list is group spells, they are the most important addition to the spell line up as far as I'm concerned. These spells reduce the tedium of constantly buffing group members individually and thus make the game more enjoyable. The question i have for you is why are these spells worse in ANY way from the original?? For instance, group sow has a shorter duration than regular sow. So, yes you can cast on everyone at once, save a little mana, BUT you have to cast it more often. I often find myself investing the extra mana and individually sowing group members. If anything, group sow should last longer than regular sow, and personally I'd even prefer if the cost of the spell were raised to offset this. You can substitue any group buff in here actually, the arguement is pretty much the same.<P>2. Another note on group spells and their relief of the tedium of individual buffs on groups. Here are a couple circumstances and the spell I was dreaming of... <BR>While camping Chief Rygorr, i often found myself craving a group damage shield, which our first version of is level 51 - way too high! Perhaps a 10pt group DS at level 39 would solve this problem. <BR>Making our way through the Tower of Frozen Shadow, we arrive on level 4 only to find ourselves swarmed by casters... They are defeated, and i realize i have to spend 5 minutes fire/cold/disease buffing everyone. Our first version of group buffs for fire and cold are 51 and 52! Way too high again, we need a lesser 'endure' version of the spells for the entire group. And hell ... we need one for magic, poison, and disease too while you're at it.<P>3. Group heal... By now some of you are tinkering with this idea... Dont do it, this is clearly in the cleric's domain. Our version is group chloro/regen...<P>4. When i was younger than level 30 I found that no matter where i went I was always keeping 2 buffs on group members. Sow, and Skin. Now in my post 30's I still keep up sow but often I dont use skin... It is just too costly. When in a full group, the only person who will get it is the lead tank, and with some extra mana maybe the group enchanter... A group version of this spell would be amazingly helpful, perhaps a group steel skin at the same level we get diamond skin. And likewise a group diamond skin at the same level we get Skin Like Nature.<P>5. Group levitate! We are the masters of travel arent we?<P>6. Superior heal at level 49! I'm sure there's plenty about this in other posts...<P>The Solitary Druid<P>7. To carry on with my above comment. In post 30's the only buffs i keep on myself constantly are sow and coat. The skin spell often falls to the wayside, it's too costly and not much beneift really, since when soloing we typically kite. I would propose that the skin spells as early as Diamond, have a small mana regen effect like 1 per tick. These spells are earlier version of NatureSkin which does have a mana regen effect i think...<P><BR>Druid - The Plants and Animals<P>8. A series of spells that needs huge improvements is cleary the charm plant line... There's only 1! Obvious problem, easy solution.<P>9. Our summon pet is embarassing. I saw the druid at NK rings with one, and i decided I would likely never use that spell. The pet is a teeny tiny version of a kodiak. Laughable! We are lovers of nature and those BIG kodiaks in west commons, (who i secretly wish i could buff). Our pet should be a large kodiak just like these, this would be much more realistic and much more fun! Balance you say? Firstly this would prevent us from using our pet in dungeons, hence a limitation on a spell that is mastered by other classes such as the necromancer. Secondly, as with spells mastered by other classes, the 'lesser' version of the spell does have inherent limitations such as forcing this spell to be outdoor only. <P>10. Charming animals is a great ability to have as a druid. In fact, whenever i fight in wakening lands I have this spell ready. There are always panthers and raptors lurking behind the dense foliage, and often join in any fight they happen to pass by. This is an excellent spell line, that is sorely underused by my fellow druids. The problem with this spell is it's short duration of effect. Now I know this has been stated repeatedly, but I want to point out that it does make perfect sense to improve this. <BR> - This is a more limited version of the Enchanter Charm spell as it can only be used on animals. It should be enhanced for balance purposes... ie. animal only but lasts 5 times longer.<BR> - Assuming there is a good reason for the new summon pet spell, the charm series would fall more in line with that. Allowing us a 'real' pet earlier on. Well ... one that has to be recharmed every 10 minutes...<P>Other Stuff<P>11. Exploring in Frozen Tower I've put my vs. summoned spells to great use. I thought they would never get used! I was pretty excited, so i looked ahead to see how much DD i could expect my next summoned upgrade to do. The current level 44 Banish Summoned does 585 dmg. The next version is the level 55 spell Exile summoned which does 675dmg. What's that all about? I honestly expected the upgrade to do maybe 800 dmg or more. Clearly, based on the limitation of this spell it would not be harmful to increase it's power. I imagine even wizards at this level can do much more damage to anything including summoned creatures.<P>12. I cant help but think that we should be able to buff more stats than just Strength. I wouldn't be in favor of being able to buff wis or int. And definitely not charisma. And not Agi as this is the only buff a ranger has and we wouldn't want to infringe upon their domain. Best choices would be Dex or Stamina. Dex seems to be the better alternative, and would make us that much more loved by our close ranger friends.<P>13. I really wish i could use Spirit of Cheetah more. At my lower levels I used it in places like Rathe Mountains, to give me that extra spurt to the zone when needed. The recycle time DOES make sense in this respect because realistically how often do you need to zone?? BUT it doesn't find it's way into my spell lineup anymore because when i first prep it, I have to wait far too long before i can use it. The recycle time should be something like 2 minutes not 10.<P>14. I'm amazed that there aren't some druid only quests that involve talking to animals. Clearly no onther classes can speak with animals... would be interesting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have recently just started reading the threads.<BR>90% of what I read is negative. I'm sick of it all. So, here's my positive post...<P>I am a level 25 Druid. My name is Pashan Wolfbane. I live on the Bristlebane server. I love being a Druid. There is nothing a Druid ever wants or needs, because it is the perfect class. We get something from everyone. We are masters of nothing, and dabble in everything. <P>I am looking forward to level 29 when I can teleport my friends and guildies. Right now my hunting grounds are the Frontier Mountains in Kunark. I love beating up giants and I can't wait till I roll a die high enough to get the Forrest Loop I so covet =)<P>I was just sponsored in a great guild (Nature's Way) and I look forward to the invite I will receive soon. <P>Being a Druid is the most fun I have ever had. It raises the level of the game to new horizons. I am completely satisfied with my Druidic life, and hope to always be. If Verant/Sony never adds another spell, I will be content. <P>My point is that I like playing EQ and why are the rest of you SOOO unhappy? If you want the spells an Enchanter has, then be an Enchanter, If you want the spells of a Cleric, then be a Cleric. If you want spells that everyone has, then the closest you can come is to be a DRUID! So delete all your characters and make Norrath a Druid only game. Everyone will be able to...<P>1) Heal<BR>2) Teleport<BR>3) Charm<BR>4) SOW<BR>5) Have a pet (at 55)<BR>6) Quad Kite<BR>7) Harmony<BR>8) Illusion (Wolf/Treeform)<BR>9) 1hs (Scimitar type Swords only)<BR>10) Skin (Wood, Stone, Steel, Diamond, Nature)<BR>11) DOT's<BR>12) DD's<BR>13) AE's<P>WOW!! What an arsenal! Druids Rock, be happy if you are a Druid. If you aren't, make a Woodelf Druid (Halfings are good too, but they are ugly FOREVER, I like to look cool).<P>I know I'm VERY low level compared to everyone else here who has posted, but I think we forget why we started a Druid in the 1st place =). I'm sure all of you "HIGH" levels will now bash me, oh well.<P>Pashan Wolfbane<BR>Druid of 25 Seasons<BR>Bristlebane Server<P> <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

RoK evacs are stupid but we just gotta deal with it...neither skyfire or EJ have ruins so we just have to think of it as a gift to go there anyway and be glad IMO.<P>over all i love my class, why i been a druid since game came out...faster heal, higher lvl MR nuke and TP QUESTs all we need..do not change our class thx<P>Dirvon Rushwood<BR>57druid of Fennin RO<BR>TMO</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Faydedar..  fix Faydedar.<P>Yes he's spawning more often now, but still..<P>The druid epic is the only epic with a spawn that is not only rare, but is also somewhat uber (he's a joke but he takes atleast 2 groups), roams over a HUGE area, AND can depop. It needs to be limited to one of those things. No other classes have anything like that, the spawns are static or timeable if they roam. And no epic spawn is on an 18hr+ timer.<P>NOT TO MENTION that we have to RUSH ATLEAST 2 WELL BALANCED groups out there asap. This is not only hard to do, but it creates violent competition between guilds. It's just plain uncalled for. I've heard of atleast 3 events on my server where there have been Faydedar kill steals.<P>The best solution: MAKE FAYDEDAR TRIGGERED!<P>Use lets say Ulump's essence to give to some npc in Timorous so that Faydedar pops. There's NOTHING wrong with that at all! It would be refining the quest to be more like other epics, because currently Faydedar is the absolute HARDEST epic mob to dispose of because of how rare he is and how hard he is to get to. Then you turn in the 3 Kunark corrupted pieces to the gnome in Overthere, and you get your Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. That's not hard to to, for you or for me. We all know that.<P>You cannot say Faydedar is acting as intended unless you also are deliberately trying to give druids a hard time.<P>The epic quest itself is a joke. It involves no skill it all, just a bunch of time consuming green and slightly blue camps. All I'm asking is that you fix one little part that tosses it way off par with every other epic quest.<P>There is nothing wrnong with camping mobs for long amounts of time, but Faydedar is off the charts. For druids that already have their epic, congrats, you have more time on your hands than me!<P>Epics are supposed to be amazing items as well as status symbols. Currently, this status symbol means "I've got more time than you, a TON more time."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My suggestions:<BR>a. TP to Everfrost or QHills (there is a druid ring)!<BR>b. druid pet should be similar to shaman dog...actually since shamans have bear form THEY should get a little bear...and druids should get a wolfie! The pet as it is at the moment cannot be called pet. It is a DoT that does 50 damage per minute. More like a cruel joke! <BR>c. Everything that looks like an animal should be an animal.<BR>f. Firestrike as effect on an item! Shamans outclass druids in every aspect of the game...we need something to compensate. We don't have Cannibalize so give us at least something similar to the Jaundiced Bone Bracer.<BR>g. No batwings for ES boots.<BR>h. Snare is UBER aggro...how about Jolt?<BR>i. Vermiculated armor is way too heavy.<BR>j. Make Spirit of Cheetah like it was before that useless nerf. I have not used that spell ever since.<BR>k. Spirit of Scale is still useless. Make it pop when the user is casting or fighting. Do NOT make it pop on NPC nukes OR make it stack with SoW!<BR>I do not want to run around without any speed spell at all only because some stupid green mob nukes me for 5 pts.<BR>l. Give us Treantform! Lvl 55, outdoor only, lowers resist fire, gives either hps, ac or both.<BR>m. Make ES gloves ENSNARE instead of Snare.<P>Overall the druid which was one of the strongest classes in the past have gone through a transition. Nowadays a druid is not UBER in any way. In comparison to a shaman a druid looks as innocent as a baby. Wizards got better nukes and similar snare and they can evac too. This conflict cannot be solved with weak buffs. Inside a dungeon many groups preferred the armored snarer (ranger) over a druid. Verant needs to come up with something big to give us our spot back.<P>Selias Evenstar (50 twink) of Xegony<BR>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)<BR>Neric Soulstalker (57 nec Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have read through this thread, and the only problem i see with Druids is that their spell drops, I cant seem to kill for or buy the spells which i suppose to have, some spells like Blizzard, I end up buying for 10, 000 pp, and maybe give us some quests, I get pretty board with fighting and when i want to do quests, i end up doing quests for other classes, which is not much rewarding for myself, <BR>I really like the spells which are already set for druids and i have no complaints other than trying to get them, because i do want to make healers better because the clerics role would decrease and other areas would just make other classes jealous... <BR>I have to say druids are the most balaced as can get<P>lvl 54 Druid <BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm OK this is from the perspective of a level 40 druid, so I don't have any experience of the end game. But anyways....<P>My understanding of The Vision for druids is flexibility. We heal a bit, nuke a bit, buff a bit etc. This seems to work reasonably well till around level 50 (the old end game). At 40 I usually play primary or secondary healer. It's nice to have a cleric in a group but a druid/shaman will do.<P>From reading these posts and talking to people in game it seems that the new end game (50-60) requires much more specialisation. The mobs have been scaled up in power as have many of the player abilities but flexibility doesn't seem to have scaled with it. Groups have to have a cleric, have to have a tank, have to have an enchanter etc, but a druid *shrug*. Flexibility isn't a class defining characteristic that will get you into a group.<P>More group friendly spells would help. The Pack series of spells (Pack Regeneration etc) is a good start but give them longer duration for a higher mana cost. They currently only last half as long as the single target spell so it's usually more efficient to use that rather than the pack version.<P>Defining us as a class would help too.<P>A couple of posts suggested that druids should be the masters of resistance buffing. I don't know how/if this infringes on other classes but I think the idea is worth considering.<P>The animal spell lines could be used to define druids, if they were improved. I don't think this would make us any more desirable in groups, it's not like there are many "animals" out there.<P>Cheers Taeil<P>PS Quest armour please!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damn, some of these posts had me In stitches, I was laughing so hard.  You Folk want the WORLD for Druids.  Wake up, your not getting it.  There are a few tweaks that would be handy, but not essential.<P>To the person that said the Gate to bind point would end up having fear raids with one group?.  Been there, done that, its quite doeable NOW, low risk.. Next ?<P>Quad kiteing, If you believe its not insanely efficient, then your not doing it right/on the right mobs.  Lvl 49-51 took me 14 Hours (thats 2 FULL levels)  Quadkiteing in Timorous Deep. (I can here the nerf requests comming now)  It is also Extremly dangerous and very skillfull to get right and consist.  Unfortunatley, its also boring as hell.  If you would like to see the masters of Quad kiteing, Check out your Local Wizard sometime.<P>Can't get Groups ?  Then you need more practice at groups, and being efficient. As a Druid I am Lethal in groups. In a 6 man team, deep in any dungeon, a Competant Druid is almost a requirment, and I for one generally never have a problem getting a spot.  If you want to waste time sitting at the Seblis / Karnors Zoneline, then fine. <P>If you don't think your usefull in groups, then check out your Spell book for Healing, Regrowth, Pack Chloro, ENSNARE,  Evacs, Sow, and Dots adn Nukes.  Just a little FYI, we have the second best Nukes in the Game after Wizards.  Even Mages can't Out NUKE a druid, but only just.  (However lets not talk about there Insane pet, hehe)<BR> Due to the BAD name given by Solo ONLY druids, you need to educate some people as to the benifits.  <P>I have spent MANY a trip keeping a Cleric and an Enchanter alive in a Group or a Raid, while the Cleric is busy healing tanks.<P>I have been to Killings / Clearings of  Vox, Nagafen, Trakanon, Talendor, Servilious, Wushoi, Ixblat, CT, Inny, Sky, Hate, Fear, PoG, Chardock King, Queen, venril Sethir The Hole etc and Rarley if EVER is a druid not usefull in some manner at these events.<P>Lets pick Trakanon, everyones favourite Poisoned Dragon and Talendor, Naggies Big Brother.  What do I do as a Druid during these Raids.<P><BR>Pre-Raid:<BR>Getting everybodies Ass efficiently to the Destination.

</FONT><HR>I'm sure many of you have played "Classic" console RPGs.. remember the heal spells in them? usually it was some sort of fairy that would fly along and poof the character was healed. my suggestion is, instead of the 55 midget bear, the druid would summon a pixie/fairy (with a casting time similar to mage pets to prevent re-use etc and a recast time of maybe 30 minutes) with minimal (and i mean MINIMAL, e.g. 10 hitpoints, 1 point melee damage, unbuffable) combat stats. druid is on big nasty dragon raid, group tank is near death.. /pet heal, pet flies to target, poofs, and target is instantly healed 1000ish hitpoints! infringing on clerics? i think not.. druidlike? quite, if you ask me.. walk through your neighborhood EQ forest.. what do you see wandering?  fairies...<P>/shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I am a 56th Druid on Povar.  I think druids &lt;50 is perfectly balanced. There were times when it was difficult but overall an excellent balance.<P>And I will not comment on Druid healing post 50 because of changes on test. Thank you<P>However post 50 and more so 55+ druids power is very limited and our key usefullness is limited to 2 spells; Teleport and Succor.  All post 50 casters get great and powerful spells and really "hone in" on things that are class specific.  The only spell Druids have thats class specific is Succor.  I challenge the Tuning team at Verant to tell me what class specific role Druids play post 50. Our damage dealing is far less than others save Enchanters.  Im sorry I dont really have a good idea to improve this, save increasing spell damage/stick or make Druids so they can melee. (see next paragraph) <P>Another thought and a question.  Was it Verants vision to have all 50+ non-melee classes to have totally 0 melee skill on blue mobs?  It is a total waste of time for any caster of any kind to melee since they can med for a bit then cast if nothing else.  With my Heirophants Crook I could at least do something &lt;50th (melee and pray for procs hehe) I think Shamans and Druids share in my vision of at least being able to pick up a weapon and meleeing for a decent amount of damage (20-30% of what a Paladin can do?).  I suggest a low capping double attack or a self only melee buff.<P>One last *****, Natures Walker Behest is a cruel joke Verant played on us Druids. I tested the pet in Runnyeye and WITH buffs, it could not take out any of the rooms, even the smaller ones. The Only thing it could handle was zone trash.  Any chance of making it closer to a Shamans wolf, as it is right now its nothing more than a parlor trick.<P>Also I think all teleport spots are fine and evacs in Kunark is good.  Us druids can get real spoiled on having to walk a zone or 2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To make yourself into a group, u MUST have some specialty to make the leader consider u are the suitable person.<P>When u need a good buff or healing - CLERIC<BR>When u need a nuker - WIZARD<BR>When u need a reliable tank - WARRIOR<BR>When u need a crowd controller - ENCHANTER<BR>When u need a good puller - MONK<BR>When u need a can do high damage in malee - ROGUE<BR>When u need a person to do debuff - SHAMAN<BR>When u need a person to do tracking - RANGER<BR>When u need a person to summon corpse - NECRO<BR>When u need a person to give u a general assist - BARD<P>Tell me what u can think of for a druid? I can only think of 1 thing.<P>When u need a person to power level - DRUID<P>Honestly no one will pick a druid in group in later level like after lv50 if there is a choice. Why? It is b'cos Druid this class lack of a SPECIALTY! And don't forget a group can only have 6 members. I perfer every member has their own duty rather than seeing 5 members doing their job but 1 is always in standby mode.<P>1) Regen spell - Big deal when u see the mob punching your tank over 100 damage each atk in every sec and your spell is only giving 15hp regen per every 6 sec.<P>2) Damage shield - 32damage per hit back to mob is not bad but not strong enough to make me consider u are the fifth or sixth member other than the 4 complusary class : War . Clr . Enc . Monk<P>3) Snare - Necro/Ranger also has snare kind of spell. Also, many new weapon or items has this or simular effect build in. Due to this reason, Druid's Snare can be replaced.<P>I absolutly agree Druid is a well balance class only in SOLOING or in low lv grouping. Once u get to a higher lv, ALL the spells u cast can be overwrite by other class, which mean u did nothing but just mana wasting. <P>I am not trying to complain how weak is druid in group or how hard is druid to get a group cos i believe every high lv druid will understand me. ( Except for those druid who has friend always to group with ). What i trying to say here is GIVE DRUID A UNIQUE SPELL that ppl will consider druid is useful in someway but not a SUB-CLASS of a SHAMAN.<P>P.S, the  other class i didn't mention at the beginner are also treat as unwelcome class in group as well. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a druid on Luclin who just hit 32nd level.  Making a suit of crafted armor for my 23rd level warrior.<P>I'm not big enough to go on Plane or dragon raids.<BR>I've spent the last month teleporting guildmates around getting pieces for Crafted, Ro, and Etched Ivy.  I'm still wearing the set of small leather boots I bought at 7th level with money earned from selling the patchwork I got turning in Crushbone belts.<P>I've never actually been to Surefall Glade.  I solo'd twelve griffons (all but one con'd red) and three hill giants from 30th to 31st level.  I haven't been asked to join a group in the last week - and I've played at least 3 hours a day over that time.<P>I played Asheron's Call for a year and left because it was essentially a single-player game you played next to 1500 other people.  I don't want to abandon my first character because it's a single-player class.<P>First, general suggestions (ie, things that I'd like to see, that wouldn't necessarily improve class balance re:grouping):<P>1.) Non-aggro Charm?  Maybe this would be too hard to code, but how 'bout it doesn't aggro on you if it's at full health when charm breaks?  Add in some flavor text ("a_brown_bear_14 shakes off the charm and turns on you in rage at its rough treatment") and it *gasp* might actually evoke a sense of wonder ... if that's not outside the scope of the Vision.<P>2.) Quests?  Right now, mid-level druids have a series of quests at the Unkempt Preserver Ring in Rathe Mountains, where we turn in usually one or two useful-to-other-classes items to receive one not-really-useful-and-only-usable-by-us item.  Why can't druids have quests that are actually worth the time it takes to do?<P>3.) Class Armor.  As in, we don't have any.  This is a common theme, neh?  We get the restrictions of being a melee-caster like Shaman (who get decent attack ratings) and Clerics (who get decent armor ratings) but we get leather, the Scimitar, and a swift kick in the pants - the swift kick being that we look like lowbies all the way up to 46th level, and usually even a little past then.  At least give us a decent set of mid-level quest armor that's colored ... it can be green or brown leather, or even a colored mask on the "naked" skin.  Something, anything, as long as it's not hot pink or lime.<P>4.) Charm.  Dammit, if we're restricted to animals (and if spiders et al aren't animals) and I think outdoors as well, then the spell should not be worse than enchanter spells of the same level.  If a 29th level Bard can charm - and KEEP charmed - a Hill Giant, give me one good reason my 32nd level druid with 97 charisma can't touch a griffon.  Even if you don't work in no aggro, at least make it not suck.<P>Now, group-related stuff:<P>1.) Resistance-buffs.  Especially Fire and Cold, probably Magic as well.  Poison and Disease can stay more in the realm of the cleric, fine, but ... we get these spells like one or two or more spell tiers after shamans.  Why?  Shouldn't druids be immune to nature's worst effects?  Or how about a single spell to boost both?  Or group spells if we're going to get them five levels later than shaman.<P>2.) This is perhaps unbalancing ... but how about a Rune-type effect?  You know, Skin Like &lt;whatever&gt; absorbing like either the first &lt;however much&gt; amount of damage, or some small amount per each hit?  Negating 3 points of damage per attack when the mob is hitting for 60 isn't all that overpowering, and would help compensate for our overall crappy healing ability.<P>3.)  How about a low-casting-time, no-aggro spells that are self-never and/or have a self-destructive component?  A heal that dumps our health into a groupmate.  The key here is low-speed; we'd be able to get the spell off fast, at the cost of personal damage (with the low-aggro to compensate for the fact that we're now nearly dead).  Or just something-for-something spells.  A debuff that shreds our own stats as it rips up an enemy or a buff that takes from caster and dumps it onto groupmates.  Make the effect greater than spells of equivalent level, both to give an incentive to cast and to prevent the druid from casting Sacrifice Warmth to buff cold on groupmates and having the shaman cast Resist Cold on the druid to counter the cold resist loss (tying in with the resistance-buffs above).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
