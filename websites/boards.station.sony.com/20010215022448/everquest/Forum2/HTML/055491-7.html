</FONT><HR>I thought of something to balance the RACES within the Paladin classes this morning!<P>We need balance between the Paladins/Clerics within the Paladin/Cleric classes themselves. Dwarfs get the best of both worlds, High Melee stats AND High Wisdom. What is the point of playing an Erudite Paladin/Cleric when a Dwarf has the exact same WIS and better melee stats then you? That is right, there is none. <P>CHA, even though highlighted as a MAJOR statistic in character generation, means NOTHING to paladins in terms of game play. This is where the Dwarfs succeed in being uber, because the only drawback to their race is low charisma (none of them are INT casters, so INT doesn't matter, it doesn't matter to melee classes anyways).<P>I propose that the amount of healing bonus on healing spells be increased by 5% for every 10 CHA above 50 CHA, of course stacking with the already 15% bonus of clerics. ERU and HIE pay for low melee stats by receiving reasonable WIS and high CHA, yet the dwarfs come along with about the same WIS and the CHA doesn't matter. Once changed, there will be more "balance" internally between the races of the Paladin and Cleric classes. No longer will you be "stupid" or "a moron" to choose a race other than Dwarf for a paladin. This will also help Gnome Clerics out, because they have more CHA than Dwarves.<P>Realizing that Paladin's have a mana-penalty already, which limits their amount of casting, and lower level spells. This could fix the problem of paladins complaining about their heals being too *weak*, yet not changing the spell lines.<P>This would also ensure that even if Druids/Shamen have the same healing spells as a Cleric, the cleric will be the obviously better healer!<P>Also, this would make CHA a stat that people might think of increasing, instead of just going for all out WIS as a Cleric. Then even low WIS races can compete with Higher WIS races.<P>Using base stats, this would yield cumulative healing bonus of:<P>Dwarf Cleric - 15% above normal healing<BR>Dwarf Paladin - 2.5% above normal healing<P>Erudite Cleric - 25% above normal healing<BR>Erudite Paladin - 15% above normal healing<P>Gnome Cleric - 20% above normal healing<P>Half-Elf Paladin - 17.5% above normal healing<P>Halfling Cleric - 15% above normal healing<P>High-Elf Cleric - 30% above normal healing<BR>High-Elf Paladin - 20% above normal healing<P>Human Cleric - 27.5% above normal healing<BR>Human Paladin - 17.5% above normal healing<P><BR>I wish this game had more choices in it, besides which race you chose at the beginnning and what stats you chose at the beginning. Maybe a Cleric wants to be a better healer, at the expense of a large mana pool. The Cleric would Sacrifice WIS for CHA. Maybe a Paladin wants to focus more on their healing nature than their melee nature. They would focus on WIS and CHA, rather than AC/STR/STA. Why not put more measures in the game where the players can "bend" their class toward a different focal point instead of all the characters ending up the same.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Actually, I have. With ac of 1190 vs ac of 1105 the difference in my average damage taken per hit, was not statistically significant in tests I've performed."<P>Please post the tests, including your stats and what was responsible for your AC change. There's also the 'rumor' that AC has breaking points like the 75 AGI limit, such that every 100 AC means a jump in tanking power.<P>However, if you only tested  those two AC's, that's hardly what I would call thorough. Do it at AC values from 800 to 1250, in 25s or 50s against 3 or 4 mobs of set level, with your back turned for a long sample period, then we'll discuss the results =)<P>"The extra 85 AC brought only a miniscule increase in tanking ability.  But actually, even without my tests, this is a fairly well-documented fact."<P>If it were well documented, then I or many of the warriors I've discussed it with would have come across a well controlled data set. But no one has posted it in any of the threads touching on the soft cap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fear. Since paladins are hybrids of Clerics and we are inclined to always get some version of their spells, then we should get fear as well. Clerics get Undead Fear, and Alive Fear, as well as SK's get this(from their parent Necro's). Clerics get half a dozen fears, so just give us a low level fear like we get for undead. No paladin is gonne Fear/Kite because we cant, however us being able to fear would save the groups many times as well as ourselves. Since we are group oriented it really only benefits outside as with all other fears. Not making us ubber in anyway.<P>Qinlaan KindredSpirit 55 Pally Bristlebane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>1.  Raise the defensive skills.  People have stated that a Paladin is 3/4 warrior, 1/4 cleric, and I think we pretty much all agree on that.  If we raise the defensive skills (including Parry/Riposte and the like) we will be equal in defensive ability, while having less AC due to equipment.  Since it's pretty obvious we dont do much damage, this would fulfill the 3/4 warrior. (same defense and about half as much damage)<P>2.  Defensive Disc.  While LOH is stellar for big group situations, we never use it on ourselves, we use it when the cleric cant cast his Cheal quickly enough to heal the warrior.  This effectively negates the advantage we have for keeping ourselves alive.  If we had a big raid /disc to replace Holyforge, this would go a long way to making Paladins viable large raid members.<P>3.  Give us an effective heal other than LOH before Level 57 (i.e. move sup heal to 53-55)  By doing this, we can actually keep other people alive in group situations (Gheal heals about half a bub of life for quite a few warriors from what I've seen).<P>I'm sure there are more changes that could be made to balance the classes out, but I feel these are the most effective.<P>Thanks for your time,<BR>Boramaf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ditto to most of the above posts.  <P>so that leaves me only the following totally off the wall suggestions:<P>1) grant paladins the ability to gate to their temple or affiliated temples.  this is not so much for gating out during problems (gating palys in fights would develop bad reps) but more as a paly answering his/her god's summons. (travel issues)<P>2) ability of paladins to teleport themselves and their groups to the "evil" planes.  sk's would be able to teleport to "good" planes.  this is from the angle of paladins leading raids upon the "hells".  i know this would eat away at wizzies' turf..but it would provide incentive for including them on raids.<P>3) in literature, paladin mythology always speaks to their ability to resist differnt kinds of magical/evil/mental attacks.  give them a base resistance bonuses.  if you want to improve their chances for being wanted on uber-raids..make some or all of these resistances pass along to the group.  before anyone flies off the handle...the bonuses would not have to be large at all.  this would be in-line with the "defensive tank" concept.<P>4) again, paladin mythology holds that they are THE most effective at inspiring and motivating others.  some type of group spell that would not overly unbalance encounters.  (group yaulps?)<P>...and for the most outlandish idea...<P>have paladin gods, when attacked on their planes, the ability to request the aid of 6 random 55 - 60 lvl pallys. two points:<P>- palys could refuse...if they are engaged for whatever reason in something else, and<P>- the palys could not GAIN/LOSE any experience, loot, or anything from the encounter.  (they will most likely die)<P>basically, this would serve roleplay purposes..and would provide an extra burden for raids.  besides..arent some of the uberguilds complaining that hate and fear are so boring that they want to or have done them nekkid?  this would spice up ANY plane raid since it would introduce some very interesting variables.  sk's might be able to answer their god's call too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why have to hit LoH before you die?  if you have LoH up, and you reach 0 hp LoH should auto cast on you or the target of your choice when they reach 0 hp's.- without any ress effects. (as in Legend of Zelda, link holding a faerie in a bottle)<P>4. Why is dropped armor better than quested armor?  if you are questing armor from your diety, that armor should be the strongest, most powerful armor attainable, or close to other than dragon drops that have accompanied Veeshan etc. etc.<P>Offense to follow in a seperate post.<P><BR>Makiza Cocheta<BR>55 Knight<BR>Follower or Mithaniel Marr<BR>Avatars of Discord<BR>Rodcet Nife Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
