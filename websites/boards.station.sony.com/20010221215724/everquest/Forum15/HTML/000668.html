</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Rangers:<P><BR>ITEM:  Defense Skill Cap.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems fair to move the ranger defense skill cap up to match the knights' offense skill cap.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Dodge and Riposte Skill Caps.<P>DESCRIPTION:  If it seems that rangers still need a bit more defense at the upper levels, raising the Dodge skill cap would seem the most logical way to give them better damage avoidance.  If we want to give them more offense and more defense, then raising the Riposte cap would make sense.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Archery.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The concern is that this combat skill is not effective enough, primarily because of what seems like a bug.  Archery seems to have a lot trouble with z-axis issues that cause the ranger to miss far more often than he probably should.  Also, why not push the ranger skill cap on archery up some, actually allowing them to be better than warriors at firing their bows?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tracking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Obviously people are anxious to get the changes that have been suggested, like scrolling and sorting.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Trueshot Discipline.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers are of the impression that this discipline is not tuned up properly yet.  They would like to see it do more damage and/or hit more often.  The problem with targeting here might be closely related to the situation when this discipline is used, combats where a lot of characters are trying to take swings at one enemy, not leaving any lines of sight for the ranger.  Perhaps this discipline could allow this ranger to ignore the normal issues with intervening PCs and NPCs.  Also, the discipline could be tweaked up a bit just by giving it some sort of minimum damage, perhaps a portion of the base damage of the bow used.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  More Hit Points.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers would like more hit points.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Jolt.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players would like to see this spell lowered in level (49th perhaps) and have another, more effective version added in its old spot.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spell Stacking Issues.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Strength of Nature (51) and Call of Earth (50) are the primary concerns here.  Strength of Nature does not stack with Divine Strength.  Call of Earth does not stack with the enchanter Augment line, Speed of the Shissar, Coldain Shield of the Eight or with the monk epic effect (I think it overwrites them, which seems like the right way to do this).  This may very well be intentional.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Casting on Lower Level Characters.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that some of the hybrid spells can't be cast on lower level characters because they are post 50th level spells for the hybrid.  But these spells are actually lower level spells for their parent class, and the parent class can cast them on lower level characters.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Thorny Vine Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers would like to see these drop more frequently.  The problem does not so much seem to be with the rate at which the mobs actually drop the armor, but the (in)frequency of the mobs themselves.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  See Invisible.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers can cast Camouflage, but they can not cast any version of See Invisible.  Not being able to cast some sort of See Invisible makes Camouflage a somewhat less useful group spell, since the party can't see each other.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Kylong Breastplate.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This sure seems like an item that might have been intended to be worn by rangers, as it is usable by all the other hybrids, as well as warriors and clerics.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Hide and Sneak.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers would probably appreciate an increase in the caps for these two skills.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Raincaller.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This bow has the same base damage and delay as the Trueshot that it replaces.  Though it is better in all other ways, perhaps a slightly better amount of damage would be in order.  They would also like to see a way to recharge the bow that did not require doing the quest over to get a new one.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  DoTs.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Lower level DoTs will prevent a higher level DoT of the same line from sticking.  Perhaps the higher level DoT should just overwrite the lower level ones.  This would affect a lot more classes than rangers.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Forage.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Oddly enough, having a higher skill in forage is not necessarily a good thing.  With a high skill, the forager tends to get a lot of interesting items, but rarely food or water.  It might be nice if there was some way to allow a ranger to lower his forage skill when he's looking for more mundane items, like sustenance.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<P>---<P>ITEM:  Jagedpine Cloak Quest.<P>DESCRIPTION:  At the end of this quest, it is hinted that there might be more of it later.  It would be nice to implement the rest of this quest.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A quick comment on the Sall of Earth stacking issue. My major concern is not that it overwrites other spells. The worst part is that the person who recieves the spell can not cancel it, like the invisible spell line. And they have no way to cancel it. Because of this, I normally dont cast it on people, because they are stuck with it for an hour or so.<P>Thanks.<BR> Youngaspen Phoenixheart<BR> Pathfinder of Tunare, in Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A pretty good list. I won't comment on 50+ stuff other than say it looks like a reasonable solution to consider the hp and defense issues, and I'm all for dodge and riposte raises if they help (the dodge and parry increases last time around didn't help significantly at all, according to parses) as I don't have first hand experience.<P>The tracking changes on Test look great, and work well. One thing I'd like to see addressed is the ability to close the tracking window (effectively hitting cancel) with your track button/hotkey (currently you can't, there's no keyboard shortcut to close it without detargeting).<P>I hope the archery fixes about z-axis issues helps, and I wouldn't mind seeing some damage increase, say a minimum damage of 2*arrow damage.<P>As for forage, as you consider high-level foraging, a command to attempt to selectively forage (ie, /forage water, /forage food, /forage random) that would increase the percentage you foraged the selected type would be greatly appreciated.<P>Finally, the item I am most disappointed with is the placement of See Invisibility. Currently, this is on test at level 39. That's still 24 levels of Camoflage being of limited use to a group. I appreciate the addition of the spell to begin with, and won't sweat it if it isn't moved down, because I hope to soon reach 39, but I speak out of principle. Even Shadow Knights get a see invisible spell at 22, and they can't even cast invis on others, why can't rangers have one at 30?<P>Again, Thanks for your time.<P>Wylias Silvershade<BR>Ranger of Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why is the stacking issue even up there?  Do some reseach please.  The reason Call of Earth doesn't stack with the augment line is because the augment line adds AC + haste.  This seems to be as intended because Verant would not want people to be able to get 50+ extra ac from two spells.  Its the AC that makes the difference since Quickness line spells stack just fine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1a) Raise the Parry cap for Paladins to 200 (Defence)<BR>1b) Raise the Riposte cap for Shadowknights to 200 (Defence with a cruel edge)<BR>1c) Raise the Dodge cap for Rangers to 200 (For god's sake, they're wearing lighter armour!)<BR>1d) Raise the Parry and Ripost caps for Warriors to 225 and the Dodge cap to 200. (I agree, they should be better at tanking.)<P><BR>2) All weapons should have a minimum damage level, and not just two handed weapons. Minimum damage for a weapon is skill-100%. Thus, a Level 20 with maxed skills (105) has a minimum damage of 5% of the output of the weapon. So, if he had some weapon with an insane damage of 40, his minimum damage would be 2. However, at level 30 with maxed skills (155) he has a minimum damage of 55%. With that same weapon, his minimum strike is 22. At level 40 the minimum becomes 105% and so on.<P>This again leaves Warriors as the champs in the high-end game with a maxed out minimum of 150%, while Rangers stay close with a minimum of 140% and SK's and Pallys lag behind at 125%.<P>(This idea may or may not be applied to Bards & Rogues, but should be applied to Monks. I just never bothered to look up Monk skill progression.)<P><BR>3) Give Paladins and Shadowknights crits against Undead starting at level 14. (I believe that's when Warriors start getting them.) If that's too powerful, considering the number of lower-level undead, make it start at level 25.<P><BR>4) Allow all Melee classes to have the Block skill, but only allow it to work/improve when the person is using a shield. With this, the Parry/Riposte improvements for the Paladins/Shadowknights become less required.<P><BR>5) Allow Epic weapon effects to stack with ALL spells. No spell should over-write an Epic effect and vice-versa. (Monks will love this one!)<P><BR>6) While the effect of having low stats is obvious, (Just watch what happens to your AC when your Agl goes below 75) the effect of having high stats is difficult to see at best. The damage output of a Warrior with 250 Str should be OBVIOUSLY higher than the same Warrior with only 150 Str.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that the core issues of ranger have been listed, however, there is one issue that was left out that does concern me.  <P>This issue is the clickable effects on the Tolan's armor.  I have just finished some research, looking at the ac (yeah I know the war, pal, and sk will have higher ac than us, but the ranger and rogue armor having the same ac as shaman armor seems a little wacky to me) and the clickable effects of all the armors.  I'm not sure if I should post my summary results, but i can if anyone, especially Absor, would like to see them.<P>Comes down to the fact that some of the classes have right clickable effects that are very useful and or high levels spells.  Other classes have essentially useless and/or very low level spell right clickable effects.  Rangers and druids for example, get a right clickable effect on their hand piece of snare, a level 9 and 1 spell respectively.  Something like ensare or ensnaring roots might seem more appropriate.  Ring of faydark sounds fun and summon arrows will be divine.  Lets not talk about superior camo, not getting the spell to 49 in the first place seems ridiculous to me.  Stinging swarm, invigor, and cancel magic all seem pretty useless at the level the armor is obtained or can be used (level 45 I have been told).<P>But when looking at the other classes's armor, most of the effects are pretty lame too.  It seems that each set has one or maybe two pieces where the effect will be used.  Perhaps the team could look at these effects for all the classes again, not just rangers.  But since I am a ranger, look at us first =)<P>Lastly, a few of the stat bonuses are wacky, namely the rogue greeves add mana.  Maybe I am missing something, but I didn't think rogues used mana at all.<P>This is all based on information I got from allakhazam's, eq-lizer, everlore, and the Prima strategy guide.  Hopefully, it was correct and I didn't present things innaccuratly.<P>Thanks for taking the time to listen to and hopefully solve these issues for all the classes Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

At least a min damage enhancemenet should go in for all rangers, and why not double attack? It is our class symbol after all and would give us a more distinctive, tactically flexible role as damage dealers who can't just wade in and tank with impunity...<P>Ranger archery in general, not just Trueshot archery, cropped up time and time again in the Ranger talk - please make the team aware of this at least.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hooray, all the changes are for post 40 levels (and mostly post 50 )pretty much except for the forage boost (tentative, and who cares i buy rations)and the improvements (maybe) to archery and track. Great, all of the real advancements went to the post 50 Rangers.<P> Those are skill CAPS folks, you wont see those numbers til end of game, so 2/3 's of Rangers if not 5/ 6th's of us just got a big old NADA.<P> It is heartwarming to see that the crying and whining by the post 50's as well as their repeated statements / posts that no one under level 50 had any business commenting on Ranger issues has paid off for them so well.<P> Well congratulations, you convinced Verant and apparently in so doing left the other 40 to 49<BR>levels of us out in the yard with nothing.<P>  well at least maybe i can use the improved archery but it seems to revolve around Trueshot so i am a lot of levels from that. Guess i am supposed to amuse myself with foraging grubs in an improved manner for 26 more levels. <P>         Helz yeah that sounds fair-<P> stacking level 50+ spells ,Trueshot for level 50+, increased skill caps for END GAME players, etc, etc.,that old Jolt spell issue, and meanwhile the overwhelming majority of Rangers who just so happen to be UNDER level 50 got zippo.<BR>           wahoo i am thrilled -<P> or is it going to be that Rangers defense skills will match knights at every level from 1 to end game? That would be the ONLY ray of light for the<BR>"rest of us" out here. <P> I doubt it, sounds like it is directed only at "end game" cap levels to me. So basically, <BR>in "low level" Ranger terminology, "we're screwed".<P>   ok, i take back what i said about Firefist, can we pretty please have it at 22, if it won't  upset the post 50's too much ? <P>                   Naz<P>                </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are 3 items I would like to be added to the list and I'll try to represent my idea as best as possible.  I'm going to explain the items in least concerned to most concerned order.<P>The first enchancement I would like to be considered, is the addition of a higher level agility buff.  Basically a(or two) upgrade(s) to feet like cat. This is a popular ranger spell, as its one of the only early spells that rangers do not share with druids, allowing rangers to cast it on themselves and their groupmembers making them more effective and feeling they're contributing to their group by being able to cast a spell that isn't immediately going to be overriden by a druid.  In fact even with shamans in group its usually more than common practice to cast it on group members to alleviate the shaman of burdensome buffing and focusing more on other areas.<P>Rangers have gradually worked their way up by getting more potent strength buffs, I really don't see any reason why the same could be done for their agility buff.<P>Secondly I would like for the tuning team to take another look at the spell call of fire. <P>This spell does indeed have great potential due to the nature of the resistance check.  It is currently a lure type fire direct damage proc that also stuns the target.  Now this may sound like a great idea but the stun actually creates a big problem for the spell.  Tho the DD component is nice (I believe it was 75dd) and since its so rarely resisted, it becomes a great tool for rangers to up their damage, especially on big encounters where the mobs AC is so incredibly high that the proc significantly helps deal out more damage.<P>However this is a level 55 spell, and tho the stun component added to this proc may sound beneficial, it does nothing more than create more attention for the ranger.  The problem is that about 90%(if not 100%) of the 55+ mobs are completely unaffected by stun spells.  The spells do indeed stick on them but they continue fighting/running/or gating.  I'm not completely sure if only giant flagged type mobs are unaffected by it or if its anything over level 55, but there certainly are more mobs immune to stun than affected by it in the high end game, and it is in my opinion that this level 55 spell was indeed designed for the high end game(due to level received), and to further enchance a rangers damage in it.<P>By removing the stun component, several rangers if not all, would joyfully start buffing up with the spell in high end encounters without fear of becoming cannon fodder for trying to stun an unstunnable mob.  Perhaps since the spell was created with the stun thought of as beneficial, increasing the DD component slightly would not sound unreasonable if the stun is indeed fond needed for removal.  More of a fair trade, but it is removing the stun that would make most rangers use it in the first place.<P>Thirdly, and I have been saying this for several months on the boards, with no luck in response: I think it is time to increase the amount of available buff slots available to us.  <P>I know this is more of a massive/general change, but I think rangers are the ones most affected by the "please dont use xxx buff on me I am low on room" syndrome.<P>We are currently limited to 15 buff slots, this includes negative/debuffs cast on by other mobs.<P>Now rangers will always cast their coat type buffs.  Any extra AC we will take considering our current stage. So we are now left with 14.  The most common hp/ac buffs on high end encounters are heroism, bulkward of faith, symbol of marzin, kragg, stamina, and divine strength.<P>We are now down to 8 buff slots available. With just essential hp/ac buffs.<P>Now most people would gladly take strength, agility, maybe even dexterity at this point.  But lets cover resists first.<P>Lets assume we're raiding Zlandicar.  This guy casts 2 types of disease AE's, AE fear, and a DD/stun proc which I can't recall if has a buff icon or not.<P>So we cast disease and magic resst. We are now down to 6 buff slots. But wait, we also have to take in consideration debuffs and harmful spells that use buff icons, such as his fear and disease dots.  Since I can't remember if his proc uses a buff slot I'm going to be generous and pretend it doesn't.  So we would need to leave 3 buff slots open, otherwise the harmful AE's would override our first few buffs.<P>We are now down to 3 buff spots and we have only covered hp/ac/resists.<P>Most people would argue speed is one of the most important buffs in raids.  At this point many people start shouting for strength, dex, call of predator, strength of nature, call of earth. And priests and casters, and sometimes hybrids, are in need of clarity and other type of mana regeneration spells.<P>Absor could you imagine adding a bard to your group at this point?  If he were to twist 3 songs not only would you not have room for stat type spells, or speed, but it could also fill up your buff slots causing the dot's and fear to override your first few buffs.  God help you if you had symbol, hero, kragg as first buffs.  Or resists for that matter.<P>I also left out the part where people accidentally hit you with a wrong buff.  Trust me it happens.  You're just about buffed up and a shaman accidentally hits you with charisma buff, an enchanter unaware, or forgetfully casts his group clarity type spells and you are full on buffs and start sweating bullets.<P>Now I know many will say. "But you can just use Aegolism and Focus".  Well I sometimes have the privilege to have those buffs cast on me, and let me tell you, while it does help, I don't consider it enough(and find it unfair to those who dont have access to those buffs).  Especially if verant intended rangers to use their new spells such as strength of nature, call of earth/predator/sky/fire.<P>Let me give you the Zlandicar raid scenario with those more privileged buffs.<P>Aegolism, focus, resist magic, resist disease, stamina, divine strength, zlandicar disease dot1, zlandicar disease dot2, zlandicar fear, coat spell, quickness type spell.<P>11 buffs.  Now we have 4 free buff slots for the more spice type spells such as the call series, agility, clarity type spells, and grim aura, some people like to use rune(wich in some cases is extremely important), and others like deathpact type spells.<P>More importantly we are in need of another buff slot for regen or for regen type heals such as celestial elixir or torpor.  And of course the obligatory "oops sorry I didnt mean to give you that buff" incident where at that point our hair turns grey.<P>Oh and bards  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Geeze now we really run into trouble.  We are supposed to benefit from having a bard in the group, but in this case if the bard twists 3-4 songs we get into a hazardous area where the mobs AE's will override our beneficial buffs and just make us ineffective.<P>I believe its very unreasonable to order a bard to not sing songs due to being limited with buff space.<P>There are several soutions to this problem and I trust verant would find a suitable solution if you decide to add this to the list or mention it to the tuning team.<P>Some ideas would be to have seperate buff window for harmful type buffs/debuffs from mobs AE.  <P>A separate buff window for just bard songs, in conjunction with the 15 slot window for normal buffs.  This would allow people to work around their 15 buff space without panicing when a bard is added to the group.<P>Or merely simply increasing the overall space.<P>Thanks for listening and I hope you consider these requests.<P>Caylen Tor , level 60 ranger from Lanys server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

NEITHER of those wear plate, and monks wear silk for pete's sake.<P>By now putting ALL the other meleers at 250-252, NOT putting ranger's there as well is a continuance of the penalty against them.<P>Whereas SKS and Paladins may shout, they seem to forget one critical fact, they can wear PLATE armor which gives them a substantial ac boost over rangers.  The dual wield was a trade off for plate, NOT for inherent defense.<P>People are truly deluding themselves if they think the foregoing changes will improve the plight of the ranger post 50.

Check the druids/Necros/SKs...they kite...we pretend.<P>3.&gt; Guess 14 lvl druids can run better than runners...can anyone explain to me why we get SoW  so darn late?  And if you say balance...I will laugh at you...maybe this spell should not have come to druids and shamans so early then.  Seems like 22 would be a great time to get a self only SoW...is that really crazy to ask for?  <P>4.&gt; replace glimpse...I am sorry, but with so few spells to choose from, a useless one sticks out like a sore thumb.<P>5.&gt; guess no wolf pet eh...<P>6.&gt; And if we can't get a self-only SoW or something, at least lower our heal spell list...good grief...my finger gets sore after a heavy battle.

</FONT><HR>ooo, ooo, better yet.  Remove the charges of Firestrike from the Raincaller and keep the stats as is, and find a way to make it proc Firestrike. With the amount that archery is used, you might be able to get it to proc once and hour or so.  I don't think this would be overpowering.  It'd have be tested though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You can use it to train divination because of the low mana cost.<P>Please make Raincaller just proc.  I remember reading that someone there said you guys figured out how to make bows proc.<P>And please do something about our lack of decent wisdom items.  I thought I read something in one of the ranger threads about retroactively adding +wis to some of our quest items.  I keep looking at my ranger only Short Sword of Morin and can't help but think how awesome even a +3 wisdom would be on that sword.  6/22 +3 str, +3 agi, +3 wis.

</FONT><HR>  If you really want to fix archery and not just put a bandaide on it the the damage needs to be raised to match melee damage and as for kiting well I know this is a fantasy game but has anyone ever tried to fire a bow while running away from something you would most likely hurt yourself and not what you were firing at so just give a large minus to the chance to hit while on the go with a bow another thing I read on the ranger thread I liked was being able to put a quiver in the ammo slot but take it one step further and change it so that only arrows in the quiver would be used and any arrows in your general inventory would not automaticly jump into the ammo slot but could be dragged with the mouse and put into the quiver that would be in the ammo slot to refill it thats about all I have to say about all of this balance stuff other then it is true we are RANGEr's but we have no reason to use ranged weapons because melee weapons do so much more damage so much faster then missle weapons so until archery is truely fixed we will all be wanna be tanks and in about 4-6 months we will be talking again about class balance oh well I'll be saying the same thing then too until the next time good luck and good hunting</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lots of missing stuff here.  Where'd the other stuff go?<P>The conversation was rife with gate/bind/port, etc issues.<P>What about not wanting disarm any longer?  It is a total waste.<P>I didn't recall seeing any comments regarding HP increases.  This is imperative that these be increased.  We shouldn't be a caster level defense and HP (self buffed).<P>What about the AC additions to the TV armor?  Why is it that many of us have spent a couple of years playing this game and we still don't have a complete set of armor?<P>What about the way VS is being camped 24/7 so that those that should be able to do the quest can't.  It isn't an issue with our inability to compete with the other guilds, it is due simply to the fact that they are typically on line when the servers come up and the fact that it is a 7 day spawn.<P>How about the swapping of the epics into either hand?  The proc rate causes agro and we'd like to be able to switch it to the other hand so it doesn't agro.  Since when does the cleric or enchanter or monk epic cause such a problem for them?  Why should the ranger epic cause a problem that will limit the use of it?<P>I know there is more, but those were the immediate ones I noticed were missing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now as i am only a newly 20 rngr i will not comment on anything that does not concern me yet. <P>Archery:<P>one of the reasons i chose a ranger as my first char was that verant states that the class is master of archery. it seems ridiculous to me that this is a post 50 mastery for if i would have known that i would have to play for six months to a year to be a true ranger i would not have purchased this game.<P>Solution: increse archery damage for rangers and only rangers. if druids are the ones in tune with nature would it not make sense to give us the market on archery throughout our careers?<P>Speed of wolf:<P>Explain to me why we get sow at lvl 39. if we are 1/4 druid would it not make sense to give us sow toward the end of our twenties rather than 25 lvl later at 39 which is more than 1/4 of our career even compared to druids?? <P>Ac and HP:<BR> as i am only lvl 20 i am just really starting to see a difference in the ac and hp beteween warriors and rangers and skinlike wood does not cut it when being swarmed from all sides. It just makes no sense to me that we should fall so far behind warriors in hp and ac when we are 3/4s war.<P>Solution: the only two solutions i can think of would be either giving us more ac and hp at earlier lvls or moving skin like rock down to lvl 15. now i know there is no simple solution to this for it would step in some druid toes so no flames this is just my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also...  many of us still believe the mana cost for Jolt is still too high.  Especially if it's as resistable as it currently is, and must be cast multiple times per fight many times.<P>Just two casts of Jolt and it costs almost as much as one Call of Flames.  Why bother casting offensive spells at all if you know the mana cost of the spell is going to be doubled because you're going to have to Jolt like crazy afterwards?<P>I know this doesn't happen in all situations, but it DOES happen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is some addressing of lv 50+ issues, but it would be good to keep in mind that only a handful of rangers are that level or higher, and that the majority are probably mid lv characters. I'm also dissapointed that there was no mention whatsoever of the numerous bind/gate posts that were made during the ranger discussions. In any case, it's good to see that something IS being done, even though the improvements are limited, at best, to benefiting characters lv 50-60.<P>Be safe all!<P>Kealin Starflower<BR>Ranger of the 32nd season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
