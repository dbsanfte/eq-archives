</FONT><HR>Ok, first of all, we all mages want the Shard of the cord to be Tradable, and could go in the AMMO slot, not range like the first post said, it can already be equipped on the tange slot.  DoTs for mages are useless in Velious, we already have a nuke that does the same amount of damage using less mana, what logic does that have? The other issues are already disscussed on other posts and i agree with the majority of them all, so i'll take my leave now. :P </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Add mana regen to our phantom armor series at the 44 or 52 level.  5hp a tick bonus at 52 would be good.<P>- Or increase the overall mana regeneration rate for all casters post 50, I dont like sitting on my ass for 15 minutes to get my mana if no enchanter or bard around.  Also I dont want to always depend on a bard or enchanter for my mana.<P>-Fix conjuration armor.<BR>-Up post 50 pet power, WE are the pet class, our pets should be stronger and do more damage than any other pet.  Also I think at least 1/2 of our pets should be able to kill a good rogue/ranger/monk/paladin/sk (at least the water and fire pets should) in a one on one duel or be very close.  The downside is the pet's stupidity off course.  I'm pretty sure its always been close to this especially 34-49, but post 50 our pets aren't pumped up enough.<P>-Lower post 50 Velious/Dragon resists or improve our dd's so we can cast them.<P>-Malise/Malosi lines have high resists on anything non avg.<P>- Do a full re-evaluation of our summon spells.  Change most of our 2hb to 1hb staffs.  Make the dmg/delay much better the higher we go.  New mod rod needed, higher hp/mana conversion per pop, better ratio or more charges.  Also new mod rod should have better dmg/delay.<P>- Stop giving our summons to other classes, nothing besides Food, Water, or Bandages should be given to any other class.  And certainly not more than 1 item summoned per cast.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I loved my Mage from 1-50<P>I enjoyed my Mage during 51<P>I played my Mage through 52 and 53<P>I started my enchanter as my Magician wallowed in 54 the level where soloing became impractical (extremely boring)and Magician's are seen as a liability (right or wrong) in so many situations  due to pathing, pet control, pets warping through walls and training the entire dungeon, etc. that getting in a pick-up group is tough in the best zones.<P>Side note - NEVER get a pet out in King Tranix's room. There is a bug on the throne that warps pet's through the wall and drops him off in the middle of the BnB area causing a massive train.  So the one part of the Naggy raid where pets might be helpful (fighting the Fire Giants), pets are prohibited by intelligent group leaders because they can cause trains that will kill THE ENTIRE RAID PARTY!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"> <P>Unfortunately "class talk" doesn't seem to have addressed many of the real post-50 concerns (as listed above in numerous posts). Guess I will keep playing my baby enchanter and hope that some day the post-50 magician class will really be analyzed and I can blow the dust of my favorite character. <P>I LOVED the class from 1-50 and always argued on these boards with post-50 Mages.  They always said, "You just don't understand. Wait till you get post-50."  <P>Now I am post-50.<P>And I understand.<P>Wish you did also Alan. <P><BR>Akhbar Ali<BR>Elementalist of the 54th Gate &lt;semi-retired&gt;<BR>Brell Serelis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's very hard not to feel insulted by your post Absor. You rehashed your earlier comments, which only covered the most obtuse and trivial matters facing magicians in the game. <BR>It's very hard not to feel insulted by your post Absor. You rehashed your earlier comments, which only covered the most obtuse and trivial matters facing magicians in the game. <P>Truly major issues are escape spells, damage dealing in general vs. melees, and pet control.  <P>None of us really care what our pets look like, or if we can name our pet "Bob's Pet".  They could be black polyhedrons that delt damage and we would still find them just as "cool" and troublesome to use.<P>None of the balance "Fix" spells on test truly resolved any magician issues.  Nor did you mention them in your post, unlike all of the hybrid concerns posts.<P>Discussion of Test server spells.<BR>--------------------------------------------<BR>"Summon Companion" only allows you to avoid bad pathing instead retrieving run away pets.<P>We can already avoid bad pathing areas.  We don't summon pets, until we get to where we need to go.  This spells casting time and no pet agro restrictions ensure that all it can be used for is to avoid bad pathing.<P>"Expedience" adds only 20% foot speed increase and does not increase in speed boost as the magician levels (i.e. it has no improvement formula). So, compare this to jboots 35% foot speed boost and you immediately see a problem with pets being able to keep up with their masters.<P>Placing "Valliant Companion" at 59 makes no sense what so ever.  If you haven't noticed melees get the "fearless" discipline at 40th.  The need for this spell occurs so much sooner than the solution that it is laughable at how late it comes.  And there are many necromancer and shadow knight NPCs with in the game that have just as detrimental effects on pets with fear as dragons.<P>Problems with current spells<BR>--------------------------------<BR>The major deficiency with Rage of Zomm is not that it doesn't look like a big eyeball it's that it has a 2 minute recast time.  So from a standpoint of how long this pet lasts in a fight with it's 100 hps, it's more of a novelty that a useful damage spell given how long it takes before you can cast another one. (not addressed)<P>The problem with the vocerate fire pets is that magician's measure pet power like DoT's and over the same time period the 52,58 pet does 30-40% less damage than the 49th version.  Ergo less powerful. (not addressed properly)<P>Dyzil Deafening Decoy cast too slowly to take any heat off the magician or her allies (addressed).  And the pets AE spell actually lowers the pet pet's agro rating bellow the magician, which means every last thing that the pet damages comes after the magician rather than the pet. (not addressed)<P>And the Decoy's very low level and low defense skills in comparison to other pets that the magician has available at 56th ensures that the Decoy gets destroyed at such a fast rate that it can't decoy anything.  This pet should be renamed "Agro everything on the magician then die."  (also not addressed)<P>Decoy, needs some truly superior defense skills if it's going to fend off attackers for any period of time.<P>Items Summonings<BR>------------------------------<BR>Summons need to be fixed to fit within our current server economy.  Making summoned staves 1hb will not in any way resolve the fact that our summons serve no useful purpose in the game currently.<P>People like to point to Mod Rods as being a good summons.  I will argue this point,  as Baelish did on Casters Realm.  The main use for these rods is to reduce down time for the Cleric.  They are a mana transfer mechanism not a form of stored mana.  Their use however lowers your party mana pool by costing mana to heal the cleric and the magician to summon the rod.  So in the long run you bought yourself more down time than you saved.<P>Spell Drop Rates<BR>------------------<BR>Drop rates of 54+ spells in general are very poor.  The only place with reasonable drop rates for 55+ spells is Reet froglocks and Selebite Juggernauts in Selebis.  You would think there would be more better places to get these spells but no there are not.<P>And by reasonable I mean one or two spells an evening as oppose to 1 or 2 a week everywhere else.  And since magician spells in general are set as rare drops off the spell table, good luck finding them.  All spells of a given level should have equal commonality on the table.  As it stands you have dozens of some spells for single instances of others.<P>Caster vs. Melee damage<BR>---------------------------<BR>Ok on further examination.  I have this to say.<P>Magicians and Wizards are good when mob lifespan is very short less than 20-30 sec.  Situations where this happens are in raids where targets can be delt with in seconds using a large mass of characters.  Experience for going to raids however is non-existent for groups with nukers.  <P>After the recent expansion of the hate list.  Each HP of damage done in melee counts for more hate that each point done in spell casting.  And who gets experience is base on hate list calculations.<P>So we go back to the day-to-day grind portion of the game with one group doing it all, this is where you make your experience.  The nukers fall apart here.  It takes 60-120 sec to kill a mob and if the nuker tries to deal the same damage as the tanks in this scenario they quickly run out of mana trying to do the sustained damage of a melee.<P>To the point where any dual wielding melee over an evening does 30% more damage than a magician plus pet or wizard.<P>Pet control<BR>------------------------<BR>Absor you once stated pets were/are very powerful.  <P>From a damage per mana spent standpoint I agree.  <P>As a spell tool for doing damage in dungeons where 90% of your character's "life" occurs pets are a random element that is hard to use.  And pets do not play well with the only acceptable type of crowd control at higher levels, Enchanters.  Even if the enchanter does not mesmerize a single target you need them for the most efficient group possible due to clarity and haste.<P>Necromancers pets don’t normally don't have this issue because then can screaming terror NPCs and get their pets away from an undesired fight.<P>Magicians however have no such option. So, are left with hoping your "/pet back off" command coincides with the Enchanter casting Mes or Stun.<P>At the highest levels of play, pets need to behave in very predictable ways; the margin for error is the razors edge.  And that is the problem with using pets at the highest levels.<P>You can mitigate the problems with using pets but you can't eliminate them even with the best play possible.  So until the pet is as controllable as the tank behind a computer there will always be some leery skepticism of using pets at all in high-level situations.  <P>And while some people would like to say you just need to educate people on playing with pets.  Why bother when you can get a more damaging tank to step up for the same job as a damage dealer/absorber and avoid those issues entirely.<P>Truly major issues are escape spells, damage dealing in general vs. melees, and pet control.  <P>None of us really care what our pets look like, or if we can name our pet "Bob's Pet".  They could be black polyhedrons that delt damage and we would still find them just as "cool" and troublesome to use.<P>None of the balance "Fix" spells on test truly resolved any magician issues.

You would think there would be more better places to get these spells but no there are not.<P>And by reasonable I mean one or two spells an evening as oppose to 1 or 2 a week everywhere else.  And since magician spells in general are set as rare drops off the spell table, good luck finding them.  All spells of a given level should have equal cominality on the table.  As it stands you dozens of some spells for single instances of others.<P>Caster vs Melee damage<BR>---------------------------<BR>Ok on further examination.  I have this to say.<P>Magicians and Wizards are good when mob lifespan is very short less than 20-30 sec.  Situations where this happens are in raids where targets can be delt with in seconds using a large mass of characters.  Experience for going to raids however is non existant for groups with nukers.  <P>After the recent expansion of the hate list.  Each HP of damage done in melee counts for more hate that each point done in spell casting.  And who get's experience is base on some hate list calcuations.<P>So we go back to the day to day grind portion of the game with one group doing it all, this is where you make your experience.  The nukers fall apart here.  It takes 60-120 sec to kill a mob and if the nuker tries to deal the same damage as the tanks in this scenario they quickly run out of mana trying to do the sustained damage of a melee.<P>To the point where any dual weilding melee over an evening does 30% more damage than a magician+pet or wizard.<P>Pet control<BR>------------------------<BR>Absor you once stated pets were/are very powerful.  From a damage per mana spent stand point I agree.  <P>As a spell in dungeons where 90% of your character's "life" occures pets are a random element that is hard to use.  And pets do not play well with the only type of crowd control that is viable at higher levels, Enchanters.  <P>Necromancers nomally don't have this issue because then can screaming terror NPCs and get their pets away from an undesired fight.<P>Magicians however have no such opption. So, are left with hoping our "back off" command coninsides with the Enchanter casting Mes or Stun.<P>At the highest levels of play, pets need to behave in very predictable ways, the margin for error is the razors edge.  And that is the problem with using pets at the highest levels.<P>You can midigate the problems with using pets but you can't elimiate them even with the best play possible.  So until the pet is as controlable as the tank behind a computer there will allways be some leary scheptisim of using pets at all in high level situations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Even if all of these issues are addressed the mage class is still broken, until something is seriously done to increase their soloability they are a dead class with absolutely no reason to play. Every class has a purpose but the mage class and its a shame one of the most powerful best soloers has fallen back about 8 ranks as the rest of the classes advanced, mages were left in the dust. Don't fix the current item,spell,ertc. problems, fix the class as a whole...<P>Everytime I see a statement from anyone at Verant about mages you see how little they know/play about the class, saying they aren't broken and well balanced just shows that fact. We also got promised a lot of things that never happen: no rent items still disappear and this was brought up over 6 months ago, after sword of runes nerf it was mentioned we'd get other summonds to compensate for it and that is now on the back burner as well...sigh...<P>Any mage that plays their character into their 50s will almost no doubtedly tell you not to play a mage...dunno any other class that seems to have this problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's very hard not to feel insulted by your post Absor. You rehashed your earlier comments, which only covered the most obtuse and trivial matters facing magicians in the game. <P>Truly major issues are escape spells, damage dealing in general vs. melees, and pet control.  <P>None of us really care what our pets look like, or if we can name our pet "Bob's Pet".  They could be black polyhedrons that delt damage and we would still find them just as "cool" and troublesome to use.<P>None of the balance "Fix" spells on test truly resolved any magician issues.  Nor did you mention them in your post, unlike all of the hybrid concerns posts.<P>Discussion of Test server spells.<BR>--------------------------------------------<BR>"Summon Companion" only allows you to avoid bad pathing instead retrieving run away pets.<P>We can already avoid bad pathing areas.  We don't summon pets, until we get to where we need to go.  This spells casting time and no pet agro restrictions ensure that all it can be used for is to avoid bad pathing.<P>"Expedience" adds only 20% foot speed increase and does not increase in speed boost as the magician levels (i.e. it has no improvement formula). So, compare this to jboots 35% foot speed boost and you immediately see a problem with pets being able to keep up with their masters.<P>Placing "Valliant Companion" at 59 makes no sense what so ever.  If you haven't noticed melees get the "fearless" discipline at 40th.  The need for this spell occurs so much sooner than the solution that it is laughable at how late it comes.  And there are many necromancer and shadow knight NPCs with in the game that have just as detrimental effects on pets with fear as dragons.<P>Problems with current spells<BR>--------------------------------<BR>The major deficiency with Rage of Zomm is not that it doesn't look like a big eyeball it's that it has a 2 minute recast time.  So from a standpoint of how long this pet lasts in a fight with it's 100 hps, it's more of a novelty that a useful damage spell given how long it takes before you can cast another one. (not addressed)<P>The problem with the vocerate fire pets is that magician's measure pet power like DoT's and over the same time period the 52,58 pet does 30-40% less damage than the 49th version.  Ergo less powerful. (not addressed properly)<P>Dyzil Deafening Decoy cast too slowly to take any heat off the magician or her allies (addressed).  And the pets AE spell actually lowers the pet pet's agro rating bellow the magician, which means every last thing that the pet damages comes after the magician rather than the pet. (not addressed)<P>And the Decoy's very low level and low defense skills in comparison to other pets that the magician has available at 56th ensures that the Decoy gets destroyed at such a fast rate that it can't decoy anything.  This pet should be renamed "Agro everything on the magician then die."  (also not addressed)<P>Decoy, needs some truly superior defense skills if it's going to fend off attackers for any period of time.<P>Items Summonings<BR>------------------------------<BR>Summons need to be fixed to fit within our current server economy.  Making summoned staves 1hb will not in any way resolve the fact that our summons serve no useful purpose in the game currently.<P>People like to point to Mod Rods as being a good summons.  I will argue this point,  as Baelish did on Casters Realm.  The main use for these rods is to reduce down time for the Cleric.  They are a mana transfer mechanism not a form of stored mana.  Their use however lowers your party mana pool by costing mana to heal the cleric and the magician to summon the rod.  So in the long run you bought yourself more down time than you saved.<P>Spell Drop Rates<BR>------------------<BR>Drop rates of 54+ spells in general are very poor.  The only place with reasonable drop rates for 55+ spells is Reet froglocks and Selebite Juggernauts in Selebis.  You would think there would be more better places to get these spells but no there are not.<P>And by reasonable I mean one or two spells an evening as oppose to 1 or 2 a week everywhere else.  And since magician spells in general are set as rare drops off the spell table, good luck finding them.  All spells of a given level should have equal commonality on the table.  As it stands you have dozens of some spells for single instances of others.<P>Caster vs. Melee damage<BR>---------------------------<BR>Ok on further examination.  I have this to say.<P>Magicians and Wizards are good when mob lifespan is very short less than 20-30 sec.  Situations where this happens are in raids where targets can be delt with in seconds using a large mass of characters.

And pets do not play well with the only acceptable type of crowd control at higher levels, Enchanters.  Even if the enchanter does not mesmerize a single target you need them for the most efficient group possible due to clarity and haste.<P>Necromancers pets don’t normally don't have this issue because they can cast screaming terror NPCs and get their pets away from an undesired fight.<P>Magicians however have no such option. So, are left with hoping your "/pet back off" command coincides with the Enchanter casting Mes or Stun.<P>At the highest levels of play, pets need to behave in very predictable ways; the margin for error is the razors edge.  And that is the problem with using pets at the highest levels.<P>You can mitigate the problems with using pets but you can't eliminate them even with the best play possible.  So until the pet is as controllable as the tank behind a computer there will always be some leery skepticism of using pets at all in high-level situations.  <P>And while some people would like to say you just need to educate people on playing with pets.  Why bother when you can get a more damaging tank to step up for the same job as a damage dealer/absorber and avoid those issues entirely.<P>(hopefully this poste won't get garbled)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

For every one that asks for this, I hear from another one that says that they have enough control already, and that this can be done by a vigilant magician without such a command.  I’ll add it to the list.

And it would also make them totally and completely reliable.  There would be no danger to using them, and no skill either.  Remember, the only real limitation to your pets is that they are not as smart as characters played by people.  There is no way that I’ll suggest this in this format.<P>I will suggest a /pet noattack, that will have the pet just sit there and not respond to any attacks.

</FONT><HR>The largest concern of the mage community has yet to be addressed by your summaries Absor. Which is the scaling of pet power from pre 50 to post 50. Not only the 52 and 58 fire pets but the whole of the post 50 pets. I'm not sure what the numbers are but if you look at it, melee classes got probably a 50-80% boost in addition to disciplines, while mobs recieved an almost obscene 200-400% boost (with the hp cap raised to 100k) whereas Mage pets and pets in general recieved a 1-5% boost if that. As stated, new summons (mainly proccing summons) are a ways away (don't know why this is, it was promised to us after the SoR "nerf"), and besides summons, pets are the main spell line for magicians and yet valid points in pet-power scaling have been dismissed or ignored. Please make some attempt at addressing these issues and perhaps bringing them up with the Live team.<P><BR>DoTs being out of character, I don't agree with. The only reason this came up was because of their lack of usefulness. They have an obscene casting time, and more often than not, they don't interrupt spell casting (which is one of their features) due to the large cast time. The mana to damage ratio might also need to be improved. But as stated above, pet power scaling is the largest concern of mages. They're what we're all about.<P><BR>-Kelston Bernstar<BR>lv55 Magician, The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>[Teramenor on /pet no attack]<BR>So very true. Implent this command. It is very simple, we can't summon pets in most cases if this command is not implented and the pathing issues aren't fixed. And what is a mage without a pet? A weak wizard which can do only two kinds of elemental damage which gets resisted most of the time. Well sure we can debuff a bit and coth, but coth is a non battle thing and there are classes that debuff better...<P>[On rain spells]<BR>The only time I have used this is to clear hall trash, and even then it is crappy. In real fights it does nothing more then get resisted, brake mesm, and mess up your pet. Get rid of the line.<P>[On DoT's]<BR>(see Diversity of spells)<P>[On pet only heal spells]<BR>Personally I like them, I want to have single pet and not resummon it (a few times) during a fight. I rather spend god knowns how many mana keeping my little Zarer alive then having to resummon one. It is pets we are talking about not reusable toilet paper.<P>[Taunt]<BR>I do not see the difference between pet taunt on and pet taunt off. Fact is, that my pet almost nearly get hits on besides in a fact of an ADD. Of course what my little friend does then is to hack on the ADD so the chanter can't mesm it. Sigh... Make the taunt stronger, and default it to off. Or maybe something like /pet taunt max /pet taunt med /pet taunt min.<P>[On identity issues]<BR>Currently I get the feeling a bit that a mage is 'nothing'. We rely on our pet, yet in 50% of the fights it can not be summoned. We can nuke, but only two elements and we get resisted so damn much.<P>[Pet names]<BR>Nah. I can think of 1000 more important issues that need to be fixed first. Besides, I kind of like the name. And I hate to see crappy/offensive names.<P>[Pets]<BR>Make them part of the group, if possible. Although I realize that this might be a VERY nasty thing to implement programming wise, it is still something that would give us more identity. Our pets could profit from all the lvl 50+ druid group spells then for example. I care for my pet, make the group care too.<P>[Again on mage's indentity]<BR>When you ask someone what the first thing is they think of when you mention "Magician", most will say "Pets". Good, I love my little pet. The rest of my party hates them. Sure, if we are camping a single spot it is "Ohhh, ahhh" on the damage. But as soon as we get moving and I start reading "Taunting attacker master" I know what time it is. The air pet's invis is good, but as you can understand it is not effective in all situations. Fix it, it is not invis, its air. You can't see air (have them dematerialize or something).<P>[On low level mages]<BR>Do not change it, I consider this balanced and the lower levels are fairly easy. Plus they get by quick, rather improve the 24+ levels.<P>[On focus items]<BR>The quests though? After I got level 24 I got my RotE and all my four focus items. I actually loved doing the quest. The items needed for the focus items I just bought, as they were easily available and pretty cheap at that too... (no I did not have some uberfriend helping me) Just a bit travelling to the correct areas (no frost giant toes in Ro heh) and maybe (help) killing a mob here or there.<P>[Various issues by Ozendela]<BR>Great list, suggest you work that down too VI =)<P>[On Mage vs Necro]<BR>Well actually this makes me kind of sad =( I have grouped (yes they group too) with quite a few necro's and every time I am amazed by their power. Sure my pet seems to be stronger then theirs, yet they can do so much more. They always outdmg me with their DoT's, on bad resisting mobs they can still lifestab uh tap, they end fights with pretty good amount of mana due to the lich things, they can even ST if needed, they can heal if needed (they can not keep a tank alive, but every bit helps) and DD some too, well and there is FD should it go wrong. And what do I do? I summon daggers for his pet.<BR>Best of all, my solo tactic goes like this. Stick pet, mali, nuke to hell.<BR>Well and we all know how the necro's handle it (was going to tell it here, but why bother)<BR>Nonetheless I do not think necro's are overpowered, they are a great class and I enjoy to group with them, however when I compare our uses both in group and in solo I do get a bit bitter taste in my mouth. Remove the pet and what remains? A very strong self reliant damage dealer and a weak two elemental wizard. Why would anyone not want a pet? See the issues above.<BR>(btw I feel sorry for those poor wizards too, just that you know =)<P>[Once more on the indentity of a mage]<BR>Give us complete control over our pets, I want my Zarer to jump through a burnin hoop, play dead and fetch orc. During the countless discussions I have read it seems clear that VI is not going to change our abilities if they are getting on the terrain of other classes. Then make us excel at what we are good at. Pets. If you do not want to give us useful utility spells then make our pets controllable, not uber-60warrior-outdamagin tanks, but -usable- pets.<P>[Diversity of spells]<BR>Besides the more fundamental problems with the mage the biggest problem that I have had is the pure lack of any other combat spells then nuke. We only get a few nukes, true. They should not be stronger, that's what wizards do. However I do not feel we are currently forfilling our role as master of the elementals. Some suggestions:<BR>- One elemental only (de)buffs (mali is nice, but I think its more for an enchanter)<BR>- One elemental only DoTs (few ticks, much dmg or lots of ticks, fewer dmg make them pretty resistable so you need to debuff first)<BR>Would be great to make mages stronger in single elemental places (perma, sol, etc) plus the debuffs could clear the way for the wizards. This would increase our efficiency on elemental mobs(not elementals, but stuff like -fire-/-ice- goblins)<BR>The wizards should be able to nuke better, more mana efficient and always (meaning, all sorts of elem nukes). We should be able to have an assorti of elemental, non DD related -combat- spells.<P>[Fun spells]<BR>Monster summoning is a -really- nice addition and I am very glad VI implented it. Yet I still think level 50+ magi should have the ability (not using (bark)potion) to transform themselved into elementals. Although its a wee bit lower on the priority list now heh =)<P>It might seem I am rather displeased with the magician class, however I am not (not entirely that is heh). It could very well be that I am making sound a little more dramatic then they are, but hey this is the last chance =) The class suits me good and I am very pleased with the things Verant has done since release. However it is not done yet. Move us more towards what we should be, our identity as master of the elements, not a vague class that falls somewhere in between...<P>Phew. While I was typing this my copy of Kunark and Velious came, so its time for more fun =) I heard there are lots of summoned higher level creatures on Kunark, time to test the true effectiveness of the SoR =)<P>Greetings,<P>Joris "Prophylon" Jansen<BR>"He who sees the number of lvl 60 warriors increase very rapidly, and the number of mages decreasing at an unhealthy speed"<P>BTW: Sorry for the countless grammer mistakes, I'm Dutch and its still early (now where did I leave that coffee).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah I wrote my msg offline, so I didn't notice Absor responded. Now honestly, I haven't played EQ for quite a time (started just last week) so I have -no- idea who Absor is. But his name is in blue so I guess he is important =) (at least he is just as stubborn as the rest of VI, gotta love that =)<P>[Absor]<BR>&gt;Yes, it sure would. And it would also make them &gt;totally and completely reliable. There would be &gt;no danger to using them, and no skill either. &gt;Remember, the only real limitation to your pets &gt;is that they are not as smart as characters &gt;played by people. There is no way that I’ll &gt;suggest this in this format.<P>&gt;I will suggest a /pet noattack, that will have &gt;the pet just sit there and not respond to any &gt;attacks. But letting the magician completely &gt;control the pets hate list isn’t even close to &gt;reasonable.<P>I think you misunderstood us here, I'd love nothing more then to have a lot of skill involved in playing a mage. But you have a very wierd definition of 'skill' if you think pressing /pet back off hotkey 100 times a second because your pet will not back off and the enchanter can't mesm the mob and everyone dies (well not really but it can mess stuff up) qualifies as 'skill'. When mobs add, and they add on for instance your pet, it gets nasty. The mob will move up the pet aggro's list instantly and will start attacking it. It is a mere matter of luck wether you get your pet to back off just in time when the chanter blanks the mobs brain. If you would give us more options to control the pet, the amount of skill involved would increase. Do not make a /pet do-not-attack-anything then but something else, more subtle. /pet dont-attack-my-target perhaps? Fixing pathing issues will help this though. Ow yes, maybe a /pet freeze # would be good? So that it just does nothing for a period of time, giving you time to tell him to back the hell of and for the chanter to rape the mobs brain =)<P>And how much skill is involved in guiding your pet where it can't go due to pathing problems? How much skill is involved when killing your own pet because it gets feared and trains the whole damn zone? Oww wait I shouldn't summon a pet in such zones, of course! I mean, we have a great DD unresistable dmg spells, we can fireshield much much better then the druid and best of all, we can summon food for the entire party! Woot!<P>[Absor]<BR>&gt;Dude, that is the drawback of the class. &gt;Besides, your pets work pretty well as a method <BR>&gt;of escape. <P>Completely agree with your here. Just like I agree with your on the intrazone CotB that's silly because I can think of a lot of ways to abuse it heheh =)<P>[Absor]<BR>&gt;Nope. There is a reason that these spells don’t &gt;affect pets. It would restrict the power of &gt;those spells if they had to be balanced to deal &gt;with pets. Pets are balanced internally with &gt;each class that gets them.<P>Hurm. Ok you win =) Still I feel the group should CARE more for my pet (and it should not be all my task)<P>[Absor on xp issue]<BR>&gt;Again, no. I guess I’ll add it, but I certainly &gt;wouldn’t expect it to change.<P>Agree with you here again, don't solo dammit, group. You'll see how fun it is =) (that is if your pet doesn't wander off and starts attacking all kinds of nasty stuff... sigh)<P>Still I would like a comment on the 50 vs 60 problems. Guess that is just a balance issue, new levels haven't been around here for so long. As we all know, it takes Verant some time to balance stuff, but if they do, they do it pretty good =)<P>Greetings,<P>Prophylon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties. The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results. You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters. This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards. FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them. DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game. YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE. KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP. STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED. <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM: Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it. They suck and you cant fix em. The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers. It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation. Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items.

</FONT><HR>(Initial Ranting; skip to next part if desired)So, hybrids get their combat skills increased and get new spells. Druids and shamans get one of the best cleric spells.  Wizards get spell crits and increased mana regen, Cleric meditate while standing. While these improvements are wonderful to their respective classes (if i was a cleric i would love to med while standing) they are things that the classes asked for in terms of balance. I saw 80% of the mages ask for improved pet control and instead it goes to the enchanters???  Naming my pet??? How is that in ANY way involved in class balance?  If nothing else, improved pet control is vital to mage balance.  Making the Rage of Zomm cast a giant Eye of Zomm. Oh, yes, thats just perfect, i feel so much more balanced now. Come on.  These "balance" issuse are a joke.  They are things that have been on the list of Fun Things To Do That Dont Impact the Game for months and are being thrown out now as a bone to the mage community, rather than focus on the real issues (why? i dont know)<P>(Real Concerns Start Here)I dont think that Verant "Hates" any class, however I think that some people have preconcieved ideas about which classes do and dont need balancing and are not seriously considering the views of the players. A mage is just a stripped down wizard without his pet.  Leaving us with pets that are impossible to use in dungeons and places with many mobs is like making a zone where the cleric cant heal, or the shaman cant buff/debuff.  Please please please for the love of all that is good, take another look at the posts that address improved pet commands.  This is not something that just affects the level 50+ players, but is a problem even at level 20 and below. (my first encounter with badly behaving pets was in crushbone at level 14 and was the primary reason for my death that night) The biggest problem, just in case you dont want to look at other posts is that the /Pet Back Off command just doesnt work.  He backs off for half a second until he gets hit by the mob and then he jumps right back in. Easy fix : dont make the pet autoattack something that hits it. If i tell him not to attack I AM HIS MASTER darn it! HE should listen to me.  A more broader fix would be a /Pet Ignore Target command that told the pet to ignore a certain enemy until you told him to do otherwise. Please, if nothing else at least explain why you guys at Verant feel that this is not something that is needed so we dont continue to feel ignored on the real issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As to the thing that if pets were totally under our control there would be no danger in useing them please rationalize this with the following:<BR>A wizards primary ability is DD spells. Do wizards have some dnager involved in using them like having to warry that their spell might hit a monster other than the one they targeted? Do clerics have to worry about their group members resisting their heals or not healing for the full amount of the spell? Do Druids worry that their evac might take them to Lower Guk by some strange fluke instead of the East Commons that it is supposed to go to?  The mage takes many hits because of our pets. We are the only caster class that has no form of root/snare to assist in escaping (and if you say a pet is just as good try summoning up a pet while getting beat on). We have by far the most difficult spell research with many pets requiring chain research to get and some pets requiring double chain research to aquire (Level 49 water pet for one).  We also have no personal means of increasing our mana regeneration (compare necro lich, enchanter clarity, wizard harvest).  To sacrifice all this for our pets only to say that they should be unreliable and dangerous to use is beyond my comprehension.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thank you for the list and it appears to be a good start..<P>however, let me address what I feel is a larger OVERALL issue for the magician class.<P>A magician's power curve goes almost flat in the post 50 levels.  The following increases to a magicain post 50 are not equal to the task & difficulties a magicain faces in those final levels<BR>-pets-while these increase in power and level.. the increse in very minor(+2dmg per hit between a level 49 pet and level 60 pet).  While mob dmg and hp increase by a very LARGE amount.<BR>-spell damage-  how can an increase from 810dmg(lvl 49 Bolt spell) to 1024dmg(level 60 bolt spell) keep pace with the mobs at that level.  It is silly to consider that 214 dmg per bolt against the mobs you face at that level.  Let's not forget this spell is a BOLT and has to have clear Line of Sight to land at all.  Please add to your list the consideration, as you did with the bard list, that the increase in spell damage from 50-60 is not sufficient and warrant a significant increase.  That is what this class is about.<BR>-Summoning Spells-  the entire line of spells need an overhall.  Except for Lev rings and perhaps coldstones,waterstones, and Gift of Xev the rest aren't used much and no one wants them.  And our summoned weapon line is unneeded now.  Could we get some better weapons to summon, even if they are pet only.. please!<BR>-Mana regen-  we have none as a class.  It is PAINFULL to meditate back a full bar of mana in these levels(at any level realy).  Considering that mages are expected to deal dmg(and nothing else looking at our spell line) we need a form of mana regen that allows us to keep pace with the dmg we need to deal to mobs in these spell levels.<BR>-Mana storage- we have the Modulation Rod(49) which allows the frugal mage to store mana now and use it later(or allow someone else to).  Could we recieve some form of multi charge mana storage rod like the multi charge potions.<BR>-Defense spell-  if you aren't aware, the magician class has no defense spell at all.  Perhaps we could get some for of quick casting multi tuant eyeball, that we could cast while being beat up that would last long enough for us to get away.  Maybe it casts an AE stun or just agros everything around it for 5 secs..  I understand that with a pet up he should be my defense, but without one we have no chance of casting a 10sec cast to get one to save our lives.<P><BR>That is my list of issues I think your summary was lacking.  <BR>Thank you for adding them to the list.<P>Nerma<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;You’re kidding, right? It’s turned off there because of the way the zone(Sky) works.<P>People can already bypass the way this zone works.<P>A cleric and a necro go(now just a necro), all die and get corpse summoned.  Viola, poor man's CoTH.<P>Pets miss too much when fighting anything in the mid-high 40s, much less the 50s or 60s.<P>Lower FIRE resist on velious mobs.  I understand how making MR too low could trivialize things(chain stun, etc) but FIRE?  All that would do would be to let mages and wizards use their nukes and we still would not outdamage a warrior.  Making a magician AS valuable as a tank on an uber raid is a tall order, because they are gods.<P>Make NICE summoned weapons where the nice part of the weapon is the proc not the dmg delay.  That way it is useless to newbies if it doesnt proc till 50 or whatever the level of the summon is.<P>Examples, a sword that procs a 300 dmg burn but is only 7 29.  Or one that procs a NICE fire sheild.   Or how about somethign that procs a SMALL slow(drowsy?).<P>You are right that pet control is part of the skill, but if you were a raid leader and there was a 1% chance of a wipeout because of a pet, would you allow them? Why?  What is the risk vs reward?  The pet should not make or break your raid so why have it?  Answer? NO PETS.  No pets? Why even bring the mage when a warrior outdamages the mage AND the pet anyway.<P>Why not let the mage become the pet?  He loses his casting ability and all non proc casting from the pet.

Complete heal makes it so the cleric needs to cast only one 400 mana spell an entire fight.

It drops VERY RARELY off mobs in Skyfire, which is where it SHOULD be dropping based upon where all other level 54 spells drop.  It usually drops (still rarely though) off Reets and Juggs in Sebilis, which is where our 57-60 pets drop.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Is that really where it should drop?&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>IMO, yes, Skyfire IS where it should drop, but more commonly.<P>Also, make Phantom Armor NOT OVERWRITABLE, and make is overwrite everything else<P>I don't care if a cleric is trying to cast Aegis of Faith over my Phantom Leather, or somesuch 50 ac difference, I PREFER MY REGEN.<P>From a RP standpoint, not being able to click it off makes sense, but also, being able to overwrite someone elses high leveled spell with your lower one does make sense.<P>I know NO mages who would rather have 67ac (or whatever the cleric buff is) over Phantom Armor's howevermany ac (who cares really?) and 10pt regen.<P>I like the eye idea for rage of Zomm, but it needs to have a MUCH shorter recast time, unless you want to make it immune to riposte;s and AE's like the wizzy and cleric ones.  (I know ours hits for MUCH more than theirs, but heck, we are magicians, we have normal pets up usually, and the damage differance is non-existant if the pet dies mid fight and we cant summon a new one until a few mins later.<P>Personally, I think that since it takes 200 mana and a malachite, it should have a 4-5 sec cast time (like a nuke) and NO RECAST TIME.<P>This would make the rage of Zomm do more damage than any other pet, but it would still have major disadvantages.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If the pet was the same level as the caster, but still did the same damage/spells....wouldn't it begin to hit a great deal more? I have parsed logs of non-epic max level pets, and they tend to hit about 30-40% of the time in high level zones(mobs ranging from high 40's to mid 50's). Against a 60+ mobs this drops to 10-20%.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I'll keep it short and sweet. I want four things addressed:<P>1. Pet power scaling between 50 to 60.  Everyone's asked you about it, and for some reason we aren't getting a response. Can you please at least tell us what the issue is here? We're a damage dealing class that no longer has that as our defining characteristic post-50.<P>2. Escapability.  As you stated, you believe pets are a good way for us to escape. I COMPLETELY agree.  The problem though is that there are many times where we don't have a pet. Ie: Corpse Recovery.  We are HELPLESS when it comes to when we die and need to retreive our corpse.  We can't even summon a pet because it requires Malachite to do so.  Please consider this...maybe make a discipline that can only be used every 60 minutes or something. But give us something that will help us survive the long run.<P>3. Pet Fear Immunity.  This is a great idea. Makes us useful in Uber mob situations. But PLEASE, make sure that Dispells will not take this down.  Many uber mobs who cast fear also cast dispell....thereby nullifying our fear immunity buff.  Personally, I think this should be an innate ability of the pet post 56 rather than a spell. Which brings me to the next point.<P>4. Pet Immunities: Makes sense that the fire pet is immune to fire. Can we make the water pet immune to cold? The air pet immune to stun? The earth pet immune to fear? Again, focus this on post 56 pets and I think it's not unbalancing. Additionally, the Epic pet should be immune to SOMETHING.  Currently it has no immunities.<P>Thanks!<P>-Mythlar Silverfire<BR>56th Season Magician of Tiarcs!<BR>Luclin Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The posts for better pet control out number the posts for the same level of pet control 10 to 1 (I just went back and counted).<P>And as I stated earlier why get a Magician in the daily grind when you can get a more reliable tank that does more damage and plays well with enchanters.  <P>Plane of Air:<BR>----------------<BR>And what exactly do you think dueling and summon corpses allows you to do now?  It allows you to summon people to higher islands without keys.  <P>And why was it left in that way?  Because a concesion was made that people have real lives where they need to leave PoA so you need to replace people in PoA as you proceed.  And some islands don't drop all 24 keys. So, how do you get those extra people up?<P>Why leave this way of summoning people up islands and not enable CoH?  Answer me that.<P>On escape:<BR>--------------------------<BR>Draw back of playing the class Bah!  Even melee's with no spells have no troubles with these mobs we're the only ones that die.<P>Our posts stated quite clearly that it's outdoor encounters with things that have SOW that we want a solution too.  Even the the 60th level arch mage will get killed by the 34th level Yun shaman or Sarnak Extremeist because we can't get away from them.  No other class has this problem they simply crowd control or kill the Mob and go on their way.  The magician gets killed.<P>We cannot drag our pet through outdoor kunkark or SoV zones while we are using SOW or Jboots since our pets can't keep up with us.  So we DO NOT HAVE PETS IN THIS GIVEN SITUATION.<P>Even with Pet foot speed increasing spells dragging pets through any zone is still a bad idea.  They will agro many things that the magician themselves will not thereby increasing the danger to the magician while traveling.  So again we are left with without a pet.<P>It doesn't have to be root.  It doesn't have to be mez.  It could be any number of creative solutions but it should be there.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>except for one post all i really see is post 50 mages here... i for one am not a post 50 mage... i am a lowly 27 mage on rallos zek.... i find it virtually impossible to find a group most of the time.  Sure i have friends and guildmates and can group with them, if 1. they are online, 2. we are even remotely close to each other, 3. we are of roughly the same level. Other than if these 3 conditions are met i can yell for a group all night and not get one.  why? simple, the pets.  One of my friends is a chanter and working with him alot has taught me very good pet control.  however, there are many instances when the pet just does not listen to pet back off and breaks the mez.  i really like the pet no attack command idea, as this would solve most of my problems.  I have one question about the rain and AE spells though.  I read that you are tyring out taking pets out of the rain spell equation: how will this affect anthing on Rallos zek?  i know, i know, it is what i get for playing on rallos and not on a blue carebear server, but i like the added danger.  I NEVER USE AE spells of any kind simply because they aggro good ole jaobober on my and he whoops up on me.  this really sucks....  it makes it really hard to be a mage when the only damage spells you get for 8 or 10 levels are AE spells.... lvl 12 was a good lvl for this.. it was hellacious to use that lvl 8 dd at lvl 15...<P>all the post 50 concers i see here are interesting, but let me be able to do something that makes me welcome in a group.  i never get to cast my dmg shield if a druid is in the group because their shield actually does more dmg than mine...  also, if i do get in a group it is hard to teach the tanks to pull to my pet and park the mob directly on top of the pet.  thus the pet never takes dmg... reducing its effectiveness... also, why do necro and enchanter pets do as much dmg as my pets? i thought that mages kicked because of their pets, only to find out that the other pets do just as much dmg, only they can't take as much of a beating.... this doesn't matter for necros though... fear kiting and all that stuff...  is there some way that you can change the pet's attack range so it goes right in close to the mob so it has roughly the same range as say a DE sk with a wurmslayer? (note, this is the specific weapon my friend has, and he is always tanking rather than the pet because the pet is too far from the mob for him to stand behind the pet and tank)  i would gladly accept this "nerf" on mage pets, and i think that many other mages, especially those of my level or so would love it.... i know that with every group that i have been with that i have taught the trick of pulling on top of the pet and letting it tank has loved the pet tanking like this.... maybe you say that i should just teach it to everyone i group with, but it is hard alot of the time and many tanks don't like this idea.... many people have never heard of this idea, and cannot grasp the concept... <P>one final parting shot: i usually group with a 29 chanter and a 30 sk, they told me the other day that they were fighting stuff, that usually we 3 fight, without me, and they didn't even notice i was gone really... talk about a mage feeling useless... i know my role well in groups, i dmg shield tanks/ pet, send pet in, and nuke...  and this is what mages are supposed to do... but why would a mage be useful if the dmg i deal is so unnoticable... <P>go ahead, flame away at the lowly 27 mage who doesn't "know the role of a mage and how to play one" ... i don't really care... I have been playing a mage for about 5 months now, and have never played another class and i love my mage... i just get soo upset when i hear about how mages are "wanted and desired greatly in groups" when i can't get a group after yelling in a zone for an hour and half..... and i mean a zone with 40 or 50 people in it... heck, most of the time i can't even start a group... the only way i get in is if i have a friend in one already (usually the enchanter cause everyone wants an enchanter)... and don't say mages are supposed to solo--- i hate sitting there for 10 minutes medding up to full mana between fights...it sucks...i mean, how much can i stare at the darm spell book anyway...<P>so, all i want, is some better pet control, and a better dmg shield, and some knowledge as to why AE spells were even given to mages on rallos... (oh, and i know the games wasnt' designed for rallos, only for the other servers... but come on, a little notice to issues about rallos would be nice..) oh, and faster mana regen would be nice, but.. i know it won't happen... i won't even get in to dieing from a lack of escape route... <P>Daetien Beyazid 27 mage Rallos Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
