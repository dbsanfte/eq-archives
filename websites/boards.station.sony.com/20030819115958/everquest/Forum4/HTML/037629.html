Did so (researched a lot), found one with some people I already knew, and accepted their invite.<P>Just thought I'd share a laugh or two from the weekend...<P>Fri night - Log in, MOTD says Fear Raid.  "Hmm, nope still 45, oh well."<P>Guild finds out Fear is "being done".  Fear raid is now "Kael Raid"... But, I am already out in Tim Deep killing Spirocs and having fun.<P>Saturday - "ToFS Raid for lower levels"  Cool!  I'll tag along!<BR>I am made a group leader...This worries me.<P>Before ToFS, we meet in PoK.  The first thing I read after the raid channel is live and all groups are buffed is:  "OK if I go AFK for like 20 minutes? I need to get some food."<P>This meatball is (of course) in MY group.  But, he is a good player from what I have seen...Others are WAY harder on him than I would be - Lots of ribald comments and general abuse  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>After zoning into IC, and being kamikazed by like 300 ididotic Snow Dervs, we are on the way.  Someone goes LD, of course.<P>Get the whole raid inside and well...There's someone raiding it already!  Like 2 other guilds on different floors - The librarians have the lifespan of a mayfly.<P>Raid cancelled. Go xping in TD again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Sunday - Log in and read guild chatter about Kaesora.  "Cool, never got deep in there!"<P>Get a party of 8 - Too late I realize it consists of levels 25 to 49  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/redface.gif"> Hey, go anyway.<P>2 parties in Kaesora - One gets a bad pull after losing the other one - I call evac on my group, no problem.  The other has a 49 Cleric with a bad attitude...She dies and blames everyone else because no one TOLD her not to go in that room.<BR>(NOT a guildmember, btw - Different guild)<BR>Giggled a LOT in guildchat over the hysterical feedback on her reputation  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In the process, couple other mass graves in the first drop in...Trying to get her out.<P>Double death for her when she insists on looting her corpse prematurely.<P>Wow, I really have a pounding headache now.<P>Finally ask a guildmate to log in his 47 Necro and summon us out - I'm dead in PoK anyway..."Sure, I'll buy some coffins.  What kind?"<P>Jade.  180pp each...Ok, well bite the bullet and help out the team.<P>Summoned, rezzed for 75% and certain everyone got out, I log after saying goodnight to the guild and having /hugs popping on my screen from all over Norrath. Laughed my a$$ off at some of the BS that flashed on the screen with them.<P>I think my xp went backwards, I spent some pp I will most likely never see again, and there is a cleric in another guild I will be avoiding...<P>But DAM*, IT WAS FUN!!!<P>I like this guild deal  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">  Hope you won't decide to flame me for the length...<P>Hav(s)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But generally the strength of guild starts to be felt post-50.  Discipline also picks up.  If you wanna raid, you gotta have discipline.  Learn to work with people.  <P>As for exp...  well, raids are done with specific target in mind, and you usually don't come expecting exp or loot.  Exp on a raid is likely to go negative, though 56+ clerics make the loss negligible.  And loot, well, hope for it but don't expect it.  Raid has a goal, everything else secondary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Normally our guild raids are as follows:<P>We have a guild meeting to discuss what we will be doing on what day.<P>Endless rants from peeps on how we don't raid as much as they would like.<P>So...guild leader plans a raid....then 20 peeps who coplain we don't raid enough have some lame excuse why they can't attend raid (if your not gonna go on the raids...shut your mouth)<P>We head to the raid site....takes a million years to buff everyone...then someone goes LD. Have to wait until they come back. then must rebuff because they decided to get a sandwich while LD and they come back 10 minutes later.<P>We start the raid...finally....10 minutes into the raid the "I have to log" messages start, 1/2 the peeps in the raid leave..saying they have real life plans. (But kinda funny when you see there alts. pop up on guild list).<P>Guild carrys on with raid best we can...if were lucky we kill a mob with a good drop.(Guild belives in need before greed) Example: nice druid item drops...raid leader asks all druids at raid to roll.....rolling is done...come to find out winner of roll is a Monk who plans on selling the item for profit. All druids and guild leader have to re explain why the monk can't roll....reroll is done. (takes 20 minutes to roll on an item..insane)<P>At this point raid has killed a whopping 5 mobs in 2 hours, more peeps start there "Oh, i must leave now" or the "My child is sick" routine. (no lie had 4 peeps kids supposedly get sick all at once on one raid..so they had to log) again a few minutes later these peeps alts pop up on guild who list.<P>Now 6 peeps are left at raid....raid leader gets annoyed and says "Forget this....druid plz port us out"...well druid goes to port and...bam! group is attacked....raid leader goes down...then another person...druid doesn't fire the succor spell becaused he un-memmed it to fill slot with "Group port to nexus" ..eventually whole remaining group goes down. So begins the 2 hour corpse run....oh and did i mention there are no clerics left in group...the cleric left when there Kids supposedly got sick....all 3 of em. Have to find rezz, pay 100pp a rezz...and port out.<P><BR>This is a true story......wish it was not, but yes i was one of the peeps dragging my corpse out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But those who went to Befallen and also came to Paw had learned their lessons about all of the above -- and that's half the point of raiding below 50.

This is a true story about a truly pathetic guild:<P>A raid on CoM, planned weeks in advance, is called. The raid leader refuses to tell anyone exactly what the purpose is.<P>Far fewer people show up than planned, so some members recruit friends of dubious competence. This throws off the grouping arrangements and sends the raid leader into a rage, swearing profusely over /gu<P>An hour after everyone is assembled and grouped (no buffing is done), everyone is at last ported to EJ. The groups have to disband and reform when the leader realizes that all the porters where in one group.<P>The raid arrives in EJ, and every group but one heads to CoM. That last group goes off in the opposite direction and gets lost. The rest of the raid waits at the zone to CoM for 15 minutes before they arrive.<P>In CoM (still no mention of raid buffs), the raid sort of splits up all over the place aimlessly killing yard trash. I send a /tell to the raid leader to ask what the heck we're raiding anyway. He says it’s a wiz epic piece.<P>Yeah that’s right; wiz epic. In CoM. More on that later.<P>after about an hour of this random yard trash pickup, the leader orders everyone back to the entrance. He and the wiz whose epic we're supposedly raiding for discuss something for a while, before announcing that the entire raid is to be Gfluxed to the top of the bridge near the entrance, to avoid the lockpick.<P>Did I mention that we had 2 rogues present with maxed lockpicking? How about that nobody had ever been Gfluxed before and had the slightest idea how to do it?<P>3 hours and 2 wipes later we finally have everyone (those who haven't already left) crammed onto the bridge. Someone tracks the quest mob we're after, and not only is it up but it's nearby. They pull it and the mystery is revealed: none other than the human skeleton for the wizard brain bite spell quest comes into view.<P>Uh-oh! Because the raid leader and wizard where so tightlipped about what we where after, nobody thought to recruit any chanters (in order to complete the quest you have to charm/mezz the skele and hand it something). Fortunately one of the non-guildees present was a bard, who filled in on short notice.<P>I sent another tell to the leader, asking him if he knew it wasn't the epic we where doing, but rather a spell quest. He blew his top and started ranting in /gu again ("what do you mean it's not the f**king epic!?"). The wiz made the turnin soon after and gated out, and I am still puzzled as to weather A): the wiz honestly thought brain bite was his epic, B): the guild leader got his wires crossed somewhere or C): the wiz deliberately misled everyone in order to have more people show up.<P>And to top it off, when everyone was ported off to nexus, 1 guy's game crashed because he didn't have SOL. He came back on another char and started berating the porter, who had announced the destination repeatedly. The unfortunate said his char was stuck in limbo but that was ok, since he was friends with an off-duty GM and he would call in a favor. Needless to say, the GM was apparently "afk" when the guy tried to contact him.<P>That is a typical raid in that guild, when they're not descending on runneyeye or najena to farm up stuff for their alts. I'm glad I got out of there when I did. Me and a few friends have since split off to form our own guild, Twilight Unity, and with the exception of SCARAB raids and such we concentrate on just being friends rather than going after loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

These are guilds who can kill targets with a few groups that other guilds find necessary to "zerg"<P>Then the anti zerg guilds.  They usuall have high requirements, lower then average membership and stress quality above all else, there are few of them and not overly sucessful, the only good anti zerg guild that has made a powerful presence of themselves (meaning, they're equipping people with vex thal gear) is science of war on legends.  Though I'm sure they're others.<P>Then there's the epic+ guilds.<P>These guilds are those that have the numbers and power to deal with epic and above encounters.  They're generally equipped will enough to kill kunark targets with ease, can raid old planar zones efficiently, and can go after most midrange velious targets.  They can get sleepers tomb keys, but don't have the strength to kill higher end luclin bosses.  They're usually in tier 2 PoP zones, with maybe a handfull of people in tier 3.  They're more casual than raiding guilds, but more structured and regimented, and can get do higher raids than the casual guilds.

My guild isn't uber by any any stretch of the imagination but we are very organized and getting better all the time.  Everyone has other real life activities but we have 3 nights of the week that almost everyone sets aside for raiding.<P>We are currently finishing off HoT and a raid night usually consists of about 6 hours.  In this time its not uncommon to take down multiple targets and mobilize quickly to the next one.<P>A couple days ago we killed Gorenaire, Doomshade, Vindi, Velks and then finished off the night farming HoT for Skyshrine armor drops.  The night took us about 6 hours.  I don't think anyone left until we got to HoT (we didn't need everyone for HoT anyway)  It takes good team work and alts camped all over Norrath to check spawns and port people in order to hit this many targets in one night.<P>Anyway, Im not sure what my point is.

If you're only out for ph@t l00t and big plat, you're probably not going to belong with us.<BR>On the other hand, if you can hold a decent conversation, WANT to help your guildies and others when they need it (one of our major points of existence), have a good sense of humor and know how to play your toons (or are genuinely willing and wanting to learn), those are the people we want.<BR>That means selective recruiting to keep out bad apples, learning raids for new people and occasionally having to reduce our intended goal on a raid when more people than planned have RL schedule conflicts. But the raids usually work -- because we DO have fun playing together, raiding together, hunting together and chatting together. And because we can trust each other to do our best for each other and for the guild.<BR>THAT's why we have a guild. :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
