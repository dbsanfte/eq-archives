</FONT><HR>The LD issue needs some kind of fix.  It is a signifigant handicap.<P>Add jboots speed to the Ring of Flight. Same duration as current, increase the mana cost and recast time. Rings are non-stackable. It is the ring of FLIGHT, not the ring of levitation. <P>Add a new spell along the lines of the dimentional pockets. Summon dimentional rift - cast it on yourself or a groupmate and it has the effect of pushing the player into a dimensional rift (the target becomes invis and cannot move), the player cannot interact in any way else the spell is broken, essentially a feign death spell. Cast it on a mob, assuming it is not resisted, and the mob is trapped for a while in the rift taking it out of the battle for a time, essentially a mez. Cast it on the pet and the pet is contained in the rift that the mage controls and takes with him - so the mage can move to a different area without having to tow the pet behind - like in dungeons. When the spell wears off, is canceled, or the caster is attacked, the elemental returns. Spell has a long recast time and regent component.  This would provide an escape route, a utility, and a partial fix to the pet pathing problem all in one.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pet buffs:<P>How about making spells like burnout and pet heals auto target the pets so I dont have to swap targets.  They only work on my pet only so why do I have to keep swaping targets to cast the spell.  <P>Epic pet:<P>Up his resists a bit.  He is suppsed to be all 4 pets combined.  My 49 fire pet can resist every fire type of spell but the epic gets beat down by the chardok Queen fire AE and the lord's in CoM.  He should be immune to everything but disease and magic based spells.  Kinda Sad I have an epic pet but I have to swap down to the level 49 fire pet for some mobs when my epic pet should be considered all 4 pets.  Also the epic should be able to backstab.<P>Gear From Plane of Growth/Quest:<P>This really needs to looked at and changed.  The robe should cast Call of the Hero not a damage shield.  Just look at the other casters robes and you will see that would put it in line with the other robes.  The rest of the effects really need to be looked at.   They are worthless to anyone who knows anything.  <P>Test Changes:<P>The level 59 pet no fear spell - This should be moved to 44 or 49 because that when players start fighting dragons really.  Maybe make 2 versions so the lower level players and hit vox/naggy and help the raid more.  <P>Spell summon pet to owner- This should really be an skill like sence heading.  We really dont have another spell slot to keep free for this spell.  By the time you notice you pet is missing ... mem the spell and cast it will be to late.   If it can't be a skill then make it work off CotH.  We target pet and it summons him instant but doesnt use mana or the pearl.  Just have the fail msg hit that the pet is not in the group but it still summoned him.  <P>One other idea for all players:<P>In Tim Deep add a Skyshine Fireport to the pot room.  Skyshine is right in the middle of SoV ... would be a perfect town to let people travel to via the pots when they dont have a port lined up.  Swap it with the greater fay or felwithe pot cause they are like a 2 min run from each others towns. <P>One idea for all casters:<P>Give us a second form of bind/gate that only lets you bind in SoV towns.  There are over 100 zones ... only 1 you can keep your bind point to is kinda a pain when you got to run back and forth between old EQ/RoK/SoV.  Let it give you the rez effect when you gate to a SoV town so you cant lemming the boss mobs within unfriendly towns.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Executive summary<BR>=================<P>* Don't mess with specialization, it will annoy many more people than it will please.<P>* Increase drop rate of earth staff off Inny, it's unfair to have hundreds of rogue/shaman/monk/cleric epics to each mage epic.<P>* Make call of hero work in Sky to increase the attractiveness of this underutilized zone and to give mages a class specific tool that will help them and their friends reach an otherwise super hard to reach part of their epic quest.<P><BR>Long version<BR>============<P>The ability to change specialization has been in game for a while, so many conjuration specialists might have changed over to evocation by now. Making changes to spells at this stage would likely annoy those people a second time, as well as annoy the evocation specialists.<P>It's not fair or balanced by any stretch of the imagination that there are a hundred each of shaman, rogue, monk and cleric epics to every one mage epic weapon in existence.<P>Our epic definitely needs fixing by increasing the drop rate of the earth staff, and we need confirmation that it was fixed - anecdotes by players who have seen it drop "twice in the last week" won't cut it because of selection bias (30 servers, 52 weeks in a year, even with a 1% drop rate you'll hear these stories all the time). The drop rate on the earth staff is ridiculous for a mob that spawns once a week, let alone that Inny is totally out of reach for many mages due to the way guilds arrange to share the planes. <P>Also, to help with the mage epic, make call of the hero work in Plane of Sky (the crown is on island 7, almost all raids run out of steam long before that because people have real lives too). The zone is very underused right now because it is a huge time, exp and platinum sink, for relatively meagre rewards compared to Kunark, Velious etc.<P>Datalore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, lots of good ideas in these threads, so I’m just gonna throw in my 2 cents and hope Absor actually reads these things.<P>Upgraded pet heal:  This is something that we really, really need.  I mean when they added the low level pet heals I was very happy, but that’s because I was around level 20 when that happened.  However, a level 20 pet heal just ain’t cutting it anymore.  I love the idea of a pet complete heal, maybe 300 mana, 5 sec casting time, 5-10 second recast time.  Chain casting pets is cool if you can get the timing down, and aren’t getting hit with lag (yeah, right =oP), but getting a decent pet sometimes takes 5 or more casts, and that is just too much mana waste when we are grouping.  Pet cHeal is a good answer to this.  Pet regen spell would be a nice addition too.<P>Root:  C’mon  guys, every caster in the game gets some form of root or snare, except mages.  The two things that get me (and group members) killed the most are 1) pet pathing and 2) the inability to stop runners.  Please, if you wish us to become more welcome in groups, you have to give us something to offer groups (and summons ain’t it).  I think mages should get root at the same level as necros.<P>Pet buffs:  Mages are elementalists.  We work with elements, summon them and fight them.  I think someone in beta got so carried away with excitement over mages ability to summon loaves of bread that they forgot what a mages true purpose was; to master the elements.  I propose a line of buffs matching our pets, which can be cast on any pet:<P>Water buff:  Increased pet regen rate (see above)<BR>Earth buff:  Increased pet strength and damage<BR>Fire buff: Damage shield (already have this, more or less)<BR>Air buff:  Increased pet agility,<P>Another way to go here is the summoned weapons that proc a pet effect.  Summon staves/swords/daggers that proc a root, stun or even dd damage wouldn’t be remiss.  Hell, maybe players will start asking for summons again.  As it is now, I can’t give my summons away (except for bandages and stones for monks)<P>We also need something done about the LD summon problem.  A flag that keeps summon items alive for 30 minutes after disconnecting would (probably) solve most of these issues.<P>I think that mages could use a slight upgrade to our DD spells at the highest levels, nothing extreme, just a small improvement in the mana/damage ratio and casting time.  A conjuration based DD spell use in groups instead of a practically (grouped) useless bolt would be nice.<P>Post 50 problems I’ll leave to others, though if everything I’ve heard about out post 50 fire pets is still true when I get them, I am going to be bitterly disappointed.  It seems our class needs a lot of work post 50.  I hope this (ore than anything else), is not ignored.<P>Valiant companion, if it goes live should be level 49.<P>Well, that’s it for now.  I’m sure I’ll have some other ideas one second after I submit this post.  Thanks for starting the class threads, it really helps the morale to think that you guys actually listen to the players.<P>Late!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My vision of a mage is that of a conjurer. He summons forth his elemental and prepares it for battle with summoned weapons, armor, and items appropriate for the foes he will face. He summons items for his comrades which will assist them in the upcoming battle. During battle he controls his elemental warrior, assisting his friends by using his control of the elements to inflict further damage upon his foes. <P>Thus, there are 3 aspects to a mage: pets, summoned items, and elemental mastery. To tune the mage, I think these concerns should be addressed in order. [I would leave the discussion concerning the epic weapon out of this particular debate]. <P>Pets First - Sugggestions include better ways to control pets, to buff pets, and to heal pets. More summons we can give to pets. The main idea here is to make the pet useful in all situations and give the mage the tools he needs to prepare his pet for any battle. Several pet buffs are live on test, and a new pet heal seems like a good bet. Due to pathing, mages need better ways to control pets. Suggestions include: having the pet summon clear pet aggro, a leash spell to keep pet from wandering off, or a command to stop pets from attacking under any circumstance. Another idea would be to buff up the rage of zomm spell (and maybe make it a line of spells), so when a mage can't summon a pet, he summon up this type of pet. Also, a pet spell which casts fast (2 second cast time) and has a high taunt would be a great addition. This would give mages a method of escape which fits in with their abilities. The pet would tie up the mob for several seconds and give the mage a chance to run or gate.<P>Also under pet problems is the post-50 firepet. Extensive testing has revealed that the pet can't melee effectively, that even when it is not meleeing that it is easily outdamaged by the other pets, and that it will cast disruptive AE spells and dispells so it cannot be used in a group setting effectively. <P>Next, summons. No line of spells in the game has such potential and such poor realization. The fear that summoned items will be too powerful is just that a fear. With twinking, the ability to control the proc level of weapons, and the ability to make summoned items no rent, lore, and no drop, this should not be an issue. Mod rods were a good idea, make it a line of spells with a lower level version and a higher level version. Give our weapon line of spells some life with good +resist gear for the ammo slot and proc'ing weapons that we can give to pets or [heaven forbid] even to other players vs. certain mobs. Throw in a couple of general purpose and fun summons and mages should rub their bellies with contentment.<P>Third Elemental mastery comprises DD, bolts, damage shields, and DOT's. With the above ideas implemented, mages' DD and bolts need very little fixing. The Blast School of magery identifies these problems: variety of DD (evoc and conj only), mana efficiency of DOT's, lack of DD at certain levels, drop in blast-o-matic rankings post 50. Personally, other than fixing the DOT's that were given to us, I don't think the blast school is going to get their concerns addressed. Nor do I think they need to. Blasting is fun, but ultimately it is not the best way to do damage. At low levels mages rely upon their blast power to solo. But the general consensus is that mages have enough firepower to support their main source of damage - the pet. I think this is appropriate. A look at rain spells may be warranted because of high resists and the ability of the target to move making them un-mana efficient. This may not be true, with earth pet and malaise stuck, they may be ok. At least look at them.<P>Ultimately, to be balanced, mages needs pets for every situation including areas with bad pathing, and I would contend an escape pet type of spell. Second, Mages need summoned items that are useful at the level they are gained and that are desired by the players under the right circumstances. +Resist gear which could go in ammo slots for raids is one good example. There are numerous others examples.<P>Well, gotta run...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the most major balance issues facing both the nuker classes Wizards and Magicians is the pool of mob hitpoint increasing dramatically past 55+.  This causes us not to be able to do our correct perentage of the damage to a mob since casters don't get upgraded in the correct maner to keep them competative with tanks.<P>The average monster to fight at 55+ is 10-15k in hps.  So in the daily play mana regen even with Clarity II and a bard you cannot keep up the same sustained damage as a warrior. Where every 2 min you are fighting something or you face begin out of mana in 3-4 fights.  And once out of mana can never make up the damage lead gained by the warriors while the nuker is medding.<P>Given the average group with 3 tanks, a nuker, enchanter, cleric.  The nuker should pull his weight in sustained damage and deal 1/4 or the hps of the monster every single fight.  But this is not the case.  The damage delt is PIDDLY in comparison to a tank of the same level when compared over the evening.  On the order of 60% of a warrior's damage.<P>Spells were made like gear at post 50 but these minor upgrades for nukers are NOT AS GOOD as the upgrades for tanks and use a consumable resource (mana) unlike a sword.  And while you can kill Joe Blow Named Mob 10-15 times in a week and get the sword you are looking for.  In 3000 kills in Selebis and Skyfire I have not seen some of the spells I have been searching for EVER!  And this is hunting the right 55+ level mobs.  So rarity of these spells is out of balance in comparison to tank gear.<P>Mana regen rates are set correctly for a cleric with Clarity II being able to heal a group of tanks every 2 min.  Mana regen rates for a Nuker with clarity 2 and a bard don't even approach what is needed for a nuker to sustain the same damage output as a tank every 2 min which is 2.5k to 3.25k hp of damage.<P>So I would suggest re-evaluating Nuker gear very, very, very carefully.  If our spells don't give us the edge needed to be a truely useful in our primary facet at a damage dealer.  Given nukers use a mana bar, we should at least do as much as the warrior if not more.  Or what is exactly the point of having a nuker in your group?  Because it sure as heck doesn't allow you to kill monsters faster.  <P>With one exception, which is less than 1% of play time in the game, Uber Mobs.  The only thing here that makes any diffrence is mana pool not Mana regen rate for nukers.  Nukers are very good at empting out our full pool of mana in less than a minute.  1% percent of the game, what about the other 99% of the game?<P>Increased int does not help, more mana does not help, more hp does not help, better resist does not help, more ac does not help, more stats does not help.  The only thing that allows a nuker to do more damage in a sustained fashion is mana regen so they can fling more magic more often.<P>And mana regen doesn't just have to be in the form of clarity.  In can be stored mana, stored damage spells (wands/staves/rods) that you can recharge during down time or in town, right clickable effects, increased efficency at damage dealing for some drawback, debuffs that actually make Nuker spells hit for more damage on the day to day mob (not uber mobs), ... and the list goes on.  These are what should be considered high end caster gear.  Not more or the same int gear we get from level 20+.<P>And as far as righ clickable effects go.  For them to be ballanced and useful for nukers then need to have fast cast times and a long refresh time.  15-30 sec to cast a spell and locking out other spell casting is a disaster for a nuker.  Its safter and smarter in all situations to use your own nukes and med durring that period.  God forbid you actually need to cast an Evac or Gate while using these things.  For heals and buffs long cast times are fine, for a DD which you allways need to land as quickly as possible because ... Oh gee the fights over, bloom corpse nuking, hmm that was useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few more ideas that I missed in my last post:<P>The global file which contains all the models for weapons and such I am CERTAIN has many unused models that look sweet or far underused models that hardly anyone has and are assigned to underpar items that really are not used purposefully so it would be nice if some of the proposed new weapon summons would model off some of these unused or underused weapon models.<P>Monster Summoning- Please allow our monster pets to wield weapons and if they "are" wielding them but just aren't showing up then work on a way to get the models that can wield weapons to properly show them.<P>It would be nice if our "pet" only spells would be Caster - Pet.. in the same aspect of a Druid using a group sow or shield the mage would have that bond with his pet and be able to cast burnout on themself and the pet included.. velocity (58) should affect both the pet and mage. I don't see how this would hurt much.. A mage strives onward to become more of "one with the elements" and modifying these spells to be like this would be a step in that direction if that is the idea Verant would like mages to have.<P>Because of our relation to elementals it would be interesting if the Hole could be modified to have magician quests and a faction for magicians (like necromancers have with the undead, druids with animals, etc..) with elementals. Along with that there should also be a means of controlling these elementals with our magic just the same as necromancers and druids and whoever else controls their affiliation.<BR>some examples would be:<P>Hold Elements (20)- An elemental-only stun, 3 seconds.<BR>Detain Elements (40)- An upgraded version, 5 seconds.<BR>Bind Elements (55)- An upgraded version, 8 seconds.<P>Elemental Berserk (56)- This spell would cause an elemental to enter a berserk, attack anything it's closest to (even npcs) by removing it's idea of what is friendly and making everything appear hostile to it.. basically setting it's aggro to anything.. so if used in the hole, an elemental would begin attacking another elemental if that other elemental is within aggro range. Would last only a little while and it would know what happened.<P>Elemental Purge(53)- Would act as a Mem blur that works only on elementals<P>Domination of the Elements(60)- Would be a high strength, long lasting charm that affects only elementals. Would have a very long cast time in order to ensure a stable hold on the elemental which would reaffirm the name "Domination".<P>spells such as this that expand our means of controlling elementals.<P>It'd also be nice in our Epic quest if when we turned over our mastery items if we would get back a better focus item with stats and such that are wieldable.<P>that's all I have for now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Argaile Talismar<BR>54 Elementalist of Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I play an Arch Mage on Vallon Zek, a PvP server.  From my experience I can add the following to this discussion:<P>1) In 60 levels, the only defense a mage has is his/her pet and gate.  Thats it.  Every other pure caster gets some kind of damage absorbtion, root and stun/mez.  The justification has always been 'we have the strongest pets' and 'our earth pet casts root and air stuns.'  <P>Eliminate the pet from the situation (pet dies, you zone, pet is feared or rooted or mezzed, etc.) and the justification no longer applies, and you're left with a defenseless magician, something you can basically say for NO other class in the game.<P>2) By the same token, Magicians are severely handicapped in PvP if their pet is removed from combat (root mez fear etc).  Yes, you can annul or pumice, but while youre doing that you're also allowing your opponent to get in a free attack(s).<P>Either GZ or Gordon stated pets comprise 50% of a magicians power.  Tell me, what other class can have its PvE or PvP power cut in half by ONE spell?<P>3) The only summons I use at 60 are: ring of levitation, rod of modulation, quiver of marr (rarely, for those cheapskate warriors), gift of xev, and occasionally shard of the core for resists.  The type of summons that I know I'd appreciate are an improved shard of the core with better resists (since the current spell is only 34, it stands that a later spell could grant better bonuses), or an improvement to the rod of modulation, such that it confers greater health to mana/ summoning cost efficiency or that it is no longer lore (I would really like better efficiency though - if necros get improved mana transfer spells, and rods of modulation were introduced *prior* to the necro line, surely this lends some weight to the notion that this was our ability first, and perhaps an upgrade as they have recieved is not too unrealistic?).<P>I can also tell you that the way you have designed Velious encounters makes my mana far more useful if given to a cleric then if I actually do anything with it.<P>PvP suggestions:  <P>1) Perhaps improve our shock line with greater pushback or something, that would really aid us in PvP.  Wizards get stuns, even shock of lightning excels at this, and enchanters chaotic feedback (level 8 nuke) is an almost guaranteed unresistable interrupt.  Our low level shocks are easily channeled through, and our high level ones are slow and easily 'stepped back' into position to channel through.<P>2) Why are the only useful PvP spells I get: Mala, scars of sigil, scirocco, scintillation, and char?  In 60 levels, thats all?  Everything else is easily resisted by anyone with half-decent gear or just impractical (Manastorm, seeking flame of seukor, shock of steel, all fairly useless based on casting times, LoS, resistance checks, etc.).<P>3) I would bear your children if you would give us some kind of pet MR buff, or a pet with naturally high MR.  Other than the epic pet, even our level 60 pet is not too unlike the abilities of the necro pet, with the major difference being more HP.  Doing something special to our pet would help make the pet conjuring aspect of this class more unique (since you gave their pets procs and spell buffs nearly identical to ours).  This would help tremendously in both PvP and PvE.  Yes, I know about the fearless pet, which is admittedly a very nice pet, but does nothing regarding a simple root spell.<P>4) Magicians have the fewest defensive options in PvP than any other casting class, and I would say any other class, period.  Should I be thankful we received the gate spell?<P><BR>My interpretation of the class can be summoned as this: we have a few slightly varying pets, and many useless ones (broken dyzils, one shot rage of zomms, 52, 58 fire pets that are 'situational' says Gordon/GZ but I've yet to find anything appropriate for them).  We have some varying DD's, only 3 or so of which see much use.  We have some good AE's.  We have about 4 useful summons.  We have good fireshields and a debuffthat while good, is useless in the presence of a shaman (mala vs malo).  We have ONE spell that makes us desired on raids.  Other than gate, shielding, see invis and invis and those sort of spells, I think that's all this class boils down to right now.  Its not bad, but a little defense would go a long way.<P><BR>Thanks,<P>Aadrya<BR>Archmage of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To any and all at Verant that will read this.  I have actually read all of these posts and from what I can tell there are a lot of angry mages out there.  Now I am on my first character, which happens to be a mage. He is about to hit lvl 15.  Now for the little time I have been playing I have done a lot of research into the mage and the spells he will get, and even I can see a problem with the higher lvl spells, and the problems with 90% of our summoned items.  Now since I am so new to the game if these changes and suggestions that have been made don't get implemented or a reasonable explanation is given as to why they didn't you will probably cause several of the higher lvl mages who have spent some much time on this game not to mention the monthly fee to play to just quit and find another online game.  By the way becuase EQ is so successful there are going to be alot more online roleplaying games to choose from.  For me i will probably just make a necro since I haven't had the headaches that these higher mages have. I just thought i would post this perspective to see what people think and to see if I at least understand how upset most mages are.  <P><BR>Iadwen<BR>Level 14 Mage<P>P.S.  Verant I didn't mean this as a threat.  I simply wanted to point out a possible consequence for alienating an entire class.  Overall I think EQ is an amazing game and i would hate to lose players that are out there who are obviously very passionate about this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just thought I'd toss in a funny observation to this thread :)<BR>I think its funny that some people complain we are the pet class and its a little unfair that almost everyone now has pets. Yet they still want some sort of mana regen, which makes me think, enchanters used to be the only real crack dealers but now it seems every class hsa it :)<P>Don't give us mana regen, we shouldn't have it and wizzies shouldn't have it either but oh well (they claim it sucks anyway but I'd love to see the complaints if they lost it :). Make us better in battle not having quicker down time. Soloing should have downtime and I feel that our downtime now is acceptable after battle. It's just our performance in battle that is not.<P>It seems to me that the way class balancing has been taking place overall is to give each class something from another class. Give druids and shamans pets, give wizzies crack, give necros a little bit of everything, give mages dots, give, give, give...sigh. The class definitions are becoming more blurred and blurred and I actually find that to be discouraging :(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few things i would like to see.<P>1. I realize sword of runes got nurfed for a reason, that i understand. But i really liked it when it would proc all the time and so did several other mages. So what i was thinking is that maybe you could give mages a spell that changes the status of a mob to summoned. true this would be more of a enchanter spell. but even if it were given to enchanters this would help us mages.<BR>2. to often do i get into a zone with a druid summon my pet and start heading to where the group is going to be camping. being a air elemental fan, the druid sows me but not the pet. even if i summon a earth. then the group takes of running. This leaves me with 3 options. (1)dont summon a pet till i get to the camp and hope that i dont get into trouble on my way there. (2) summon a pet and keep up with group leaving my pet behind to agro everything, thats just bad news. (3) walk slow and stop frequently to wait for pet and hope i dont get lost cuz my group out distanced me. I would like to see a personal pet only Sow type spell for mages that way in the case that i have a air pet that is invis and cant be targeted i can use F1 to target and cast the spell.<BR>3. Last and most important. One of the resons pets are not allowd on raids, is cuz they break mezzes. this could be easily fixed by haveing the /pet back off command work 100% of the time. regardless of how much dmg the mob is doing to it.<P>the rest are just cool wish list stuff.<P>4. Voice graft for magicians would be cool.<BR>5. first time the mage summons a pet he picks a name (one for each type of summon) from then on all pets have the same name.<BR>6. this one would be kinda big but cool. If there was a way to controll the pet from first person. like a vision graft that allowd controll. one of the draw backs could be the mage has to be sitting. and once you are controling your pet there is no going back untill the spell wears off or pet death. then if the caster got attacked you would have to taunt it off with the pet. also the pet would get some skills to work up Like taunt and 1 hand slashing. Each time you summon a pet it has the same name (that caster picked first time it summoned it) and the stats that it had previus to death or zone. Each pet earth, air, ect. would have their own name and stats that the mage would work up. This would also be a good new class to start you could call it mindwalkers or something and maybe they would do it to mobs as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can the rate of magician spell component drops be increased?<P>Our research has always been the most difficult in the game, but I'm not having difficulty creating my spells...it's getting the spell components.<P>In my average day of hunting for say, 5 hours, I will loot on average 10+ necro words, 12-15+ enchanter writs, 12-15+ wizard runes, and .5 magician word and/or component (wing of xegony, flame of vox, etc.)  That's right, I average looting a single mage component about every 10 hours..or 20 times less than all other words/runes.<P>There are some mobs which after weeks of nonstop killing have never dropped a single mage component...but they drop necro words, runes and writs & tomes at the average rate of 1:4.  Are there specific mobs which have a higher drop rate of magician components?<P>Also, I usually wind up having to buy various spell components to create my spells...and I'm buying my 39 & 44 components off 55+ players hunting in 50+ zones!  Is there some reason why our components are dropping at normal rates off mobs 10-15 levels higher than the lvl spell created?<P>Killing level 35 dwarves will yield you necro, wizard and enchanter components for level 34 spells and below.  Yet, after soloing exclusively from level 40-44 on dwarves, I looted only three mage words (1 level 29, two level 24) and zero components.<P>I'd appreciate the drop rates checked, or a valid reason why our drop rates are intentionally broke.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>   I suspect there's a slight problem with the drop rates.  My guess (from observation) is that research components all come from one loot table with uniform probability.  It's a big list of all the runes, pages, words, etc, and you just pick one once you make the "drop a research component" roll.  However, all the spells but mage pet spells use unique components.  Each spell is in there once, essentially.  Classes with more spells to research will show up more often, and rightly so.  But, you need four copies of each mage word to do the four pet spells.  Those words should be in the table four times as often to represent their increased frequency of need.  Just having the item in there once would mean they only appear one-forth as often as they should.  It would be easy to double-check, I would think.<BR> <BR>   Other than that, it seems to be random luck to me.  You're at the mercy of the random number generator as to what you get.<P>   A bigger can of worms is balancing the drop rates against the actual server population that needs them.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lots of good ideas on this thread, so I hope it gets read all the way thru.  Some more items:<P>- Give Mages teleports to the Elemental Planes. <BR>I like what you're doing with upgrading druid and shaman healing.  It's pretty clear that it increases everyone's fun if there are Classes that are Masters in an essential area, and additional classes that are 'journeymen' level, to fill in (in a limited way) when needed.<P>Now, Wizards get teleports both across Norrath and to the Planes.  Druids get teleports across Norrath.  What is missing is someone to do teleports to just the Planes.  Make it specific if you like, or give out other teleports to other classes where it makes sense, which leads to.....<P>- A general improvement in teleports.  It looks like Verant has been trying to make Religion actually matter to players.  This has a downside, since Religion can only ever be acquired at Character Birth.  But, disregarding that, here's my suggestion:  A God should want to see and reward their advanced followers.  So make available spells that are teleports to every Plane housing a Diety.  Make them lvl 50, or even 45.  But make them scribable, and usable, only by the followers of the God of that particular Plane.  Since Religios choice follows Race, rather than Class, what this amounts to is giving high level players of every Class a chance to teleport.  But it limits them to only *one* teleport possibility, to the plane of their God.  Adds something to the game, gives it a more RP flavor, without being a big imbalance or squashing the Expertise of Wizards and Druids.  Note also, that i think of these as Individual teleports, not Group teleports.<P>My characters are all too low to go on any Plane raids, so I don't know how feasible this is -- is the teleport point on every plane a deathtrap, making an Individual teleport a dangerous thing?  (Though I've been playing since just after EQ went public, i tend to do the time-killing things rather than experience-generating things).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't bother changing the compontent for Phantom Armor just make it use 1 cats eye agate instead of 4.<P>This would be well in keeping with our pet spells which use malachite from level 4 to level 60.<P>And as it stands Phantom Armor is not anywhere near the usefulness of the damage absorption line of spells.  Where a sheildskin like spell can block out a round of melee damage allowing you to cast.  The 18 AC from Phantom Armor while it would be great for a tank does diddly to stop monsters from pounding a magician into goo (with their low AC's around the mid 600 range).  As a defensive spell it's completely useless.  As a regen spell it's not too bad.  <P>If Phantom Line is to become a good defensive spell on the level of the same usefulness as damage absorption skins the amount of ac it gives needs to bring magician AC into the mid 800's IE a raise of 200-500 AC. Which is never going to happen so, blah.  <P>As it stands this spell sees use as a downtime healing spell, not for any protective value it gives.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I posted this on the broken thread but I'm not sure if it will get read there so I'll post it here.<P>The worst pathing I've ever seen anywhere in Norrath has got to be the Plane of Sky.  The lag images and the pathing is just horrendous.  I love the idea of the place but omg is it horrible.  And for convienience sake, turn on CoH in the Plane of Sky.  Also in sky make keys to islands go forward and back, so you can go up and down throughout sky.<P>As a mage of Prexxus &lt;the only god I could choose&gt;  I often wonder why I have 75% fire spells in my arsenal, and 25% magic spells.  I'm not a worshipper of Solusek Ro, even if I wanted to be.  I wonder when on this great earth I'll get something with ICE in the name.  Something that does cold damage.  Shoot even a cold based damage shield.  But a cold based bolt would be great, and they're very cool looking too.<P>Also I'm wondering why mages recieved Imbue Fire Opal.  Why even put our name on the list when we can't choose the one god that the spell is for?<P>I've helped kill phin a good 7 times before the epic quest and saw two water Mastery staffs drop, since I have killed him about 8 times and not seen one.  In fact most of the drops have been the all mighty Mana tapping and malicement rods.  His drops no longer are three drops and should be looked at and at least increase the drop on the mastery staff, or make it drop someplace easy like you did for the Robe of Kedge.  <P>I've seen inno drop maybe twice, he didn't drop anything mage worthy either time.  Same with the water staff, make the earth staff drop somewhere else other than inno.  <P>instead of just putting the staff elsewhere, make up two quests so that mages can quest for their staffs instead.  Have a water Mastery Staff quest start in Ocean of Tears and maybe the earth Mastery Staff quest start on the island between qeynos and odus.  Throw us a bone here.  I'm trying to do my quest but visiting the same place after place with no rewards is getting me down.  I'll even write up the quests!<P>Just as a rant:  My guild along with several others cleared sky up to island 7, cleared 7 2 and a half times.  Not one single Crown of Elemtary Mastery dropped.  Again, drop status should be checked.<P>Maybe an upgrade to CoH, a little faster cast time, for alittle more mana. Or a more expensive reagent.<P>well, got longer than I was gonna put, so just make sure you revamp the pathing in SKY, it is the worst.<P>Agla Magus Sator<BR>Immortal<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I hope this gets read despite Absor's note that seems to indicate this thread discussion is over, only 2 days after it was started.<P>===To Solo or not to Solo===<BR>Okay I'm confused here, is the point of the game to Solo or to group? Everything I've ever read about the game as a whole says the goal is to promote grouping.  so if the Mage class is supposed to be geared toward soloing, then lets treat it as such, I dont see this happening, honestly Necro's and Druid's can solo much better, or at the least much Safer than mages.  If the goal is to not make us soloers, then plese make us more desirable for groups.  My lv 20 Druid has 10 times more success getting into groups than my 30 mage, and my druid can solo better. I haven't tried to solo and even con with my mage since his low teens.  Yet my druid can easily take yellows on a regular basis, and I'm in the same place at lv 20 (ill omen) that I was when my mage was lv 20.<P>I think the biggest issue here for me, in regards to this soloing issue, is this:  The pet taunting is a joke.  My guess is that when a pet attacks a mob, we get partial (or full) credit for all the damage that they do.  I have have personally watched Mobs race toward me as my mob attacks it, even though I haven't done a single point of damage to them personally.  Why is this?  When was the last time a mob charged toward the Wizard, away from the warrior pounding on it, even though the Wizard hadn't nuked it yet.  If I haven't cast on the mob, it should not be coming after me.  And then heaven forbid I cast on the target, then he'll never get off me, and unlike a Druid or wizard I dont have any way to keep away from him. Oh and dont tell me that,s what an earth pet is for, it's root spell is not that effective.<P>We are supposed to be the master of summoned stuff, right?  okay so why aren't we?  why do Druids get the ward summoned line WAY before us? they get ward at 5, we get it at 12, and then 2 levels later at 14 they already get the next one.  I dont even know why the druid has this line.<P>I disagree with the idea that we should be able to "Charm" summoned creatures, that is not our thing, but we should be able to send them back to where they came from (read as kill), REAL easily.  Chraming is not within the "concept" of our class.  Neither are DoTs or having Evoc DDs.<P>Here are my other thoughts and requests:<P><BR>===Pet Names===<BR>I would like to be able to have my pet addressed in a tell, just like I do an NPC, can you add %p or something like it so we can insert a pets name, no matter what it is?<P>===Pet Health Bars===<BR>Akherat said: Pet health bars - green line through the mages hp like the blue line on xp for pet health would be sweet.<P>I Think Akherat's idea is a brilliant solution  (adding the blue bar to Xp was Awesome on Verant's part)<P>===Pet command radius===<BR>If this is less than the normal "Say" range (and I'm pretty sure it is), it should be changed to equal it.  Whatever it is now it too short though.<P>nuff said for now.<P>Zauber Vizekonig, mage of the 30th rank<BR>AeRo server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, a couple of things. <P>The Magician class should have never had Dots. As a mage, I would have no issues if it was taken out. <P>Further more, we should have never been allowed to do magic based damage. It should have been Fire and Cold for offenses, and earth and air defenses .... if you are going to use the 'elemental theme'. <P>As it stands now the 'elementalist' term has lot a lot of perspective. <P>We should have however Root. Earth being an element, we should have been the FIRST after druids to get it. Nothing to do with power, but with the 'theme' of the class. Or summon a ring of earth with the Root effect. <P>Instead of summon waterstone, it should have been summon ring of water, e.t.a. This is what the Mage class lacks. <P>Instead, at 50 they made us overpowered offensively and  compensated with non upgrade pets post Kunark and our nuking power post 50 curbed severly. As a matter of fact, we have even lost the number 2 nuking spot, after wizards. <P>A Mage past 50 has one spell to look for ...... Call of the Hero. <P>As for the debuffs ? I don;t get this either. What this has to do with my class. do I like it ? Yes. But someone has to point out to me what this has to do with an Arcane Elemental summoner.<P>IMHO - we should have never gotten Malase, never gotten Dots, never had magic based DD. Cold is resisted more than Magic, but shesh, at least I would feel like a mage.  Instead of Shock of Swords, it should have been Shock of Ice. Conj based ice damage.<P>We should have added cold to the Mage line of spells, root, and any other 'earth shaking spells' (useless as they may be). <P>I do not have an issue with a slight loss of 'shooting power' actually, because we are a summoning, or THE summoning class. However, pets should have more control under a mage. And not to throw a spanner in the works, but Golly Gee Batman, it should not be a surprise that most Mage's thought our Kunark pets would look different. If any class should have felt special about their pets, it should have been the Mage.<P>Monster summoning was a solid step in the right direction with Velious. We got something that was a 'nifty ability' but offered no Power, just a flavour, because no mage will summon that pet verses his usual choice in a raid. But you then lost it when you gave us Dots. <P>In conclusion, I know you feel the class is 'balanced' Absor, I do not see it as. I see the Mage as a class that has had a series of bad choices made, that to rectify them would mean a strong overhaul of the class, because there is not much you can give us that would not make us overpowered. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, let me start off by saying that I love my mage, but I'm still a ways from the "post 50" game, so I'll spare you my uninformed opinion on such matters.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <P>I really like the proposed change to LD.  It would also be nice to keep my pet, but I don't know what it would do while I was in AI mode...  Probably would be a bit unbalancing in PvP for an LD (AI controlled) player to also have a pet.<P>Summoned stuff was in another thread, but I would like to see a few pieces of summoned armor added to our repertoire, along with the oft-requested procing weapons  .  (and beer, definately beer)<P>Pathing is horrid in any dungeon with walls.  Go from there.  Basically read VI's own warning about auto-follow and then add the tendancy of the pet to find "alternate" routes if a straight path doesn't seem available.  Seperation on the vertical axis is also likely to confuse a pet and send it running for the nearest aggressive mob. A specific example would be that I cannot get my pet to follow me out of the basement of High Keep.<P>I would like to be able to name my pet, or at least have a %p chat variable for my pet for more interesting social buttons.  i.e. "/bonk %p, /say %p, tell %t thank you for that nice buff!" or "/pet guard me, /say To me, %p!" or even "/tell %p /pet back off"<P>Cooler pet graphics are a plus, and I really think all illusions should stay with the 'chanters.  I would rather see a series of elemental buffs (perhaps castable on others) than a self-only elementalform spell.<P>I agree that DoT's don't make sense, we seem to be more the DD type.  :confuse<P>I would like improved invisibility, but I don't see why we (or anyone besides enchanters) DESERVE it, as everybody else seems to think.  <P>Give necros the AE pet fear resistance buff (Calm of Death) at 51, and let us summon an item with a few charges of it at 59.  (okay, so I don't know what I'm talking about firsthand, but it made sense to me)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Pet health bars rock! :cool 'nuf said.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome&lt;&lt;<P>Absor you are so wrong.  The mage is not wanted in average group, not anymore than any other class ( aside from enchanter and cleric ).  Malo is not a big advantige because malosi works just as well.   On raids, all that is required is one mage for CotH and malo, thats it.  You say our pets make us desired, but thats not true, the only thing a pet offers is more damage, which can be easily equalled and surpast by most other classes.

The 20-25 levels green mobs with sow that will kill a magican of 55-60th level will die to a melee without the melee character breaking a sweat. Ooh scary 1 to 2 bars of health damage, you've got me quaking in my boots now.  <P>My alts a 55 warrior so I speak from experience.  I cut Yun shamans, Sarnak Extremists, Raptors into rations and stuff them in my backpack and regen the health loss with a regen tunic in on the way to selebis/chardok.<P>If a magician stands and fights with spells = magician bits all over the landscape. Do you think a magician is going to get off gate while being quad hit for 90-110's? No, I don't think so.<P>Note magicians don't get inate sow either. In a market of sow potions, sow casters as common as grains of sand on a beach, and jboots a warrior has all the same retreat options as a magician.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor, i do hope you decide to read this.  I have played a magician to level 36 and i have experienced several problems and lacks i think should be changed, so here they are.  Ok here in are some ideas for changes in the mage class.<P>1.) Up our pets power.  A little more dmg per hit, like say at level 60 your pet might hit for 70 each time, id say it should do 100-120.  Also our pets seem to have close to no resistances to spells. I would like to see our pets atleast have a pc's resistance levels if they seem to be so weak.<P>2.) Up nuking power post 50.  Granted im not level 50+ yet, but ive read ALOT of this and mages dont seem to complain.  Most of the eq community has come to recognize that mages are the second best nukers in the game, but this starts to fall away at 35 and continues dropping at 50+.  I would like a minor boost in our nuking dmg and also a major boost in the resistability of our nukes.  Alot of the time i will not get full dmg on most of my nukes, even with evoc maxed in skill.  That problem causes a mage's nuking power to be mediocre.<BR>3.) and now to a new proposition.  Give mages more things to do offensively than just a few nukes every other spell circle.  I would like to say first off that the dot's are a great idea, WTG VI.  You guys at VI have come up with alot of great ideas and i would like you all to give mages a few more options offensively, as to ideas im kinda at a loss here but im sure you guys can pull something cool outta your sleeves.<P>Thanks,<BR>Nemeth Darchant<BR>Level 36 Magician, The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know you're probably sick of hearing about this, but anywho - do something about the Mastery focus items! I really only have a problem with the Earth one, but I know you've heard too much about that. My suggestion - make them all questable, as well as drop from big big nasties. A mid level mage has no problem getting all of the lesser focus items solo, why shouldnt a 50+ mage be able to get the improved versions solo? Make them all like tiny epic quests, but soloable by, maybe, a 55th mage. I know this would increase the rate at which epics come into the world a great deal, but at the rate they're coming in now, thats not necessarily a bad thing. The whole epic quest should probably be re-tuned anyways. Even with soloable quested mastery items, its still quite tough, although I'm not sure it'd be tough enough to be on par with other classes epics...<P>But basically, I want soloable but tough mastery item quests. Okay?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Speaking of which considering we have to deep six 2 out of 3 mastery staves for the elemental orbs  for the epic quest and each elemental orb has no stats.  Each orb should still act as a pet focus for elementals over 49+.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
