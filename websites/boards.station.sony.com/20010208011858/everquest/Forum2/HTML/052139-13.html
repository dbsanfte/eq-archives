</FONT><HR>Make GoK and Rapture useful in Velious. These spells were meant to mez high level mobs, but it's basically useful for shrooms and juggs in sebilis and that's it. Not like an enchanter is going to mez down a train with this and will save some of the hassle of kiting/tanking mobs in PoG. There will still be plenty of that going on if the enchanters are able to mez mobs with those mana hungry spells, but as it is PoG requires one very bored enchanter. We get dictate at 60, an uber charm spell. So where is our uber mez spell?<P>Personally, I could care less about illusions unless you are going to add a function to them. The most amusing one we have is minor illusion, and I find that handles all the group entertaining that needs to be done. If it's not going to be utilitarian, please don't bother with it.<P>Saw a comment by you, Absor, saying that you thought enchanters were overpowered at the early levels. Not sure what levels you meant exactly, but enchanters have it pretty rough until about the mid 30's. Adding breeze was probably a major boon to everyone that couldn't get groups until level 29, but the fact of the matter is enchanters die, and die a lot. There *might* be a potential to be overpowered in some situations, but you would really have to know your stuff. I had played EQ for a year before being an enchanter, and it's like a whole new game as an enchanter. As far as being "overpowered" from the mid 30's on...yes we are highly in demand, and a requirement for any dungeon group. However, this is a function of game mechanics and not enchanters...any nerfing you do along this line threatens what people like about EQ (of course, they don't like not getting groups...but when they do get groups they love it...just because enchanters have it easy in that respect does not make us overpowered). But I'm not sure in what aspect we can be overpowered? We don't solo so hot (I still end up dead whenever I try even at 56 ;p), and pretty much we only bring one thing to a group and that's increased efficincy in the form of mana regen, speed buffs, and crowd control. Any nerfs will equal a decreased efficiency for everyone that plays the game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not an enchanter, but I noticed a trend when grouped with an enchanter that perhaps can be adjusted. It seems that when in a full group enchanters I come across will buff the melee classes with their haste spells and then eventually stop doing it because of the high mana cost, since they need their mana for mezzes, clarity, etc. Can you look into either lowering the mana cost of those spells or perhaps increasing their duration slightly to make it easier for enchanters to keep the melee classes buffed? Might look into doing this for shamans too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On raids we get MANY requests for shissar speed, clarity2, rune5 and enlightment (for resists purpose).<P>Requests are generally sent in tells to avoid raid spam and several chanters wasting mana on same target. Other benefit is if the chanter is afk, the player is informed and the request can be redirected.<BR>Last but not least the chanter can cycle through the requests in tell using /r to be sure he got everyone requets.<P>Then most of us use /target nameofplayertobebuffed<BR>and then cast.<P>This is quite boring on long raid but necessary to be efficient.<P>WHAT I SUGGEST :<P>Implement a commmand /rT% or whatever.<P>Means you have a tell from your lvl 60 warrior Arghhaoghieuuber "Da Shissar plz !".<BR>You use /rT% then he is targetted and you can buff.<BR>Would avoid LOTS of boring typing.<P>Eclair<BR>(Bristlebane,RoV)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>"you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters." and "Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd<BR>control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools."<P>Response:<BR>You are wrong for the most part...at lvl 50+ (more like 55+) we basicly cant do anything and is VERY hard to get in a group. We cant contribute to a fight AT ALL. We cant even cast Rune on a fighter because that mob (which the warrior has been taunting and has the mob down to 1/2) will stop attacking him and come after us. Only thing we can do is haste and clarity. Shamen have better hastes than us...so we are stuck with just casting clarity. So let me get this right...lets say there is going to be a raid. They have 4 warriors, some hybreds, a couple of rogues, like 3 clerics, several other hybreds that heal, and 1 enchanter. Why would you need more than one enchanter in a raid because WE CAN ONLY CAST CLARITY? Actually I take that back...the last 2 dungeon crawls I went on, there were 2 or 3 enchanters. The reason is so there is still someone to cast Clarity and Rune after one dies from casting rune on a War.<P>I remember when I hit lvl 31. It was my first death cycle. I died 24 times in that level. Before then it was only like 7-8 times a level. I came REAL close to quitting. I didnt know that that would be the about the average amount of times you die during a level for an enchanter. 7-8 hits and your gone.<P>Another thing is that it is easy to get in a group (below lvl 55)...that is as long as there is a group without an enchanter. If the group already has one, why waste a spot on another? That is how most groups think.<P>From all the characters I have played. Enchanters are probably the most fun but in NO WAY the easiest. In fact, I would say they are the hardest characters to play. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay... its taken me two days but i've finaly hashed through this stuff. <P>I AM going to repeat what others have said due to repetition being the only to prove these issues are not minor. Repetition and putting an issue in front of people MULTIPLE times is the only way to get it noticed and REMEMBERED.<P>On Choosing a God:<BR>Good lord how I wish someone had told me to NOT pick a god when I first got this game. By the time I found out, I had to choose between several months of hard work in getting my character to the level it was... or to start over in a "Proper" enchanter. I opted to not startover and now at 54 I am daming myself nearly daily.  Will I start a little chanter? Start all over? No, not with the reduction in power that an enchanter accuires as they are leveling (aka, getting more powerful??) In high level encounters, we are usless if a necro and bard are around. I have upon occasion gone back to my home city of Felweithe .. to those small enchanters and explained the God issue to them. Nearly every one of them have erased their first character and made an agnostic enchanter.  ... and those few that did not, i've heard them wish they have. <P>On Illusions: <BR>Ya, great fun! At least till you have to USE them. As an enchanter, not doing the Tashiana quest is not even an option. However, being a HIE Enchantress who chose Tunare for a God (Slaps self in head) ... at least one death is unavoidable. Illusions SHOULD hide gods! Illusions DID hide gods!<BR>The statistical adds of our illusion? Nominal at best. There are a few usefull ones: Illusion Air elemental, Illusion Water Elemental. (Althose these are negated by LinkDeath to the point that I rarely if ever use them.) Speaking of that... why do the illusion fade upon LD? Invis does not. Lev does not. <P>On an enchanter soloing: <BR>An enchanter CAN solo in the prime of their career. (24 - 45). You just have to find what and where. YES it is INCREDIBLY risky, but it can be done. However, after 45... you are a group ONLY character. Well.. thats not too bad, thats where most of your skills lie. Crowd control...<P>On Crowd Control (Kunark and Velious specificly)<BR>Kunark - We can still function in a limited manner. We can still function enough to be a wanted member of a group. <P>Velious - A disaster for an enchanter. This continent takes away all that an enchanter IS and we become the clarity and speed issuing pez machine. What about our debuffing and mezing abilities you ask? They are non-existant in this land. There are a few things here and there that can be mezzed (upon repeated tries as you get resisted MULTIPLE times on a GREEN con)[Side note: A GREEN panther killed me simply because mez was resisted, color flux was resisted and root was resisted. I could not get away.] Of those few things that can be mezzed, the ones that cant be mezzed LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME! Some even have the same con. There is NO WAY to tell that you are useless against it in any other way then to soak up a bit of damage before you die to offer your group a few seconds more time. The "Nomez" flag and insanely high magic resist is WAY overused in this continent. <P>On Enchanter garb and equipment: <P>We are the only class that MUST keep TWO stats as high as possible. Very often at the sacrificing of AC. However most all new equipment (Kunark and Velious)lists only one stat (int usualy) and VERY low ac. We more than other Int/Wiz casting classes are EXPECTED to take a beating. We have to engage the creatures BEFORE everyone else which puts us to the top of the agro list. There have been cases where i've had TWO clerics and two druids all to myself to keep me alive long enough to tashiania a creature to give others a better chance at landing some sort of magical hit. <P>On Enchanter Agro:<BR>The tash line agro is INSANE. I have waited till a creature is at half life and has been Malo'd to cast a tash against it and it will make a bee-line to me to kill me. What is with that agro??<P>On Enchanter Spells:<P>Lull line, WTYH Line, Sentinal.<P>Useless spells. Lull is a suicide wish. It does NOT stick. It does NOT lull.  WTYH breaks with a bash or stun? When is a creature NOT getting sunned or bashed when it is being attacked? Again, death to the chanter! Sentinal... nice way to make people yell at you. <P>Mez and charm. The bread and butter of the enchanter. The DEFINING characteristic of the enchanter. Yes, charm is supposed to be unreliable because it can be so powerful. However at higher levels, it is insanely reisted. Or more often "That creature can not be charmed". I have stopped using this spell. Heck, I only used it a few levels anyway due to the high resists, high agro and low reliability.  <P>As an enchanter grows up we are expeted to get better at our crowd control. We are expected to be masters at this. It is our PRIMARY function. Clarity and its like are all secondary.  However, in actuality, we get worse. What mezes we have to use against these higher creatures are so very mana expensive that even with a necro feeding you, a bard playing manasong and C2/Gift of whatever/Brilliance on you, you can only cast five or six times. Out of that five or six, three or four are resisted (yes, with tash and malo). These are TOO mana expensive. <P>There are other minor things that I FULLY agree with in the previous posts. However, the above are my main concerns. I want to be a valuable group member. I want to be able to mez that creature that a necro can "screaming fear (aka mez)". (there have been times where i've been told: We have a bard for mana regen and a Necro for crowd control, we dont need an enchanter)<P>At the end of these concerns I do want to say one thing. THANK YOU for the new jewl craft item. Blue Diamond craft. They are wonderful! I just wish Blue Diamonds were more plentiful.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thank you for reading my post. <P>Aaearie Warsoul<BR>54 Enchantress, Brell Serilis<BR>Legion of Heroes<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please give us a Charm spell that works on targets 58 and under that is not a fixed duration.<P>Please fix the time that is required to memorize the level 60 charm spell (currently 8 mins)<P>Please increase the duration of the 51+ mes line of spells or decrease the mana it takes to cast them.<P>Please change the spells on the new quest armor for enchanters.  Replace them with something more usefull for high level enchanters.  At level 60 Clarity 1 on the robe (12 sec recast) is about as usefull as 2 boobs on a bull not to mention Reclaim Energy on the bracer.<BR>Maybe a fix for this would be a new quest that requires you to turn in alike items from hate and the quest armor for something more usefull a high level enchanter could use.<P><BR>Lastly, at high levels enchanters are just buff machines. This is very boring.<P>You stated earlier :<P>&gt;So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are a few changes that would perfect the enchanter class.<P>First off, on the topic of illusions, i believe every illusion should be able to cast on others.  This would greatly enchance the usefulness of illusions.  For example, the 10ac bonus you get with the earth elemental illusion, this would be a great buff to toss on a melee character, but as far as being a enchanter jumping into the melee mix, this spell isn't going to do much for me.  Many of the illusions would be great to help a group.  I believe this idea is touched on with the group werewolf form, but the others should be available too.  There are potions that do the same as the earth elemental illusion so this would not greatly unbalance the world of EQ.  Make the illusion cost twice as much and last a few minutes.  Make the enchanter use strategy to choose the best illusion for each group member.  This would act uniqueness to groups and to enchanters.<P>As far as illusions not being able to hide the enchanters illusion, this makes no sense.  The argument is that enchanters would be able to go anywhere if the illusion hid the religion.  If the purpose of illusions is not to make us masters of disguise with the ability to go anywhere, then what is the purpose?!?  As much as i like to entertain the group by switching illusions, this will grow old.  I just do not see how a classes idenity is what causes it to be overpowered.  <P>The last thing i would like to see added to an enchanter, is an adjustment to the suffocate line of spells.  I would like to see a slow element added to the line.  Similiar to snare or darkness.  Enchanters are traffic cops of the mobs.  I would trade off just about anything for the snare type spell.<P>On a final note about balance and overpowered.  I believe enchanters are a unique class that one enchanter is necassary for a group, but a second one offers far less then other classes.  I believe a class that was overpowered would need no other class in order to survive.  An Enchanter is invaluable to the group, a second enchanter offers little more then companionship.  With the improvements i mentioned enchanters would not be takeing jobs from others, we would enchance other classes.<P>Thanks for your time.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I havent read this entire thread as it is just too darned long  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But i think Enchanters in PvP at high lvls are extremely underpowered. PvP is just too overlooked and it really ticks those of us who live and breathe for it off. First off Enchanters dont do damage...we all know that. But seeing as how the majority of decent items have MR on them we kinda get the shaft. And dont tell me "oh well just tash" cuz even with tash people tend to have higher than 100 MR easily too. Tash is nerfed in PvP too so it doesnt even do full MR debuff like it would on a mob. Its frustrating when you cant land a single spell on someone 8 levels below you and you end up having to run or die because of it. Also our Glamour/rapture series isnt worth using in pvP as it has a huge mana cost. In pvp gear you have significantly less total mana and we just cant use Theft of Thought enough to keep it coming back. I seriously dont see why our spells are as resistable as they are compared to just about anyone. If you want to debate about that stuff then i'm sure you will bring up Torment of argli. Sure its LESS resistable but still resisted a ton. And its a dot unless i am mistaken so it really ruins our mezzes since thats what most of us rely on just as much, if not more, than our "nukes".<P> Another thing is our pets. i mean we can control peoples minds(ok nevermind charming PCs was taken away from us) but we cant control a pet? You say we arent a "pet class' but guess what? We're are only one of two  classes to have a pet from lvl 1 on up. Now i know whats gonna come now when i say that Shaman pets are better and that mage/Necro pets are better. Well mage and necro pets should be better...but shaman? They can control their little doggy but they cant cast it until their mid 30's? There's got to be some logic behind this that i just cant see. Basically Enchanter pets suck and charm isnt nearly as reliable anyone would like to use it efficiently without getting killed by our own pets after 2 seconds of fight because charm wore off and you didnt see the message. <P> Thats another thing. Charm is almost worthless to me. I havent used it in a really long time due to it wearing off too soon and getting me dead. The message is annoying sure but you can just keep your distance so once ya see them running at you you can run. I can max out all my stats its still oging to wear off at the worst times and end up killing me or chasing me out of the zone where i have to sit and med and heal up  and hope no one takes my spot. Which just makes for MORE downtime which gets annoying.<P> In closing Enchanters are really at a loss in PvP now and it shows. We are no match for a necro, shaman, wizards, mages or even tanks since tanks damage isnt nerfed in pvp like it SHOULD be. But thats another topic entirely. Enchanters ar ethe ONLY casting class that has to work on getting two stats up. Int and Cha. Which leaves hardly any room for resist gear. Now i bet yer gonna say "oh well necros need -cha." Yeah well they may need it but it seems ever since Kunark and now Velious came out Verant has catered to Necros once again. I've noticed a trend since Kunark. Seems the majority of the really nice items are necro items. Gee wonder why that is? I cant imagine what class you all play at home. What really ticks me off is there arent that many items that are equivalent for other classes. For instance: Hand of the Reaper. Where is anything even closely being equivicable for any other caster? Aint none bubba. Necros are spoiled and i hate them.  I dont even fight them anymore unles they are half dead and without a pet already. Which doesnt evenget me bragging rights since they can still kill me in one spell that uses less mana than it should and can also lifetap to full health since i cant damage them since their MR is too high since most have 100+ MR  since you deem it necessary to do everything in your power to help necros and hurt enchanters. <P><BR>Puinsai Da'Kine<BR>Buyaka SHonuff<P>Sick of the nerfs...sick of being underpowered in pvp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a suggestion for a new type of spell which would fit well with enchanters as being masters of the mind and illusion:<P>Illusory Damage<BR>---------------<BR>Damage done to targets that is very real (from the target's perspective) unless dispelled or it fades away.<BR>---------------<P>These could be implemented as dots or as dd's which contain an enchantment component with a duration.  In both cases, a magical enchantment is left on the mob in question that can be dispelled and will fade after a certain time.  If the spell fades or is dispelled before the mob is dead, the damage done by the illusory spell would be "healed" as if it never had been done in the first place.<P>I think if these were post 50 spells, they could help with the enchanters not being quite as effecive (not being able to mez or charm) at the higher levels.  If these were on par with wizard spells of equivalent level, but were limited by the fact that the damage could be negated by time or dispel (and even possibly only one dd on a mob at a time, since they wouldn't stack?), we wouldn't be trodding on wizard's toes.  Also, the added prospect of illusory damage would add a very interesting aspect to our tactical fighting game of EverQuest. <P>--------------<BR>Possibly the target is attacked flying swords that it couldn't do anything to defend against... all illusion, of course.  If the spell strikes a killing blow (by finishing it off), the target would think itself dead and cease to live.  However, if it manages to dispel these phantoms, it would no longer be plagued and instead realize the truth of the situation.<BR>--------------<P>Of course I still wouldn't mind still playing with Charm/Mez (as we Chanters rightfully should do =) ) post level 50.<P>Aeryllia Mystnar<BR>Level 48 Chantress<BR>Tarrew Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing Baldur's gate recently and I had an idea for enchanters.  There is a spell in D&D called minor spell trigger.  It allows you to pick two spells for instant release at a later point.  I think this would be a perfect spell for enchanters.  Obviously, this spell would need a regent.  Also, since you would be letting the spells get cast instantaneously, you would have to have a long casting time for this spell, like the enchant silver line of spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since there are 4oo+ posts in front of me, I haven't had time to read them all (yet).  I do not know if this has been mentioned anywhere else, and may not actually be considered 'balancing', but it related directly to enchanters.<P>There needs to be something to do with the Mana Potion spell line.  I would strongly suggest that for each and every spell, the resulting mana potion have at least 5 distinct products using this item in each crafting discipline.  This includes all crafts -- Alchemy, Baking, Brewing, Fishing, Fletching, Jewelcraft, Poison Making, Pottery, Tailoring, Tinkering and Smithing.  So far, tailoring is the only skill that uses these potions to any degree.<P>I would suggest that these manufactured items have some form of clickable effect, similar to many other items in the game.  The power of the items, and bonuses added should be scaled appropriately to the level of the mana potion used.  The lowest level might make a 1 charge item, while the others might make 3, 6, 10 and 15 charges.<P>To restrict the profit potential for this change, remove the gemstone component requirements for these spells!  This would allow the potions to sell for reasonable amounts (cost of the vial), so that the costs of the final product (from the trade skills) would not be well out of line with its overall component costs and the rendered effect.<P>Examples of this could include:<P>Magic cookies (non-stackable) effect: Strength +3 for 15 minutes (stacks with all strength buffs).<P>Normal weapon -- effect:  becomes magical for 5 minutes and adds 3 damage to the weapon.<P>Gate and Bind potions (non-combinable).  Allows melees to bind and gate.<P>Hand held Totem -- effect: increases one stat by 4 for 10 minutes, stacks with all buffing spells.<P>Magic Arrows (stackable) -- effect: arrow does not disappear for 3 shots, but adds 5 to the arrow damage for each of these shots.<P>------------------<BR>A second point, also concerning crafting skills,  reduce the number of Enchant metal spells to a single spell -- Enchant Ore.  Hold the metal to be enchanted and cast the spell.  Use gemstone components that are all store bought.  The target metal determines which gemstone is used.  This has two effects -- it makes the price of crafted items more in line with their abilities, and it adds the Enchante Medium Quality ore that is currently missing.<P>Mendel<BR>Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doh, I missed the start of the thread. Oh well, at least I got a chance to read through most of the posts. <P>I won't go in any order of importance (I will start off with current spells):<P>     Lull series:<BR>Bad spell line. Very bad. The resist rate is way to high and it aggros the mobs. <BR>2 possible fixes: 1) reduce the resist rate to around the Druid spell Harmony. ( unlikly, I know. Lulls can be cast inside, harmony cannt.)<BR>                  2) Remove the aggro side effect for a resist. <P>If you do neither, then just remove the spell. it is useless as it currently stand. ( Its a train on the enchanter/cleric spell)<P><BR>          WTYH series<BR>It breaks way too easily. Bashes and stuns breaks it. Personily, I would rather just have a single target stun to replace this. But to fix the current version : 1) make it so bashes and stuns don't break it<BR>                  2) Make it have a set time. (like our stun series)<P>         Tash line<BR>Aggro is too high for this..... I mean WAY too high.<BR>Example : I cast this after a Drolgav rager in DL after getting beat on for 10 secs, and took a nuke from 2 wizards, he still comes after me. Something has to be wrong with that<P>Fixs: reduce aggro on this spell.<P><BR>            Mez spells<BR>GoK and rapture costs too much for the amount of time they lasts. I thing the duration needs to be raised, or the count reduced. <P>Another possiblity would be to have dazzle overwrite them.<P><BR>On a side note, I would just like to say, i think that a higher level mez should overwrite a lower level one. But that might go against game balencing. don't know.<P>         Boon of the garou<BR>Duration on this spell is too short, and you can not keep it on 2 fighters at one time. Can you move it from a 5 min duration with a 3 min reacst to a 15 min duration and 6 min reacst?<P>Ok, moveing to specfic regions of Norrath:<P>The Hole: Last time I checked, we cannt mez anything above 51 in this zone. ( I could be wrong now. might be a higher level, and it may have been fixed) This was supposed to be because it was part of the original game and not the expantion. ( +50 mob were not meant to be mezed in the old game, I believe.) Yet, it came out after Kurnak, and is a 45 - 55 zone. It needs to be more like Krnak in this respect ( For most of them being able to be mezzed with GoK.)<P><BR>Velious: This place is an 'chanters nightmare. Alot of the Mobs here are immune to mezzing, and those that are not have a very high MR. Either the zones should be rebalence or we could get 2 new lines of spells<P>            Spell 1: Some one wrote of a spell that would mez giant flaged mobs. This would be a good spell to help. It would have a high cast cost/ and possible either a short duration or high recast time. <P>            Spell 2: A 2nd spell that lowered MR (like tash) but only for mind altering spells (fears, mezes, charms, stuns, maybe even chanters DDs) It would allow us to affect mobs with the higher than normal MR. It should also be Veliuos castable only, as it would cuase a game balnce issue in the older worlds.<P>Lets talk enchanting items:<P>       Trade skills<BR>I am not gonna get into this today. Its not just a chanter area, but I will just go on the record of saying we need more craftible magic items.<P>        Proc spells<BR>I think we should be able to cast upon a weapon the ability to proc : 1) AoE stun<BR>                      2) one of our lower DDs<BR>                      3) Our mana tap spell<BR>                      4) one of our DoTs<BR>                      5) one of our mezes<P>The first 4 should be self explanatory, the 5th one needs some explanation.<P>Ok, you cast the mez proc spell on a melee/hybred before a big pull.  He becomes the secondary mezzer. the hanter gets all but one under control, and it attacks the chanter. This melee breaks off from the /assisted mob, and attcks the uncontroled one. he swings 1 2 3 times, the weapon procs, the mob is mezed, he stops swinging. Everyone rejoice. Melee can do CC. <P>BTW, on a side note, i think wizzys (fire/ice/lighting) and clerics ( for against undead) should also get proc spells as this.<P>          Illusions<P>Absor wrote in response to us getting a "copycat" illusion <BR>"Monster (and any copycat illusion), however is pretty much a no, because of faction. I've gone over this many times with the coders, and it's not going to happen any time soon. I'll have it on the list, as a reminder, but don't expect it. "<P>I would just like to put my take on this on the board ( and i hope hes still reading this)<P>           Spell: Doppelganger and Greater Doppelganger. (sp?)<P>Works by targeting a PC or mob. Dopp will work only on man sized creatures (elfs, humans, orcs, sarnaks) or small sized ones (gnomes, halflings) where Greater will do just about anything. It has a ranger of the Tash line ( which seems to be shorter than most spells) and turns you into a carbon copy of that mob. ( yep, faction would be affected as would gaining certain abiltiies. Like, say +20 str for gain the form of a giant) <BR>Two small problems : 1) the spell is unstable, while you can cast spells and attack and such in this form, it acts like an invis spell that can drop at any time.<BR>                     2) If you cast it on a PC, there is no 2nd problem. If you cast it on a NPC, however, that creature becomes enraged at you. (like after they break a charm. hate list erased and you are put on the top of the list. luck you)<P>This would prevent just running around, say Kael, with out any worries becuase after it falls, you would literally have to kill another giant to get its "face"<P><BR>        Targetible or group illusions<BR>This would be another good spell to have. Targetable ele illusions for lev, or enduring breath, or +10 str or a dam sheild would be nice, though it might be low on my personal list.<P>         Illusions in general<BR>I would like it if illusions didnt drop when you zoned or went LD. ( like invis) If there is a game play issues for this, I would like to hear it, otherwise can we get this changed.<P><BR>That is about all I can think of right now. <P>Jendar Sunstar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In most part I think Enchanters are great the way they are. Yes it would be nice to have higher level illusions, but not neccesary.  I do see a problem with DE illusion, that with my collaboration and if i'm dubious the Dark elfs still see through my illusion.  I think this should be fixed to some extend, although i don't mind questing to fix it a little.<P>The big one is illusion Troll and illusion iskar stacking with Skin of Nature. I dont see why these dont' stack.  I have to dispell all my buffs sometimes to even to be able to dispell Skin of Nature so I may cast those illusions on me.  You ask why would i want those up. Well so I can go into the Troll city or Isark city.  Just anoying.<P>Boon of Garou, Clarity or Clarity 2, Augment, It would be nice to see the duration to be longer on these.  If its a balance issue then increase the mana cost vs time on them.  Its sill for them to last 3 min for garou and 20 min for the others.

</FONT><HR>I am a 54th level enchanter, so can't tell you about much that is wrong with 55-60, but there are a few thigns I would like to see fixed that I can tell you about.<P>1.  The Lull line of spells is WORTHLESS.  They just don't work and are a waste of money.  They need to be fixed.  When using any of this line of spells you are more likely to end up with everything in your lap than pulling a single, due to the failure rate.  Solution:  make them work like the druid harmony.  Start with a small area of effect, and each time the spell gets an upgrade increase the area of effect.<P>2.  Debuffs are worthless against mobs.  While awesome against other players, I have stacked nearly 150str worth of debuffs on a mob and have not seen a BIT of difference in his damage output or his movement ability.  Do the same to any player and their damage output drops dramatically, and they slow down due to encumberance.  These spells need to be fixed.<P>3.  Rune line of spells.  These were fine as long as we were using something cheap like jaspers.  Once we get rune 4 and start using peridots it gets extremely expensive.  Keep in mind, Clerics use peridots, but their spell increases the target's over all hitpoints, meaning they can be healed back up into the extra amount.  This allows the cleric spell to remain in effect for quite some time.  Our spell drops the second the damage is equaled or exceeded, and in the case of velious mobs, that only takes a single double attack from many, or a single quad from most.  Considering the MR you have seen fit to put on most high level velious mobs, enchanters have been relegated to the role of RUNE FACTORIES.  There isn't much else we can do to help our group when mobs resist (or are immune) to all our primary spells even after being tashed. (this is assuming that the tank was able to pull them OFF of us after we cast on them.  Something that frequently can't be done fast enough to save our lives considering our poor AC, HP, and the damage the mobs dish out.<P>4.  Color spray spells.  This is one of the mainstays of enchanters.  Color spray to buy the time to mez, then mez the mob off of us.  The problem I see with the line is each upgrade has a longer casting time, making it more and more possible for the mobs to break our concentration while we are trying to cast between their attacks.  This is compouded by the fact that the higher the level of mobs we're fighting, the faster they attack.  Yes, I realize that the area is also being increased with each upgrade, but that can also be a bad thing (aggro mobs you didn't mean to) so is balanced out by the inherent downside.  I think you should make all spells in this line have the same casting time as Color Flux (the first in the line).<P>5.  Illusions  Illusions Illusions.  Enchanters are supposed to be masters of illusions, only we don't get any illusions at all after 44th.  I have heard YOUR arguments that all the benefits should be removed and they should be looks only.  Know what?  I could even accept that **IF** you could set them up so they would have a clean slate faction wise so that I could kill (for instance) halflings while using DE illusion, then change to halfling, or any other illusion that hasn't lost faction with halflings and go into rivervale.  There is no logical reason they should recognize me as being a "bad person" unless I killed halflings in the form I'm using to enter their city.  I know you can't do this, so just leave us the effects, stop calling them illusions, and admit they really are shape altering spells like the necro-druid-shammy spells.  <P>What I would like to see is MORE ILLUSIONS.  It has been stated that we can't have a random illusion spell that will turn us into a mob in the zone (like the mage monster summoning) because it would let us go anywhere.  SO WHAT?  What real difference would that make?  Right now, using illusions and invis-Invis undead I can go anywhere in THE HOLE that I want.  The only good it did me was to turn in for part of my epic quest.  There is NO WAY that I could sneak down into THE HOLE and solo anything without getting massacred, so what possible harm would it do for me to be able to look like a mob in any other dungeon?<P>6.  I just mentioned my epic, and while on the subject (however bad a segway it was) I would like to mention how much I LOVE this thing.  Only a couple things I would want changed.  First (and I know you won't do this) I would like to see it possible to use it as a defensive item as opposed to a weapon so that I can have some more AC rather than that awesome 11 24 weap that I will never use.  Second, he haste effect doesn't last long enough.  12 min isn't bad, for a single party, but when buffing everyong for a dragon raid, or plains raid, 12 min is NOT enough.  It might, however, be acceptable if you would make the casting time instant (like the Jboots casting time) rather than 6 seconds.  That way I could actually get them all DONE fast enough that they won't constantly be wearing off.<P>7.  Velious in general.   I realize that these are supposed to be UBER mobs over here, but on far too many, tash is the only thing that works...and assuming I get a chance to cast anything after the tash, it's either resisted 90% of the time, or they're just plain immune.  My personal solution:  I don't go to velious except to buy velium bars in thurgard.  You wanted to add more zones to get people to spread out?  That was a failure as far as I'm concerned.  I am all but useless against most of the mobs, relegating my job back to buffing tanks and C2 casters.  Get a pull with more than 1 mob, the chanter WILL die because the mob won't mez and we get pummeled into the ground faster than tanks can taunt them off.<P>8.  More so than any other caster, Enchanters get beat on.  Our spells all aggro mobs more than non-enchanters could believe.  Use a mind wipe, you say?  I'd love to, only they FAIL 90% of the time.  Even reoccuring amnesia doesn't seem to do anything.  Either fix the wipe line so we can use them on high level mobs, or reduce the aggro on our other spells.  I find myself waiting for 20 to 30 seconds before casting a tash on a mob so that it will get good and angry with the tanks first.  This keeps them off me, but without that tash, the shammies have a much harder time of landing their slow, even with malo.  That means the mob is dishing out even more damage to our tanks than is neccessary.  Cast the tash sooner?  Then the mob jumps me, and unlike the tank, I CAN"T take the damage and tend to go down within 10 seconds of getting jumped to quad hits of 400+.<BR>Even if you don't reduce the aggro on anything else, PLEASE reduce the aggro on the Tash line of spells.<P>9.  Not directly enchanter related, but Please take a look at Jewelcraft.  I had a long talk with Gordon at the Velious unveiling and he basically ignored all my points, even when there were other chanters all supporting and giving examples of their own.  Here's the problem:  It is taking me on average 148 attempts at jewelcraft to raise my skill one point.  I think there is a problem with that, considering my int is 255 (topped out while doing the craft).  Gordon said something to the effect of "it's supposed to be hard to raise the skill, it's the most lucerative skill in the game".  Well, considering the fact that I fail an average of once per stack of attempts, and each attempt at my skill of 206 is costing me 106pp (using plat malachite) that means I'm losing 784pp each time I want to raise the skill, assuming I can keep to this admittedly LOW level of failures.  <P>The cost of practicing the skill is enough of a penalty, don't include additional difficulties in obtaining skill increases just because the skill has potential to be profitable.  In all my time doing jewelcraft, I have NEVER made more money than I have dumped into the skill for improvements.  (And yes, I do mean to say that additional difficulties in skill advancement were placed into the skill.  I was getting one increase per 20 or 30 attempts BEFORE the skill was changed to allow levels beyond 200, the day after that, my increases dropped dramatically.  I have spoken to many enchanters and they all say they have noticed the same thing, further, Gordon did not try to deny, in any way shape or form that increasing the skill was made more difficult.  To the contrary, he actually gave us the opinion that it was done ON PURPOSE.<P>Also, lets take a look at the trivials on this.  255 is the trivial for platinum Jade.  But what about all the different combinations of plat above that, and THEN there is velium even above THAT.  I don't know of any other skill that has so many things completely off the chart for trivials.  It is frankly rediculous.<P>How about giving us some multi-stone, multi-metal, or multi-stone multi-metal combinations that we can make? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

( and it would seem that, for the most part, they same problems that most of us have) I just felt I had to point out something.<P>Your point 4 about color flux series is true, they do have longer casting times the higher you get. (though i think the level 52 one goes down.... cannt really remember) But, they line stacks with each other. so you can cast, color flux, then clolr shift, then color skew and get plenty of time to cast a mez or possible even 2. <BR>( I know it requires 3 spell slots, and I know there is a good chance for it being resisted. But it is still very powerful)<P>Jendar Sunstar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gods,<P>There are ALOT of people asking for ALOT of unbalanced things here.  Enchanters are mostly ok as they are, where *balance* is concerned.  There are *alot* of little annoying aspects about enchanters that could be fixed (such as illusions dropping when zoning) but enchanters are as not unbalanced as some people here would have you think.<P>I know that Absor said not to repeat things - but I wonder how he will separate the absolutely absurd requests/comments from the legitimate/valid concerns, especially since the former seem to be much louder.  <P>Absor - as a 59 enchanter, the second post in this thread by Mezzoman pretty much sumarizes my concerns (there are a few points in that post that I don't agree with).  I do not think enchanters are unbalanced significantly, but if you would fix some of those annoying little details, enchanters would be more fun to play.  (The devil is in the details  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  Whether or not a very large number of very small irratations/concerns adds up to a significant imbalance is very hard to prove or disprove.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Huh ? Did i miss something ? Enchanters are OVERPOWERED at low lvls ?<P>Till lvl 16 its hard to get a group, so chanters tend to solo. At my time that meant low blue mobs, for anything coning black was death mostly, and if i lived at least my pet was dead. Started a Necro lately, from the start he killed black and yellow conings with no problems (he sure has a good equipment, but not that much better than my ENC at that time) I hear from mages that they can kill the same things, maybe not yellow ones. Wizzards suck, but thats cause they dont have a pet and root fails often. At least they can blast the things and dont have to wait 5 secs till they can cast again.<BR>Fearing the mob would help my pet stay alive, but since the MOBs tend to run like hell and i cant stop them (root lets em fight again) i need a SOWed pet for fear kiting.<BR>At my time there was no breeze and i continued soloing till 29. 2 Mobs agro on me always meant gate or dead. Impossible to mez one, for my beloved pet would surely attack as soon as i nuked the other one down (if i even managed it). This little hero. Would you believe that this valiant pet attacks a mezed thing without considering the fact that it only has a slight red sliver of live left ? Sarificing his masters life, too. So what ? Kill one and hit gate... Was anoying to fight dwarves (lvl 24 and 25) in OOT, nice spot, trouble is the pirates, high agro mobs that attack even though low green, just to help the dwarfs. Pirate joining the fight... Pet dead... Gate... Even at lvl 30. Not to mention that i could only camp one of those dwarfs, my Necro can easily hold both at lvl 28 and has no trouble with the pirates at all. Been told Mages can do the same.<BR>Want a good pet ? Charm one. Was sick of losing so many tiny daggers in FV, cause drolvargs hit for insane amounts of DMG, Chanter pets cant take that. 2 Mobs meant death anyway, reason stated above. Charming has the advantage that you can also kill the charmed one after charm is broken. The disadvantage is that you cant trust your pet at all, had to go back to FV Town every now and then and trade clarity for SOW... Btw, i still think its a bad joke that i can turn into a wolf that can fight like a wolf and needs a SOW to RUN like a wolf... <BR>Was in Velious now, lvl 54 and had to kill FGs for the thurgadim shawl quest. My lvl 52 Mage friend who still gets exp for most of them kills them with his pet and no probs. Even elite ones. At lvl 54 there is NO WAY i could possible solo a elite FG. Pet dies within 15 secs and i cant do enough dmg to kill it. Our last DD spell (dementia) should have been at least 700DMG, considering the high HPs of MOBs at that lvl,and the high recast time. 628 is nothing. The other (green) FGs fight like some blue mobs ive seen in kunark btw. Same HPs ,too. No exp for them, but still risk your live. 3rd part of the quest includes fighting snow griffins for their eggs. Had to cast a new pet after each fight. Doubt that a necro or Mage would have that kind of trouble. Our pets are weak, for they are supposed to wear Rune all of the time. NO  Chanter can afford casting a Rune for every single fight... At least not for 11PP a shot.<BR>Chanters are group characters, no doubt, but i would not say theyre overpowered. They shine in a group cause they can bring out the best of the others. Alone they are just sitting ducks.<P>Oh, and someone stated that hed love to have his pet behind him. Since i cant send it into battle and it only hits if i am i DONT want it too far away from the battle. Maybe beside me, but certainly not 3 steps behind me.<P>Tashan line. You need to cast Tashan prior to have a chance that your spells would stick. Used to pull with it and was shocked when the casting range was cut to half recently. <BR>I dont like the fact that mage malo debuffs more resists, but at least Tashan is never resisted. At lvl 55 we get the last tashan spell, winds of tashani. Thx for it. Im sure you had velious in mind while creating it, make sure that the chanter can tashan all mobs before he dies, not only one. Ill skip that one, been offered it as a gift and rejected. I risk my life, thats my job, but im NOT suicidal. Oh, maybe you can check if it also affects he chanter, like the AEmez lines. For that would certainly ban it from each single Chanters book.<BR>Make it a 100MR debuff instead, single target, and we might be able to fight in velious.<P>Tashan agro. I always cast it first, for it makes NO difference when i cast it, regarding aggro at least. My guess is that its some kind of aggro mem blurr, that cancels the aggro on anyone else but on the caster. With uber mobs hiting for 850HPs its a short live, regarding the crap called ENC armor we get in higher lvls.  I dont mind to have high aggro on that spell, im used to it, but since i can pull whatever i want however far its been beaten down to come and kill me just by casting it id say there is something wrong. Its not like we cast a mega blow with 2500DMG on them. And i never seen em run for the mages after malo, thats even more stats debuffed.<P>Mem blurr line. Reocuring amnesia does not reocur, you got that. But also it does not state when resisted. Same with memory flux or all of those mem blurr spells. Since they ARE resisted id consider it a bug. Maybe they only work partially and for that are not resisted ? Who needs that ? Make it a all or nothing spell like our DDs and let it say resisted instead, so we know that thing will follow us through the whole zone after mez or root wears of. <BR>Memory flux costs far more mana than reocuring amnesia, btw, as soon the no reocur bug is fixed no chanter will cast it anymore, for it has the same chance for success and only one try. Make it harder to resist or reduce the mana cost/casting time.<P>Soul bind. <BR>Lvl 49 spell that was taken of us for balance reasons. The reasons are gone now, even casters cant bind at the places where it could cause exploit, but the spell is still gone, causing endless treads of tank classes complaining they need to walk all the time. <BR>Give it back, make it a lvl 50+ spell and we can only bind the ones that really need it, on places its needed. <P>Dont bother much with illusions, but i recognized that the fireelemental illusion has no svFire in it. Didnt try if its immun, but doubt that. Id say there should be 10 svf in it. <P><BR>Haegar, lvl55 chanter of Tarrew Marr, poke me for clarity<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't know of any other skill that has so many things completely off the chart for trivials.

Try to cope.<P>What would I like to see?<P>CHARMING:<BR>Risk is NOT worth the reward.  An expiration warning like Invisibility gives.  If I'm controlling the mob's mind, I should be able to tell when I'm losing control of it as well.<P>"You are losing your charm."<P>About 3 seconds later charm breaks.  The only thing I've been allowed to do is get my pet targetted.  I've still got my pet and anything else that was aggroed to deal with.<P>But all other random duration spells (outside of WTYH) have a warning they are expiring (Invisibility best example), and even Illusions, with a fixed duration, make a visible warning in chat while blinking.  Take that warning away and give me a charm warning.<P>WHIRL-SERIES:<BR>Spells are a pile.  Remove the debuff effects from Dynn's Dyzzying Draught (DDD) and make both spells check for saves the same as Root.  As I'm supposed to educate you, Root has a periodic save (6 seconds according to ALL tests, so once per "tic"), as well as allowing a save for every DD source.  This means nukes, DOTs that have an initial direct damage impact, arrow shots... anything that says "hit by non-melee damage" allows a save.  (Incidentally lifetapping something while rooted give the rootee a save, apparently that "heal" is a negative-number DD.)<P>Currently people believe that WTYH gives a save every time the target is bashed or stunned.  Incorrect.  There is a save every time it's hit.  I took a group of THREE monks (no bash or stun abilities, no proccing weapons, just fists) and tried to keep just WTYH on a mob.  I broke instantly EVERY time I cast it.  EVERY time.  But there were three 45+ monks with Swift Like the Wind beating on it.  It was taking in the neighborhood of 10 hits every 1.5 seconds.  Make the periodic save every say... 4 seconds, like Color Flux.  That would mean 3 saves before duration (initial, 4 second mark, then 8 second mark).  Give DDD the same save checks, leave the recast and mana cost like it is.  This would allow WTYH and DDD to be chain cast on a SINGLE mob, but also be prohibitively mana expensive.  That would be 12 seconds of stun for 55 mana (WTYH) chained with 12 seconds of stun for 150 mana (DDD)followed by 12 seconds of stun for 55 mana (WTYH again), then you have 18 seconds before DDD is available again, 7 second for WTYH.  For 360 mana, and PERFECT timing to land the stun as the old one finishes (assuming the mob doesn't break early) that's 36 seconds of stun with a 7 second break to next start of the cycle.<P>Color Flux (4sec 20mana), Color Shift (6sec 40mana), and Color Skew (8sec 60mana) nets the same 36 seconds of stun for 240 mana, and can be chain cast till you're out of mana, and has a much greater chance of holding the lock down.  We are paying 120 extra mana for a MUCH less reliable effect, but targetted.<P>MEZZING<BR>I'm not involved in the 51+ game yet.  I do know the 50- game though quite well.  Big mez doesn't overwrite little mez.  I got no problems with that.  If I could use Mesmerize and chase it with Dazzle, I'd be broken.  I can Channel level 4 mez through 100-200 damage.  I don't think it's fair to overwrite AE Mez with singles.  The risk you take with AE Mez is being committed to AE Mez, or else dealing with the trouble of switching.  In short, I want to say the pre-50 mezzing doesn't need help.<P>ANIMATIONS<BR>They rock.  Granted, at 29th, I used them on mobs the magician was fighting at 24th.  The magician devoted his class to a pet.  I just get one for a bonus.  Not complaining about it.  I don't want to command it.  It's great practice for sloppy tanks actually.  I don't want more HP for them.  (The 39th and 44th don't have lower HP proportionally... it's just that the blue mobs are hitting much harder).  I wouldn't mind a small upgrade to their defensive ability at 39th and 44th, but mage and necro pets had a "weak point" too.  What I want is for enchanter pets to dual wield when appropriate level.  The EASIEST way to do this would be to tack on a NO DROP, NO RENT, LORE class:none race:none weapon to the summon.  When a magician summons that cool bag, it puts a bag on the cursor, when the bag is set down, it makes a stack of food, then water, then bandages, then fireworks.<P>When we summon the auto dual wield level pet (should be 44th and up I believe, just stick that little weapon on our cursor when we summon a pet.<P>LULL<BR>Good lord this thing sucks.  But I think making it non-aggro is broken, completely.  I think the resist rates should be more in-line with other enhanter mind-controls, like mezzing.  If I have two mobs I want to split, I can Lull one or Mez it.  Right now, I'm crazy if I don't mez it and worry about mez lifting later.  Now Lull resists in upwards of 75% of casting (so hard to test this at high level, but a drolvarg rager when I was 49th resisted Pacify 80% of 20 casts (16) and aggroed for 8 of those, bringing the one next to it as well.  I know it used to be a broken spell and abused, but now it's just broken.  I had 217 Charisma at the time btw, and 201 Intelligence.<P>STRENGTH DEBUFFS<BR>Strength debuffs are all but useless in player vs mob combat, outside of a few mobs that always carry a LOT of money, or bronze loot, etc.  Then a full STR debuff is better than snare.  Most mobs carry 5 copper, and move just fine with 1 STR, because their encumberance is 1.  With AGI debuffs the AC of the mob drops, and if you take the mob below 75 AGI it slows down.  STR debuffs do not have a visible impact on damage dealt from the mob--but looking at warrior research on damage (I though us chanters had some math geeks), STR has an impact on damage, but not a massive one.  Now, this is a lot of *****ing about STR debuffs, eh?<P>I like them just fine.  They can be crippling in PvP, and enchanters have too many other damned spells to worry about memming STR debuffs in combat.<P>ILLUSIONS<BR>Our last illusion is at level 44.  I'd like more, because we got two or more every spell rank.  Suddenly the chanters of the world just got writers block and decided not to use illusions post 44?  Tell Jeb Lumsed that in the epic quest.  Illusionist.  Phantasmist.  No illusions post 44.  Illusion: Gender, Illusion: Monster, Illusion: Face.  All great ideas and already suggested.  Use the same table as monster summoning II.  I know a magician can't get a Vox pet, so the chanter can't be a dragon.  You obviously have no worries about a magician summoning a pet too big for his location, so use the same proceedure to determine what the enchanter becomes.  Make it a high level spell, we actually prefer it.  Strip faction if you can.  If the faction can't be removed, then no the spell shouldn't fly.  Remove the skeleton illusions... they don't fit in, and we'd rather have Gender, Face, Religion and Monster anyway.<P>SUMMARY<BR>1.  Charm warning message like Invisibility.<P>2.  WTYH & DDD need save rate changed, remove debuff from DDD and leave casting cost (massive mana for targetted stun with possible good duration, but unable to recast the stun for a long time.).<P>3.  Mezzing pre-51 is just fine, even overwrites.<P>4.  Animations SHOULD have dual wield.  Carrying around rusty weapons is just as hard for me as the necromancer, and casual gaming 'chanters solo a lot, even 44+.<P>5.  Lull needs resist rates fixed, not non-aggro.  This helps THREE classes balance also, not one.<P>6.  STR Debuffs suck vs Mobs.  But Mez, Color stuns, DD, and DOTs all work just fine.  These are for PvP as far as I'm concerned.  (For those reading though, charm a greenie and hand it a clay block.  Break charm and drop a full debuff spread.  Now fear it.  THAT is a snare.)<P>7.  Remove skeletal illusions.  The cackle annoys people anyway, bad.  Implement Illusion: Gender, Face, Religion and Monster.  Make the last two high level.  Religion illusion can be the long lost quest for high levels that took a religion.  They roleplayed and Verant stuck it up their butt.  I played my first chanter to 20th, and STIL couldn't get into Neriak using both Benevolence and Dark Elf.  I deleted him and started over Agnostic.  I haven't regretted one minute of replaying those horrid first 20 levels.<P>Xornn Mier'noen (Nameless Souls)<BR>49th High Elf Enchanter (Agnostic)<BR>The Nameless Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Whoa, so very many disgruntled enchanters. I'm going to try very hard to avoid turning this post into a free-association diatribe on "The Way Things Oughta Be" -- in general, I'm very happy with my class, and I think that for the most part, we are "balanced", even on the dreaded continent of Velious. However, there are definitely a few factors which need to be re-examined, many of which have been mentioned in this thread already. <P>1. Crowd control in the post-50 playing environment: Yes, we're definitely operating under a serious game mechanic handicap when attempting to do our crowd control job in the 55-60 environment. The trouble is twofold; the much-discussed high magic resistance of many Velious mobs, the proliferation of 'giant-flagged' unmezzables, also most noteable in Velious, and the "charm gap" between 54 (Boltran's) and 60 (Dictate). All of these factors serve to inhibit enchanters severely in performing what has become their class-defining duty. <BR>Suggestions - raise the Boltran's cap to 55 or 56, which would make charm a viable alternative for crowdcontrolling those 56+ critters who otherwise require the mana-intensive Glamour of Kintaz to control. It is definitely more high-risk, both to the enchanter and other players, due to the wild card nature of charm, but it would at least give me another option when faced with the dreaded message that my target cannot be mezmerized. No, I'm not talking about high MR (that comes later  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) -- these are mobs that are flagged as unmezable. If I can't mez or charm them, I can't risk using my class' other 'definining' ability in combat and reducing innate MR with Tashania. <P>Which brings us to the next "problem area": the Tashania line, or, as it's come to be known, Tauntania. I know that this is a powerful line (although less powerful, in terms of actual reduction, than the Shaman or Magician Malo lines, but I digress). However, in "ultra mob encounters", or even in the post-55 game environment, the taunt factor on Tash is, quite simply, absurd. There is no spell in the game which enrages mobs quite so much. I could taunt off a cleric chain-casting CH on the lead tank, a lure-nuking wizard, a slowing shaman AND a DoT-crazed necro in a flash by casting tash -- for about .4 seconds, which is how long I'd last when the mob in question turns his quad-for-400 attack on me immediately afterwards. It has gotten so bad that enchanters are faced with two choices at a typical 'epic'-class encounter: cast tash, or live to cast even one other useful spell during the battle. Look into the taunt factor of tash, please. I'm not asking for a free ride to lowered MR, but the current situation is over the top. <P>And finally - the buffing conundrum. Yes, I know that enchanters are hardly the only - or even the most put-upon - "buffing" class (Hi, shaman!). In a raid situation (which, by the way, is where most enchanters find themselves spending 90% of their time in the post-50 game), there are two spells that we *must* keep on all members of the raiding party (usually between 20 and 40 people): speed (augment, AQ, WR, choose your poison) and clarity 2. Anything else is just gravy. <P>So, you ask, what are we whining about, when shaman have to cast 4 or 5 buffs for our 2? Duration. Clarity 2 has exactly the same duration as Clarity; While the 'pure haste' speed buffs generally last from 12 to 20 minutes, Augment has exactly the same duration as Augmentation: roughly half an hour, for each. That is, simply, not long enough. An hour would be manageable. Some of the higher level cleric buffs last over an hour and a half. <P>Suggestions: Re-tune the Gift series. Contrary to your former correspondent's opinion, it is not "awesome" in the least; it costs too much mana for negligible benefit. The mana boost (200 at level 60?) is a joke. The added mana regen is *impossible to perceive*. Yes, we can stack it with Group C2, but let's face it, since we're spending the majority of our bufftime buffing those *outside* the group (remember what I said about raids, and how we spend our post-50 existence), group spells, while very handy *for the group*, are hardly the essence of our buffing duties. <P>I do not have 400 mana on hand to buff every member of the raiding party with Gift of Brilliance (which I would be hesitant to do even if I was floating in the stuff, since it's such a useless buff). I would far rather spend that 400 mana on a combination-style buff that stacked Clarity 2, Enlightenment and - perhaps - a breeze-like "added" mana-regen that lasted for *at least* an hour. Sort of Clarity 3, with int, that actually lasts. <P>This would be a *great* spell, and would also fall in line with the other level 60 buffs given to the other buffing classes: Aegolism for clerics (combination symbol/heroline/AC) and Focus of Spirit for shaman (combination Kragg/str/dex). It would not be "unbalanced" in the least. <P>Finally, on the miscellaneous other issues that have been brought up: <P>llusions; sure, illusions are fun, but honestly, other than the occasional trip into enemy towns or the utility factor of some of the elemental forms, I don't use them all that much. I've got actual work to do; I don't have time to put on a show for my group/raidmates. <P>High cost of higher mezes; Oh, after months of grumbling about it, I think we're finally resigned to spending half our mana controlling one or two 56+ mobs with Glamour instead of slacking off with the irreplaceablely perfect, low mana, low resist, long duration Dazzle (I love Dazzle  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">). It would be nice if higher level mezes could overwrite lower level mezes, however. This would go a long way towards making multiple enchanters of different levels "stack" when on the same raid. <P>Oh, and one last thing: I HATE BOON OF THE GAROU. The duration is way too short, the recast too long, the benefits too negligible to make me spend a whole spell slot on what is essentially a party trick. Change any of these three factors, and I'll reconsider  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Kady<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Who is the debuffing master? Shamans or Enchanters?  Most seem to think its enchanters.  Could would plz get the Malosi line of spells it would help in Velious alot.  Alone in velious many of the 50+ are so making resistant tash doesnt cut it, yet when stacked with malo one can mez things fine.  Also even tho its already been mentioned make the str/agi/ac debuff line of spells DO something against a mob.  As the spells stand now reducing a mobs str has no effect, and reudcing a mobs agility seems similary have no effect.  Also as a last note alot of people have complained enchanters are overpowered because we are so necessary in a group.  Now while to some that may register as over powered that says to me its a mistake made by the dungeon creaters.  So nerfing the enchanters wont make enchanters less necessary...it will just make dungeons impossible as apposed to difficult.  As a last idea i dislike adding the idea of new spells but what about illusionary damage spells.  DD spells the work only on things that can think...so for instance undead/golems and the like would be immune.  This would give enchanters something to do atleast if mezzing just instant working</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I simply wish my pet would stick with me when I zone.  I am low level (lvl 6), and I don't always know where the zone is, and I will accidentally wander into it, and lose a pet I just conjured.   From a gameplay standpoint (and a danger standpoint!) it doesn't make sense to me for a pet to disappear when I cross a border.  I can see how this might cause some problems at some point, or be difficult to program, but maybe we could also get a clickable icon, like buffs, that you could dismiss your pet with.

</FONT><HR>Why illusion should not drop:<P>dropping illusions make no sense from a RP context for continuity.  Correct neither does running from a mob to zone, but this one takes away from usefullness and adds no unbalancing element (its low cast cost so not having to recast is not much of a mana save)<BR>For PvPers especially this would at least give us an illusion, even though nearly every PK jerk runs around trying to attack any caster that doesn't have a mage or necro pet to see what race they are.  I would also like to be able to cast one illusion over the other.<BR>If I have little to no offense then my defense based on illusion should be excellent.  If I want to start as a gnome enchanter and live my whole life disguised as a human with no one the wiser I should be able to.<P>PvP why drop my illusion when a fight begins?  what rationalle?  If need be do so just before I die so he gets the correct faction hit, but I am not revealed if I successfully escape.  This allows DE spies, elf scouts and human curiosities that are wasted now.<P>No do NOT give me charm or fear in PvP bad news.<P>DD was nerfed in PvP we have so little this does not effect us much.  HOWEVER, since its no loot many PvPers have HUGE MR, so how about a full hit on DD so we and our allies can hit for _SOME_ damage and so that our tashanis will be wanted for PvP groups.<P>Religion mask.  I chose a god.  If A freakin merchant can tell someone is a rogue or a worshiper of X god just by looking at him then I will take the same.  HOWEVER, all players should have a benefit to having a god.  QUESTS come to mind but take time.<BR>On that note IMBUE.<P>every caster should have an imbue gem that does the following<BR>a) checks their god<BR>b)imbues the item as the gem of their god would<BR>c) usable by them.<P>Is this a nitpicky thing? I don't think so.  I have amaster blacksmith character who can't make his OWN magic weapon with a TRADE skill because he has to get someone else to imbue his gem. <BR>Ok with me if you think enchanting items adds to much a balance issue.  But how about if you give me the power to make an imbued item that i enchant so MYSELF.  Heck make it a NO DROP version of the weapon or item for all I care,  but that would be more complicated and add little. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;<BR>And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>Im a little confused here.  You see I was under the [mistaken] impression, THAT WAS OUR JOB.  The role of the Enchanter is to temporarily shut down unengaged mobs, allowing the rest of the group to focus on whats in front of them.  Those mez, stun, and charm spells, arent just spells that we want to use, but theyre spells were SUPPOSED to use.  THESE spells, the whole crowd control line, are the defining spells for this class.  Not Clarity, not haste, not Insight/Brilliance.  Crowd control is what an Enchanter is for.<P>Also, lets deal with this notion that an Enchanter is effectively acting as ten other characters.<P>First, the Enchanter class isnt effective at dealing offensive damage.  The class best nuke is on par with the Clerics all target nuke, and is approximately half as powerful as a Wizards best nuke.  The same thing can be said about the Enchanters DoT.  When we mez a mob, the mob doesnt just go away or die.  It stands there, at full health and full mana.  Somebody is going to have to kill that thing, and its quite obvious that the Enchanter isnt going to do it by himself.  That leaves that group of 10, which is now beaten, hurting, exhausted, and dangerously low on man, to kill this buff, tough, and pissed off mob.  Now, Enchanters still have the option of charming, but charming will only help in killing the first mob and not the second, and charms eventually break, and old man Murphy (of Murphys Law fame) has a ball with this because charms like breaking at the most inopportune moments.  When an Enchanter charms a mob, they are also writing their name at the top of the mobs hate list in black permanent marker.  The moment that charm breaks, a race starts.  The Enchanter has five bubbles of health to get that mob either back under control, or get off the hate list (with a combination of memory blurs and taunts).  If the Enchanter fails, the Enchanter dies.<P>Second, we have here two monsters that are designed to be fought by twenty people.  Thats a pretty tough encounter, something close to a Vox/Naggy raid.  Chances are, those two mobs would be, by default, untouchable by Enchanters.  The mobs are probably giants, making mez and stun useless; they might already be immune to magic or else have their uber flag set.  Now, where would these two monsters be placed?  Are these monsters yard trash?  Are they placed near the zone entrance?  Or, are they located closer to the rear of the dungeon?  Perhaps theyre the guard mobs, the last two monsters you have to get through, before facing the boss.  If theyre near the back of the dungeon, then what are the 50 to 200 mobs, our intrepid party had to wade through, like?  Enchanters are already ineffective against raid level mobs, but Enchanters can be extremely effective in getting the party up to those uber mobs.  If the Enchanters role, in these encounters, ended a couple or three mobs away from the finale battle, we would be more than content to stand back and say, Ive taken you as far as I can.  The rest is up to you.  We would have had our chance to have fun and we would have had the opportunity to play the hero, and we would be satisfied knowing that we did our part to make this party effective.<P>&gt;&gt;<BR>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited. Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools.<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>Sigh.  Challenged is an understatement, if Ive ever heard one.  Crowd control and buffing arent mutually exclusive.  We are expected to buff every member of our group, as well as do our thing.  One of the unseen challenges, of playing an Enchanter, is we have to manage our resources, so that all our group mates are buffed with our best buffs, and we still have enough mana to perform crowd control.  This is something weve gotten real good at too.  Some of us even have the routine down so pat, that were refreshing buffs before the players even before they know they need a refresh, let alone have the chance to ask for it.  (Lets see a show of hands.  How many Enchanters here have one or more cooking timers, or timer programs, set up to help them time their buffs? &lt;Raise&gt; )<P>How much fun do you think we have, when all we do if buff six or twelve people, sit down, and then simply watch everybody else get it on with the dungeon (or worse), night after night after night?  The reason I say or worse is because stories are coming out of Velious that Enchanters, along with some other classes, are being used to buff their group and then camp and sit on the chat server, waiting for somebody to come tell them when theyre needed.  If this is true, then Enchanters not only do not get to participate in the fights, but they dont even get the privilege of WATCHING the fight.  Is this fun?  Is this part of The Vision?  The simple fact of the matter is that a lot of Enchanters are simply opting out of going to Velious.  A lot of those that do go are going because of obligations to their guild.  Youre not going to find a lot of freelance chanters looking for pick up groups there.<P>Although I disagree with you on the details, I do agree with your premise I think youre posing, Enchanters have the ability to trivialize a dungeon.  Ive heard stories, from friends, about using a fear spell to pull a mob (they fear it, run back to the group, and wait to see what arrives) and Ive been in groups where the puller will intentionally start a small train and bring it to us, just because I said I was bored.  When somebody pulls a stunt like that, theyre making a mockery of your dungeon layout.  However, I believe that although Enchanter exacerbates the problem, they arent the source of the problem.  Even if you went as far as completely removing all forms of crowd control from the game, you wouldnt solve this problem.  In fact, if I may be so bold to say, that would only make matters worse.  Please keep in mind, when you discuss the rebalancing of the Enchanters, that the problem of trivializing dungeons isnt as much a result of crowd control, but is more the by product of camping.<P>Players got into camping because its the most efficient way to hunt, in this game.  After the initial task of breaking the camp, players can settle down and kill mob after mob, usually one at a time, and face very little risk, outside of getting run over by a train or having a camp killer (a mob that is several levels higher than the rest of the mobs in the camp) spawn in front of them.  If you find a place that has a steady supply of experience giving mobs, you can turn that camp into a regular experience factory.  A couple of the most shining examples of this are Oasis of Marr and Aviak Village of South Karana.  Places like this allow you to find a mob, kill it, and heal up and med, and then go get another.  No muss, no fuss.  In fact, in east commons, from time to time, youll hear a newbie shout for a high level player to come clear out an Orc camp for them.  Here, a higher-level player will come in, kill everything in the camp, and then the lower level players will sit and kill each mob as it respawns.<P>This kind of behavior can extend into the higher levels too, where groups are now using baby sitters (very high level characters that can safely pull singles and doubles, because the mobs are green to them and wont automatically agro on them.  Also, since the mobs are green to that character, the rest of the group doesnt have to worry about that character taking most/all of the experience.)  Now heres a form of crowd control that even the best Enchanter cant match, let alone rival.  Even when groups arent using baby sitters, simply getting enough people into a zone, to cover every named spawn in the dungeon, is enough to render the dungeon impotent.<P>When the Temple of Ro went live, I was playing on the Mith Marr server.  Unrest had a number of items put in it for the Ro quests.  The day before Ro, and its quests, went live, there was a regular population of 30 people in Unrest and zone clearing trains were fast and frequent.  The day after Ro went live, the population shot up to near 50 people.  All the named spawns were fully camped, and zone clearing trains became a rarity.  A week later, the population was around 60, and trains were either lowbies (levels 12-16) running from yard trash, or groups that lost control of their camp.  Arguments over camp ownership became common.  By the second week, around 70 people were hunting here.  Every camp had a waiting list, and accusations of kill stealing were rampant.  If you had simply looked at the three public chat channels, you wouldnt have been able to tell the difference between Unrest and Lower Guk.  Before Ro, this zone was considered a nightmare to hunt in, and many people would leave here with less experience than they came in with.  What the Ro quests had inadvertently done was add 15 to 20 people to this zone, pushing the population to the critical mass where every spawn could be covered by a player or group.  The zone became safe and word got out, so more people arrived.  The higher population made the zone even safer.<P>This thing I witnessed occurs every day in places like Crushbone, Cazic Thule, Lower Guk, Sol B, and many other places.  Look what happened in Najena when you have the Rubicite event.  This all happens with our without Enchanters.  The simple fact is that if you put enough people in a dungeon, then your whole concept of risk vs. reward falls apart. An Enchanter comes in quite handy during the initial break of a camp, but once everything is dead, and the group sets up their routine, the spawns end up spread out enough so the group has to deal with one mob at a timetwo at most.  Crowd control plays a minimal role in this circumstance (You think we dont KNOW how boring buff mule duty is?  We know, because weve done it beforelots of times.)<P>Now, the one zone I consider my favorite, and nearly every other Enchanter Ive talked to had a great deal of fun in, is a zone thats on your list of under used zonesMistmoore.  The best Enchanter that ever played this game simply cant trivialize this zone.  Starting from the low 20s, when the yard trash is white and yellow, all the way into the castle, every fight can be an edge of your seat event, and every pull can be the one the kills you, or sends you packing for the zone.  Imagine having to fight anywhere from eight to a dozen mobs at once, only to have a named spawn drop on top of you as youre wrapping up.  I dont have to because Ive been there (Zycotl is one mean SOB when youre low on mana.)<P>In closing, I would like to ask for a couple favors from you.  Please keep what I just said in mind, when you talk about Enchanters.  If youre concerned that Enchanters are trivializing encounters, I think we all might be better served by first looking in other directions to see if Enchanters are really the source of the problem, or a possible solution.  Ill give you this, Enchanters are too power, and maybe they need to be toned down a bit, but kicking the Enchanter out of the group, like you did in Velious, isnt the answer.  Also, I ask you, if Enchanters are destined to be nerfed, please come back here and tell us, and tell us why.  Also, please be open to suggestions from us about this nerf.  This game is almost two years old, and the Enchanter class, if any, has been constant throughout most that time.  Any change to this class core abilities, no mater how slight, are going to have a serious impact on the playability of the class, and wont be received very well.  Im hoping, that if a nerf is coming, and were told that its coming (and maybe weve had a small part in designing or understanding the nerf), maybe well be able to say, I dont like this, but I can live with it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, I know I have posted about this before, but I never seen a comment from you in it, so here I go again. Enchanter have a line of Stun and Fear spells, our last current stun is at 52, and last fear is at 56 I belive. The spell I'd like to see is a Stun and/or fear spell, called Mimic (or something to that effect) Like the necro spell there the mob is turned into a drybone when hit with it, I want Mimic to change the caster (if the spell takes) into the target for a slight time (no faction, if anything make it completely KoS to that mob when stun falls of .. would you try and kil it if you seen yourself?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">), thus stunning or fearing them for a moment for they just seen themselfs attacking themselfs. I wouldn't be simple I agree, but I think it be a great lvl 60 end to our ilusion/fear/stun lines and loads of fun. <P>I seen this mentioned already, but Dizzy is useless, forever recast time, and will break even before whirl would.<P>Also I want to say I agree with you about keeping enchanters playing the class. I have played since about July of 99 and my enchanter, now at 44 was my first char. My god is karana and I live with that. I have taken my time and learned how t play and encahnter, I was in Karnors at 43 hunting , helping a group, and they had no idea I was only 43 till I told them... The only effective enchanter is one who has taken the time to level correctly, and learn the class. Don't make it too easy on them.<P>I do not feel we are over power, nor do I feel we are greatly under powered, I am quite happy with my enchanter.<P>Yes I do think we should be able to make magical items, perhaps being able to jewel a sword, place sword gem one gem two and gem three and see what you get with the sword. Maybe entend that to fineplate since a fine plate suit IMO would have gems on it...<P>Well I hope this helps... I hope you like the idea of Mimic...<P>Jadenjasmin Draco'Lamia &lt;Alliance of Souls&gt; GM<BR>44th Level Highelf Enchanter -Xev<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know you dont like to read this Absor, but I dont have time to read all the other posts to see if it has been said. I have however read the summary on Castersrealm, and this was not in there.<P>One of the things I find most irritating as a chanter, is trying to target the right mobs. This is something that you learn over time, but in some cases its still VERY hard to target the right mobs for mezzing. This is especially true when you have 3+ pulls of monsters like Skeletons and Gargoyles, whose name doesnt appear over their head. When you have two of these, a simple "stand behind tank and press nearest enemy" will work. Targeting the other mobs is EXTREMELY hard though, since you cant tell which one of the mobs you currently have targeted. I have a couple suggestions for fixes to this:<P>1. Get some damn names over all monsters' heads. There is no reason some mobs should not have their name tags, and it makes mezzing unnecessarily hard in some cases.<P>2. Implement a new function that allows "cycling" between closest NPCs. It could work like this: <BR>When you have something targeted with nearest NPC, pressing the cycle button will target the closest un-targeted mob. To avoid jumping back and forth between two mobs, the client could remember the last - say 5 - mobs targeted, and will not target those. To reset it (get closest NPC regardless of previous targeting), just press nearest NPC again. I realize this would probably require some extra programming, but it would really be a great function. Of course, a similar funcion could be added to the nearest PC button.<P>Thanks for listening, and I hope to see an answer.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lull Line - I understand why chanters get this line of spells, but the chance of an enchanter living is pretty slim if you aggro an entire camp of blues on you...unless your group is coordinated enough to taunt them all off you with some sort of aoe spells.  I don't trust my xp enough with pick-up groups to ever even consider this as an option.  I'm not really sure what to do about this line...as it stands, I've never seen this line of spells used (other than the unresistable harmony line)<P>Rampage line - Make this stack.  This will not unbalance anything.  This line of spells has a damage absorption component that pretty much means it's gone the first few seconds after you start getting pounded on.<P>Illusions - Please put Illusion: Halfling on the normal illusion vendors.  It doesn't make any sense why I have to travel to Erudin to look like a halfling...none of the other player race illusions are like this.  Hehe...another illusion idea...Illusion: Guard...makes you look like a guard in the zone you're in and put you on their faction.<P>Augment line - Please make the executioner axe proc not overwrite this.  No tank I've met preferred the very short proc to augment.<P>Bind sight line - if the target is out of range, please make the spell fail and tell you so...not just give you some random view of the zone =)<P>Pets - Add "A Suit of Sentient Armor" (Wakening Lands) to the global model and make it the visual for the lev 60 chanter pet...similar to what was done for the lev 60 necro pet.  I'd like a little bit better model tho...the helm on the thing looks a bit squarish...full plate helm would look more menacing.<P>Voice graft - Yeah...but there's nothing like controlling someone's mind and making them say something.  However, I'm not gonna cry if we never get this =)  I don't see how this is a class defining spell...I've only seen one person use it...and it got rather annoying.<P>Memory Blur - This spell will not give any indication that it failed.  I've cast this on mobs before that were not kos to me when they were attacking me (for various reasons), the cast was successful, but they kept attacking.  Two mobs I can remember this happening to me with are Dragoon Zytle (West Commons) and Broon (EK).  I've heard others with this complaint, too.<P>Unresistable spells - Chanters have two that I've never seen resisted...Tashan line and Mem blur lines (even tho Mem blur occasionally seems to not work w/o give a message saying so).<P>Charm - I've had occasions where my charmed pet went rogue and nobody in the group could attack it until someone cast cancel magic on it.  I did not go LD.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
