</FONT><HR>Heh yah, I have to agree with grimstaff as well. For mages and wizards, rains are best used on single targets as anything more dilutes its power\efficiency (expecially when you account for resistences and relative damage to each target).<P>The last real AE mages get is lvl 51, though there are some rains after that. For the AE mage, fixing rains would really help them out givven their already sparse AE spell list.<P>Also, for an AE spell, why do rains work best on single targets?<P>Alcheon of Prexus<BR>Wizard (yah yah, not a mage but same issue)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A good point is that you mentioned earlier how some melee types are offense oriented, and how some are defense oriented...but not both.<P>Well, mages are definitely offense oriented (our only escape spell is gate...we have only 4 buffs counting our damage shield which I would argue is an offensive spell). Yet, we are as good at offense as a high level druid (who are the masters of mobility...who I would argue are much more defensive oriented...well actually they're both.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seems to me lots of the talk is about stuff that would be 'nice' instead of stuff that is really class balance. The class does have some problems however...<P>1) Damage Absobtion. I.e. Rune Series, Shieldskin series. All caster classes in the game either get the ability to cast these spells or heal themselves (ench - rune, nec wiz - skin, dru shm - heal). These spells are pretty much required to keep them alive, especially in the post 50 game where you die in seconds.<P>Magicians, as it is, have the HP of a caster and no way to heal or protect themselves from damage. This accounts for many very quick deaths in 50+ zones, and lots of problems even in level 30 zones. Ever fight 3 level 30 mobs at the same time and simply not be able to do anything but wait for your pet to kill them one at a time? This is more because of our lack of Root, but could also be helped a lot by having damage absobtion.<P>I like the Armor series that mages get, the regen is nice, but it simply does not compare to the Shieldskin series.<P>2) Root. Mages do not recieve root in any form. When I was level 10, leveling with my Necro friend, we would talk about how if we recieved root we would be so powerful. Then I understood that a low level mage w/ root could easily kill many mobs with the added time to cast a new pet. Yet had a to learn how easy it is to chain cast pets, or that Necros recieve the ability to root at level 29. When I found that out.. It makes me wonder why dont we recieve root? If it's so unbalancing that mages would be to powerful, why dont we simply get it at a much higher level?<P>3) This probably isnt an issue for many people.. but for those with the Magician Epic weapon it is. The weapons effect, the *big* pet, happens to get stuck a lot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">. The best example for this is Cazic Thule, try dragging him through the doors. He'll just run into the door for a while, then 'gate' back to where you made him. A 'Shrink Pet' spell would be very useful for situations like this, and also helpful during raids.<P>4) Nukes. The Magicians final 'nuke' is a Bolt, Seeking Flame of Seukor (1024). Hense it is very hard to use on raids, or high level encounters. We have to revert to our 57 Shock of Steel (825), but most of the time encounters like that are immune to Magic, so we have to revert to our level 52 Char (702).<P>It would be very nice if Magicians recieved and upgrade to the 52 Char at level 60, even if for the same damage as the Seeking Flame. Having the ability to decide between Bolt or DD would be extremely helpful.<P>There have been arguments for an Ice line of DD's for mages also, as they are the 'Master of the Elements'.. it would be nice, and helpful, but I'm not going to start hoping just yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>---<P>Other than those things there, theres many other, non-essential things that would be nice if they were looked at, such as expanding the Spells Vs. Summoned line, 52/58 Fire pets, why level 54 spells Voc: Water and Bandoleer of Luclin drop off the 55+ spell table (Juggs etc.), and countless other good ideas listed in this thread.<P>One additional thing I think would be pretty cool.. if we were given a Summon: Bow spell, and we gave the Bow/Arrows to our pet, it would be sweet if it could start shooting arrows.<P>- Kaltare, 60th Mage VZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR,,,,<P>The list is good and a good start.  here is a diffrent idea.<P>Mages in the purest form in EQ are master of the elments.  So why not allow mages the ability to get the apperance of an elemental.  This isnt unbalancing in any way and dosent take anything away from chanters.<P>Pet pathing, in POH and in charduk and in seb the pet goes everywhere.  How abotu a summon spell that no matter what summons your pet to you. (in fight or not) yes this may or may not cause a train pending on how far away the pet is.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>For the issue with mages soloing,, yes we need better DD's with higher dmg.  pure and simple and allow the spell lava bolt to increase in dmg like other bolt spells.  <P>Mages not druid should be the #2 DD caster behind wizards.  This is why.<P>In the beginning there were wizards, but a group of wizards decided to concentrate on specilizing on the elements vers wizard studies. (wizards being the best DD in game)<BR>So since we parted from the wizard discipline we lost the ability to port around. So with this in mind i think the DD we do should be increased to reflect this.  After all druids by nature are good peeps, love tunare and the wild, hence they dont need the #2 best DD in game.<P>MAJIE 55 mage of POVAR<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this idea has been brought up... but it concerns AoE Fear and pets.<P>What if the pet, when feared, went and cowered behind his master (effect similar to /pet back off) and couldn't be commanded to attack until the fear expired.<P>The pet could reply something like:<BR>"Sorry master, he's too strong for me!" (okay, not great, but you get the idea)<P>That would preserve the effect of the fear for the mob but lower the chances of the pet running around and ruining the mages day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here are my ideas to make the mage a more rounded class.<P>Allow mages the ability to summon a new pet that kills the old pet as soon as the new pet spawns, the reason for this is that mages have zero spells to stop a mob beating on the mage if our pet dies.  <P>When fighting large mobs such as dragons or giants its almost impossible to get anywhere near our pets to kill them off and summon a new pet as teh range on large mobs is greater than our pet command range.<P>Necromancers, Enchanters and even the Shadow Knight both have at least 2 spells that can hold a mob off long enough to summon a new pet but for a mage if the pet dies its either RUN, GATE or zone if your lucky.<P>I belive the mage should have the ability to at least always be able to have a pet up as this is our only means of defence, the addition to a pet health bar that many have suggested in this talk would go hand in hand with this idea.<P>Magicians did not recive an upgrade to invisibility, no one know why we havent, we just didnt, I therfore suggest that mages get Invisibility VS Elementals/Summond mobs, this would be in keeping with our class sort of like how a necro has invis vs undead because he is a master of undead.<P>I would also like the mage group damage shields to include group pets due to mages having to keep both the single and group fire shields memmed in order to keep a group and our pets DS'ed, after all whats the point in having a Group spell if it dosent cast on everything in your group!<P>I would also like to see the mage get a spell that gates the mage back to a second bind spot that can only be bound inside a city and is self only. The reason I ask for this type of spell is that mages do have a hard time traveling. <P>Because of the problem of mages losing there pet when zoneing mages very rarely travel with a pet and as we have no other means to defending our selves or any speed enhancement spells mages are proberbly the most vunrable class in EQ when traveling. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>People have been saying the No Rent suggestion won't fly...here is an alternate idea I saw on another thread--<P>**************************************************<BR>For what its worth, the best "general purpose" suggestion that has been put forth that I have seen is this: <P>The system knows when you go LD versus camp - ie it marks you LD, whereas if you camp, it logs you off normally. If you go LD, add a "spell" effect like a rez effect, only it doesn't do anything negative to you. A lot of spells have a fixed duration, so the system knows when the buff is "put" on you. If you log back in in a certain amount of time, the LD effect is still on you, and you keep any no rent items. If you log back in after the LD effect duration has expired, you lose all no rent items. If you camp, then you lose all no rent items just like you do now.<P>They haven't shot this one down yet, to my knowledge, and I think it would take a little creative effort on their part, but its doable I believe under the current system.<P>Akherat<P>**************************************************<BR>Genthiel<BR>40 Mage Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Number one on my list:<P>1. You are correct about that lvl 52 and 58 fire pet. They suck.<P>I use extensively the fire pet, and even though I have not reached 50 plus lvl, I have seen these higher lvls pets in action.<P>The lvl 49 Fire Pet can nearly handily kill a Sea Fury, but the post-lvl 50 Fire Pet dies. Pets are supposed to grow progressively stronger, not weaker. I am sorely disappointed in the weakening of this pet.<P>Bring back the old fire pet, or make this one better.<P>2. I like the DOT's. Necros have a few DD spells, not to mention their life tap is as good as DD. So us having a few minor DOT's doesn't hurt much.<P>3. The major thing I would like to see is a spell that allows us to break a 2 spawn at least.<P>I was thinking of a summon spell that has a long cast time, allows us to cast a spell like root (say one charge.) The spell line I had thought of is was summon Constraint. The disadvantage being that if we hit the creature it automatically breaks, no save required.<P>Since you have mentioned that we can solo at almost every level, a spell to break a 2 spawn would fit us nicely while not eliminating the usefulness of other classes.<P>Other than these issues, and the ones you have already mentioned, I am extremely happy with the class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I to love my mage and do think it is very enjoyable to play. There are alot of great ideas here and wish i could read them all.<BR> First of all i would like to say that losing my pet at ld is no big thing for me but all the rest of the stuff is a hassle.<BR> Secondly, the summoned staffs would be great as 1hb at level 24 when pets do get dual weild. The effects that you have put on them are terrible though as they are rather usless as a spell during most of my gameplay time.<BR> Thirdly, I love my armor series spell and do not want to just be able to click on spirt series to take effect away. I would like mine to make others that dont stack say no thanks i have better. There has been many times where i start to tell group no tto heal me as i have a regen then lo and behold some cleric overwrote it.<BR> It would be great to get some type of snare or root even if it is only a 5 to 10 second spell thus giving us time to get off a gate. Maybe even make gate a two part spell where you get this 3 second cast time of root followed immediately by a gate. Problem there would be if to close to mob but that is something i could live with.<BR>  BUt more importantly, I would love to see the spell summon portal. I think this would be outstanding for mages. It would be similar to teleport only it summons a portal directly to  just outside the gate of all major cities. This would gives us a type of evac for later levels if we get a group portal thereby making us more viable option on raids. At the very least self only would be great to. Another idea that just popped into my head would be  last 5 bind point gate option. Well thanks for the time and i was pleased to see you have a real understanding of our class.

</FONT><HR>Magician pets should be made invulnerable to PC based AOE. At least in their groups. Especially in pvp. Magicians have NO USE FOR AOE spells in pvp. They kill off pet, injure friends, and aggro pets to you.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>This is the post you want to read<P>I'm sorry if I tend to disagree with you on this. The magician class needs as much if not more than any of the hybrid calsses that are getting a lot of attention. You think the majority of the issues are trivial. Well let me list the issues that are not trivial, and are indeed broken<P>I will write this keeping in mind the issues you are and are not aware of, and have prior knowledge of. I will also try not repeat the issues already addresses (lev 60 aegis of ro, lev 54 pet spell drops,  etc)<P>I will refrain from naming Mage Epic a “class balance” issue, consistent with your other posts<P>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUES<P>1. Lev 52 and 58 Fire pets<P>Problem :<BR>I want you to understand the issue. These pets are supposed to be wiz casters. Currently they use wiz lev 16/20 spells. Which are very mediocre nukes, which get resistsed (since the pet levels are much lower than PC or mob levels during fights) and they dont even chain cast these mediocre nukes, they move in to melee. And they melee for only 28 dmg when comparable pets (earth, air, water) hit for 56-60. All in all it's damage output is pitiful, PLUS it has the least hitpoint. <P>Solution:<BR>Now that you understand the problem, I propose that you either raise the lev of spells cast by the pet to the wiz 24/29 spells and stop making it melee but just chain cast from a distance (it's a wiz after all), or remove the whole wiz concept, and give us the old fire pet back which casts a huge DS on itself and melees for as much damage as others despite it's low hp. <P>2. lev 44 and 55 DoTs<P>Problem :<BR>We dont hate the fact we got a DoT like you said. It's fine. It adds a little diversity. But it's useless right now. e.g. the 55 DoT compared to 57 DD. the DoT takes longer to cast, takes 30 sec to complete it's effect, has stacking issues, has a worse ratio that the instant hit DD, gets resisted more, has an all-or-nothing type effect, etc etc. <P>Solution:<BR>I think all classes with DoTs have to deal with stacking issues, the fact that the monster may move and reduce ratio and all-or-nothing type effect. That's the nature of DoTs. But other classes get excellent damage ratios. e.g. even the Enchanter Torment of Argil lev 56 DoT does 560 dmg for 150 mana with 2.5 sec cast time and debuffs int and wis and drains mana!!!! The damage ratio alone is superior to our lev 55 DoT does 800 dmg for 265 man for 7 sec cast time!! how pitiful. Why would I use this over my lev 57 DD, which does 825 dmg for 275 mana with 6 sec cast time and hits instantly!! Lets not even compare to the far superior dru/nec/shaman dots. We're not even better than Enc DoTs !! Please make this DoT do nearer to 1100 dmg or move mana cost down to 200 ish AND make cast time 3 sec or something to make it useful. It's worthless right now.<P>3. Mage DD mana ratios and resists<P>Problem:<BR>The mage DD and Bolts in the post 50 period received extremely pitiful upgrades. This was done to remove the magician from being second behind the Wizard in nuking power to third behind wizard and druids. Druids received far superior upgrades to their DDs. Did you ever wonder why no druid ever complains about their DD ratios. Plus Necro (lifetap) and Wiz ( Lures ) get far better opportunity to inflict damage in Epic encounter while all mage nukes are resisted. Don’t tell me that the mages do damage via their pets, so do the necros. <P>Solution:<BR>Please review the mage dmg/mana ratios for 50+ spells. Esp our bolts, which have an inherent flaw which makes them difficult to use (line of sight, z-axis variation) on top of which they don’t even have better ratio that the Druid DDs. I think the ideal solution would be to give the mages a crappy version of a Lure type spell at lev 59/60. Something with a poor mana ratio like 600 dmg for 300 mana or something, compare that with the Wizards Lure of Ice which is 825 dmg for 320 mana. There must be SOME appropriately nerfed version of a wizard lure spell that would be balanced in not pissing of the wizards, giving mage Epic encounter options, and basically adding to our arsenal in a balanced manner. Hence we might have poorer ratios than Druid DDs (and they get better heals now too) but we have added variety in our nukes. Believe me, some crappy version of a lure would make all parties happy. Just have to find the right ratio.<P>4. Anti – Summoned DD<P>Problem:<BR>Magicians receive a line of DD spells which we can use against summoned creatures only. Currently there are extremely few summoned-only mobs out there, as opposed to the hordes and hordes of undead creatures out there. It’s hard enough to find a mob to use it on, but then it has a dmg/mana ratio which is WORSE than our regular DDs which we can use on all mobs. Compare lev 56 Exile Summoned DD ( summoned creatures only ) 725 dmg 250 mana to lev 57 Shock of Swords (can use on all mobs) 825 dmg, 275 mana. Why would I ever use the summoned-only DD when my regular DD is better !! <P>Soultion:<BR>Please raise the dmg/mana ratios of the summoned-only DDs. Raise the lev 56 Exile Summoned’s dmg to like 900 for 250 mana to make it more balanced. Also add the “summoned” tag to more creatures if possible. <P>5. Rain Spells<P>Problem:<BR>You know all about it. The resist rates are ridiculous (try casting it) and it hits our pet. <P>Solution:<BR>Remove pet as being counted. This does not make them unbalanced. Keep in mind that we cant use these spells 90%  of the time since it’s an AoE and will break mezzes. It’s very situational. Plus resist rates are incredibly high, please look into them, they need to be somewhat lowered.<P>IMPORTANT ISSUES<P>6. Lev 56 Dyzil’s Deafening Decoy<P>Problem:<BR>You know it. The pet is useless because the taunt is non-existant. There is no reason to use it.<P>Solution:<BR>I like your suggestions. Make the AoE Taunt REALLY grab everyone’s attention. Reduce casting time. <P>7. Lev 55 Rage of Zomm<P>Problem:<BR>I couldn’t care less what the pet looks like. I wouldn’t waste your time with such trivial issues. Right now the pet has 100 HP. Yes only 100 HP. You need to select a mob to cast the pet, since it will only attack that mob, and suicide after the mob is dead. Obviously the pet was never supposed to tank, but right now it will sometimes kill itself on the mob’s Damage Shield or will die on 1 riposte. Plus this pet has a 8 sec cast time, which you cast *during* battle, not before like the other pets. This cast time is a major hindrance. The pet is going to suicide after the mob dies anyway, why not give it a 2 sec cast time. Plus why does it have a 2 min re-cast. Is a 100 HP pet really that over-powering ??<P>Solution:<BR>Give the pet atleast 300 HP so it wont die on a single riposte. It still cant tank, 300 HP will get wiped out in one round of a mob’s damage. Plus give it a 2 sec cast time, and rather remove or significantly lower the unnecessary re-cast time. The pet has extremely limited uses as of now.<P>8. Pet mana costs<P>Problem:<BR>Mages used to be the masters of summoning cheap pets. All our pets were 200 mana from lev 20-50. This was out trademark as the other pet casting classes had increased costs. Post 50 our pets costs were increased  to  400 mana while our pets were given minimal improvements. e.g. Take the max dmg by the best possible Air pet summoned at various levels. Lev 29 Air pet (28 max dmg), 34 air pet (34 dmg), 39 air pet (40 dmg), 44 air pet (48 dmg), 49 air pet (56 dmg), 53 air pet (56 dmg – Yes , same !!), 59 air pet (58 dmg). The pre-50 pets were 200 mana and gained new abilities every few rounds (dodge, kick, bash, parry, dual weild, regen etc) , post 50 went to 300 and 400 mana and gained no new abilities. <P>Solution:<BR>Either reduce costs on post 50 pets to 200 mana again., or give them better max dmg (I doubt this is acceptable) or , more appropriately, give them more skills. Give the Voceration pets lev 51-54 the riposte skill as well, and increase bash/kick skill caps. And give the Greater Voceration pets 57-60 either triple attack, or critical hits, or even higher skill caps on dodge, parry, kick, bash etc. Hence you would only minimally increase their power, but would justify the increased mana costs and the negligible increase in damage output <P>9. Pet Utility spells<P>Problem:<BR>Brainstorming better ways to make pets useful, and to really hone the idea that mages derive their power through their pets.<P>Solution:<BR>The valiant companion spell is an excellent addition. Making pets immune to fear is a wonderful idea and will increase our usefulness on Epic encounters. Would a pet-immune-charm spell also be considered. On the same lines. Also I like the idea of summoning my own pet back if not agroed, thanks. The new Expedience spell introduced on Test at lev 29 makes our lev 58 Velocity obsolete. How about a new spell at lev 58 which essentially acts like a war/rog/mon discipline. Giving us the ability to increase our pets damage potential (most of the damage done is melee dmg except for the broken fire pets) with some spell which last e.g. 3 min depending on the strength of the spell and has a 15 min re-cast time. This obviously has a downside since it will grey-out one of our slots for a long period to just use the spell, and then pets will after all be pets. They cant be used in all situations. Possible spells can be doubling all dmg, giving crit/crips, riposte attacks (useful for decoy pet when fixed) etc etc. Something useful at lev 58+ mages for special situations<P>10. Pet Heals<P>Problem:<BR>We get pet heal spells at lev 8 and 20 and then the line disappears. We can make a new pet for 200 mana. Why not give us better heals for our pets ? Why was this line abandoned ??<P>Solution:<BR>Let us CH our pets for the same cost of a new pet, you can even take the component. This has the upside that if we spent hours and hours summoning and re-summoning till we get our best pet out we don’t lose it. Also we don’t need to buff it all over again. <P>RELATIVELY MINOR ISSUES<P>11. Robe of Conjuration<P>Problem, Solution:<BR>As you know the robe has our lev 49 DS. Plus it has a huge casting time. The “mana-free” spell costs only 120 mana. Even the 56 DS costs only 155 mana. The necro robe has a 700 mana costing spell and the casting time doesn’t matter since the spell is cast during CR and hence downtime is irrelevant. It speeds CR since the necro doesn’t need to med. I think the best equivalent would be the lev 55 Call of the Hero. It will save us from the 500 mana cost and the casting time wouldn’t matter when the spell is cast outside of fights. But as of now the lev 49 DS effect is messed up since I can med up the 120 mana in the 30 sec cast time. So the whole point of mana free is irrelevant. <P>12. Phantom Armor<P>Problem:<BR>Two problems with this. Both simple and you are aware of them. Costs 4 cat’s eyes. Need a new component. And cleric can over-write with higher AC spell, but we want our HP regen. We cant even click off the cleric buff.<P>Solution:<BR>You know what to do =) Fix it<P>13. Pouch of Quellious<P>Problem:<BR>We get summoned throwing shuriken that only Monks and Rogues can use, not even us. Ok. !! So monks and rogues will come to mages and ask for it right ? no !! Monks now get armor that summons our LEV 55 pouch of quellious. This isn’t a spell that we can cast on 13 classes and 1 class got the ability to exclude us. But only 2 classes can use this, and monks get a armor to make it now !! <P>Solution:<BR>Make our version of shurikens better, so monks still come to us, or give monks our lev 20 throwing daggers spell, or less reluctantly, our lev 53 Bandoleer of Luclin, a lower version of our lev 55 Pouch of Quellious. <P>14. Improved Invisibity<P>Mages earned the right for this as much as any other caster.<P>That is all I can think about for now. There are probably other valid issues but I cant remember. I am not going to waste your time by asking for defensive spells (root, snare, fear), mana regen spells or other such outlandish suggestions. Most of these issues listed above are suggestions on corrections on abilities we already have. The only new spell ideas I think would be balancing are some pet buff at lev 58 + (suggested above) improved invis, maybe an upgrade to our lev 52 fire based DD (not mentioned above) , and maybe letting us manipulate (charm, fear, root, mez) summoned only creatures. There are few of them out there to make this work if balanced.<P>I hope you found my rather long post still concise, and enlightening you to the VITAL issues, hopefully from a perspective you had not received before. <P>If you can just answer to these points, I doubt any magician would feel their issues weren’t heard, regardless of whether you respond favorably or not. <P>Thanks for listening<P>Best regards<P>Desi Dhamaka of Omega<BR>59 magician of Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm trying to read this post and the all the answers, and I have to say I think all the changes Absor mentioned are right on.   Including Improved Invis (we get invis before wizards, and it's the only way I can travel and not die, they can TP).<P>I also agree with the peanut gallery that mages aren't even close to the best soloers.  We are limited to where we can go, and we can't do any of the cool stuff, and it is completely unsafe most of the time.  A wizard has BOF, and COF.  Necros have fear.  Druids are druids.  If any of them get an add, they can survive.  If I get an add it's time to gate.  Because a pet and myself can only take one low blue at a time.  An even or higher is a death wish. And a high blue is a risk that isn't worth the xp.  I've given up and group to the point where I have to wait to find a group like a cleric, and mages aren't as welcome.  (And if your intent was to pigeonhole me into grouping, give me some group helpful spells.  Bolts are useless in a group)<P>I also agree without a pet we are screwed because we don't have a stun or root.  And in situations where I am in a pathing/no pet zone, people ask me why I am not stunning.  I'm not opposed to a change but I understand it could overpower us.<P>Mage epic quest.  I give up, unless that staff drops off someone other than Innoruuk I am not going to consider doing it.  It's a guild flame war if it drops, and it's a raid only zone. /bow<P>What I personally want:  <BR>1.Sheilds for pets to weild.  I  have never gotten a normal sheild for my pet to weild, but I still want a pet bashing with a sheild. It'd be ultra cool.<P>2.I'd like pet taunt to work better against mobs.  I've been in situations where my pet couldn't save me because the intelligent enemy won't aggro off me, when we are both at full hp.  If my channeling doesn't save me, I'm a dead mage.<P>3.More mage specific items.  The foci items are good, but the other ro items no mage over 20 seems to wear anymore.  And the mage only drops in Kunark are significantly less.  Talking to people about how cool the class specific loot from VS was for them got me curious.  Mages got a lousy weapon. <P>4. I want to wear black clothes.  I want to be a magician in all black, sans robe.  I'd settle for being robeless.  But have you seen what a high elf looks like in leather?  It's bad news.   I look like a janitor when I equip the broom  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5. Increase on waterstone time, or a warning with that spell is leaving (other than the flash) unlike lev, waterstone effect didn't warn me and I was trying to get a summon for a cleric up.  Thank god he could rez.  (The bard was amused, it said he killed me)<P>6. More caster sheilds.  I don't want stats.  I just want to have one.<P>7. Item summonings: I agree, no one over level 4 wants a weapon I summon though it can be blamed on a flooded market.  But It'd be nice for my pet to weild.<P>8. More amusement spells at earlier levels.  Considering they don't do anything anyway, can't I have something to entertain people with?  I am magician.  Can't I summon some flowers?<P>Lastly I'd like to actually thank Verant for Monster Summoning.  The spell is dumb, the pet is usually weak, but the amusement factor is awesome.  I would also like to know if maybe we could get different monster pet effects?  So far they are just mage pets with a different model, sans foci effect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Random idea:<P>LORE NO DROP items with long casting times and X charges of some attack/defence spell.  And I mean _long_.<P>LORE to prevent players from stocking up on them.  Hence, you know that a mage has X charges in a fight, period.  Allows it to be more powerful.  NO DROP to prevent N players from benefiting from them, where N is large, or having extras held by other people.<P>The long casting would prevent folks from using one, then getting another, during the same fight.  If it takes 45 seconds to summon a 'wand of fireballs', you won't want to do this when there is a mob who could break root at any time.<P>Stuff like staves with charges of DDs, orbs with charges of self-damage-shields, orbs with pet healing spells on them, etc.<P>Of course, this idea is probably too late.  Mages are already miniWizzies with pets, giving them the ability to summon combat-useful items and such could only be balanced if syncronized with a Wizzie upgrade or some other Mage nerf.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think mages are pretty solid pve except for the pathing and the fear business, they still have high damage output in groups.<P>the main problem with mages is their pvp ability, they are close to being the worst pvp class in the game at high levels, though they are awesome at lower levels.  with earth pet root being easily resisted and air pet stun pretty easy to resist too and not to meantion a non sowed, non jboot speed pre 58 pet, and long dd times there is absolutely no way to keep someone from running from you, its very frustrating and when you do try to chase them down your pet ends up lagging behind and the other player procedes to beat you senseless.  <P>also pets can be taken out of the picture easily by anyone who can root snare fear so that leaves mages pretty much as drunk wizards with no defense which sucks when the person who did fear your pet has his own pet out especially when its sowed in shamans case (necromancers and shamans).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well this is a letter i pre made just for this occasion =0 its suggestions from many mages..and many on this thread are great<P><BR>Absor,<P>Because of the class tweaking going on I posted a thread on a few good mage forums to get the general consensus on what they think could be done to help our class post 50.  No mages are arguing we are powerful enough in the 1-50 game, but when it comes to 50+ on raids we aren’t always first on the list of necessities.  So here they are…<P>Post 50 Pets:<P>Since post 50+ pets don't progress along the same growth curve as pre-50 pets and in some areas pets are prohibited by groups, mages need some more abilities to fit into the post 50 world. COTH is good, but it is not enough, especially since it is a rare drop and level 55. Mages need some fixes along the lines of other classes. When the power of other pet classes pets was decreased, they were tweaked with the addition of new spells to compensate such as hp/mana transfer. We are not asking for a clarity here or any mana regen at all (it would be nice) since you have said it wont ever happen.  Not overpowering, but useful to groups when pets and DOT's were not of service. Mages need a similar tweak.  There are some suggestions further in the letter.<P>Post 50th Fire Pets:<P>The reason that these pets need to be fixed is because the post 50th spells should have, in the very least, kept the Magician's power status quo compared to lvl 1-50. By replacing our standard Fire Pet with the Wizzie Fire Pet Verant has taken away a pet that had a lot of uses in various situations and replaced it with a pet that has limited uses in very certain situations. Effectively, this has lowered the Magician's power post 50th because the variety in pet summons has actually gone down because of this. <BR>Suggestions: Make 52 and 58 fire pet non-aggressive pets, they are wizards after all…no wizard runs up to something to try and cast on it and melee it at the same time, so if this is really a wizard pet, make it stand back and cast.  Also it has been suggested to give this pet the lvl 49 fire pet DS and maybe lower its Hp’s because it will not be fighting and will die fast this wouldn’t be too overpowering if tweaked a little.<P>Specialization:<P>Up until Kunark it was very hard to decide on what you should specialize in because many of the good high lvl Damage spells were of both.  Since Kunark came out almost every high level DD that we get is Evocation.  We are mages, not wizards, we are Conjurers and Summoners post 50, why are we casting Evocation spells, that’s a wizards job. Please change some of the post 50+ spells to Conjuration based.<P>Group Damage Shields:<P>Making Group Damage shields more mana efficient to be worth casting - You have taken under consideration making shaman group buffs more mana efficient.  I hope that you take Mage 50+ group damage shields under consideration for this too.  As it is, it takes less mana to cast DS on your group members than just to cast this spell.  <BR>Additional Idea: If it can not have its mana efficiency tweaked, is it possible to include pets in the casting of this spell? That would more than make up for the extra mana cost. <P>Pets in Group Spells:<P>Although I am not sure if it can’t or won’t be done many mages would love to see our pets and all other pets included in-group buffs and bard songs.  Not sure on exactly the specifics on if this would make our pets too strong, but maybe they would be a welcomed addition in place of a tank for once.<P>Rain spells:<P>Remove pets as eating a wave in Rain type spells... now that they are PC’s this may be easier than it was before to do.<BR>As is currently Rain spells are resisted a lot more often than any other DD, this grouped with pets eating a wave of it puts it in the back of many mages spell books (if they even bought it).  We are not asking for it to be on par with our other Fire and Magic based DD’s on resistances, but somewhere a little closer?<P>New Spell Ideas:<P>Simply to keep up with healing our pets at higher levels we need some way to keep them alive. <BR>Pet Heals: 2 new pet heals... 1 at 39 ... 1 at 50 (300 at 39 with slightly better mana to hp ratio than level 20 spell.. 500 at 50 again with slightly better mana to hp ratio than 39.. or Make level 20 spell increase in effectiveness as level increases.<P>New Summon Ideas:<P>Shard of the Core: Great idea for a spell the +poison resistance’s are a godsend on some raids, until you realize its No Drop which makes it a very small increase in power over previous resistance dagger summons.  Was this a mistake making it no drop?  <P>More Resistance’s Summons: They are great for raids and overall period, even if it means adding some resistance’s onto our existing 50+ summons and making them trade-able.<P>Weapon Summons: A couple good post 1 Handed weapon summonings.   Place a level restriction on them as with some items with possible proc..(Kunark and Velious weapons should warrant a change like this.. More for CR than anything)<P>An upgrade to Mod rod that we get at lvl 54:<BR>Modulators Rod<BR>Mana Cost 250:<BR>Takes 500 HP and gives back 350 mana <BR>Conclusion -500 HP for 100 mana.<BR>Numbers adjusted appropriately.<P>FA Quest:<P>Pegasus Cloak: It was said that you weren’t sure if this was No Drop or not and have since learned that it is.  This camp is one of the absolute worst in the game, if you can not increase the spawn and or drop rate of this, Please take off the no drop tag so that we can at least buy it.<P>Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth  - For many mages that I have talked to this is the only piece that they need to complete the FA.  Because Gods are on a week spawn rate, many mages will be stuck here for a VERY long time if not forever hoping they see a staff, let alone get one.  Please increase the drop rate on this staff, or even better as previously thought up, move it to one of his minions in Hate such as Maestro, thus increasing the chances it could drop.<P>In the end these are the most important issues that I could pull out of the people that responded, and I hope you can look through this and give us a response because many mages such as myself are becoming frustrated with the class we loved for 50 levels to only hate for 10. Many mages are counting on a response for hopes of getting some things fixed/changed.  Thank you!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part, I'm happy with my mage, even if he's level nineteen and I haven't played him in a month. *chuckle* (Real life... it just, well. I'm not gonna ruin it for a game)<P>Here are my major concerns: <BR>Summoned items being no-rent<BR>Pet Pathing<BR>Pet Summoning and/or Re-Summoning<P>Here are my solutions:<BR>Summoned items should NOT be no-rent as long as they are carried by a Mage. Do not, under any circumstances, tell me that this is developmentally impossible. All items have a number, right? When a player quits, check to see if (player-&gt;class == mage) before you start nuking items in with numeric id's that match those of summoned items. This makes complete sense, as the magi are the MASTER summoners. They should be able to control summoned objects even while unconscious.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>It'd be nice if my pet would always just stay three feet behind me unless I told it to "/pet guard here" ... Why can't the pathing for a non-player-character match that of a player-character? Just have him standing three feet behind me, wherever convenient.<P>Pets are neat. Eye of Zomm, Rage of Zomm, etc, are neat as well. Being able to create a life form on a whim is really, really cool in my opinion. It'd be nice however if instead of getting the warning "You cannot control more than one pet at a time!" (or whatever it says) when you summon a new pet, or even try, the old pet would get all jealous and feel depressed and run off, leaving you free to control the new pet. Essentially, the new pet 'replaces' the old one--which makes sense. You should just automatically lose control of the old pet when you summon the new one. Whether the pet gets lost or gets irritated at you and starts attacking you ... well, that's an issue you should solve yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Sy<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Wow, there are a lot of good posts and ideas in this thread. My eyes are blurring after reading all of these so it is a good chance that poor Absor feels the same at this point. I sure hate to put my post so far down but I missed when this post started (curse work anyhow!).<P>Pre 50 I feel that mages are exceptional in their abilities. Summons are alright for what they are and I can see no way for new summons to be added or exisitng ones to be fixed that will ever reach what most people would say is good for the level we get to summon them. I would like to see more "fun" summons certainly, but that is not a balance issue, just something to give the mage class a more unique feel. However, there is one aspect of summoning I think can help balance us in the post 50 game:<P>Summoned Proc weapons that are pet wielded only!<P>There is alot that can be done in this area that can make our pets really defined for certain roles depending on a weapon we can summon for their use. Sword of Runes is the only weapon we have that fits this role and there are so many more that can be made into something. Procing daggers, spears, rapiers, staffs, etc that are pet only wielded will give them a little extra juice during those big post 50 encounters where the mobs have so many HPs that people will welcome a mage even if the mage himself would be generally resisted on his own spells.<P>Rain spells are another area that we suffer at even more than other classes that get them. Currently as everyone knows our pets soaks up a wave, and I know that on Test this has been fixed. However, that really doesn't fix the two real issues with it. First, it is HIGHLY resisted. Even now I get resisted by level 30 mobs (I am 52) with my highest level rain spell. I have tried it on many different mob types and it doesn't seem to be specific to anything other than the spell itself. The second problem with it is that even if the pet didn't soak up any waves, this AoE spell only hits 4 times total. That is any combination of 1 target 3 times (the waves only come 3 times so the 4th hit would be wasted), 2 targets 2 times each, 3 targets 1 each with 1 of them geting hit for a second wave, or 4 targets once each. The spell has to successfully hit 3 times for this spell to even start being mana efficient. Right now if I want to cast an AoE I will just walk in and do a PBAoE that will hit up to 11 or 13 targets for 581 each. I did that in Splitpaw not too long ago and got all 11 or 13 gnolls that were surrounding our group (I got promptly killed by the gnolls after this cast, btw) so for my mana I got a LOT of bang. I persoanlly think the rain spells ought to be 3 waves that hit up to 4 targets EACH wave. Each target still has a chance to resist each wave and the rain spell would still be less mana efficient than a PBAoE. Please look into why this spell is so limited. Even with the new change going in I will certainly not use it over my PBAoE. Also as a side note, why did we not get anymore Column of Fire type spells? I loved that spell when I got it, but there has never been an upgrade to it. It is the only AoE spell I ever really used with any frequency.<P>Higher level heal spell would definitely serve well especially since we already get two now. Like a 500hp heal at 44 that takes a component, then a level 55 or 60 heal that was a complete heal but took a more expensive component. It will give us a few more elements to think about in our strategies...do we let our pet die and take 10 seconds to cast a new one for 300 mana or do we cast a complete heal that sucks up a component of some sort costs 300 mana and 5 or 6 seconds to cast?<P>The level 52 and 58 fire pet should either go back to the way it was or should become a real caster type and not try to melee, not to mention take out its dispelling abilities. NO ONE wants a pet that dispels. I have no problem with this being a weak wizard type pet as long as it can do some damage with its spells without being resisted almost every other cast and can do some stunning or other beneficial things that would not make me want to use an air pet or the old 49 fire pet in its place. This pet is something I never use which is sad since the pets are what really defines the mage class.<P>Most of my other thoughts are spoken of in great detail in previous posts but these issues are the one that I really think would help give post 50 mages a welcome spot in groups. As it is now I can only get into groups with friends and guildmates, but for me that is only about 15 people or so (small guild with only about 8 people near enough to me in level). I have a very hard time getting into a pickup group in any place that gives good exp or decent treasure and I feel it is mostly due to the bad rap mages get. <P>Oh, and one last thing....Mages soloing ability is incredible pre 50, but post 50 it is MUCH faster to be in a group. Things just have too many HP in the post 50 world for a mage to do better than a near full mana dump into most post 50 mobs and then have to sit to regain a full mana bar before doing it again. At those levels that takes alot of time and most groups can easily do 5 or 6 of the same mobs in the time it takes me to do that 1 and re-med.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Keeping in mind this is all about class balance (i.e. not a wish list), here's my, imensely abreviated, list of points:<P>Get rid of DoT's, they're a different damage delivery type, Mages should stick to DD only. It's all 'bout class distinction baby! On a similar note, no root/snare/J.boot function. Yeah it's a pain, but again it helps define us. Every class MUST have limitations otherwise where's the challenge? Learn to play (sic) to your strengths AND your weaknesses.<P>Having said that VI could alter some of our exisitng DD spells to include cold-based damage (and an appropriate air based damage type). Weaken them slightly to do this if need be (but not 'too' much!) This also promotes strategic variability (i.e. which damage-type works best against this mob?) rather than alwys using the same max-DD spell.<P>Increase damage on the anti-summoned range of spells. Not only are summoned type mobs very rare but my 'normal' DD spell of the same (similar) level does more damage, so why would I ever use the anti-summoned spells? Even if you don't include more summoned type mobs at least Mages would then be especially useful against those that do exist.<P>Our ability to solo is good but by no, means brilliant/easy. My current routine is to; log on, summon stuff, look for group, and if I don't find a group in 10-15 minutes log off. Sure i could solo, but it's damm boring and seriously inefficient compared to grouping. However, don't improve our solo ability, improve our group friendliness. How?<BR>1) Fix pathing<BR>2) Give us the ability to force caster-modeled pets to cast, not melee' <BR>3) 'Fix' rains spells [ooohhhh you DO listen! Thanks!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">]<BR>4) More 'useful' (see below) summons<BR>5) Help people find pick-up groups, some sort of in-game bulletin board that cossed zones (or at least the nearby zones). Maybe in Inns to preserve game fiction? Having this ex-game (i.e. the chat server) is almost useless, we need to be able to advertise (and chat about it) while already in the game (i.e. in a group). I'd be only too happy to run across 5 (or more) zones if I new I'd almost certainly get into a group when i got there!<BR>5) Give mages a (very) limited ability to promote mana recovery. Sorry, can't justify this quickly, going to need to post the full arguemnt:<P>On reflection the main [but by no means only] advantage of groups is to reduce down-time thus anything I can do to that end is going to render me group friendly. The two main ways to reduce down-time are; to do fast damage (thus shortening the course of the fight), and speeding the recovery of resources (mana & HPs) post combat. Allowing pets to work in all situations achieves the former goal as does targeting mobs by specific damage type (per below) and on the whole Mages are already pretty good at this (with the exception of pet availability restrictions due to pathing). The second technique is where Mages are currently weak, we do little to aid in the recovery of mana (aiding the recovery of HPs is waaaaay beyond of our remit). Mana rods are useful but limited and apart from that we have no ability in this area [that I can think of at the moment anyway]. The first, and biggest, question about this is "should we"!!? This is after all the provenance of Enchanters and it would seriously encroach on their territory for us to have a significant ability in this regard. However this is also an extremely group-friendly ability and an obvious way to encourage groups to take Mages. So to answer my own question, Yes! We should have this ability BUT only in a very limited fashion. Thus we could become Enchanter-lite, never as effective as Enchanters at speeding mana recovery (or Bards for that matter) but better than nothing in the absence of either of these two classes. This achieves two things, it makes Mages significantly more attractive to groups without seriously impinging on another classes ability. There's a really good analogy I like to use in this regard. Druids and Clerics, both heal (i.e. speed the recovery of resources, in this case HPs) but Clerics do it much better than Druids, and the fact that Druids can do it at all increases their attractiveness to groups without seriously undermining that of Clerics. If you need a healer a Cleric's the way to go, but a Druid is definitely better than nothing. Similarly Mages could be 'better-than-nothing' when it comes to speeding mana recovery without ever seriously threatening an Enchanters (and Bards) utility in this role. Thinking about it while several classes can speed HP recovery (Cleric, Druid, Bard, Shaman and even Necro (to a far more limited, i.e. individually, extent only) only Enchanters, Bards and Necros (again to that very limited extent) can speed mana recovery, there's a under-utilised niche' there just waiting to be filled! There's no mana-recovery equivalent of Druids, and Mages fit the bill beautifully. J [Yes, Wizards could claim this also but I see them as a far more focused class (the magic damage equivalent of warriors) to which end they need their ability to do DD improved, not hugely, but definitely improved].<P>Focus items for MS'ing.  A common, and very sensible, suggestion about this is to have the pet type summoned be that of the focus item held (regardless of the skin type). I can see a few odd situations arising, e.g. summoning a Muddite while holding the air focus item, but while a little counterintuitive this doesn't seriously threaten the gaming environment. This also removes any requirement to add another item specifically as a focus for MS'ing (unless VI want to do this of course). Failing to allow focusing MS's in some fashion renders this spell largely useless/irrelevant. No body at the levels when MS becomes available is summoning normal pets without a focus item (in my experience) so being unable to focus MS's punishes the Mage for using it. The alternative is to allow the pet to retain/incorporate some of the intrinsic abilities of the skin type summoned (i.e. Cyclops/Giants bash, Spiders poison etc.) While this is actually preferable to focusing MS'ings I'm betting is substantially harder to do (especially balance wise).<P>Weapon summons, specifically weapons with procs. Start small (in both weapon type and proc effect) and work up. Concentrate on weapons usable by Mags and/or pets (i.e. 1-handers; blunt, slash and piercing) but throw in the odd mele-only summon as well to aid group-utility. The ability to limit proc'ing to level (as can already be done) greatly inhibits, although not removes, these weapon's use as a twinking tool.<P>Armour summons. Again covered in detail in the 'summons'-thread. I think the Mcsummon-a-full-armour-set-in-a-bag idea is very nice but too much. Therefore you've almost got to go for the ability to summon very tasty armour even a low levels and increase the size/piece of armour by level rather than the effect. I.e. while all the summoned armour is of a similar tastiness at all levels, at low levels you summon the very smallest bits (wristbands, belts etc) and it's not until very high levels that you get the largest/most useful (in terms of coverage) bits (i.e. robes, tunics). There's an open question here about wether-or-not to make the armour Mage only or usable by all classes. If Mage only you can make them a bit stronger and more frequent (in terms of spell circles), but all-class is a very strong group-utility ability which would be very nice.<P>Many of the posts in these threads concentrate on the post-50 game, which is cool, but let's not forget the 'little' guy either. Having different sized pet-models at lower levels would be nice too! Maybe not every spell circle but maybe every couple? More variability of spell dmage-type (i.e. cold) at lower levels would also help.<P>In Conclusion; My Top 3 Magician Issues Are:<P>1)	Fix the well-known bugs, specifically: pathing and the post 50 pets (fire and decoy). This addresses class balance (by actually giving Mages abilities they're already supposed to have), promoting a Mage's usefulness to groups, and a Mage's usefulness on a plane raid, all in one non-skid™ easy-to-open package!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>2)	Lack of useful summons (especially for groups), 'useful' as defined by real-game situations, not idealised class/item designs…. [*cough* The Vision *cough*] My point here is we already have a fair number of summons, but they're not used simply because they're not typically very useful! ('situational use', while undoubtedly true at times, is too easy a defence for VI to hide behind here, if the payers aren't using it there's a reason, even spells are subject to natural selection!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<BR>3)	Give us a limited ability to speed mana recovery (especially in groups), nothing that would compete with Enchanters or Bards, but something that is 'better-than-nothing'. This would obviously make is somewhat easier for mages to solo which could perhaps be regarded as the definitive alternative to a root/snare ability.<P>While there many other things you could do to make Mages stronger/more group friendly they're not really needed and/or are often grossly unbalancing (i.e. bind stones, mana stones etc.), the one big thing to do is to allow us to use pets anywhere. As soon as it's 'safe' to use my pet groups will immediately be more interested in me. Obviously having some neat stuff to summon and hand out will help too!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks<P>Tdor, 30th Mage, Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like all the ideas, very well thought out analysis, Absor.  <P>Our summoning line really needs to be skewed to lower levels - the items generally would've been useful levels before we get them.  I'd like to see more charges on the items, also.  I'm thinking of the lev ring in particular (ok, you got me, i'm thinking mod rods too) - 3 charges over the current 2 would be a distinct improvement - the added pain of summoning a ring and then using it to cast the effect you're looking for in the first place should offset the low mana of the summoning.  That and the fact that it isn't given to us until level 39... (and the rods at 44 - yeah, levi and hp to mana conversion, they're not our class' strengths, but the classes that specialize in them get them very early, comparatively - heck, pets are being handed out like party favors).  The rings are only useful if you summon a couple every time you log in (I do if I'm gonna be on for a while, but LD's make this a gamble) - otherwise, they're planned-situation only.<P>Pathing improvements would also be a huge help.  Look at CoM, for one.  It's a mess.  <P>Gotta go, good luck!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor,<P>There are only a few things wrong with the mage class.  None are so broken that they need immedaite fixing, but I feel they are important enough to share.<P>1)  Summons:  I summon food/water and destroy the bag/bandages from Gift of Xev.  I summon a coldstone.  I summon a couple pet masks.  THAT IS IT on a daily basis.  The others get used maybe once a week..tops<P>2)  Epic:  Needing the staff from Innoruuk is insane in its current form.  Having to get an item that drops on average 6 times a year is just plain nasty and wrong.  And that is if you are the type of player who can do Innoruuk when he spawns.  I cannot and therefore will never get my staff.  No mage will ever multiquest it for me as it is such a rare item they will probably never see another one. <P>3)  Pets:  They mana increases of our post 50+ pets does not come anywhere close to the power increase that they receive.  Why am I paying double the mana for a pet that is just a couple levels higher and that is basically it?<P>Also, at the highest levels AE fear is not the worst part of a big game hunt.  It is the massive AE's that they cast.  Pets have no resistances other than one with fire and one with cold.  Pets often last no more than 2 AE's and since many of them are ALSO 100% resistant anything but melee damage and lures, mages are pretty useless.  Each pet should have an innate resistance (or at least very high resistance) to something like the water and fire pets.  Pets will still die to the massive melee damage but at least they will last awhile first.<P>4)  Pets part 2:  The level 52 and 58 pets are worse than the 49 fire pet.  It does less damage and has less HP.  It's spells are resisted on most big game mobs as they are 100% MR.  It's damage is actually on par with the other pets when it sits there and chain casts, but when it goes to melee (29pts MAX damage) it's damage potential goes WAY WAY down.  The fix is simple: up the melee damage.<P>That is it for now.  I am sure I can think of more given time hehe<P>Sumoner Deltorros<BR>60 Arch Mage--Bristlebane<BR>Club Fu</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few ideas...<P>Add jboots speed to the Ring of Flight.  Same duration as current, increase the mana cost and recast time.  Rings are non-stackable.  It is the ring of FLIGHT, not the ring of levitation.  <P>Add a new spell along the lines of the dimentional pockets.  Summon dimentional rift - cast it on yourself or a groupmate and it has the effect of pushing the player slightly out of our dimension (the target becomes invis and cannot move), the player cannot interact in any way else the spell is broken, essentially a feign death spell.  Cast it on a mob, assuming it is not resisted, and the mob is trapped for a while in the rift taking it out of the battle for a time, essentially a mez.  Cast it on the pet and the pet is contained in the rift, so the mage can move to a different area without having to tow the pet behind - like in dungeons.  When the spell wears off, is canceled, or the caster is attacked, the elemental returns.  Spell has a long recast time and regent component.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok i've read through all the threads above and i would just like to hit on one of the summons that no one has payed any attention to.  If you want to make it so mage's can solo better, we need to be able to regen mana faster, so far the only way to do this is a level 44 summon, modulating rod, it takes 225hp from you and gives you 150 mana, what no one is realizing is that it COSTS 200 MANA to summon! i mean the shaman canabalize costs 0! mana to cast, necro dark pact line cost at most 20 mana i believe. if you want mages to be able to solo better this is a must have, i mean lower the casting cost to like 20 or something, its pointless to summon them for the modulating affect as it is<P>secondly without our pets the magician class is a sitting duck. period. we have no root, no fear, no snare, i mean come on i'm running back to get my body and i get jumped, because i have no way to summon a pet cause all my components are on my body, we should get something maybe a low level root or fear, or something that lets us get to our bodies a little safer<P>well thats all i have to say, all the other topics that need to have been adressed are stated above =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>for the summoned items - <BR>rather than timing them from log in, I'd suggest timing them from last save.  If I summoned a bag on login and played for several hours, i shouldn't lose it on LD.  that's no better than the current situation.<P>you CAN make the Save code store the timer info for the summoned items so that the login process can check the values in the last saved game (assuming you have programmatic access to the last saved game file)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Few things I would like to see:<P>1. A /pet dont cast command. So if our earth pets for example have something on the run he wont root and take extra damage.<P>2. The Higher/More effective pet healing spells would be valuable.<P>3. Give us more pet only spells that just add proc's. Like a spell that falls into the line of Call of Etc (Ranger Spells). This would not require us to use summoned weapons for them. Yes on top of the pets natural spells they cast.<P>4. I like the idea about NO RENT items staying on characters for 30 minutes after logging to help with linkdeath.<P>5. The idea of "PLayer's name" Pet is good.<P>6. New Graphics Models for pets.<P>That's about it. I know some are far fetched but I'm telling you what I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this is not precisly a balancing issue, but I don't understand the thought process behind summoned items dissapearing when we log off.<P>It seems it would be more game oriented to have them disspear after a certain about of game time has passed, just like the buffs.<P>Unlike many posters I do not get to play more than perhaps 6 hours per week. I have a full time job and a small child and sometimes can only play for a hour at a time.<P>I love playing my magician but it is fustrating to have to spent the first 15 minutes of every session summoning pets, and food, and water, and weapons, and bandages etc. etc. etc. then have to sit and meditate until mana is back to full.<P>Could you consider at least those items carried on the magician to remain even through logoff?  Not pets, or items given to others, but those on the magician's person, or in dimensional pockets?<P>I don't see where this would affect the balance of the clases, but it would be a lot easier for those of us with limited time to play.<P>I also agree stongly that if we are supposed to use our pets to fight, than the pets must not cause an xp penalty, and should be kept under control in all situations. As many have said, if we can not use our pets we might as well be wizards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is my take on Rain spells in general. If you want I can parse some data for you but I have experimented with them for quite a while and know what I am talking about.<P>Example:<BR>Lava Bolt - Level 49 - 810 Damage - 300 Mana<BR>Rain of Swords - Level 49 - 3 waves of 324 damage (972 Max) - 375<P>I think the trade off of an additional 75 mana for an additonal 162 damage is fine. What is bad is the RESIST rate. I tested this out last month in Skyfire (yes mages can solo there, I spend 2 minutes fighting the mob then 10 minutes regaining the mana).<P>I can chain cast Lava Bolt and get resisted maybe .5 (partial) to 1 times in a battle. Sometimes none at all.<P>I can cast Rain of Swords and NOT get resisted at the same rate. I think one fight I managed to get one wave to do any damage and it was partial. Not once did I go through a battle and not get resisted. On average I was resisted on the rain spells about 50% of the time.<P>This was after casting Malosi.<P>I think it is a huge disappointment to the Mages overall to penalize one of the best lines of spells we get. Why give us a line of spells when it will never be used?<P>Summary<BR>Problem: Rain spells are resisted on average of 50% or more when used making them less efficient than a normal DD, even when coupled with our resist debuff. The added AE tag and 4 target penalty (if you need clarification I will provide it) makes this a limited use spell as it is. With the resist rate it's not even worth scribing.<BR>Solution: Make them equal to Normal DDs for resists. Even with Malosi applied I get resisted sometimes with my regular DDs so this won't overpower us and the added restrictions applied to the Rain spells will keep everything else in check.<P>Thank you.
