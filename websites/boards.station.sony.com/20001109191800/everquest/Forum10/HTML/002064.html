</FONT><HR>Something that is bothering me a lot is the fact that people in my group when i play my lvl 14 warrior have actually complained that im a stupid twink because I tell them a few pointers on their class and they just go ahenad and say ok know it all twink. And mean while other twinks in my group agree with my advice. I mean ive always been good at getting deals and making cash my lvl 30 bard gets called a twink every now and then even though hes my main. So please don't knock twinks we are your friend. Why would you NOT wanna group at an orc camp with a warrior in full crafted and an exe axe....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all I don't group with a bitpattern, I group with the person sittining at the keyboard, so I realy don't care if it's Twink or not. We'er here to have fun - and each to his own.<P>Now about using an exe.axe at orc 1 & 2 (FP i take it). <P>If I recognised it I would ask you - in a tell never public - to use a less deadly weapon. The reason for this is you a inadvertendly powerleveling me (Me = Kabump, Troll Warrior) and a Troll is a slow learner so I need a lot of hit's in order to max out my weapon skills. So were as I like you, I none the less hate your axe, at Orc 1 & 2 later I'll probaly love it when it saves my a... in a tight fight. I hope you see the difference.<P>Kabump<BR>Eh ..

</FONT><HR>That question should surely be why would you not want to group with a warrior?<P>Before you go any further im not bashing you.. please read on...<P>Also are you TELLING them pointers on their class or advising them on pointers on their class, for instance, "have you tried to do this while in combat or would you mind trying suchandsuch" this is good..<P>"hey can you TAUNT and BASH while fighting cos that your class job" is bad...<P>I once heard a warrior in EC shout.. HEAVILY TWINKED warrior looking for group... to which he recieved the most awful rain of abuse along the lines of "oh oh.. please group with me mr twink etc etc"..<P>Anyways depending on HOW you advertise the fact you want a group will decide if people want to group you.. i mean after all how many lowbies know what the HELL Crafted Armor is and does?!?!<P>Twinks ARE very good people to group with when they offer helpful advice to the group, or when they know the zone you are fighting in etc.. but i PERSONALY hate it when said twink tells me my equipment is LOUSY.. i wear most of my equipment because i like it OR its all i can afford in that slot right now (cept my arms.. but thats a sore point with me right now...GD bone armplates..)..<P>Sigje has never commented on someones equipment, except to ask about an EXE axe, but will happily answer any questions about her equipment wheres it found and how much it cost etc etc.. and has even sold some of it on the spot (i.e. BI Boots) to people in her group..<P>I myself am in no way against twinks.. i AM however against twinks who think themselves better than someone else by virtue of being a twink..<P>this is of course my humble opinion, and is NOT meant to replect the attitude of sir_denion who himself says he was advising people.. which i LOVE about twinks.. id happily group with a twink of that nature any day.<P>Daile, whos in a weird mood today...  the moral of this post is.. twinks should not make people feel useless as part of the group, if they are not doing as good a job as they might GENTLY nudge them in that direction..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I guess this isn't really the right board for this discussion, but as long as we can keep it civilized it should be okay..<P>(This is all my opinion, based on what i've seen in the game)<P>There seem to be several different types of twinking:<P>1. Newbie player twinks<BR>A newbie player is given lots of good stuff by friends, eager to get them up to the same level as they are.<P>This results in characters running around with over the top equipment and making the same newbie mistakes we all did. I have seen quite a few complaints along the lines of 'My fourth level character lost all their bronze armour to corpse decay etc...' They don't learn the game the hard way,, and end up ruining the fun of earning their own stuff. <BR>This twinking really bugs me, and I refused to be twinked by a friend when I started for those reasons.<P>2. Newbie gift twinks<BR>A newbie player is given a minor item to help them start off<P>I have accepted ‘twinks’ like this, but only unsolicited and just one or maybe two items. Giving a first or second level character a minor armour piece or lightstone will not make a huge difference, and can be given for small task such as collecting bonechips etc. If I give anything away, I always tell the newbie to pass it on when it is no longer useful..<P>3. Character twinks<BR>An existing character gives items to their starting character to get them through low levels quickly<P>I only have one character (at 12th lvl), so I am probably biased against it. There are doubtless many reasons to twink a character like this, and maybe when I have ran through a few characters, I will come to accept it as a way to avoid endlessly running through the lower levels.<P>To answer your question Sir_denion why wouldn’t I want to group with your character? Because as far as I can see, you haven’t worked to get the equipment you have. If I sold all my gear, I would probably be able to buy an exe axe, or two pieces of crafted, and here you are with it all.<P>I don’t mind people who give me advice, and human interaction and dissemination of knowledge is what makes EQ more than just 3d baldurs gate, but if a twinked character starts to give me advice, I’m already predisposed against that character. If you had dispensed the same advice in bronze with a mino axe, wopuld you have got the same response? Yes? Well then either they were jerks or your advice was too much like criticism. <P>I would say that if you want find people to group with, group with other twinks.<P>As a side note, I notice that in Verants FAQ, they refer to power levelling as ‘babysitting’. Funny how that term never stuck… maybe it doesn’t sound very good to /auction will pay for babysitting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">     <P>Talabrina<BR>Paladin of the 12th Order<BR>Karana<P>/em feels better now and goes for a cup of coffee…<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sir_Denion,<BR>  I wouldnt even worry about it.  You are trying to part good advise on some newbies if they dont want to take it fine.  If you are a twink in full crafted and exe axe you dont even have to group with them you could solo.  <P>Now for a story that I have.  Some backround My main is DE Ranger knows Kelethin & CB like the back of his hand this was my first EQ character.<P>My second char is a DE Druid also in Kelethin.  I was up on the orc hill one day and asked the people I was grouping with if they wanted to go to the front of CB entrance as there are tougher orcs and eaiser to control the situation as there wont be to many people camping there.  So we go and we have a good deverse group.  So after one nasty fight I offer up some strategy.  A wizzie was meming right where a cent spawns, I suggested he go to the back of the tunnel as that is the safest spot to mem and still see on his chat bar what is going on.  Well he gets all pissy with me saying this and that.  P.S. I am not twinked my two prize items were given to me by kind strangers A FS Morning star and an SBS.  <P>Well the cent pops and starts beating the crap out of him we finnaly get it killed but he is in bad shape and our cleric left and I was down on mana from the previous fight and saving his life on this one.  So he takes my advise and goes to the back of cave to mem. I tell him I will cast Camo on him so he wont be seen and tell what he can and cant do to stay inv. until he is ready to rejoin the fray.<P>Needless to say he goes to loot something cent pops and creams him he dies.  We get regrouped and talking thru group chat.  And I explain that my main character knows Kelethin and CB inside and out and I just trying to provide tips on staying alive.<P>These people were real newbies first chars and all.  Well after that we had no problems and everything went rather smoothly after that.<P>Needless to say it doesnt matter if you are a twink or not.  Good advise should never be turned down no matter where you are getting it from.   Keep up the good work Sir_Denion.<P><BR>Dayhel (Knights of Mythe Drannor)<BR>Ranger of 19 summers<BR>Terris<P>Wansdyke (Knights of Mythe Drannor)<BR>Druid of 9 rings<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's all in the presentation.<P>A helpful suggestion, as opposed to a sarcastic one is of course, preferred. (note, I have no idea how you presented your advice, this is a generic statement)<P>My suggestion?<P>ALWAYS give any advice in /tell.  NEVER in /g or /say.  Why? Because it embarasses some people, to know they could be doing something a bit more efficiently, etc.<P>My example. (ME) 10th Dwarven Warrior on Luclin, grouped with a 9th Dwarven Paladin at trainer hill in Crushbone.  For the two of us, the centurions are no problem, but the Trainer still puts up a BIG Fight!  Well, Paladin has his LOH up. The trainer pops, and we start to fight.  Well, he's yellow to me ,and pounding the snot out of us! I tell the Paladin that I need that LOH. Well, long story short. I died. So, when I respawn, he says "Sorry, I couln't target you, I kept getting the trainer."<P>So I tell him, Don't worry about it. You don't lose much XP at 10th, but check this out. (zone back into crushonbe) Now, see my health bar on the right side of your screen? "YES" Click it once. "Hey! I see you in my target box" Yeah, cool eh?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  Ok, hit your escape key now to clear the target box. "OK" Now, hit F2. "HEY! You're back in the target box!"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> Yup, F1 through F6 targets you and the people in your group in decending order, and clicking on their health bar on the right will also target someone. That way you don't have to try to work your way around whatever MOB you're fighting, especially when there's multiple Monsters.<P>He took it well, and ended up asking questions for over an HOUR while we hunted in Crushbone. It was a hoot! But if I had said something along the lines of "Try clicking on my health bar bonehead." I'm sure we would have been having a totally different conversation  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Now, I'm going to quantify this by saying, some people WILL NOT take advice, under any circumstances, no matter how well you put it. They're just like that. All you can do, is make your suggestion, and deal with it. They won't impliment it while you're there, but maybe after you leaven, they'll try it, and if it works, then perhaps use it from then on. Or so you can hope!<P>Damn I'm rambling hehehe...<P>Balkin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My 2 bonechips worth (too poor for even cp! LOL),<P>Ever since I started EQ, I have felt a sense of pride in being able to work my way up myself, dying-to-learn as it were, and not be dependent on begging, people power-levelling or twinking me.<P>I have received random buffs from people every so often (Hi Cuchulaine!!)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> However, I agree with with beccaj, I would rather adventure and earn things myself. If someone were to give me items, I would turn around and find another newbie to pass them on to then. I want to fight my way through and get my skills up, because I know I will suffer later on if I do not.<P>I personally welcome *ANY* advice a more experienced player has to offer. In my opinion, it would be foolish NOT to accept such advice. If the person is rude about it, I would just take it as it is and move on. This really is a game, and taking things personally is going too far IMHO.<P>*shrug* but what do I know?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well most of you know I am a firm believer in twinking and power-leveling *higher level players* In fact, I was invloved in twinking and PLing such a one last night. My friend just started a brand new wood elf druid and we want to get her to level 20 by Sunday, so she can go to my guild raid. She also happens to have a level 48 mage. If she didn't have a high level character, then I wouldn't power-level her. She would need to learn some things while leveling. Since she DOES have that high level char, she already knows those things.<P>I have not grouped my twink very much (she's on my wife's account, so basically, I power-leveled her myself, with my druid). But the few times I have, I have given out advice (in /tell) mostly to druids and rangers, and mostly regarding snare (I HATE it when no one snares). I am always tactful, and try to explain WHY they should snare everything. Once they see it work a few times, they are hooked. I NEVER say anything about anyone's equipment, including my own, unless they ask. I think it's just poor taste to make fun of someone's equipment, or brag about your own. I know I wouldn't like it if someone was making fun of my foreman's tunic on my level 47 druid  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"> (I've had that since level 20, and I REALLY need an upgrade).<P>If you group with a twink, find out if they have a high level char, and ask for advice if they do. Chances are they know a lot, at least about one class. If they are just there to brag, then find another group. Some are jerks, but some are actually nice people, who just don't like dying every five minutes in the lower levels. There's a good chance they have some ideas that will make your hunting experience both more profitable, and more fun.<P>Cuchulaine Kynthelig<BR>47th druid of Tunare<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

(this red still being basically killable by this lower level character).. and then  getting healed by the higher level character when needed.. also the higher tends to pull specific mobs for the lower one to kill..<P>Clerics and druids make by far the best Power levelers.. (called PL)..<P>Daile..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>When the server my guild is on had a split, several members of the guild went to the new server.  I stayed on the old server.  <P>The guild members that went to the split server asked me to create a character on the new server to be the "Guild Leader" there.  I now have that character up to 9th level.  He is in full patchwork (tailored myself), and has a very nice axe (not-magical, but nice).  I was able to afford the axe from getting lucky and killing many bears and finding several HQ Bear Pelts.<P>Right now, he is making silk armor for many of the higher level characters in the guild  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>He has been accused of being a twink many times.  Is knowledge twinking?  That is the only thing that has been passed to him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have to admit I agree with Uffe_the_Dwarf on the weapon skills.<P>If were' the same lvl, and we kill a move twice as fast as we should... that means my skill improvement just slowed down to half.  You're not only harming whoever you group with, but also yourself in learning slower than you should.<P>I've grouped with people with full craft around lvl 9-11...  Total twink, I was fine with it... and so new to the game I didn't have a clue.  I still don't mind grouping with twinks.  I don't twink, even after 4 chars... but some people put way too much importance in what they have...<P>"Hey, did you see this kick @ss sword?"  Well, some people go Oooo  Aaaa  but as the person here mentioned the shout in the zone... rude comments start flying.  If you don't display your twink as being a twink, you're usually fine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>About the skills: <P>Actually, trolls and ogres don't learn weapon skills any slower than other races. The reason is that weapon skills increase on dexterity, not int or wis. I'm pretty sure that both ogres and trolls have a fair dex rating. <P>Also, at low level (pre 20), that exe axe is not making a heck of a lot of difference in how quickly the mob is being killed. All chars below level 20 have a max amount of damage they can do. Even if they had a 50 damage weapon, they wouldn't be able to do any more than the max, which is around 25 or 26 pre-level 20.<P>Last, their armor does not make a huge difference, either. A level 30 warrior has a higher AC naked than a level 5 in full crafted. AC goes up with level, as do hit points. Don't get me wrong, having great armor definitely helps, but not as much as you might think. It doesn't make them invulnerable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I had a similar experience today in South Karana. I was passing through with a few guildmates, but got lagged out, and they zoned into Lake Rathe without me. I then hear a bard complaining no-one will group with him, and he's about the same level as me (31). I tell him in /ooc that he should just go to rathe mountains, and solo some cyclops, which is what I do in offpeak times. Then he announces bards can't kite, which really annoys me as this screams "twink" to me. I lose my temper a little bit and call him foolish, but other people in the zone express similar disbelief at my claims that I can solo a cyclops (amazing what some players dont know). I started arguing with him, but I regretted it and tried to actually talk to him /tell's. He got really angry at me, and said there was no way that I could kite cyclops, and that bards never got charm (its the level 27 song btw). I tried to point him towards good bard websites, but he just said that he was ingoring me and that I was talking down to him like a child. On the one hand I was really annoyed that an ignorant bard twink could just reaffirm everyones idea of bards as useless, but on the other hand I really wish I hadnt gotten angry with him in the first place. <BR>The moral of the story?<BR>If you play a twink, learn the class properly.<BR>If you see a twink, give them the benefit of the doubnt and try to educate them politely.<P>Aegyn Eldarian 32 bard of bristlebane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=002064&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=002064&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
