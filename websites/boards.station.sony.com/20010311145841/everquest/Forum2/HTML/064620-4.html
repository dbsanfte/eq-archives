Isn't it funny you don't even list those spell as methods to support melee.<P>That's the heart of the problem. Those spells used to be a very effective means of supporting melee classes, but that was years ago. Since then melee damage has scaled to the point where those spells just don't pack enough punch anymore to make them effecient enough to build a group around.<P>If the solution ignores DD and DoTs this game will never be balanced, because many of the casters were just built around them.<P>&lt;&lt;Take it from me, though, you wont be able to solo much using it. &gt;&gt;<P>So warriors can't solo better with the new Velious/Kunark gear?<P>Rogues can't solo better with ragebringer?<P>Monks can't solo better with the new weapons they have?<P><BR>So what, now we just phase out DD altogether because we're "afraid" of the mighty solo wizard?<P>Or we create new melee only nukes?<P>Do you realize how absurd you're getting because of this paranioa about players soloing?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Isn't it funny that the whole idea of DD and DOT's as support for melee has been totally forgotten by this game.  Since when did this happen?  Kunark.  Since then it has become a myth that caster damage was ever of any real assistance.  Melee just screams "know you role and support me somehow" and "stop soloing.."<P>I find it narrowminded for melee to think that because we can solo some things that hurts their game in some way.  Those same skills that (used to) allow us to solo make our contribution to the group game too.  <P>Anyone else remember before the expansion that there was always the consideration that if our casters kill it now(quick casting damage) it is less damage we have to take.  Casting damage WAS our support role.  Now those spells don't land, or don't matter in the oceans of hps that mobs have these days.  So 3 casting classes almost completly nuerted in the game.  That deserves attention.  Our role never was support, like the healing or enchanter classes, ours is Damage.  But we can't do that anymore.<P>nerma<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sometimes the simple is the most difficult to see <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">The original post has a great point. Increasing a casters mana pool helps a LITTLE since they could cast more spells but not that much. The best caster gear currently in the game has the highest int/wis which helps marginally. A piece of gear that lowered the possibility of a spell getting resisted, or decreasing the casting time, or increasing mana regen, would be more in line with the power of a weapon such as the Wormslayer. When I was playing a cleric and the Kunark weapons were being discovered I used to say "Look at the power of these weapons, how can you say that a manastone in the hands of a cleric is more overpowered than the weapons coming out of Kunark in the hands of a melee class?" </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with a lot of what has been said. I dont think items that lower resistance is the answer. Its the added resistances of MOBs that I see as the problem there. <P>Higher and higher MOB MR makes all casters weaker and weaker. All that is really accomplished here is that old spells become completely obsolete as new spells become the only thing of any use. This just turns each caster into a one dimensional support class. MR must be brought back to earth to make casters versatile again. It is not ok to make a caster weaker than a tank if that caster has no versatility. If MR lowering items are added and high MR is the norm it only adds to the trend of limiting the choices a caster has. <P><BR>On the other subject, here are some ideas I would use for items.<P>1. More caster items with unlimited charges of lower level nukes/heals. So casters dont have to sit so much. The only problem with the cleric breastplates was the level/power of those spells. These spells should be less than half the level of the spellcaster. Who cares if the player can kite or PL other players - they can do that anyways. Some such items already exist and unless you are going to nerf all of them I dont see a problem with making them more common.<P>2. Items that increase mana regeneration while standing. Again so the caster doesnt have to sit down 95 percent of the time. They should still want to sit down periodically but not constantly. They could add less regen than meditation with no regen while sitting. So they only work while standing. <P>3. Health regen items for INT casters. Yes, health regen. Tanks are not the only people who need health. If a breastplate can regen a tank why cant a robe regen a caster?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Interesting thread.  Ok here is my take on this subject.<P>Pre 50 Casters have it way better than melee guys.  I mean Pre 50, my rogue had it way tougher life than my mage.  Both are damage classes.  But my mage could bind where he wanted.  He could solo, basically my mage pre 50 had it way better.  Same if I was a wizard, druid.  Casters had it better pre-50.<P>Ok now post 50 everything reverses itself.  I mean just think about it.  A ROGUE WAY MORE POWERFUL THAN A FREAKEN NECRO.  Pre Kunark, they would of thought you insane, even to think about it.<P>I think melee classes should do better than casters post 50.  That is their time to shine.  But I would help the INT based casters so they don't feel 100% useless, (like my rogue did before Kunark came out). <P>But I'm not sure how you handle the situation of the tuant factor and giving casters huge nukes.  The whole game get's out of whack post 50, and I'm not sure how you fix it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm not just a wizard, I'm not just a mage, I've played every class in this game and judge EQ from the viewpoint of all those classes.<P>And the non-scaling of DD/DoT is EQ's biggest problem right now, because it's forced many classes into narrowly focused roles they were not origionally created for.<P>So you have a large segment of the EQ population now playing classes they didn't sign up for, all because VI was afraid to scale up a cornerstone of EQ(offensive casting) for fear of players soloing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ancient_Cyclops_1<P>You have a fundamental miss understanding about the high end game.  The damage delay ratio is only part of the equation.  At the high end of the game you just want a weapon that has a incredibly low delay an reasonble damage level.<P>A jade mace is 100% better than a 14/28 weapon because there is a flat damage minimum damage add to melee damage directly related to your str and level.  So a lower delay weapon with the same ratio is always better than a higher delay weapon due to this flat add on in damage.<P>So the base adder at 60th is around 15 pts for the average tank.  That is why the 3/10 moss covered twig was the ULTIMATE weapon and ultimately unbalanced.  <P>With a tanks +15 minimum damage adder that humble weapon became a 18/10 monster 1hb weapon.  And with max haste sitting around 70-80% it became the 18/2 weapon. <P>Do you now see why some of the new weapons like dual Lams at 9/18 is 100% better than any anything previous?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I want all you melee characters to think about this.  What if your weapon usage was limited by level?  Let’s say that you get a new weapon and no longer have a use for that Yak.  Right now the Yak can wind up in the hands of a level 5 tank, but if there were a level requirement for usage then perhaps only a melee character of level 25 or higher could wield the weapon.  If you think this is outrageous then pity the casters because we experience this now.  When I got the draught of fire spell I stopped using ice comet.   Now I can go out and make another ice comet scroll and give it to a level 5 wizard, but he will have to wait until level 49 to use that scroll.  My advise for the people saying that we have to compare your weapons to our spells is to speak softly because you guys have it a lot better than we do. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I certainly see these problems.<P>My main character is a level 58 Enchanter. And guess what? I have my epic.<P>This doesn't exactly make me estatic, as you can tell. It reinforces my role. My role is to buff. That's what I do. I don't mez anything. Monsters resist too much, and if I get resisted I'm dead because of the way high-level monsters scale upwards EXPONENTIALLY, whereas my HP scale upward LINEARLY (well, not 100% accurate, but close enough for casters).<P>The problem, simply, is that in order to combat the exponentially increased damage output and HPs of monsters in Velious, your (Verant's) game requires exponentially increased tanks. If you give casters exponential increases they become rather too powerful. So, casters continue on with their linear or sometimes nonexistant increases, whereas melee and mobs increase exponentially.<P>Now, to further prove this example, I provide additional evidence: What caster spells are considered most useful? I would argue that there are 3 basic spells, when you get right down to it.<P>1) Complete Heal - Because tanks increase exponentially, this spell's usefulness also increases exponentially.<P>2) Haste - Again, with tank damage output increasing exponentially, this spell also sees an exponential increase.<P>3) Slow - Once more, a spell that increases exponentially because mobs also increase exponentially.<P>That's it. There are a few other spell lines that increase exponentially but with lesser effect due to the way they're coded (For instance, stat buffs).<P>Solution: Assuming this problem was to be fixed (which it won't be, I can't even begin to contemplate the amount of man-hours they'd have to put in to recode the work they've done - it'd probably be simpler to devote their resources to EQ2), casters would HAVE to get an upgrade. I don't mean 'enchanter buffs now cost less mana, and complete heal has a casting time of 10 seconds instead of 8'. These, while enhancing the caster classes, do NOTHING to relieve the dependency on the melee classes at higher levels, and they do NOTHING to relieve the boredom of playing a support class. What casters need is the ability to use disciplines, or items that provide some kind of percentage increase, or hell, maybe even a self only buff that makes them dish damage/take hits like a melee for a limited duration. However, if you only do this, the power of casters and melees combined will be rediculous. So, yes, I think melees need to be nerfed. I dont' like to say it, because calling on a nerf for another class of players to balance a first class is kind of lame, but in this case I truely believe there is no other option at this point. It shouldn't be something that will, in the end, make casters less effective (IE, as a grossly exaggerated example, increase the delays of all weapons by 50 across the board - which would mainly have the effect of preventing all melees from taunting anything), but something that will simply shift the requirement for melees to be there. I would suggest reducing offensive caps (which would in the long run be compensated for by increased Wiz/Nec/Mag/Dru damage).<P><BR>Anyway, I think, Absor/Abashi/Aradune, that it has become VERY apparent that the high level player base feels something needs to be done.<P>Just please, for the love of God, test whatever you put in adequately. Offer to duplicate some people's characters onto test for them...So they have their chars on their original servers, but can have chars on test to help you out as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Couldn't this be solved by adding right click DD wands and staffs for wizzies and mages so they can keep doing damage when they're oom?<P>Oh, wait... They already have. Yes, these items aren't going to outdamage a rogue hacking away at a mob, but a mage will sure as hell come close with a pet hitting at the same time.<P>Wizards, however, I agree are in major need of improvements in terms of damage ratios. Perhaps include a series of uber-nukes that drain a full bar of mana and have some other negative effects like blindness and injury on the caster but do serious damage (and i'm talking into the 10k plus regions for the level 60 version). This would accentuate the wizard as a one shot serious weapon of destruction, which seems to be what players want their wizards to be.<P>The only issue with this would be in soloing, where a wiz would potentially be able to kill a blue mob with one spell, although add to this a small risk it could be resisted leaving the caster in a potentially very vulnerable situation plus the mana drain and it would be in line with the soloing capabilites of other classes at that level. Even if this line of spells was only resisted one time in 20 it would make it useful for the uber encounters but seldom risked in soloing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, I'm amazed that not once on these boards have I seen the very real correlation between EQ and Diablo/D2.<P>Both are muds, one is 1st person, the other is 3rd. Both were very successful. Both had quite a few of the same elements, and in general, systems. The only main difference in core elements we see is the caster gear. <P>Whereas Blizzard thought it through well enough to realize more mana and slightly higher spells would never be enough, Verant apparently didn't quite catch that concept. D2 introduced more spells, but basically limited them to only a few different types. Good for the type of game it was. Verant introduced many many different types of spells, which is also good for the game they created. D2 allows you to increase the power of whichever spell you want, exponentially increasing it's power. EQ doesn't allow that, instead, you get an entierely new spell.<P>Ok, we're moving along against subtley different routes but we're still fairly equal. Here's where the progression gets screwed up: D2 allows casters the same general type of upgrades as melee, without being overpowering. Examples:<BR>Items that would decrease casting times.<BR>Items that would increase a spells power (focus item)<P>Are the classes in D2 balanced well? The answer is an easily and resounding yes. Are they well balanced in EQ? Well.. even as Absor relayed to us from Verant, "Uh, not really, but we're working on it." <P>Now instead of just ranting, I like to 'try' and introduce (or resubmit) ideas that are helpful. <BR>1) Items that increase the power of a spell or spell line. Cold focus, fire focus, air focus, etc. This would allow mages to become semi-unique if they chose to go down one path. Same goes for Wizards and Necros. <P>2) Focus items for pets. Oh wait, we have them for Mage pets.. what about necros? (Don't give me the crap about the super-rare book drop off a /god/ that's on a week spawn, at the end of a plane (that's about to be upgrade), which increases the power of our (5 times nerfed now) pet by maybe 1-2 pts of damage and no more than 100hp of health.<P>3) Casting time decreases (not really pushing for this one, casting times 'seem' fairly well balanced to me at this time, except for SK-Necro FD, which 'must' be cast fast enough to work..but at this point with Velious, it ain't happening, thus the spells are nearly useless. On a quick tangent, give Necros the upgraded FD.. that's just inane to give it to the hybrid class and not the parent class, Verant.)<P>4) Two words: Mana shield - Even a 1000hp absorption shield doesn't do jack when giants in Kael (we're not talking 'that' high, we're talking Kael here) hit for upwards of 230 a shot. Not to mention you already charge the hell out of us by making us spend money to cast those spells.<P>5) Be creative. Come up with new 'types' of spells to solve problems - it's not like people on these boards don't give you a list of ideas so long it makes the Bible look like a quick read. <BR>The two new spells on Test are examples of this: Thinking just a little out of the box and, even if the spells don't make it off test, at least 'try' it and see if it works. <P>6) Think about how creative to the game you were during beta. We had new stuff pouring into the game that you could just visually see the developers coming up with over cheetos and mountain due while playing Tekken.<P>7) Communication straight from the Dev team. You guys used to talk to us, I mean 'really' talk to us. Hell, in fact I'm gonna include an old patch message I still have just to show you how it once was versus how it is now.<P>-Ashtaroth Solarium<BR>Take twenty seconds and fight the old patch message I'm gonna post, it deserves it's own thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;1) Complete Heal - Because tanks increase exponentially, this spell's usefulness also increases exponentially.&lt;&lt;<P>If a tank's hit points have been increasing exponentially, then the usefulness of hp buffs must be decreasing exponentially.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I think you guys are exagerating the increases to melee. A monk, for instance, gets 24hp per level from 50 to 60 just like pre 50, with 2 or 3 special levels where we get 80hp or so instead of 24hp.<P>You guys make it sound like we're not dependent on casters. <P>&gt;&gt;2) Haste - Again, with tank damage output increasing exponentially, this spell also sees an exponential increase.&lt;&lt;<P>Nah, 40 percent haste is 40 percent more damage now matter how you look at it.<P>&gt;&gt;3) Slow - Once more, a spell that increases exponentially because mobs also increase exponentially.&lt;&lt;<P>See above.<P>You could argue that these spells are more important than ever in a game that is more dependent on melee damage to kill things, but it's casters that have those spells.<P>&gt;&gt;These, while enhancing the caster classes, do NOTHING to relieve the dependency on the melee classes at higher levels&lt;&lt;<P>Hey, you're dependent on us, and we're dependent on you. That's the way it's supposed to be. What you don't like is your job. heh<P>&gt;&gt;and they do NOTHING to relieve the boredom of playing a support class. &lt;&lt;<P>Yeah! The good old days when melees were nothing more than a bunch of rodeo clowns! heh<P>&gt;&gt;What casters need is the ability to use disciplines, or items that provide some kind of percentage increase, or hell, maybe even a self only buff that makes them dish damage/take hits like a melee for a limited duration. &lt;&lt;<P>I don't really have a problem with that, but the reason melee got all this stuff in the expansion was because we used to get nothing! Pre-kunark and pre-51, the last new skill a monk gets is at lvl35! How would you like it if from 35 on you only got more mana and no new spells heh.<P>----<P>From all I've heard, however, it seems clear to me the only real problem is resists. If your spells weren't resisted, you'd be doing what you've always done. And giving you a new high damage nuke, or way to increase damage through items, wont change anything if it still gets resisted. <P>I asked, but nobody answered, how much damage can a lvl 60 wizard do with a full dump of mana. I suspect it comes out similar to what a melee guy contributes in an uber fight, at worst.<P>I think the problem is that verant took some of their old tricks (resists and requiring melee range to cast) for making fights tough, and combined them with huge increases in mob hp, and this is what has screwed the damage caster game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something else just occurred to me. <P>Resists are like chances to hit with a weapon.. but when you get resisted, you still lose the mana correct? That is unlike with weapons. <P>What we need is some chance to this still, but maybe not at the cost of mana. And we need a way for it to improve through items and or skills.<P>Resists are somewhat based on relative level also. So in terms of game mechanics and coding, maybe what you need is an item, or discipline, that in terms of resist calculations, raises your level.<P>Something like the caster equivalent of a melee class's offense/weapon skill combined with str and buffs that raise it directly, to give their attack rating.<P>Like the focuss items suggested, but related to resist levels.<P>Combine that with maybe certain spells that don't lose mana when resisted, or don't lose all mana, or have a chance to not lose mana... <P>Changes along these lines would make spells somewhat like melee. Rogues may get off high damage backstabs that are higher than some wizard nuke, but they don't do it every time! When they miss, however, they also don't lose the ability to try again because they're out of mana. heh<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just as an example from real life play. I am right this moment playing in Hate. I nuke for one encounter then med and read this board for the next 3 encounters. If I am lucky I might influence the one encounter I nuke in but each and every melee class participates and influence each encounter. BTW I am a wizard the most screwed of the caster group but still caster vs melee is skewed towards melees and none of Ancient_Troll_1 won't dissuade me from that notion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a 56 ranger, and let me address a few of the concerns you are presenting about Melees from a rangers perspective.<P>1.  Rangers defense = Druid/Shaman defense over 50.  We recieved no defensive upgrades with Kunark.<P>2.  We do a lot of damage, but just like casters, when we go all out we die.<P>3.  Our HP is barely higher than casters.  Rangers have the lowest HP/AC of all melees.  Our armor has lower ac than all other melees, and Cleric and Shaman have similar AC to us.<P>3.  There are balance issues between melee classes.  Not just between melee and caster.  Rogues and Monks do insane damage and have maxed out defensive skills in all categories.  Higher than warriors even.  They are damage dealers.  Rangers are damage dealers too, but we have caster defense.  The tank classes (warrior, paladin, SK, and to an extent Bards) do not do the damage that the damage dealing classes do, with warriors being the only exception as that is all they do; melee, but they still rank behind the damage dealing classes (Now that verant has moved rangers fully into the damage dealer category) but only barely.  SKs, Pallys, and Bards do very little damage, but have spells to help them tank/taunt.<P>4.  I have my epics, so in raid situations where I am the only one to have epic weapons (Im the only one in my guild to have finished his epic as of now), I usually make my group KS group.  That is until the nuker group decides they want to get the exp, and then there is no way in hell the melee groups will outdamage them.  In god type raids its the nukers that make or break the raid.  Sure you need enough melees to build up hate, but it is the wizzies, mages and droods that do all the damage.  Velious is a different animal and there are serious balance issues for casters there, but not in Kunark or the old world.  Try doing Trak or VS without wizzies.  Try doing Inny or CT without nukers.  Not gonna happen.  You cant do these mobs without the quick damage that you guys do.<P>Now with this said, do I think that casters should have some of the things you ask for in this thread?  Yes I do.  I do think they need to have much less resistable higher damage spells, and a disc of sorts to decrease cast time is a great idea.  I think all casters should have some sort of ability to regen mana at a faster rate that increases as your mana pool does.  <P><BR>So I do support you guys... you guys getting improvements makes us all better.  But remember not all melees have 1100 ac and 4k hp, cause unbuffed I have 853ac and 1851hp at level 56 with full planar and Tolans armor.  Monks and Rogues have similar hp, but have much higher AC.  There is only one class that does a lot of melee damage, and has high HP and AC - Warriors, and they should be the only ones as they are the best all around melee class.<P>Sorry for babbling... This post intrigued me.  Though I saw a lot of closed mindedness on both sides, there are some good ideas being presented here.  Verant should take a look but remember... Improve, dont nerf!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It just makes me sad that casters have such a high downtime post 50 and can't cast many of the Uber 55+ mobs outhere without lures.<P>And yes it does seem that rangers are on the lowest of the melee's yet I've always considered warriors and rogues to have an easy life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm just sticking around till the other games come out and then bid EQ and it's whole time sink gaming style a sionara.
