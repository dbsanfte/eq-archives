</FONT><HR>Well I agree that the Wizard class has been neglected. If VI wants everyone to play druid then so be it. I was playing a Wizard got her to only lvl 40 but after reading all the problems with the class after 50 decided to stop playing her and play my druid a bit more. If that is what VI wanted congrats it worked for me. Until some changes are put into place that make my Wizard more groupable (tired of looking for groups for 1/2 hour) I will continue to work on my other chars. It is a good start with the idea of Dragonbane and Giantbane spells but they are not the only ones that have ungodly HP's are they? I would like to see the restriction taken off those spells and changed to a lvl based spell instead ie 50 lvl MOB does X dam, 51 lvl MOB does X dam etc... And I enjoy playing my druid so much more then my wizard with it capabilites. I liked my wizard so far (nothing like nuking a MOB for 1/4 of its health in one shot) but don't see any reason to advance her until some issues are taken care of. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel I should make a longer post. I for one am not impatient. I could wait until the end of April if it meant half the improvements you talked about on your list. However, if the two new level 60 spells are all your planning to do, then you've pretty much done what wizards were fearing you'd do: throw them a bone and forget about them forever. Up until this point, wizards have been one of the classes complaining the most, and the first time I've seen someone actually address our concerns was about wizard lure bug. Thats after 2-3 years of Everquest.<P>Wizards have been ignored in the past, and we're afraid after these class talks we'll be ignored forever, given our level 60 spells that are good, but still leaving all of the level 1-59 wizards severly lacking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yep what Wizards are best at is traveling. We can travel to almost any zone within minutes and shout for a group we won't get. I am lucky enough to have a group of mid 30 types that I group with regularly, but It's a pain to try to play at the times my group isn't on. It's not that we can't make an impact at least pre-50, it's the fact that people that don't play wizards have that impression.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>the two new spells are a start... i say give feedback to verant about these spells... this is obviously a test to see how ideas work in the game.  hopefully they will start dropping in some 40-50 spells for us too. &lt;prays&gt;  and forget all you newbies who think mages are worse off than wizards and that druids are that tough to play...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why does no one want to solo their wizard .. i sure as hell do, there's no reason not to. When i solo my chanter i can take high blues using about a bub of mana, med up with breeze for 30 seconds and ready to go again. With my wizard it takes all of my mana for a low blue and 5 minutes of medding.<P>In fact i think there should even be wizard only zone.

</FONT><HR>Ok, sure the new nukes on Test are nifty.. but lets check out some spells and their damage to<BR>mana ratios.

Sure, I can deal<BR>a few points of low resist damage, but when a Wiz<BR>is dealing out 30% less damage cuz he's using a<BR>Lure on a zillion HP mob, then why even bother?<BR>You might as well use your regular high damage<BR>low mana nukes and hope you get less than a 30%<BR>resist rate.

</FONT><HR>I hear that Absor has said that he has played on a live server.<BR>My question is this.<BR>Has he or any other members of VI tried to get a group with a wizard?<P>Here goes a challenge, a direct slap in the face if you will take it that way.<BR>Goto KC, Seb, lGuk or SolB with a 49+ with each class and see how long it takes to get a group.<BR>And see if they come up with the same conclusion that I have.<P>Wizards have hands down the toughest time getting a group.<BR>To me it is obvious the reason why wizards kite their way to 60.<P>Have you looked in your EQ dictionary?<BR>In the EQ dictionary a “Grinding Group” means group without a wizard.<P>But, that’s the problem. EQ shouldn’t be a game that you solo your way to 60.<BR>Due to the lack of getting into groups I have soloed from 25% of my level at 29 to 100% of my level at 52.<P>I have leveled much faster than most the people I knew.<BR>But, at the same time, the lack of grouping with people hasn’t gotten me too many items.<BR>Hmmtt. I’m the only wizard walking around with a Oreo Robe Tattooed in the back is the Nabisco Brand name and the Sign that says *Can’t get in a group for the Boncaster’s robe*<BR>/sigh Maybe I’ll get a better robe in Fear one day<P>/* --- Important Point --- */<BR>In terms of class balancing, it should be about what a class can bring to the table to a group.<P>That’s the problem.<BR>Perceptibly the only thing we can bring to a group is Direct Damage and evacks.<BR>First, damage.<BR>Every class in the game can do damage, some can even out damage us.<BR>Second, evacks.<BR>Evacks are useless unless in a raid or fighting in a adjacent zone to a portal<BR>i.e. Paw and NK, MM and GFD<P>Now, on top of damage most classes can either tank (pets included), crowd control, buff, debuff, or heal,<P>Take for example Shamans<BR>They can nuke, heal, buff, debuff, and have pets.<P><BR>Our damage output is inadequate.<P>The only way we could contribute to a that type of a group if your lucky enough to get into one. Can be described in one word.<P>Accentuate<P>What I mean by that is we cannot cast more than one or two spells.<BR>Casting more than that and you are in jeopardy of running OOM and one of two following happen.<P>1 You’ll have to med though fights.<BR>What tank wouldn’t take a pot shot at that?<BR>This makes it look like your either doing nothing useful or, you’re not able to manage your mana.<BR>Not group friendly.<P>2. You will not have enough mana for the multiple pull that might happen.<BR>Which is the only shining point of a wizard.<P>Now with that point stated.<BR>Any wizard that is effectively manages their mana cannot out damage a tank or if he can barley does it.<BR>So, therefore we are a damage dealer that does less than a combatant but cannot provide a tanking/taunting aspect.<P>The only thing I can see to alter this is giving us an increase in  mana regeneration.<BR>*See the nerf section<P>The manaskin is one that I would barley use and is in my opinion a poor spell.<BR>This spell regenerates 1 mana per tick.<BR>That means that it takes 33 minutes to regain the mana it took to cast.<BR>And after you have regained the mana you have lost the effect is so minuscule that you cannot notice the effect.<BR>Now this is assuming that you actually go 33 minutes without loosing the shield.<BR>*Note the section about the lack of procs producing hate.<BR>Because the loss to the shield can’t be healed it makes this a spell that I only use for raids for the 500+ damage absorption.<BR>Even the epic. Since it’s one of the harder epics to get I think that you should get a little better than a level 16 breeze out of it.<P>I personally think that we should get a clarity and C2.<BR>This will make people happier overall, not only the wizards.<BR>How many times have players asked me for clarity.<BR>Increasing the amount of players that can cast mana regeneration would be a good thing for all players in EQ.<BR>(Clarity at 49 and C2 at 57)<P>On the other hand of course I would like to see a stackable wizard only mana regeneration.<P>BUT, NOT ON A DAMAGE ABSORPTION SPELL!!!!<P>I’d rather see it on a shielding or resist spell.<BR>What I don’t understand is why wizards don’t have a MR buff.<BR>We are supposed to be the one who deal deepest into combat magic but we have never had a MR buff except the shielding line.<BR>Maybe that would be a nice spell to stack a mana regeneration effect on.<P>This would bump us up on the damage scale and possibly be able to keep up with fast pace “Grinding groups”<P>All right, now the issue I wanted to though on the table for a while.<BR>Tanks do damage based on their weapons.<BR>They get items that speed them up and do more damage.<BR>Their strength makes them hit for more.<BR>Mages and necros get focus items that make their pets stronger.<BR>Enchanters have better chance to stick charm and mez spells with higher Charisma.<P>I don’t see any such items for a wizard.<P>So, I though down this challenge to VI.<P>Come up with an item or ability that will increase damage, speed of casts, or resistances.<P>I understand that this is a hard problem since that it might have to be a lot of coding.<BR>But, if you could recode the game to DirectX 7.0 I think this is a feasible project.<BR>And it is one that would make many verbose wizards content.<P>On that note I have another suggestion that might be easy, or it might not be.<BR>It’s one that suggests increasing damage on nukes.<BR>The problem with giving wizards Umber nukes is that the can turn around and use them to solo with.<BR>My solution is this.<BR>Give wizards a bonus to damage based on how many people are in the wizards group.<BR>exsample:<BR>2 5%<BR>3 10%<BR>4 15%<BR>5 20%<BR>6 30%<P>That would be sweet.<BR>I’d start grouping again, assuming that I could get a group.<BR>It doesn’t overpower us or give us another soloing ability.<P>Now due to the way that EQ is coded another idea to though out.<BR>Some kind of shock damage.<BR>For example, so and so Ice Comets a greater Kobold for 1120 damage.<BR>Greater Kobold is hit by 200 shock damage.<BR>Sort of like the warrior crits.<BR>And this could be based on how many people are in a group.<P>OK. Now what I have to say next might piss off both wizards and enchanters.<BR>I propose giving wizards a limited form of crowd control.<BR>Let post 50 wizards have a spell similar to enthrall line.<BR>A single target mez like spell would help us get a group in KC and Sebilis.<BR>Of course we couldn’t sit there and fascinate.<BR>Unbathed Gnome wizards have low charisma (My gnomie can testify to that) <BR>So those spells wouldn’t be as good.<BR>But, an alteration based spell that is similar to what wizards in movies and TV do to their opponents.<BR>Kind of like the wizard is using his force of will to keep the person out of combat.<BR>No. I am not asking it to be as good as the enchanters.<P>I am asking this because enchanter or no enchanter. I still plant stuff.<BR>I do this more so without an enchanter in the group.<P>As it stands now (for mobs that don’t summon)<BR>On botched pulls.<BR>I nuke the creature run so it’s out of attack range of the tanks.<BR>And I root it there.<BR>Crowd control. In a very crude form.<BR>This technique is dangerous.<BR>So much so, that I get killed much faster than an enchanter doing this process.<BR>The moral of the story is for those that weren’t paying attention is save a gnome.<BR>Give us a force of will spell we’re doing it anyways.<P>Now the problem with procs taunt.<BR>I guess that this is a ranger vs wizard dilemma.<BR>On one hand, if you have procs taunt the rangers die.<BR>On the other, you don’t nukers agro the mob.<BR>I don’t understand the logic behind the hate being removed from the procs.<BR>But, I do say that tanks are there to taunt.<BR>Any addition that would help them taunt should be there.<BR>The way I see it is that a tank that is beating on me with a sword that procs and a caster is nuking me in the background.<BR>I would very much take in consideration the effect of his weapon before making a desion about who to go after.<P>Also, I add this in.

You might think of increasing the draught line of spells.<BR>Have spells that can only be cast in Velious.<BR>Or, have a level 52 spell that does unresistible 1000 damage.<BR>So that the normal raid level wizards 52-60 can participate in these raids. Not just the few 60 wizards.<P>Also, those spells bring up another point.<BR>Wizards shouldn’t be only for raids.<BR>Nuf said.<P>All in all, I would like to not put my wizard into retirement.<BR>I like playing him in groups when I get the chance.<BR>Yes, the exp sucks in groups, but how am I to get a boncesters robe or some GEBs.<BR>Those groups you’d have to be a tank, healer, or crowd control to get into those groups.<BR>And those are 2 items that I would like to have BUT WILL NEVER GET because soling isn’t too for the wallet.<P>And that is a fact more than anything else has erked me beyond compare.<P>Do me a favor, there is a lot in here if you do respond I would ask that you don’t give me a one-line response and pat yourself on the back for that.<P>Don’t mean to be rude, but in my eyes you have given wizards the least response.<BR>And by the HEATED post on the discussion boards it seems that we should of gotten a little more attention than we have.<P>Actions speak louder than words.<BR>Start doing stuff and moving it to the test server.<BR>Maybe then myself and other wizards will be able to see that you are trying to address our concerns.<P>Until such time, you have not proved that you’re not being flippant.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There have been some great notes written on Wizards and their problems, but some very ignorant posts take away from them. Posts like "I'm level 30 and no one wants to level with me". If that statement is true, it's because you don't know how to play your Wizard and you don't know where to hunt. End of story. I'm lev 35 and I have NEVER had a problem finding a group. No, I'm not a twink. No, I haven't grouped with Guildmates all the time (wasn't even in a Guild until late 20s). Now I can't speak for levels above 35, but I don't see much of a problem. We have a good class that just requires a little intellect to play it. Yes, we have some problems. But we need to keep perspective if we're to earn credibility with the dev team.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Clear and simple fix for wizards:<P>1) Familiar that acts like a mini-bard with 4 types of effects (mana/regen/haste/resists) selected at summoning time.  Familiar has no attack abilities.<P>2) All damage spells sliding gradually upward in efficiency to 6/1 ratio from 1-60th level.  Casting times should increase smoothly from 1 to 6 secs for newly acquired spells, but drop to 50% of original cast time as you level past the spell ring.  Example, a spell takes 4 sec to cast at 29th, but takes 2 sec to cast at 44th.<P>3) Add 2 intermediate mana-free right-click wands between Solists Icy Wand and VP-level drops.  Suggest simply making Wand of Ice (KK drop) right-click 6 sec cast.  Add Wand of Fire/Shock/Lightning as quests and/or drops.  Note, charged wands are useless without recharge point.  Possible compromise is to require a reagent for wand cast.<P>4) Increase skill caps on Offense/Defense and weapons usage to something higher than current, but below hybrids.<P>5) Significantly reduce casting time on Okiels Flickering Flame or increase its duration.<P>6) Add a spell that allows a single melee attack from the wizard to do backstab like damage.  Damage and hit-avoidance similar to equal level rogue, as opposed to a magic-type resistance check.  Rogue can do it frequently, while a wizard uses mana and has a longer recast time.<P>7) Snares and Roots should have both single and AE forms.<P>Just my opinion, but a good start.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>If Verant wants wizards to truely be masters of magical damage, then we need a percentage based DD spell.  I think they have it right with the "mob"/bane spells, but, instead of X damage that is set, it should be x% that is set.  For example:<P>Dragonsbane<BR>1% of dragons existing hps<BR>Casting time: 5 seconds<BR>Recast time: 5 seconds<BR>Mana: 400 <BR>Level 53<BR>Vendor or quest or drop<BR>90% unresistable<BR>Velious use only<P>Giantsbane (See above)<P>And the % would actually increase the LOWER the spell level.  Further example:<P>(whatever name)<BR>Indoor use only<BR>2% to 3% of mobs health<BR>casting time : 5 seconds<BR>recast: instant<BR>mana: 500<P><BR>As you can see, the less hps the mob has, the less effective this spell is.  By making them indoor or velious only, you limit their usefullness in solo'ing.  In addition, you make them mobs only! No use on PVP.  By making it a %, you make the wizard decide between almost immediate aggro and must effective use.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well friends we are here again:<P>Be patient i can do, have been as friends hve passed me by, so i guess we wait longer, but not wasting anymore time on my wizzy till some changes occur.<BR>1. I like that familiar idea that could give mana regenration, good roleplaying and one thing we definitely need to be somewhat group friendly/efficient.<BR>2. My opinion on soloing, is: A. its not fun for long and i play for a social aspect.  Also can't solo inside dungeons and get stuff sucha s new robes etc. So whats the point. B. Soloing is very dnagerous in my opinoin one good lag spike orLd and you spend your time doing a fun Corpse retrieval.<BR>3. New bind sites for melee's, good for them , bad for us one less need for a wizards teleports<BR>4.  Fix our DD please we should be at least twice as powerful damage wise or at least twice as mana efficient than every other class at every level. PERIOD.  No waffling here<BR>5.  60th level fixes, great  i don't see my self even getting to level 50 these days and now they are giving 60th level spells for fixes.<BR>  /em pokes verant and say " what about levels 1- 59 ?"<BR>6. Wizard parked at 46th level till changes are made, hes just not fun to play.  Made a shaman hes 43rd now still fun and don't see that changing, BTW he can out solo my wizard any day.<P>Draku of prexus, Wizard 46th (retired)<P>ps GO grimsatff want to say your have an iron will, i get mad andfustrated everytime i think of my wasted time with my wiz, but you still keep plugging<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello All:<P>Last night, for the first time, I ran into many of the limitations that have been discussed here for some time.<P>I got into a Paw group in SK with 5 others.  Lvl range was one belor to two above my lvl. (I'm a 26 Wiz by the way).<P>While fighting the Gnolls i realised again several things:<P>1:  Mobs conning Red to me almost ALWAYS resist my DD spells......if not wholly then to the point that it wasn't worth casting on the mob....5 pts dam for 110 mana...not real good.......<P>2:  Root if not resisted...and if it lasts long enough to cast one spell......NEVER lasts long enough to get off two spells.<P>3:  Dispell Magic.....DOES NOT!  After cating this spell on a blue mob six times.......the mob still had up a damage shield (recast maybe) and still had time while casting to pound the tanks.<BR>(and Yes i got the message "target feels a little dispelled" when i cast it.)<P>4:  SOLO?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?<BR>    After the diappointing personal showing in Paw, I then traveled to BB for what I thought would be some safe testing (I thought I might be missing something about how to play a Wiz.).<BR> Seeing a Green Orc Lego (they've been green for several lvls now) I decided to Practise a little Root'n'nuke.  Starting from maximum distance that root would work, i rooted and nuked....once..root broke and i had not time to root again befor the Lego was on me.  Root again   run back a little...and the root weears off before i can nuke......Root again....run...Root....run...Root.....run.....I think you can see the problem here.<BR>To make the above a little more concise...ROOT DOES NOT STICK!<P><BR>As for the VI claim that Wizard are the "Masters of Direct Damage"?  HAH!  I am constantly outclassed by any number of classes in amount of damage dolled out.....<P>Enough of my ranting....<P>Carnal Per`Venificus<BR>26 Wiz<BR>Lanys<P><BR> <BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im pissed about the wizard class in general.When i made my wizard, i made him for several reasons 1) I didnt know that every other class was better for groups, and i dont play this game to solo. 2) I had heard that wizards were the undisputed damage dealers hands down. Later, I found out that instead of being undisputed, at higher lvls almost every single class could outdamage us or at least contribute something worthwhile to the group. I spend up to 5 hours before i find a group at all, because we simply arent in demand. 3) I like wizards, always have, until i played this game. Every class has many redeeming values, you never see "KC Captain group looking for wizard" since they never need a nuker cuz chances are there are already 10 wizards already on the list because of our ubiquitous ability to get on the list for 1000000 groups before we actually get called into one. And if they didnt have any wizards on the list, no worries. They can always get any other caster class and there is practically no difference. As a bonus, if they get any other class, they get whatever else that class has to contribute. And finally, every other class has gotten something good, if they had problems. Now at least we are the only class that really needs fixing, so maybe theres a chance VI will actually help. But im hoping these changes are actually going to be something useful, rather then just something pointless that verant throws at our class so if we say class needs fixing they wont have to listen.<P>Viktheren Silvermaul<BR>48 wizard of luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's amusing to hear/read Wizards telling everyone how great it is to play a Mage (oh, we have it so easy! we're so wanted in groups and Wizzies never are!) I know Grimstaff doesn't subscribe to this nonsense.<P>Guys, I play a Mage. It's obvious that most of you do not. If you had, then you'd know how silly some of your accusations are. Mages have DDs almost as good as Wizards, eh? Bah. It is to laugh!<P>Picture this: the other night, I left my pet to guard a spot and went wandering halls in Skyshrine to hunt down a stinking, greenie crystal spider. At level 46, I couldn't get a single of my 'oh so awesome, nearly as powerful DD as Wizard' spells to cast. I got my butt handed to me in a basket by a greenie spider. Note that I had JUST witnessed a Druid casually destroy the very same spider only minutes before because it had 'aggroed on him'. A single hit, and it was dead. Yes, we were similar levels.<P>The casting time on our DDs (any spell for that matter) makes us completely and utterly useless without a pet. Can you grasp this? I don't think you can. I wish I could allow you to play my lvl 47 Mage RIGHT now so you can see what I mean. Yes, it LOOKS like we have it sooooo easy. But we don't. Trust me on this. Mages also have many, many design flaws AND our magick is being doled out here and there as  well. There are items in the game that cast our 50+ spells useable by melee classes WHEN MAGES, themselves, HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM or have to pay thousands of plat for them. I hate the phrase: slap in the face, so I'll use another, equally as powerful:<P>A punch in the mouth. That's what Verant has done and continues to do to BOTH of our Classes.<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>a few suggestions~~Harvest(make it an abilities Hot Key) ie. LoH.HT,track etc...SIS 300mana/1200 dmg..lvl 55 maybe instead of the uselessness of lvl 60..when most people are ready to retire their characters and make a twink..its not that big of a difference than comet save the 100 mana and I would think by now at post 50 a master of the arcane sciences would have figured out a way to better his cast times/resists/mana/dmg ratio..but alas we with all of our INT keep making spells with longer cast times ie.6.3secs.. and poor mana/dmg ratio..maybe I need more int ;{..ok that was a brief tantrum ..seems it is contagious of late among my arcane brethren,maybe because we are all sitting at the same zone lines looking for groups ;{..yes I know I can go solo while I wait..what if i want more out of the game than xp..perhaps to see a new dungeon?explore meet new people..ok enough babble...IMO  less resists..faster cast times...lower mana costs..and Brain bite at a vendor..would ease all of our woes..well in some cases not all..lure line mana/dmg ratio is pathetic and still gets resisted on the mobs that count 50% of the time..ie spite golems etc,god mobs etc,we get into god raids because of lure and it doesnt even hit but 3/6 ;{...hmmm Maybe wiZards should get a spell that enables all tanks in group to proc a DD (amount of times based on dex of course)..that might get us into a few groups..(think boon of the garou)..tanks are addicted to this spell. it seems wiZards were made to be soloers..I had a tank tell me in Seb that I wasnt casting enough..huh?..do I dump  all my mana or stay in time with tanks dmg as not to have the cleric healing me instead of them ..***..and if i do dump it on these mobs with a zillion hp..im only good for one mob then im LoM...somethings wrong here ..im only wanted in high lvl groups for evac purposes..heh they form groups then say we need an evacer..;{..yay me..the power master of dmg is actually the power master of travel..my guild master will be proud.;{...ps give us group spells  i want to see places and be a a part of EQ not solo in skyfire and have 15-20 min down times. ..lower mana costs/faster cast times/less resists..<P>            Maxxim Strike (shouldve been a rogue)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Thank god I have a pet and am not a wizard.<P>As for the other poster saying we do not want better melee skills...please speak for yourself and don't speak for me.  I do not want to be some hybrid, but the current cap on skills is too low.  AND, our class needs access to more procing weapons like the now nerfed Dagger of Frost.<P>It would be most cool to have a (speculative) Solist's Fiery Wand (flame shock 6sec cast 110DD) in the offhand and a Dagger of Lightning (shock of lightning 83DD) now at 45th as an upgrade to the earlier DoF/SIW combo.  Add just a few more points of skill and that would rock when I am trying to conserve mana for the BIG needs.<P>It is irritating as all get out that rangers get conflagration as a proc on a non-god/plane weapon, and we can't USE that dagger.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to say that I think wizards are still useful.  Yea I felt the same as the rest of you about nuking.  You think it is bad at low levels?  It is a lot worse at the higher ones.<P>Enjoy level 30 because at that level wizards are one of the best classes in the game.  At level 30 you have enough mana to kill 3 blue mobs by yourself before running out of mana.  From there nukes just go down hill until at level 58 you don't have enough mana to kill most high greens in Velious.  If you are lucky you can find a few mobs that are green ep givers or very low blues that you can kill with all your mana and harvest.  But the reality of the situation is that at high levels what you bring to a group is not nukes.  Tanks with good weapons way out damage wizards over the corse of the battle and some even out damage them during the time wizards are nukeing..<P>What can I say,<P>NUKING IS NOT THAT USEFUL AT HIGH LEVELS.<P>This affects all classes not just wizards.  But since wizard main talent is nuking it affects them the most.  With the inclusion of Velious the mob their have 2-4 times as many HP of mobs at the same level in the other relms.  What does this mean for wizards?  Don't go to Velious.<P>So what can you do about this?  You can do two things.<P>1. Quit playing your wizard.<P>2. Find other ways to be useful.<P>At high levels what a wizard gives a group is:<P>1. Snare<BR>2. Evac<BR>3. Teleport<BR>4. Root - It can be used to save the life of the enchanter or cleric.<P>And yes when you have extra mana you can throw in a few nukes.<P>The main problem is that since all the mobs have had their HP incresed and all the tanks have better weapons with the release of the new realms wizards are not longer that useful for doing damage.<P>Sorry, but that is the way it is.<P>Myst<BR>Level 58 wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not speculating.  Go look at the numbers and don't hand me anything about chanelling, it does nothing for casting time.  I said BELOW LEVEL FIFTY (although Scars of Sigil casts faster than any spell we have past level 4).<P>Something Magicians often screw up with casting times is that they assume that Wizards will always memorize their best blasts only like they do.  I have a blast I got at level 20 Memorized sometimes, and regularly one at level 29.  I'm level 47.  Sometimes I need a quick small blast, and I always want a stun up.<P>Don't confuse old, quick casting little blasts with the blasts you got last spell circle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However your comparing prekunark mage spells with post kunark wiz spells.<P>Mage Spells Post Kunark:<BR>  Char - Lvl52 - 4.5sec - 260mana - 660dmg<BR>  Sigil - Lvl54 - 2sec - 175mana - 450dmg<P>Wiz Spells Post Kunark:<BR>  Draught - Lvl51 - 3sec - 215mana - 643dmg<P>Althought the wiz DD is better, the difference is small.  I'm not saying to nerf mages.  Far from it.  I want more bang for my buck is all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062802-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062802&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062802&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
