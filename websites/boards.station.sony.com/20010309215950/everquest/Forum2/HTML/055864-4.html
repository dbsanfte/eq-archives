</FONT><HR>Firstly thanks for even having this discussion.<P>Here are the issues I have with my 52 necromancer and the necromancer class in general.<P>1) The necromancer pet from 1 to 16 is overpowered in my opinion. By giving the pet a two handed weapon he can do a great deal of damage and his weapon delay doesn't change.<P>2) The scent line is almost useless. For a debuff it gets resisted an awful lot.<P>3) Screaming terror should be overwritten by enchanter mezs. I don't understand why it is this way, there spell is much better. I am afraid to use ST alot of the time because of this. (An upgrade to ST would go a long way to making us group friendly)<P>4) To deal damage in a group I use Venom of the Snake or E-Bolt both are castable by shamans. This means with a shaman or another necro in the group I have to resort to DD. Problem is Ignite Bones is frowned upon in most of my groups due to the skel illusion. So I am killing a level 50+ mob with a level 34 spell, Acid Blast.<P>5) Mana transfer is all I have at raids and I am useless at it. 1/3 of my mana gives a cleric one complete heal. If mana transfer is too be my forte (plz no) make me better at.<P>6) Corpse poofing. This happens to me at least once a week. Happened to me twice last night in the Hole. It is not fixed. This problem means I can't cast at least half of my spells if there is even a small chance at a good item.<P>8) My pet is a nancy and runs every time fear is cast. My pet is level 40 or so and yet a mid teens level NPC can fear him every go.<P>8) The epic.<P>9) Getting the epic.<P>In conclusion, I love my class I have tried most of the others but being a necro suits my character. Recently (post 50) I have found myself playing a rogue more and more. The 51+ necro is not the same character I started over a year ago in the dimly lit forest of tox. I miss him.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the level 29 spell Defoliate.  At that level it would be really usefull since there would still be mobs that we could cast this on and get xp.  I don't know of any necro who has seen this spell.  Is it in the game? Other than this I think most of the important issues have already been posted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something else i almost forgot. The scent spells are good, most peeps just never get into using them. Works well with shammies. But the scent spells are very easily resisted and difficult to stick. Should a debuff be so hard to stick?<P>Also a little off the beaten path... how about some transparent robes? I would take a neg 20 to all stats to have a robe like that. 8)<P>Also, keep inmnd, if the lich line is fixed, we lose some of our ability to mana share, and shammies will be effected too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its low damage, 200 mana, and allows us to tap to regain our hp, so we can perform other abilities.<P>Trucidation is a worthless spell, and with a 15 minute recast time or whatever (shows how much I mem'd it) it is and always will be on page 50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>answer this please.  these are quotes from the Necro raid thread<P>"Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines."<P>We ask for this and then you give it to magicians?<P>My question is "what kind of class are necromancers?"<P>are we offense, defense or support?<P>every class has a role, but as far as i know, necros are the only class whos role changes at the higher levels.  If we are an offensive class, fine.  we should be offensive all the way to 60.  <BR>If we are defensive, show me our defensive spells, if we are support show me these too.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Even though the Lich line was not as originally intended, I think it is fine.  The original damage from it is WAY too high and was a bad original design.  This is a great spell as is and is defining in the class like the cleric 49 res. spell.<P>Necros are a strong balanced class.  Our only problems are on UBER raids of dragons/gods.  We just can't do any damage without either upsetting the groups with us or risking corpse poofing. Our pets get feared off or die REAL fast.  Seems like they take full spell damage from ANY mob regardless of level or spell.  Can't our pets at least have bad resists instead of horrible?<P> We can't even feed mana that well on these raids cause we can't lifetap our health back.  One hit or aoe and we have to take lich off or die.  Raids are only a problem at 57+ if you ask me.  I can't see where having lifetaps stick is a big deal.  I do 330 damage with my 54 lifetap.  I this too much damage?  Thats not even one backstab from a rogue. <BR> Whats the big problem with letting lifetaps have a shot at landing on uber mobs? <P>Necros don't need that much changed.  Ignite seris needs to lose the skele form.  Lifetaps 54+ need to be able to have a chance of landing.  Pets need  decent resists at least the 53 or 56+ ones.  A pet sow and/or pet summon would be real nice and a fun change.  <P>WE all know you guys don't want to make necros any more powerful. Thats fine, but don't make them MUCH less powerful at 55+ after all the time they invested.  Leave the class and spells about the same, just add a few resist/spell adjustments and we will be happy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor & Verant,<P>The Lich series is self only, so calling the damage adjustment a "bug" seems unfair and irrelevant. Isnt it possible that the original coders knew that it would fall under pvp code? Perhaps they knew this, but to keep the code simple, they *already* increased the damage so that the post damage was reasonable? Why isnt this possible?<P>Or perhaps they didnt, and yet perhaps Lich is still appropriately balanced? Isnt this possible?<P>It seems odd to be willing to increase the effectiveness of necromancers in uber raids at the highest level (which basically all necromancers feel is a need), and yet you are only willing to do it at a price that affects necromancers at ALL levels. What is it about balancing the necromancer that will only allow for fixing the weak points (raids) to come at great cost at all levels? The necromancer has already been nerfed and adjusted throughout his career. Many of the changes were called for, and they seem to be balanced now, as is, except for mega raid encounters.<P>Everyone seems to agree the raid portion needs help. Why weaken the rest?<P>This makes me fear for all of Everquest. Is every other "bug" only going to be addresses in the context that an increase in one place requires a decrease in another?<P>If so, I pity the classes that use rain spells, for starters. The issue with it interacting with pets is being fixed, but the biggest bug remains. It is supposed to be 3 waves each for up to 4 creatures, a total of 12 waves. But the code limits the max waves based on the number of creatures, not num_creatures * 3. So you never get more than 4 waves. If they fix this, will they nerf the magician pets or halve the wizard DD?<P>And there are many other examples out there of bugs that need to be fixed ... but at what price?<P>Well, I just wanted to put this out there for people to think about. Please do not nerf the casual gamer (who often choses the necromancer for time constraints) to support the dedicated gamer. Also, please do not avoid helping the dedicated player when their needs are justified.<P>Why not allow both to prosper?<P>AnimatedU</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the revisit Absor. Here is what I think that needs to be done for the 50+ Necromancer since we are fine 1 to 50.<P>1) Ignite/Chill Bones: The skeleton effect needs to go. All it’s good for is to wow the newbies. Also move Chill Bones to level 51 instead of 55 because it doesn’t make much sense to have to accumulate so many levels just to get a spell that’s the same as the level 49 spell.  Bump up the drop rate on the spell too or let us buy it from vendors.<P>2) Essence Emeralds are excellent for Convergence but not for the other spells. So please change the components for Trucidtion and Levant. Star Rubies would be nice instead of the Essence Emeralds.<P>3) Nighttime spells make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I don’t think that we should still be using Harmshield rather than Quivering Veil of Xarn. I believe that Skin of Shadow should be changed only for Dark Elf Necromancers because we don’t need Ultravision. On PvP servers, it’s kind of one-sided that Light races can Track while the Dark races cannot. I believe that Necromancers and Shamans (dark races only) should be Track too. Change Skin of Shadow from the Invisible/Zoom/Ultravision to Track/Zoom and for Shamans to get it in their 20’s.<P>4) Lifetaps should be able to hit ubermobs and the not so uber like Tserinna in the Tower of Shadows. We have to be able to tap if we are liching. To ask a cleric to heal you after you just feed him mana is pointless.<P>5) Pets should not be feared by the ubermobs because they spend most their time running than fighting. Please up the health points on the 53 and 56 pets because they are useless unless we are soloing. The 59 pet should be a mean as he looks so please look into upping its damage. Please do not nerf the 49 pet just to make the other ones look better. It’s been nerfed several times already. Also change it back to where we can use the Worker Sledgemallet on our pets because people get very annoyed when you use it on them.<P>6) Feign Death is getting a little long in the tooth. It gets pointless to cast in places like the planes because once everybody has died, guess who is last to die even though they are feigned. We should get the Feign Death upgrade as well.<P>7) Screaming Terror should have an upgrade because everybody shouldn’t have to die just because the Enchanter died. Group DMF would be great too because I hate seeing people constantly saying in shout I NEED DMF over and over. <P>8) Once again here is my suggestion for Defoliation, on PvP servers make it castable on Druids. :P <P>9) The Duckstaff needs some work. First off it’s very hideous. Secondly, the stats are good but why are the Cold/Fire resist so low? Necromancers do not have a Fire resist buff so I think the Fire should be at least +15.  I’ve heard that there is just one Duckstaff on my server and that’s because everyone quit doing the quest. Upping the Fire resist and look would surely change that. Is Chris Elliot the designer of the staff?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since my necro is only into the 20's, I can't comment on any of the high level aspects of gameplay. However, I would like to say that even though the Lich series may not be working "as intended," I believe you should look closely before changing it. When I first used the "Allure of Death" I thought it was very aptly named since I can easily kill myself if I don't pay attention. I have far, far more mana points than hit points. This, in itself, is a form of regulation. Yes, I can regain some of those HP through Life Tap and<BR>Leech type spells, but - unless I'm just not doing it right - there is no way these compensate for the hp/mana use. And remember, there is no comparable limit at all on the other forms of mana regen - clarity, Bard song.  While reviewing this, please be sure to consider that the difference between our hit points and mana points is already a regulating factor. In other words, please review the validity of your original "intent" for balance and not just assume it was correct at the time.  Maybe it isn't as unbalancing as it seems at first glance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I look now for this spell since nmore then 3 month.. but no chance to get one (<BR>The drop rates of the Level 55+ Spells are way too low but the drop rate of the level 50-55 are way too high.<BR>This does really hurt a necro (. I am not able to get my Pet. So with Level 57 i still fight with my level 49 Pet!<P>In the beginning of Kunark it was sayed that the basic spells of each calls will be purchasable.. so the Pet doesnt count to the Necros Basic Spells.<P><BR>Are we still a Pet class then?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems the post 50 game is being addressed well by my higher lvl brothers. I would like to see Breath of the Dead and Gather Shadows castable on others. Also, even tho I'm only level 40 I see a lot of people talking about how some of our upgrades to the Darkness line and Tap are almost never used in favor of the lower level spells due to resist rate and casting time. One of the best upgrades I like was the faster cast time of Invoke Fear. It would be nice if this principle was applied to some of these upgrades to make the higher level versions more appealing. Add into that the fact that the length of a fight also makes a lot of upgrades not as useful as the lower versions which just doesn't seem to make sense. I would like to see an upgrade to the Siphon Strength spell and a group version of this spell. Also Shadow Vortex could be made group friendly. With a few more group spells that people would benefit from might encourage more Necros to group earlier and learn the skills that many players say we don't possess later in the game and won't take us into groups. If the vision is grouping, make us more useful to a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sigh.  First off, this is Necro talk.  I.E.  <P>Talking about necros and balancing what are perceived unbalances.  It's very sad to see that there are already 40 more posts here than the Magician talk, but those 40 are only about Necro haters.<P>Anyway, thank you for creating this oppurtunity to discuss the issues.  <P>I would like to put forward my support for Zrazzt as he does a great job of describing our problems.<P>One of our problems is that post 50 we lose focus of the definition of our class.  Perhaps VI could enlighten this?<P>We have been told that the Magician is THE pet class and has a few things which make them greater.  <P>For example, quest focus items.  Necros have none.<BR>Magician have damage shields to put on pets.  Necros have none.<BR>Also, a haste item to give to pet.  Necros can use, just need a 55+ magician to summon them one<P>Combined, all these make the Magician far superior to the Necro as a pet class.<P>With Kunark, we were given 3 new kinds of pets.  Magicians just received higher of the same.  However, one major problem exists.  The level range of these summons. <P>For example 53 - Rogue pet.  I have summoned a pet that was blue to a lvl 40.<P>These 3 pet spells should not have a very wide range of summons.  They are situational, we are fighting mobs 50+ and a lvl 39 pet is useless against these.  I have no issue with any of the other pet spells due the fact of how often we get upgrades.  However, the 50+ is completely different.<P>Upgrade possibilities:<BR>Damage shield to give to pet?<BR>Upgrade to Spirit Armor for pet?<BR>Grim Aura to give to pet?<BR>Vampirice Embrace to give to pet? (yes I know 44+ has this)<P>Next topic:  DOTS<BR>Prior to 50+, Necros are wonderfully powerful due to the wide array of DOTS.  However, post 50, mobs don't live long enough and DOTS cost a lot of mana.  Also, many 50+ mobs summon and therefore limit the number of DOTS per necro to a max of 2.  Many of the poison/disease dots have such a high taunt value they are useless as they guarantee death.<P>While I am all for improving other classes, Wrath of the Elements was a slap in the face to necros.  Here is a QUICK DOT, low mana, quick cast, low taunt, Good Damage and given to... the Dot Master?  Nope.  Magician.<P>Perhaps something similar can be given to necros?<BR>Perhaps the ungodly cost of our dots could be looked at considering how long they take to work?<P>Next topic:  Lifetap<P>This is our main way of healing.  Yes, our heal dot is nice, but takes near a bubble of mana.  Having been on raids where no matter how debuffed a mob is, Lifetap cannot stick while all other casters are casting is pathetic.  If the mob is immune to all forms of magic.  Fine.  Immune to all but lifetap, unacceptable.<P>Next topic: Debuffs<P>We were given a scent series of debuff to assist ourselves.  Just for grins and giggles give em a try.  You'll understand why we don't bother.<P>We LOVE the last DOT Cessation of Cor, and asystole is nice if it sticks.  But these are such uber taunt and high resists, unmem.<P>Next Topic:  Undead<P>We were told we are the masters of the undead.  This isn't true totally.  <BR>Clerics are the masters of killing undead.<BR>Why is it that we have a Fear Undead line, and yet normal fear works also? The point of Fear undead is....?<BR>Were our pets, undead, unfearable to fear but fearable to Fear undead would make them better.<P>Next topic:  Ignite/Chill Bones<P>No other OFFENSIVE caster class is so limited in DD as the necro.  Which is fine.<BR>But why is it our DD isn't chain castable?  What is the sin here?<BR>Were it to actually change the mob to undead, rendering it Nukable to undead spells - why there's a new tactic.<BR>Or perhaps Ignite changes to undead and Chill changes to Summoned?<P>Next topic:  Defoiliaton<BR>Every caster class either has a specialty nuke:<BR>Undead, Plant, or Summoned<BR>They do more damage for less mana to specific kinds of mobs.<BR>If it looks undead, it should be undead nukable<BR>If it looks like a plant, it should be plant nukable<BR>If it looks summoned, it should be summoned nukable<BR>Period.<P>Next topic:  Upgraded Spells<BR>Feign Death - fabulous, but way too slow 50+<BR>Screaming Terror - fabulous, but way too short 50+<P>Next topic: Helpful changes<BR>Summon Coldlight - it's no drop.  Why can't we give this?<BR>Group DMF - enough said<BR>Group/Target Feign Death - could be helpful<BR>Self only Teleports - we are the kings of selfish spells, hard to believe being so hated we wouldn't have devised some means of travel<P>Next Topic - 50+ spells<BR>I think this has been covered in enough detail.<P>Next topic - Lich<BR>Please do not fix this.  A Necro 50+ cannot go below 1/2 health as he runs extreme risk of death. We do not have 2500 hps so it's not like we can lose all our health to get back all our mana. With only my buffs I barely have 1400.<P>Next topic: AOE<BR>LOL.  Sheesh.  It was nice Way back when at 49 AOE lifetap was a spell.  But removed.  Noticed a few Boss mobs have it.  Makes them really tough.<BR>Otherwise, Bleh on every single AOE we have<P>Next topic:  Charisma<BR>Could we please have an answer as to WHAT effect charisma has on Fear and Charm?  We have fought over this for ages and can't get concrete proof.  We get lots of Neg Cha items so it makes us wonder.<P>Next topic:  Coffins<BR>Sure they weigh 10. But 2 slots?  Sheesh.  It weight 10!!! and is a Coffin.  Perhaps a 10 slot?<P>Next topic: Trucidation and Infusion<BR>Trucidation should be irresistable and chain castable.  Period.<BR>Infusion should be a CH mana and chain castable.  Period.<BR>Only due to what they currently cost.<BR>Otherwise, change reagent and leave as is.<P>Next topic: everything else.<BR>Lack of quests for human, Dark Elf and gnome necros.<BR>Epic quest - drops waaay to rare in sky for cloak and by no means is reward EPIC<BR>Would it kill to give us a focus quest at 30?  Would really help the 50+ pet situation.<P>Well, that's all I can think of now.

</FONT><HR>I actually did have one thought for post 50 necros.  Maybe change one of the pets so the it take damage when it hits, and does damage when it is hit.  Make it have a long recast time, and make the pet either immobile or immune to fear.  It would sort of be an irresistable variable length dot.  We wouldn't use it in day to day fights because when our spells land a normal pet would be more effective.  You wouldn't have to worry about a bunch of necros getting together and killing all the ubers on their own because the necros would die from the mobs way before the pets did enough damage.  Anyway, that's my thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fix the graphic on the epic.  Seriously.  If you can add in an data to display the Sword of Gathering, you can fix this.  It looks STUPID.  It doesnt look like a scythe, go look up what a scythe is, and make it look like that, with little fear skulls as the particle effect.  That is an epic weapon graphic.<P>Change the effect of the epic.  For the difficulty of the quest (not the most difficult, but ONE of the most difficult as evidenced by the number of epics per server), the effect and stats are very lame.  <P>Address spell rarity.  Certain spells in the necromancer Kunark lineup are too rare.  Chill Bones.  Servant of Bones.  Emissary of Thule.  Perhaps Demi-Lich.  Adjust these drop rates.<P>Buff the 59 pet and take away the peridot casting cost.  Why does it cost a peridot AND 2 bone chips?  That makes no sense.  Additionally, this pet needs to have a better stun spell, or do more damage.<P>Add in a tap spell at 60 that works on Uber mobs, doesnt have to be as good a ratio as Touch of Night, we just need something that will allow us to gain health while doing damage, the core ability of our class.<P>Boost the mana transfer efficiency of the subversion spells.  Mod rods are better than Sedulous Subversion.<P>Give us the (proposed?) Mage spell that makes a pet immune to fear.<P>Get rid of Infusion and Trucidation.  These spells are insulting poor.<P>Take away the night time only component of Levant, Skin of Shadow and Veil of Xarn.<P>Thanks<P>Sayleth<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forgive me if this has already been brought up, but I admittedly have not read through all 4 pages of posts here.<P>One of the items I see recurring throughout the posts I have read is the ineffectiveness of our DOTs against hi-lvl mobs. I am just a lv 35 Necro, so I have not had the pleasure of nailing an uber mob yet. But, even at lv 35, I rarely see my DOTs do full damage when grouped due to the other damage inflicted by my group mates. Often, I expend several hundred mana points for relatively little damage points inflicted. A complete waste. <P>My primary spells when grouped seem to be a lifetap DOT, to counteract my CoB or Allure of Death, and my DD spells. This makes me a poor excuse for a wizard, albeit one that has a better mana pool. <P>Why not scale the damage dealt out by the DOT? For example, a 500 dam DOT that takes 8 ticks to complete can deal out: <P>30% on the 1st tick, 150 pts of damage<BR>20% on the 2nd tick, 100 pts of damage<BR>15% on the 3th tick,  75 pts of damage<BR>10% on the 4th tick,  50 pts of damage<BR>10% on the 5th tick,  50 pts of damage<BR> 5% on the 6th tick,  25 pts of damage<BR> 5% on the 7th tick,  25 pts of damage<BR> 5% on the 8th tick,  25 pts of damage<P>Of course these numbers are purely theoretical, but it may be one way to allow us Necros to deal the kind of damage we need to to rate up there with those other death dealers in grouped situations.<P><BR>Just a thought.....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>first off, the necro is great, i love it.  it's my dream, i've always loved the evil side to things.  so now here it is, im not talking about high lvl necros, im talking about mid lvls.  our pets are not the best, reason? the mage gets the focus item at lvl 30 or so, i cant get one until 50 or so, why is that?  make a quest for a low lvl focus, we depend on our pet's more then anything.  the mage gets the broom and shovel, we should do a quest about the same lvl and difficulty, and at high lvls get a different item, like the mages get a new focus at 49 or somthing.  make more commands for pets, maybe /pet assist or /pet guard group, more group friendly commands so when were meding we dont have to stop and target the mob and make our pet attack.  we need more dd or faster dots.  and let us have a difference in pets, lvl 24 it changes color, that's cool but maybe we could get a undead froglok or dead werewolf, that would look cool.  and at high lvls. i'd hate to be a mana battery, that sucks.  i want to be able to solo high lvl mobs and be useful in a group, using my own spells to hurt the mobs, not just give it to some nuke junkie(i love wizards too, just a figure of speech) i mean comeone, i dont want to sacrafice my mana to give to someone else, we are the most powerful class, until we have to give our mana to a wizard or cleric, that just does'nt fit the discription.<P>thank u,<BR>silabiss</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My main complaint is this:<P>Every class seems to have a main function in helping other classes with no penalty (ie clerics can res players without needing a componant to cast the spell, wizards and druids can teleport without a componant also.) I would like to know why if one of the main uses for a necromancer is to help with corpses why is it that it costs us 160pp to cast Summon Corpse? Most people aren't willing to pay that much for a Summon Corpse, and being that it takes most of us a while to even get the spell I feel that it's unfair to the class to charge that much.I would hope that they might take a look at this and consider changing either the price to make it more affordable or removing the need for a componant all together.<P>Gilthin Deadbinder<BR>42nd level Necro<BR>The Tribunal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please, please, don't repost the list with comments that just agree with the fact that the item is there, or to explain to me why it's important.  I know why it's important…  And I really don't want to lose good ideas among the reposts of ideas I've already got.  If you have a concern about an item on the list, great, let's hear it.  But the less often you repeat ideas already on the list, the more time I have to read and the less likely I am to skim.<P>As I read this thread, I keep seeing bickering.  Please stop, folks.

Keep in mind that this would be a list that we will look at.  I make no promises at all that any of them will be changed.  In fact, I can see a few on your list that probably will not be changed…<P>Zrazzt wrote:<P>&gt;"Absor, <BR>Could you also please ask the trolls to either provide a sensible, well thought our reason to their rants of "shut up whiney necros you have too much"?"&lt;<P>Actually, how about just ignoring them?

"&lt;<P>Actually, no it was not balanced that way, at least not originally.  It was 'broken' when we made the change to reduce the damage done by players to other players with spells.  Necromancers were balanced around the way it used to work.  And it wasn't even until a short while ago (several months) that we even noticed this bug.  So, no, necromancers were balanced assuming that this spell worked properly.<P>Thuldorn wrote:<P>&gt;"Finally the pet spells on test for mages. In an other thread you told us you would not want to give us pets that were immune to fear because you thought mages would then ask for the same thing. Are the pet summon and pet immune to fear spells going to be implemented for necro's as well?"&lt;<P>Right now, I just don't know.<P>This will certainly be something we talk about.  It may stay only for magicians (they are the primary pet class, even though necromancers run a close second).  We haven't really talked this one out yet, though, and I have no answer for you.  I know there will be a lot of upset necromancers if you don't get these two spells.  And we'll consider that.  But that can't be the only reason for making a change, we also have to look at more than that.<P>Post_Toasties wrote:<P>&gt;"If Absor were on our side he would have more clearly explained this."&lt;<P>I didn't know we had chosen sides.

And if you two don't stop this, I'll have to come back there.  You don't want that.  Take your personal disagreement elsewhere.  I don't have time to read it, and our customers shouldn't be expected to either.<P>Graverobber wrote:<P>&gt;"First off, Lich series. If the "bugged" 1:1 ratio is what is preventing Necros from gaining any sort of upgrades, then fix it. There are ways around it such as increasing HP gear and asking for Talisman and Symbol type buffs. Although personally, I think the spell is actually fine at a 1:1 ratio, seeing as I have thousands upon thousands of mana points versus my thousand HPs. So even at a 1:1 ratio, I will only gain 1300 mana for 1300 life, and that is about all of my life. heh heh But, if this is the one thing that is blocking any kind of fix to the class, then Id rather have it returned to normal. It may be a nerf of sorts, but it can be dealt with."&lt;<P>Well, fixing Lich and other changes or improvements are linked in a way, but not directly.  They are linked because they represent part of the whole of the power of the class.  So, yes, fixing Lich might allow some improvements in other areas.  But just because we fix it (IF we fix it) does not necessarily mean an improvement in some other area.  And, yes, a 1:1 ratio for hit points to mana seems reasonable enough on it's own.  But you can't forget that hit points can also be restored with mana.  And since hit points gained for mana spent is at a much greater ratio than 1:1, we have to keep in mind that mana (or hit points) can be generated out of nowhere as it is…  It's a complicated thing, and we'll have to look at it very carefully.  It's also probably the kind of change that would be hard to test, since it's effects would be wide spread.  Testing can make sure the changes all work as intended, but how they would affect the fabric of the game is going to be hard to tell.<P>&gt;"Mana transfer(subversion line): Ok, first off let me just say that as far as how *I* feel.  Necros should have never gotten these spells. Altering the mind is an Enchanters thing"&lt;<P>Perhaps, but using this logic it's just as easy to say that necromancers should never have gotten Lich spells either, that's converting matter to affect the mind too…  So it's not easy to judge these things.<P>And keep in mind the paragraph I wrote above.  Allowing mana to be given to others at a better ratio could be a mess, since the cleric can turn mana back into hit points very efficiently.  We really need to make sure that mana isn't too easily created out of thin air.  Obviously a fix to the Lich series would give us more room to work here…<P>&gt;"My Solution:<BR>#1.) Allow Trucidation to be Unresistable. (now wait, hear me out)"&lt;<P>I think I can add this to the list.  I am, personally, against making anything 'unresistable'.  I have a theory about things like that, and that is that they have too much of a potential to unbalance the game.  But considering the cost of this spell…  I'll add it to the list.  But I don't know if you should even hope that this will actually happen.<P>Greysoul_of_Povar wrote:<P>&gt;"We ask for this and then you give it to magicians?"&lt;<P>_I_ didn't give it to anyone.  And, right now, nobody actually _has_ it.  Let's not blow this out of proportion.<P>Animated wrote:<P>&gt;"The Lich series is self only, so calling the damage adjustment a "bug" seems unfair and irrelevant. Isnt it possible that the original coders knew that it would fall under pvp code? Perhaps they knew this, but to keep the code simple, they *already* increased the damage so that the post damage was reasonable? Why isnt this possible?"&lt;<P>It is not possible that the original coder knew that it would fall under the PvP code.  At the time that spell was created, there was no PvP code.  And the guy that created the PvP code was the guy that just recently discovered the BUG in Lich.  It is most certainly a bug.  The only question is, do we fix it or not.  I'm seeing a pretty mixed reaction here so far.  We'll have to take a long look at it, and do what's right for the game.<P>I'm off for lunch, keep up the good work.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yay! Necro talk! Thanks, Absor!<P>There seem to be a lot of concerns with the higher level spells, but since I'm only a measely 35 at the moment, I can't really comment on them.<P>However, I do have some comments on htis uber mob-group thingy. Recently, you've agreed to consider improving the utility of other classes in the ubermob encounter. SKs were given Summon Corpse, you will put forward suggestions for increasing Druid and Shaman heals, giving magicians a pet anit-fear buff, etc. So, it would be nice to see more done to improve the necro's use in these encounters too. Since Verant's vision of the necro is to act as a manastone in these encounters, I won't argue with that. But, as we are obviously still not particularly popular in raids, perhaps you could also look closer into this? If lifetaps can't land, then we can't continuously act as manastones. And therefore, we won't be useful or wanted. Simple as that. Oh, they may come and ask us to summon their corpses when something goes wrong, but that doesn't really do much for us besides making us a bit richer and using up our time.<P>Would it be correct to guess that the changes we've seen in Test did not include Necros because you hadn't done a talk with us? Only thing I can say about the changes is that I hope that we will be getting a pet anti-fear buff too.<P>And something that has not been mentioned yet here, and my current pet peeve. I have no idea whether it has ever been covered before but here it is: Iksar Necros. More precisely their quests. What exactly is the point of the skullcaps? The 7th and final skullcap has been found and it isn't particularly impressive. You could quite easily buy helms with more impressive stats. But the stats are not the problem. It's the difficulty of attaining the 7th skullcap itself. At each step of the way, there are increasingly rarer spawns that we have to find. Some of these spawns don't appear for days! On top of that, we have to actually devote a fair amount of time to improving our trade skills. Could you please review the amount of time and effort that has to be put in to obtain these items, versus the benefit of wearing said items? Most people have given up simply because there is almost no point in doing the quests.<P>Another thing puzzles me is the fact that Iksar necros cannot wear Iksar armour. Could you please explain the reason for this? It seems to be a completely unfair bias since Dark Elf necros can wear theirs. Are Iksar Necros so much more superior to Dark Elf Necros that they can't be allowed to wear armour? Even with the racial experience penalty we have?<P>Not entirely class balance issues, but I felt that this was as good a place as any to bring up these questions. If Absor or any of you could answer these questions fo rme, I would really appreciate it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
