</FONT><HR>A local EQ player read my thoughts that hybrids should be left alone.  He sent me an email, and invited me over last weekened to watch him play his 50+ ranger AND paladin.<P>A really great guy, that wanted me to see the concerns of his classes, and that there really are changes that need to happen.<P>I WAS BLOWN AWAY..  I was wrong all along...<P>Hybrids do have major issues.  I always assumed, a ranger in full thorney vine was basically the same as a warrior.  I was very wrong, and I will glady admit it.  I always thought a paladin  was uber in every way.  I was wrong, and I will  admit it.  Paladins have major issues.<P>My thoughts.<P>1) Paladins need major upgrades on their defense AND offense abilities AND spells.<P>My friend insists on using a 2HS (Soulfire), because hes a true paladin roleplayer, and feels that paladins always use 2HS weapons.  Anyway, I couldn't believe the pathetic damage this "Once Uber" weapon was doing!  The guy would only hit very rarely in the hundreds, and most of the time was doing 30-40 per hit, some as low as 16.  With the SLOOOOOOWWWWNESS of the weapon, why isn't their a big 2HS damage modifier?  Say if a given weapon is over 40 delay and 2HS, then the given damage should have a minimum of say 40+, with a damage modifier of say 150+ on the top end maybe, even add special damage crits for users of 2HS weapons.  Given the fact that a big sword, swung with two hands, should land with some serious force.  Once uber weapons like Skarlon, Soulfire, Flamberge, are now relegated to banks, because one handed weapons from Kunark are way better.  This is pretty wrong in my view.  After testing it, and watching him, its way wrong.<P>Warriors are super great, but paladins need upgrades in defense and offense(if using 2hs weapons).  Warriors will always be great - fear not, but Paladins need boosts, it was evident from watching him in battle in comparison to when I played a warrior to 50+.<P>Paladins need better spells, better buffs, and better disciplines in my opinion.  My friend was in full Valorium, and had AC well under 900.  Armor that was once considered Uber, and very rare, has now lost its status symbol for the most part.  Why not upgrade Valorium/Thorney Vine as part of the class balance? Add a couple points of AC to each piece or something.  The stuff is harder to get than Deepwater/Tolans, and deserves some respect.<P>As for his ranger, full thorney vine, AC wasn't close to 900.  His hitpoints were about 1500ish, about the same as a necro of the same level with nice gear. Rangers need offense?  I think not.  He got tanked HARD already in battle, and could seldom use his taunt key.  Defensive increase? BIG TIME.  HP increase? BIG TIME.  Rangers are considered a tank class, right?   Well, upgrade their HP a bit, just under a paladin, well under a warrior, but still more than a caster.  Ranger spells are good from what I noted, and I don't think they need adjustments other than whats coming from Test.<P>So in summation, i'd say:<P>Paladins:<BR>Better Spells<BR>More Defense/Higher Caps (defense(ac),dodge,parry, etc)<BR>2HS Damage Modifier for roleplayers that use 2HS.<BR>Valorium Upgrade (couple more AC per piece?)<P>Rangers:<BR>Upgrades to Hitpoints<BR>Slightly increased defense/skill caps.<BR>Thorney Vine Upgrade (couple more AC per piece)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>reply to what was previously posted:<P>"Grrr, you're gonna hate me for repeatedly posting things, but I seem to click that "reply" button too soon some days...<BR>As for an "epic" 1HS/Shield quest, please DO NOT make getting the Fiery Avenger/Fiery Defender a prerequisite! You'd be affecting five people per server if you did that. The stinking Books of Scale are waaaaay too rare for that. Give us a separate epic quest for a sword/sheild combo if we get another one at all...."<BR>*end quote from previous post*<P>Please do not make another epic shield/combo quest.  First off it would be unfair to other classes who just have one. Secondly, it is rediculous that those who have put the time/effort and questwork that is invovled to complete their Fiery Defenders currently.  I would love to see some sort of quest that is not very difficult at all really, that wil give the paladins the choice of changing their 2hander into a shield/1hander combo.  Of course tho, the FD would and should be a prerequesited item to upgrade it / change it from 1h/shield/2h combo like the warrior epic *2h into 2 1hs* vs *2h into 1h/shield* .  <P>In short, Give the paladins who have put the legwork in obtaining their Fiery Defenders the option of a 1h/shield combo solution.  Please DO NOT add another quest that is completely another epic quest w/ a reward of 1hs/shield combo that has nothing to do w/ the FD.  <P>I think all the paladins who have been thru what was required to complete their FD can all agree with me on this as well.  Thanks! :)<P>Darkfiend Lightbearer<BR>55th Knight of E'ci<BR>Follower of Na Koa<BR>Proud Wielder of The Fiery Defender!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen alot of great suggestions on these boards. But the bottomline is, Paladins need ONE good reason to be added to a raid group. Clerics are needed to Heal. Warriors to tank. Druids can ensnare and buff, with Shamans giving even better buffs. Wizards, and Mages have a number of needed abilities on top of their nuking. Enchanters we don't even need to bring up. Rogues are needed to pick locks, corpse recover and to top it off do great damage. Necros can fill most any role on top of corpse recovery. Bards are great for group buffing and mana recovery. Rangers still can output enough damage to make them useful along with their tracking ability. We need one ability (as do SK's I believe) that makes us unique and valuable in these situations. <BR>The best suggestion I have seen so far was the ability to replace a target that is being attacked with ourselves. Be it an extremely powerful taunt, or some kind of replacement spell that is limited to maybe a 10 min recast. This would truly make a Paladin valuable in a raid situation, AND should not step on any other classes toes. <BR>Jaybartu<BR>Tarrew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The Book of Scale is my main concern. I have been restricted to level 51 for months now (as have other Paladins I know) so I can go on raids and still have room not to hit 53. I don't even play my character due to this when I could easily be 55+ by now. I can't count how many dragon raids I've been on and have yet to see a book drop. That's a 3+ hour raid run everytime for something that never drops. Then if they do drop, I'll still have to roll on it. And the worst part, if I do win, I now have to increase my faction with Dark Elves (!) to complete the book. This is just not logical role playing. I see in no way how making the dragons drop a book half everytime or completed book to avoid the DE faction would imbalance us in any way. I know the Kunark dragons drop them as well, but Kunark dragons are rarely defeated and require uber guilds. I think Gorenaire has yet to been slain on my server. If you have no plans on changing the book drops, then please at least add a alternate NPC to turn the books into.<P>-Donovan Leonheart<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Group Yaulp - This is the most incredible thing I've ever heard.  Now if you guys just gave Yaulp IV to the one class that might actually use it - we'd be in business.<P>Sacrifice - kill yourself to group CH the party - nifty idea<P>Group LoH - nifty idea<P>Damage Redirect - Activate this discipline to take the damage being inflicted on another player - another nifty idea.<P>Stunning 55+ mobs - Doesn't exist - this is a class defining ability for Paladins and we're stripped of it post 55.   My idea of balance doesn't include negating a class's innate abilities and strengths.<P>It's been said before but it begs repeating...<P>Post 55+<P>But wait paladins can heal - nope clerics, druids, and clerics can take care of that - and what good is a 300pt heal that takes 4 seconds to cast in which time an uber mob can hit for 700.  We're back to top off healers post 50.<P>But wait paladins can stun to mitigate damage - nope, 55+ mobs can't be stunned or interrupted - this class defining ability is summarily stripped from paladins post 55.<P>But wait paladins can take damage - the upgrade to our defense was a great step in the right direction and the effects of this have yet to be seen - but all this did was fix what was already broken - there are other more pressing issues that need to be addressed like having a unique ability that will be welcome on large target raids<P>But wait paladins can buff - nope, our level 60 dropped spell buff don't stack with Cleric buffs or a store bought level 50 Ranger buff.<P>But wait paladins might unbalance the warrior class - come on guys - you've enjoyed your monopoly on large target raids for long enough - it's time to share again and draw upon the collective unique strengths of each class.  Now if Verant would only give us one - we'd be only too happy to use it.  We're not looking to usurp you as the primary choice for tanks - our issue is that we have nothing to offer to large target raids - please, just accept and understand that that is what we are fighting for.  Not new spell lines, not more damage - just something unique that we can add.<P><BR>The focus in this game has gravitated towards the selection of pure classes that have unique abilities they groups can draw upon to defeat a mob.<P>Show me the unique ability paladins have and can use post 55.  Show me the one thing we can offer on large target raids that isn't being offered by 3 other classes already (LoH doesn't count).<P>Fact is - they don't exist and that's all we're really clamoring for - everything else is just candy.  90% of the paladin community feels that the class is actually great and that our spells are totally fine - the single problem that affects us is that we don't have a defining ability that we can offer post 55.  Fix that and 90% of your troubles go away.<P>Thanks for taking the time to read this.<P>Dig</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Me again.<P>Just thought the idea that i have seen about Pally crits against undead is a great idea.  Especially with the Necropolis out, there would be a real use at high levels too.<P>I think ShadowKnights would have to share this, but we FEED on the undead.  I think we should have a chance to "crit" but make it a lifetap for  around half the damage potential of a Pally crit.  Example:<P>Pally hits an undead with a critical blow of 180 damage.<P>ShadowKnight hits with a 'Crit' of 90, plus a 45 point lifetap.<P>huh?  SK's and pallys should at the very least get crits on undead.  Perhpas only with blunt wepons. <P>It's a good idea whoever came up with it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just want to bring up something that I am sure will get doused with large amount of oil, and torched repeatedly.<P>This concept of The Block, and the idea that it wouldn't unbalance anything.<P>This would have to be implemented very carefully...  3 minutes....10 minute refresh....  <P>uhm...wow!<P>To that poster's credit they did talk about having it only abosrb half damage.  That's much better than some of the others that think that this should absorb all damage for a set period of time.<P>Think about it...<P>A team of 6 paladins and 6 warriors...  That's a heck-of-a-lot of immunity to damage.  <P>Warriors jump in.. Warrior_01 taunts and deals damage until they need to go defensive.  Shortly thereafter pally_01 "blocks" for that warrior...they have now done their "job".  They dealt out some free damage and allowed others to get lures on, backstab, whatever...they may now die.  <P>Warrior_02 steps up their taunting, going defensive when he gets too hurt.  Pally_02 blocks for him. (clerics may complete heal this time around, maybe not)<P>This repeats for all the warrior and pallies, and over the course of a raid-battle that could be a dramatic increase to efficiency.<P>Now, don't get me wrong i think this is a great idea.  I love it.  BUT it has to be watched carefully.  Perhaps the person your blocking can't attack at all, nor can the paladin(the blocker is effectively in front of the blocked person blocking outgoing attacks as well as incoming, due to being in the dern way).  <P>Absorbing only a portion of the damage(scaling as you gain levels?) seems to make a lot of sense as well.  However, just just drop something like this in the game could indeed skew things dramatically.<P>of course, I spose this isn't really a discussion about how to balance the possible additions.  That would happen by the dev team.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After reading quite a few of these posts, I feel that I have something to add to the discussion, so I think I will.  I play a level 44 paladin on E’ci, and while I can only imagine and sympathize with the paladins whoa are faced with the dilemmas of post 50 life, I think I may have a few suggestions that would make our class more “balanced.”<BR>	I think that many of us reading these threads are forgetting what balance really is.  Balance is not having one class be as good at any particular skill as another.  That only serves to effectively lessen the uniqueness of the classes, and make the game ultimately less replayable.  I think that when we think of balance, we should look at the situation.  If any two classes are truly balanced, then two classes in the middle of the same problem, will have different, but as close to equal as possible ways of dealing with the situation.  Example:  a warrior has lower damage output than a monk, but a monk in turn has lower AC.  This enables the warrior to slowly finish off a mob taking less damage per round.  The monk will take more damage per round, but will finish off the mob faster.<BR>	As I see paladins in Norrath, we are the defenders and the protectors of our party.  We do not/should not be the ultimate damage producing melee class, nor should we be even considered in the middle of that category.  Where we should excel, however, is protecting ourselves and, more importantly, our party.<BR>	I read in an earlier post the idea of adding a parrying bonus to Paladins/Shadow Knights when wearing a shield.  I think I’ll take that idea and modify it a little.  Add a “block” skill to all melee classes.  While Monks can already do this without a shield equipped, require the other melee classes to have a shield equipped for the skill to be used, and for skill to be gained in using it.  Not only would this enable Paladins to better serve as protectors, it also makes shields a more viable option to dual-wielding classes.  If not that, maybe adding a “chance to block” attribute to the shields would be a good option.  Giving the shields different blocking chances would be appropriate, as a buckler wouldn’t be as good for blocking as, say, the larger Qeynos Kite Shield.<BR>	Another shield upgrade that I would like to propose, even though it is not an original one, is to increase Paladin bashing skill significantly.  We, as paladins, trade damage output for defense when we equip a shield instead of an extra weapon, but I feel to remain as a viable choice as a party member, Paladins should more consistently connect with their shields, and possibly have the damage output increased slightly.  Since no large races can be paladins, it’s not as if our slamming ability comes into play here, as in the case of warriors and SKs.  I have also read much about the inability to interrupt the casting of many end-game monsters, and I hope that this will be resolved, but as I haven’t personally encountered this problem, I don’t feel comfortable commenting on it much.<BR>	The Paladins in Norrathian lore are the fighters who will die for honor, duty, and their loved ones.  I think that attribute of paladins is mostly left out of the game.  I have read talk in this thread of an AE root-type spell.  I think that a simple AE root would be very imbalanced, as it would give paladins a too effective way of crowd control.  What I propose instead of this is a spell, that although will work as an AE root centered on the caster, the spell will also effect the caster.  Additionally, the spell will add a powerful, but slow dot to the caster only.  The addition of the dot would make this an emergency only spell.  A Divine Sacrifice, you could call it.  The rest of the party is left free to flee the scene, but the paladin is left behind to face the wrath of the monsters that were caught in his spell.  <BR>	I think the addition of more utility spells would also be welcome Paladin spell book.  Whenever I am in a party with a cleric (which is nearly all of the time), nearly all of my spells become useless, because the Cleric’s casting ability totally eclipses my own.  This is as it should be, but there should be the addition of several spells to both the paladin and cleric arsenal that may not be important enough to the Clerics to use a precious spell slot on them, but would greatly enhance the ability of the Paladin to contribute to the group.  Spells like group Invisibility to Undead, more resist buffs (I see that Verant could have already partially addressed this), and maybe a spell that lowers everyone on the target’s hate lest except for the caster would be nice.<BR>	Sorry to make this post such a long one, but I love playing my paladin, and I know the strengths and weaknesses of the class very well.  I hope that my comments are read, and that they are helpful.<P>Pithticus Pygmalion<BR>Paladin of the 44th Honor<BR>&lt;Pillars of Heaven&gt;<BR>E’ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm Currently playing a lvl 60 Necromancer, I'd consider playing my (53 paladin) if the following changes where made. Other wise I'll just get my 55 druid friend to PL me an Ogre Warrior up to lvl 50 in 7 days /played or less...<P>1. So far spell changes looks great.<BR>2. Block skill w/ sheild or raise other defensive skills.<BR>3. Raise Bash skill max w/ sheild & epic weapon.<BR>4. 8) Add the Evasive Discipline at level 56, the Defensive Discipline at 60. Both should have 2/3rds the effects they do for Warriors (2/3rds of the missed/damage down percentage, 2/3rds duration); keep reset timers the same as for Warriors. Spells   (This was coppied from your last thread)<BR>5. Higher AC sheilds.<BR>6. MAKE THE DANG BOOKS FOR OUR FA/EPIC DROP MORE OFTEN. ( Example almost every 56+ shaman on TM has their epic( I know every lvl 60 does), same for clerics and Enchanters...Theirs quite a few ranger warrior druid epics around... Paladin ? only 2 or 3 total.  Ask any paladin whats the hardest part about their FA / Epic ?

</FONT><HR>  I apologize for making yet another post, but I wanted to add that I'm seeing a lot of ideas here that I WOULD support, speaking both as a paladin and as a warrior.  <P> First, I like the block idea that Guzzler mentioned.  (I dunno who suggested it first, but he was the guy I saw that mentioned it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P> Second, I *REALLY* like the sacrifice idea that Digndive and several others have mentioned.  <BR>Both of these ideas fit the paladin image perfectly, would make them more desirable on raids, would be UNIQUE (a big plus in my book) and don't step on any other class' toes.  <P>  I am strongly against increases to paladin or SK melee skills, simply because I don't want my 2 main characters to just be carbon copies of each other, with only minor differences.  I want my warrior to be the supreme, undisputed master of tanking.  I don't want anyone else to be close to his ability to tank.  BUT, I want my paladin to have enough OTHER abilities to compensate for being a much inferior tank, and make him wanted on raids. <P>  Let's enhance the hybrids, and make sure that hybrids and warriors are EQUALLY desirable.  But let's DON'T just turn hybrids into warriors that have 600 fewer HP, in exchange for being able to  cast spells. <P> Other paladin issues:<BR>Enstill is supposed to be an upgrade to root, yet it is actually far more mana efficient to cast root than enstill.  If enstill is supposed to be an upgrade, then it shouldn't be a worse spell than root.  <BR> <BR>LoH: I know Absor has nixed the idea of making LoH a complete heal for paladins over level 50, but I honestly can't see what the problem is.  It is a unique paladin ability, so this wouldn't step on anyone's toes.  Nor can I see any reason why this would be overpowering.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Say for example..the sword of morning's Blade, which is almost clear anyway. Also maybe have an option to alter the color of the fire on your own blade. Give it a personal touch.. Or just make the color of the fire on each different sword, (Soulfire, Fiery Avenger, Fiery Defender) different, BLUE would be awesome! I also like the idea of a shield/1h slasher combo option for the Fiery Defender. Warriors get the ability to change their Epic weapon from 2h to 1h and vice versa.<BR>Xilver Darkbane<BR>53 Paladin<BR>Bristlebane Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Anyway as someone pointed out, having 12 tanks in riposte disc is about the same.<P>That redirect damage discipline was the best idea i read on paladin board and i'm really looking forward to see it go live.

</FONT><HR>Hybrids all receive multiple penalties to their casting of spells. As is apparent...<P>Much fewer spells to choose from through out their careers.<P>Spells are received very late in their careers, often being 20 or more levels beneath them.<P>Parent classes will always have "the better version" when grouped together.<P>Spells cost additional mana to cast over their parent counter parts.<P>Hybrids have significantly less mana to work with based on equipment and specializations of casters.<P>Hybrids cannot specialize any of their spell circles.<P>Many individual spells are individually nerfed to be less effective when cast by a hybrid.<P>Lastly hybrids contend with the fact that 90% of the time they are casting, they are also supposed to be meleeing. This is where I see the need for a balancing improvement to our spells.<P>What I believe would benefit Hybrids the most on their spell casting needs is a way to "specialize" in Channeling. What this would mean is fewer interupts of course, but more importantly and entirely the point would be Faster Casting times.<P>For instance, a SK trying to cast a 7 second dot is almost impossible when tanking or soloing. Not to mention how much melee time is lost. More than half the SKs I talk to do not use most of their higher level spells, like cascading darkness, simply because the casting times are just rediculous for spells that may be resisted or over written anyway.<P>If a Hybrid had the ability to hasten casting times at later levels, making their spells more useful (or just plain useful) and allowing them to get back to meleeing more quickly (or recast again in the event of a resist) it would even out the fact that their spells are 20 levels too weak and only marginally effective.<P>It would also mean that less tampering would be needed with a hybrids base skills and attributes (the very things pure classes hold against us) as these faster casting times would mean we would be more effective with our watered down spells.<P>This makes sense to me.<P>It makes sense that a Cleric, who has gained considerable knowledge in spells would eventually specialize in the healing circle.<P>It makes sense that a Necro would eventually specialize in one of their circles of study as well. <P>This makes both characters better, more efficient casters in the areas they most need.<P>It ALSO makes sense that a Hybrid would specialize their spells for one purpose and one purpose only. To cast faster. So they can get back in the fight and do their jobs as melee's.<P>I hear complaints constantly from Hybrids about their spells being obsolete far too often.<P>But when would the superior heal of a Paladin be more effective than the superior heal of a Cleric? (who has more mana and is specialized in that circle)<P>Answer; when the paladin can get it off faster. Because he has devoted his study to being able to cast lesser spells quickly, in order to get back to the melee. It still cost him more mana, took longer to learn, and insn't as good as CH. BUT, he has an advantage of speed with his lower spell and specialized channeling.<P>Right now Hybrids are Forced to make hard decisions; Do we cast dooming darkness, with a good chance of getting it off successfully in only two tries? Or do we waste alot of time trying to get cascading off and to stick, when it takes forever to cast?<P>So why not create a method that allows Hybrids at higher levels to shave off some of the casting time to their spells? Thus allowing those spells to be more useful and in the end, more balanced.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well your Paladins would never run out of LoH because by the time the last one casted the first one would finally have his back.  <P>other than the above scenario i see no reason why post 50 it shouldn't be a complete heal even if you don't fix it please post the reason why.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a 50lvl Pally, and will talk about some of the problems i am facing.  First of all, have to give credit to ppl who did all the previous posts, lots of good points, and verant please listen to the posts, we have spent all our times playing a pally and we know what we are talking about, so don't just response 'I don't think so'.<P>We always heard, pally is penalized in a lot of areas coz he is a hybrid, that is a melee who can cast.  Well, how useful are our spell?  I would not discuss how usefulless our spells are in here, talk to every pally and they can have an hour discussion with you for sure.  This leads to the cap issue that everyone is concerning.<BR>When speaking of spell, now warrior can cast much better spell than pally with the kunark armor.  ??? so why pally is suppose to be weaker than a warrior ???  And what kind of spell we got from the kunark armor, symbol that still needs a gem???  Give us some useful spells and fix the DW armor pls.<P>I chose to play a pally based on the role and the characteristics from all other RPG games.  Paladin is a knight, stop talking about a defensive tank, a knight is to do damage, may not be as much as a warrior but certainly not worse than a ranger or rogue.  Fix the offence and defence caps pls.  At 50, i am pretty useless in a group, not able to find a grp, serve as an substitute of a warrior in raid.<P>Want to have fun when playing the game but certainly not much fun when you have to run 4 zones for corpse retrieval when die.  The origin idea is to balance the down time of the non-caster/hybrid and caster coz the caster are weaker and easier to die.  Are you saying all non-caster/hybrid should run and leave the caster behind when there is trouble?  If we stay to help, should we die first since the caster has gate?  On the other hand, hybrids are nerfed compare to non-caster coz we can cast, so why hybrids don't get the bind and gate spells? Isnt this contradict?  In mid to high levels, dont you think the casters will have to wait for the tanks to come back to get back to action anyway and don't we have the same down time?  Pls either give the hybrids the ability to bind and gate or allow every class to bind anyplace same to the casters.<P>Pally quests are jokes.  It is the tougest among all classess yet I don't see a reason why.  The overall idea of quest in EQ is a joke.  To finish a quest, you have to wait for N hours, killing a much much high lvl mob, rare spawn, rare drop.  How can you have others to wait with you like that?  Pls make the waiting time less.<BR>Not to mention i will have to keep at 52 until i get the books for the FA quest.  Sigh!<P>All of these are balance issues.  They are either a balance issue of class power or how fun to play the character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To the Paladin that feels they should beable to Critical hit with bash because ragers can Crit with bow:<P>To use a bow, the ranger must step out of combat, removing the damage done by melee. Giving Rangers crits with the bow was a way to improve their lack of damage with the bow.<P>Paladins have no such concern with the shield, it works it doesnt work a lil EXTRA damage if it does. Nothing lost if bash does not suceed.<P>Rangers are switching to a completely different combat mode, where line of sight issues among other things make it even harder to hit the creature at all.<P>So in short, dont use that as an excuse to get Critical Hits.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like alot of the ideas put forward alrdy and so I won't repeat them. However, I don't feel that any of them will make post lvl 50 Paladins more useful in raids. I think we have to get away from the idea that a Paladin can match a warrior as a melee or tank class and have them be able to do something completely different from either of their parent classes.<P>Here is an idea, although I agree it is more suited for a cleric it is not completely ludicrous for a Paladin to have. A desease and a poison buff (say lvl 49 or 50 spell level) that stack with ALL other poison and disease buffs. <P>For example: Tunare's Defense +50 to poison sv and maybe a small amount of hp.<P>Protection of Rodcet Nife (spelling) +50 to disease sv and maybe a small amount of ac.<P>Have these stack with Dead Man Floating and the other line of resistance buffs and Paladins will be more than welcome on let's say a Trakanon raid or other mobs that require high Poison and Disease saves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, Paladins.  My first main char and the first I got over 50.<P>Defence Skill:  Bringing it in par with Warrior is a great Idea, they still have better Armor and more HP, but it allows us to be more effective in our role as a Tank (same for SKs)<P>Stuns:  I have 2 beefs about our stuns.  1) they are too easily resisted at higher levels, mostly due to it being magic based.  2) Basically same as one but on another point, they are useless against Uber mobs, as well as almost any 55+ mob I can think of.  Being that fire is a symbol of paladins (purity and light) and we already get a Fire DD at 50, why not allow for a fire based line of stuns.  It could be a line of low damage, high taunt (maybe), fast casting (1-2.5), long recast (1 min or so), stuns that last longer than our current stuns (8-12 sec as opposed to the current 6), but fit into their own situation.  They would not over power us due to the long recast and low damage, but would accentuate our melee capabilities (since Pallys seem better at preventing damage that actually doing it)<P>Crits vs Undead:  I believe we should gain the skill to crit (and crip) naturally on undead beginning around 35, and increasing in ability as we level.  I know there are SKs that think that would make us better than them in a sence, so a similar ability to prevent class envy may be appropriate (maybe an undead lifetap proc in place of a crit that occurs naturally)  Then Holyforge could be improved upon or removed and changed altogether.<P>Bash:  This skill needs to be increased for Pallys and SKs.  You have heard it so many times before and you'll hear it from me.  Pallys and SKs are THE ONLY classes that at the higher levels, use a shield on a regular basis.  also other possible improvements I can think that would be nice is increased stun duration at higher levels, effectiveness increased post 50 (such as on giants and other normally unstunnable mobs), maybe a critical bash (at 51 my pally never bashed for more than 19, a crit on this would still be a very low ammount compaired to how much I would normally do with a dark metall holy water sprinkler, so I'm not hung up on this), and maybe even a pushback factor to increase the chances of interrupt.<P>Lay Hands:  I like the once again improvement, and agree that there is really no need to make it a Cheal.  I would possibly like to see a Discipline as was previously suggested to make it a Group Lay Hands, or a Discipline that would automatically Lay Hands on a group member that would otherwise have died (but a good duration should be placed on it to allow it to be effective, at least 5 min)<P>1H vs 2H:  Paladins and SKs need more 1 Handed selections for them only.  They should be well worth having so that the pally (or SK) can have a choice of what they want at the time (2hs for good damage, or 1hs and shield for decent damage but improved defence + bash).  It pains me to see a warrior duel wielding 2 weapons that have better dmg/dly ratios than the 1 hander I like to use when I am the primary tank in a group.  I could use a 2 hander, but then lose effectiveness as a tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>POST 50, POST 50, POST 50!  Well, I'm not Post 50 and from the way it sounds, I'm glad I'm not! I would never get a group!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> I'll leave most of that discussion up to everyone else, with some information about what I liked and didn't like so far.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>I agree that up to level 40 or so Paladins are a well adjusted and pretty much balanced class. I'm lvl 31 but group with many higher than me and see no real glaring issues. <P>About all I can say is we could use better defense. That's about it, and you HAVE to do something about RO ARMOR!!!! (See below) I have a VERY simple solution and my suggestions are probably NOT what you are thinking.<P>Blocking: I really like the issue raised about us being able to BLOCK all or some attacks directed at a party member with our shield once we reach a certain lvl, while not being able to attack back ourselves when blocking. Perhaps something graduated with percents getting higher as we lvl.  For instance: 52nd lvl - 33%, 56th lvl - 66%, 60th lvl - 95% or even 100% for a time.  A good group certainly won't miss our attacks since they are evidently so pitiful to begin with at higher levels, but this is a way for us to really make a difference in the group protecting the Cleric or the Enchanter or whomever.  I like this idea!<P>Duel Wield:  I don't think we should get it. Period. Don't need it, don't miss it, not interested.<P>Riposte: I don't think we should Riposte as well as Warriors or Rangers.  People keep talking about Riposte as a DEFENSIVE skill. It is only HALF DEFENSIVE!!! You get to attack back. That makes it Offensive as well!  Leave it as is.<P>Parry: We should Parry better than we do. That is definitely defensive only.  Raise parry 25 points.<P>Bash: We should Bash better than we do, while that does a miniscule amount of damage overall, it involves a shield which is defensive in nature and a shield is our mainstay.  I really like the idea of both magical shields that Proc for us and Crits and Crips with shields. The damage won't be overwhelming, but it will be a nice addition with no real balance issues.<P>Stun: I just got my first stun and I love it. I hate to think that once I finally reach mid-50's and up it is a useless skill. Something should be done here.<P>Better Offense: A small bump would be nice, but not bad as is. Let the pure melee classes do the damage. I'm okay with it.<P>Better Defense: Definitely need a good solid bump here.<P>Undead: I like the concept of Crits and Crips on Undead, and the aspect of a "Lichbane" undead sword similar to Ghoulbane at about 50th lvl.  We fight undead better than anyone, lets keep that issue something for Paladins.  Then it will be up to Verant to make more Undead at higher levels for us to fight! Wouldn't it be nice to have some Uber Undead Boss Mobs that people are BEGGING Paladins to come and fight!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Group LOH: While I'm not familiar with the issues at higher levels and boss mob/planes raids, it sounds like a very unbalancing idea to me. Before you blast me too hard, I openly admit my lack of knowledge at upper mob levels.<P>Suicide to CH the Group: From the way this sounds, it looks like the Paladin, even if no where near death, would take out a dagger and slit his own throat to CH the group.  That's the vision that comes into my head and I don't like it.  I have no problem sacrificing for the good of the group, but some explanation as to HOW this ability would be implemented is in order, I think. Maybe take all attacks on himself until dead, but NOT slit his own throat.<P>Taunt: Perhaps it could be a bit better. I am already starting to see problems with taunting from Casters.  Nothing drastic here though, especially if our stuns are made more effective at higher lvls. Let the warriors taunt. Ours is fine.<P>Armor: Or more SPECIFCALLY RO ARMOR! Man are the quests hard and long and drawn out. But that's okay. No problem working for what I get. I do NOT agree that MM granite should be removed from No-Drop status. If anything, MORE of it should be No-Drop.  You EARN IT, you don't just buy it!! What a concept. Currently, the MM Granite is the ONLY Ronium component that is No-Drop. Keep it that way.  Don't you dare make it easier. Just make the time and energy equal to the reward.<P>The only issue with the armor itself is that I can BUY my own RO ARMOR from Bards and Rogues and Magic Users on any given Sunday at the tunnel in EC! All it takes is cash. Anyone can make it and get it. That is ridiculous. It should be NO DROP!! Come on Verant, this is our defining Armor! Not only should OURS be No Drop, but everyone elses as well!  WAY WAY WAY too much stuff being sold to the highest bidder.  If you just CAN'T bring yourself to make it No Drop, then at least make certain things LORE!  I recently met a high lvl warrior auctioning THREE Wurmslayers!! THREE!!! While I have no problem with a high lvl warrior getting three Wurmslayers, I do have a problem with them having them all at once just to sell! The "free market economy" is out of control, STOP THE FARMING!!!!  .....but I digress (sorry, for the RANT)<P>RO ARMOR SOLUTIONS: It is obvious that the expansions have moved on and left Ro Armor behind. It needs to be fixed. I'm not suggesting it replace Deepwater Armor (which I think should be QUESTED FOR and not just a drop), but just a few tweaks are needed. Namely, tweak the Breastplate by bumping the AC from 20 to 23. That's it, nothing more. That would put it on par with the other items out there, such as the Dusty BP or the Black Enamelled CP.<P>Bump all the other pieces 1 AC pt.  Don't change the saves or bonuses. Just bump the AC by 1 for all the other pieces. That would be any extra 10 AC total if you had all the pieces. Not much but enough to increase their worth. <P>AND THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET PEOPLE TO WANT RO ARMOR AND USE IT:  MAKE IT ALL GOLD!!!!  The boots are gold, the gaunts are gold, I've been told the bracers are gold but don't have them yet, but nothing else is!  The BP and Grieves look just like FS plate. What's up with THAT?  Make it all GOLD, and you will see an increased interest in Ro Armor.  You could EASILY distinguish the Armor as special, people at a glance would KNOW it was RO and would KNOW that you were a Paladin. That would be enough to peak interest in it again. Fix Ro. Don't make it easier to get, just make it worth while. People currently think I'm CRAZY for trying to get it when I can just buy it or buy BETTER!  It shouldn't be that way.<P>Lastly, I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA of Race-related defining quests. As a Dwarf, I should have some special paladin quest to do that will not only define me as a Paladin, but define my race as well. If you really want expand the game and peak interest in developing characters, give us more RACE-SPECIFIC quests.<P>Those are my thoughts. Certainly not a wish list. Trying to be realistic.<P>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<BR>31st Circle of Dwarven Paladins<BR>Twilight Brethren<BR>Torvo Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, etc. I just read the long post about the possible upgrades to Hybrids, mostly including talks about the paladins and shadowknights.<BR>I am all for changes to the paladin class, but i feel that a very, very large problem was left out of the thread. This problem involves the first part of the Paladin Epic quest, the Fiery Avenger.<P>As of now, the quest involves getting a book from vox and nagafen (and of course, the "new dragons". The only problem is, while almost every other class has a reasonable easy time getting their epics, Verant has made it very, very difficult for paladins. Problem being, since you implimented the level limit on Vox/Nagafen, you have hence punished us paladins who have lvled up. So, basically, if we can manage to get the levels together to kill Gorenaire, etc, then MAYBE we might be lucky to get a book drop. This is ridiculous.<P>I think you should strongly consider implimenting an NPC or a few NPCs which, like any other epic mob encounter, require a few groups of high 50's, etc, hell, make it a full out dragon encounter, BUT not as difficult as say, gorenaire. And, make these NPCs drop the paladin epic books with a MUCH higher drop rate than say, Vox/Naggy. Also, dont impliment a complete Vox/naggy loot table, that would most likely be a risk vs. reward issue. But, the ability for paladins to get epic quest componants really needs to be evaluated.

</FONT><HR>If the changes on test go live, my 51st paladin will be back from retirement.  These are the only other issues I have.<P>1. I want my Big Sword just like the paladins in all your box cover art.<P>Verant said in the past that their visionTM of the paladin is with a big sword.  So where are our big swords?  The proposed changes on test will free us from the need to use the 1hander/shield combo, but what 2hander is better than the wurmslayer / charred guardian shield combo, for the 40s to low 50s ?  That combo offers you 25dmge, 40 delay, with a total of 30ac, 5strength and 5vs magic, 50hp, and the ability to bash.  I paid a total of 10k pp for both.  What 2hander can I get that offers the same advantages, for about the same price?  just look at our 2hander from the planes, 20/36 with 5str 4int.  Does anyone know a paladin that uses this weapon?  <P>We need 2handers with better damage ratios, and with AC stats.  Throw in bash on a couple of the higher end ones.  I know there are some really nice 2handers for 20k, but im talking about something to close that gap between the low end and the high end.<P>2. How are we supposed to agro the mob when we are designed as a defensive class? We need a low mana spell with the agro power of snare, or a better taunt.  SK have several spells they can use to agro mobs.  If I am designed to get hit, help me be hit.<P>3. 51-54 spells.  Calm, resist disease, frenzied strength. Does anyone keep these spells memmed? Does anyone even buy them ?<P>Why is enstill a lvl 54 spell? Its a lvl 29 cleric spell, and the upgrade to our lvl 22 root spell.  This spell should be at lvl 51, and may help solve my problem #2.  Would also be nice to see an exp rez before lvl59. Very few groups will ever go anywhere with even moderate risk, unless an exp rez is available.  With the upgrade to Shm/Druid heals, groups will not REQUIRE a cleric, as they now do, post 50 (Yup, getting close to stepping on clerics toes now).  Only time I've ever used my no-exp res was to rescue newbies who forgot to bind after taking a boat. Have never used it on a group member.<P>I want to look forward to my new spells every level.  I want to be rewarded for advancing.  I dont want to have to wait until 55 for my good post 50 spells.<P>4. Boss mobs.  We're fine.  I took 3000 melee damage from Dracoliche, in addition to his AoE, without one heal from a cleric. I just used LoH and chain healed myself.  This gave the clerics a chance to use their mana on the damage dealers, like wars, casters, etc.  We are defense, not offense.  We can also use LoH to save a war that didnt back off to get a heal in time.  Damage dealers need to be kept alive as long as possible. My boss mob experience is limited, so I may be wrong, but I am happy with my roll on these raids.<P>Zaid Ynot, 51st Paladin.<BR>Looking forward to playing this character again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PALADIN PET<P>Shadowknights have pets so why not give pallys a pet.  Make it be like a summon glory spell or something where the paladin summons a pet.<P>This pet would in no way be a fighting pet, it would have the melee abilities of a level 4 caster.  The sole purpose of this pet would be to heal party members that are not full health.  The heal it would be casting would be in the area of heal doing about 100hp heal per cast for the level 60 pet.  The pet would require a jasper to cast and would have a low amount of hit points but enough to survive at least 1 round of attacks from the average level 55+ mob.  Of course the pet's heal would only be able cast so often (lower level the heal the more often it can cast)<P>If paladins had a pet that healed the group from most damaged on up, this would be a great enhancement to the class and although would not be powerful enough to allow the paladin to solo or take the place of a group healer it would lighten the load of the healer.  Groups would be more open to saying in /ooc Group looking for pally.  Only time I've ever seen that said is when someone was messing around, doesn't hurt till it's you that's getting stepped on and pushed aside.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The other hybrid quest spells require TRADEABLE items off of uncommon mobs, and their spells appear to be more powerful.<P>Rangers just need a few items from lvl 40ish mobs in mistmoore, lower guk and solb, while SKs need items from lower guk and solb.  These zones are regularly camped, and the questor and a friend could easily kill the mobs needed.

</FONT><HR>Please do not post requests for paladins to get useless pets. 1) paladins dont need pets. 2) there are enough classes that have pets. 3) Just because our equivalent/opposite class gets them doesn't meen that we need them. They have them becuase of there parent class(necro). I think adding new ideas are fine for this thread, but lets keep them with in our class definition. If you want a pet to play with, make an alt that can do that. Sure fluff like that might be nice, but it takes away from our class the attention that it needs.<P>  Our class is defined as a Tank in the group roll. But our defense, paladin and shadow knights, isn't at the level that we need it to be in order for us to play that roll correctly, even if it is a failed roll. EQ is base on offense. This has been proven time and time again. With the current fighting engine of EQ, it is the object to kill the mob as fast as you can. More offensive power is your defense. The fast you can kill a mob, the less hits you can take. No amount of AC or defense currently in the game will make up for lack of offense.<P> An example. Warriors are the BEST tank in the game so far. The have best AC and defense for a tank. But they can dish out the damage as well. They might not be as good as a rogue or monk, but they are not far behind compared to hybrids. Now if a paladin has the same AC, defense, and dodge/parry/reposite skill as a warrior, would that make him as good a tank as the warrior? lets say that a level 55 rogue,cleric,wizzy wanted a 55 tank for their group. Both a paladin and a warrior could take the damage just as good(providing they had the same AC and skills) as each other. Who would the group pick? The warrior would be the better of the choice. Why? Because not only can he take the hits like the paladin, but he can also dish out damage 50-60% more than the paladin. You might say that the paladin has heals though, but 300point heal isnt going to do anything at level 55 and considering the paladin will be taking all the hit( being the tank), he wont be able to even cast that spell. Also since the paladin can't dish out half the amount of damage the warrior can, this means the fight lasts longer, the paladin takes more hits than the warrior, and the cleric is using more mana to heal himt that the warrior over the time of the groups adventure. Even if you added the amount heals he can can due during downtime, this is won't make up for the damage he has taken over the time the group has been together. I think the party would rather have killed the mob quicker, take less hits over time, and gain xp faster by adding a warrior. <P> Please, not only should the defense/dodge/parry/reposite be upped to that of a warrior, we should also receive some offense/weapon skill increase as well. If our offense/weapon_skill is not increase, then I ask you to increase out defense/skills to be a little more than a warrior.

</FONT><HR>I would also like to point out that the (failed)roll that the paladin trys to play in a group, does not fight the raid/uber-mon scene. A warriors roll doesnt really change when on a raid, they still tank because they can take the damage and deal like in a regular group - but they receive a set of DISC's that in effect help during these encounters. A paladins roll who barely fits a group, WON'T in a raid/uber-mob. So what roll can they play in a raid/uber-mob? <P> Replaced the normal mob in my above post with an uber-mob and you would out a second thought still choose a warrior over a paladin ( even with same defense/dodge/parry/reposite). The skills point difference in offense between warriors and paladins might not seem that much, but it is and it doesn't scale with the later levels like it does pre 50 game.<P> Some paladins have even begged for watered down disc of a warrior. I think that we need something more than that. We are asking to have an ability that the EQ community can recognise so that we are able to contribute to the raid/uber-mob scene. Giving us something that something that is watered down/not as useful in practice(not theory) will keep the Paladins of Norrath comming back to these boards complaining about there class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi<P>The main issues have been addressed by Absor. I have 3 more suggestions to make.<P>1. Please look into the feasibility of the Paladin Epic quest especially the part where you need to grab the 2 books from Nagafen and Vox.<P>2. An upgrade to Flash of Light could be implemeted i.e. Holy Light which has a melee debuff effect on the mob when in effect lowers their defence and attack ratings.<P>3. A new suggestion for a discipline or spell i.e. Aura of faith which is an aura surrounding the paladin during fights. The aura will be rolled against a mob's attack on the paladin i.e. when a mob attacks a paladin, other than rolling the possibility of hitting against the paladin dodge, parry , riposte and what-have-you, it rolls against the discipline/spell effect as well. This will reinforce the paladin in the role of a defensive tank.<P>To reiterate the better suggestions Absor has taken:<P>1. A Block skill viable only when wielding a shield.<P>2. A review of the HolyForge discipline.<P>3. An inherent ability by the paladins to inflict critical hits on undead.<P>4. Better Bash skills for paladins.<P>5. Shields with proc.<P>6. Possibility of triple attack for paladins if their offensive skill caps are not raised. Triple attack does not occur naturally, it is rolled against the skill. Even with triple attack, a paladin will still miss a lot, and do substantially less damage than rangers, rogues, monks and warriors.<P>7. Lowering the recast time for LOH from level 50 onwards. However, the reuse time MUST NOT be reduced to such that it is abusable.<P>8. The spell additions and changes on Test Server are good.<P>9. The defensive skills of paladins would be raised to meet those of the warriors i.e. Defence, Riposte, Parry etc<P>10. Wider variety of weapons and shields for paladins to choose from as the present range are pathetically limited and highly unobtainable. (I am considered lucky to have a ROF and SOTM)<P>I would appreciate support for my suggestions, and definitely your opinions too!<P>Thank you.<P>Sagiitaur Blackheart<BR>Devoted High Elf Follower of Tunare<BR>(Too bad they nerfed the Natures Defender Quest before I embarked on it)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, your brain must be mush by now.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>I've been reading these posts and thinking for a couple days, and wondering if maybe we should be looking at this balance issue from a different perspective.<P>There has been a huge focus on defensive skills in particular, as a solution to make paladins more "balanced", but I think it will only end up making them lopsided.  Putting all our apples in one basket, by boosting a couple skills way up and ignoring other problems isn't a great solution, IMO.  For just one moment, ignore everything you know about the classes in EQ, and consider this one point:<P>A paladin is (supposedly) 75%/25% warrior/cleric.  I'm not sure what the actual exact split is supposed to be, but I'll use that as a close estimate for now.  Anyway, this implies two basic things -- first, paladins have some cleric-like abilities, but their PRIMARY focus is melee.  Second, not counting special class abilities (disciplines, LoH, etc.), a paladin should be able to function at 75% of the offensive/defensive capacity of a warrior in most situations.<P>The key here is efficiency.  From a melee standpoint, if a paladin truly functioned at 75% of the overall efficiency of a warrior, he would actually be balanced (assuming the cleric side of things was also balanced).  A warrior would still be more desirable to high level groups, because it would mean greater efficiency and less downtime.  But a paladin wouldn't be so drastically worse (efficiency-wise), that it would preclude him as a viable alternative.<P>As it stands, paladins are currently far far less than 75% of a warrior (ironically, mostly due to their awful melee skills).  If paladins can't help make a group efficient, they will continue to be unwanted in groups.  But skewing their offensive/defensive focus too far (in an attempt to keep from homogenizing the classes) will create an entirely different problem.  Just blindly maxing out paladins' defensive skills without looking at their other melee attributes is a BAD IDEA, and won't lead to any kind of true balance.<P><BR>I propose the following:<P>Step 1)  This is just the starting point, so hear me out.  Balance paladins' skills across the board, in every melee respect, to make them exactly 75% of a warrior with the same equipment and stats.  This balancing should not include dual wield because I don't think there's any fair way to balance against that.  It should, however include pretty much everything else, including crits and class-specific bonuses.  I won't bother to suggest numerical values, since only the Verant people know for sure what effect all the numbers have.  But do the math, run the simulations, just make sure you get it 100% right.  The idea here is (statistically) to make paladins EXACTLY like having 3/4 of a warrior in the group, for BOTH tanking and damage output.<P>Step 2)  Now skew the offensive/defensive focus toward specializing paladins as a defensive tank.  But most importantly, keep doing the math, keep running the sims, etc.  Make sure that no matter what, the paladin still has the same efficiency impact on a group as if he were 3/4 of a warrior.  I'm guessing that you will find you can't take things as far out of whack as they are on the test server right now, without losing the balance of efficiency.<P>All in all, there have been a lot of good suggestions in this thread, and I don't feel much need to repeat what everyone else is saying.  I will, however, repeat and stress one serious issue with our cleric side:<P>Our level 50+ spellcasting abilities do NOT constitute 25% of our usefulness to a group.  It's a joke in bad taste to give us spells that are overwritten by classes that are present 95% of the time, and then tell us that those spells are supposed to contribute significantly to our desirability.  How exactly are we supposed to be desired in a group (for our spells), when they already have the same or better spells?<P>Our high level spells SERIOUSLY need to be re-evaluated, to focus more on spells that help in combat, and group/self spells that are NOT overwritten by other classes' spells.  Stuns are about the only useful thing we can bring to a level 50+ group (until level 55, anyway).  Flash of light would be a nice debuff (and a great taunt) if it didn't have the tendency to make a mob flee (as if feared) at around 2x SoW speed.  How the hell does it navigate all those twisty corridors that fast when it's blind, anyway?  A new ATK or STR debuff of some kind would be wonderful, fitting in with our "defender" role.  I particularly liked the idea of a buff that would transfer a percentage of the target's injuries to the paladin.  Not so useful for the tanks, but a life saver for the casters.<P>As far as disciplines go, I'm not sure about some of the suggestions.  We definitely need something to make us a contributor in epic encounters, but I'd like to think of copying warriors' defensive discipline as a last resort.<P>Any kind of LoH discipline/ability I'm not too sure about, as it really doesn't have a huge impact on an encounter in its current neutered state.  LoH's only real use is to bail out a wizard who nuked too much, an enchanter who temporarily lost control of the crowd, that sort of thing.  It's pretty rare that a situation occurs where you need to LoH your entire group at once.  Generally if things are that bad, you're all going to die no matter what unless the evac gets off.  Besides, you won't find too many people planning a raid saying, "okay, now first we'll want to get ourselves in a really screwed position, where we're all about to die, so the pally can LoH us..."   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway, those were the most important thoughts I wanted to share.  I hope you're still reading all this Absor.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  If so, a sincere thanks from all of us for taking the time to listen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NEW (I think) IDEA:  anti-jolt spell.<P>Background: Jolt for rangers is a Single Target Hate List Reduction at level 55 for 60 mana and 1.5 second cast.<P>Proposal: Paladins gain a single spell at the same level rangers gain Jolt that does the exact opposite as jolt: increase their position on the agro list by 1 or 2 positions with a quick recast time but for substantialy more mana cost (200-250).  This would allow paladins to absorb more damage and better allow them to utilize the new defensive caps.<P>Analysis: This spell must be designed to balance other changes being made to the paladin class.  A dicipline such as rispote could not coexist with this spell.  <P>The speed of casting must be very short but the mana cost should prevent it from becomming an automatic life saving taunt. (Trade off, mana for a better taunt - it keeps taunt balanced and prevents exploting.)  <P>Since paladins have less hitpoints, AC, and  dodge/parry/rispote skills there is a good chance that being at the top of the hate list is NOT a good thing - so the increased chance of death also balances the idea.<P>I would like to see both this spell (suggested name: Holy Light) and Jolt be moved to level 52.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think you've covered just about anything, but as far as new ideas, here's one from my original post (I'm not sure you saw it or not)<P><BR>- Paladins are no more effective vs. undead than any other class.  The undead DD spells we do receive from the cleric line are too little damage too late, and the casting times are too long.  Long casting time means lost combat swings which more often than not means less damage output overall.  Holyforge discipline is still too unreliable as a method of increasing our damage vs. undead, and only useable once per hour.  I would be fine with it being removed, and replaced with the watered-down defensive discipline I suggested above.<P>Solution:  Add a new spell or two for 55+ paladins that would do 300-500dmg for 150-200 mana with a 1.0 to 2.5 second  casting time thereby being useful in combat and not wasting melee swings.  If you want to make sure we are in combat while using  such spells, just shorten the range of the spells to melee range.  For flavor, consider allowing paladins to have a chance (regular  warrior % chance) for critical and crippling hits vs. undead all the time at level 60 (or 50+ if you're feeling generous or "flavorful"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ).   Another neat idea is to add a spell similar to Divine Might at around lvl 55 (that would not stack with it) that would make us randomly proc a LOW resist 250-400 dmg vs. undead.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
