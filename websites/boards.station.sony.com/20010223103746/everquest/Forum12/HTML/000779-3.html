</FONT><HR>I'll second the feelings of the poster above.  It boggles my mind that in a "community" game there wouldn't be some kind of class steering committee made up of select users and Verant reps.  That way some of the really stupid suggestions don't overshadow some really good ones that deserve serious consideration.  I'd be perfectly happy to have experienced players vet some suggestions and present "findings".  Chances are, with some guardrails, many of these activities would have a self-correcting mechanism since those same folks have other characters, too.<P>Sure, these massive posts serve to air concerns, but shouldn't that be an ongoing effort so that the game gets progressively tweaked instead of a massive balancing act that might be tough to do financially / time-wise? Your task IS appreciated, but it's monumental given the issues that have been raised.  It just doesn't seem likely that real study will be given to this effort.  And, unfortunately, filtering these issues through one person's perspective isn't an effective approach.<P>After I started reading this discussion, and the other classes as well, I just stopped playing my two characters (and I am considering cancelling, also).  I'm a casual player, but my perception is of a very promising game that simply might have issues when it comes to execution, community, and continuity. Certainly, the only encouraging item I've read so far was the recent Producer's Letter (very well done).  Somehow, I don't expect we'll see anything close to that for the VISION (tm) for classes.  And, unlike the folks that can spend their time getting one of every class to 60, I certainly don't have that kind of time to kill.  But, I do expect professionalism for my investment.  Now I dread even logging on (kind of: "what's the point?").<P>Like so many things, it takes a lot more work to maintain it than to start it up.  That might be where this game is now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well rather than flame Verant or Absor.  Maybe we should just issue a post about the main issue of being a mana pump.  Necro's can respond Yes or No with the char name and server that they play on.  So Verant could take a sample of the responses since they have our station ID(if they wanted to verify the response).  Maybe (I may be kidding myself here) if they clearly see that we don't want to be mana pumps. The uestion of what do you want to do will be raised.<P>1.

</FONT><HR>While, I am only 34th (been 35th and undinged about 4 times so far), I do NOT look forward to becoming a mana pump and wish to add my voice for that vote. <P>I look at the list of necro suggestiong that made it to the final draft and compare them with the suggestions made, and I do not see representation of the views of the majority of the necro community in the final draft.<P>I would like to see IRC representatives for each class (2 blue reps. 1 pvp rep) elected who would attend regularily scheduled IRC meetings with the dev team to represent our views and work with them to reach solutions.<P>The reps would read the message boards and discuss ideas with the peers and and then bring the refined ideas to the dev team to discuss.<P>Even if that is not deemed a viable option, I do belive the way you condunct your class discussions should be re-evaluated.  You are forced to wade through both the good and the bad ideas in such volume that it consumes a lot of your time and decreases the probability of good ideas making it to your final draft.<P>If mana battery is the final role after all is said and done, you should at least update the class description to reflect this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here ya go, this will make your meeting short.<P>1.  Leave Lich alone.  I wouldn't take a lich nerf even for a 1:1 mana transfer spell.  If you want the message boards filled with I quits and complaints then go ahead and change it.<P>2.  Lifetaps should be able to hit uber mobs.  My 54 lifetap is 330 dam for 200 mana.  I wouldn't even move the mobs lifebar barely, but I could get back hps I lose to lich.<P>3.  Remove the skele effect from ignite.  I use my MUCH faster casting lifetap over this spell even whne I can use it.  It has a HUGE recast and even clerics have a much much better nuke then this.<P>4.  Give our 53/56 pet more hps/higher ac.  If you want to leave the 53 pet as is thats fine.  Some people still fear kite at 53 so pet is useful.  The 56 pet will be used in groups.  I use the 49 pet most times, cause the 56 pet has WAY to low hps.  You think at level 57 I should have to use my 49 pet??  The 59 pet needs an upgrade also.  The 59 pet costs 11pp to cast and doesn't offer much over the 49 pet and lower damage then the 56 pet.  Please adjust the 56/59 pet a bit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. You will have many happy necros.<P>5. Add a nice spell like summon companion.  Pets are how we do damage as necros.  Our dots do very little in groups and we have no real nukes so to speak of.  Play a necro and see how useful you feel without a pet in a group.  Pets are just about as important to us as mages.  We should get the same lines of new pet spells. This is a game how about a bit of fun?<P>6.  Take out the spells that req. EE to cast. NO ONE MEMS THESE SPELLS!!  Res is the only spell that I would ever use this for.  How about changing the req. to a gem of some sort like a ruby or sapphire?<P>7.  Take out the night only component to Levant an Veil.  Who would ever mem a harmshield that might not be able to be used if you needed it at the wrong time of day?  Who thought of that idea??  Maybe make them more powerful at night or something.<P>That is my list of items that need to be tweaked.  Follow that and you will not hear a peep from necros.  Thsi list would not increase our power more then we have in a normal group now.  Just make life easier and the game more FUN.  I know you think necros are real poerful, but at 55ish the power not only stops but goes to zero in some situations.  Please consider this list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lol , what class does Absor play , as if he would awnser , and allow himself to be fillet'd .<P>Targetable FD , absolutely NOT , a mess , a disaster . NO WAY . FD takes practice to use effectively , fails over 50% of the time , and we don't even get the upgrade .<P>Our mana pact line . It is already extremely high risk gameply . Anyone who plays a necro knows that the  lich / twitch / life tap style of play , is grueling to keep up , exspecailly after a few hours . Most of the time I do prefer clarity . I have died countless times with 60% mana . Just because CoB has drained me down less than two bulbs of health . Then something pops on me , dual hits me for damage , and bam , dead , just like that . Well I guess any of of spells that are effective , always get reduced to worthlessness .<P>Our pets , Weak  , pathetic , sorry , crappy , not very good at all . Lack any creativity graphic wise . <P>Level 24 pet , max damage 26 , will produce dual attacks at best , and kick , whoo hoo (if your dumb enough to go through 3 or 4 bars of mana and a stack of bone chips to get one .<P>Level 29 pet , max damage 28 , official dual weilder ,  by this time mobs are hitting for 60's and 70's . <P>Level 34 pet , max damage 33 , now mobs are hitting for 100  , hope you like fear kiting . Cause mobs will take it down fast .<P>Gee my skele grew an inch taller and does 2 or 3 more damage , ooooooo . meanwhile , mobs are doubling in HP and damage out put .<P>I want to see existing spells made targetable . Such as Gather Shadows , and shadow sight . <P>Track corpse , dont let VI know its working , they might *fix* it .<P>I really hope I am not wasting my time , my money , my LIFE , trying to get a Necro up past 50 . Only to see my pet get creamed in one AoE boss spell , to give the darkest mana in norrath to the holy rollin cleric . <P>You need to fix casters post 50 , it really sucks to have the gameplay constantly depend on tank and healer . You guys do realize that what it all comes down to dont you ? Hello ? is this thing on ? <P> /ooc Level XX Necro LFG .<P>thought you guys could use a laugh . </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's not only that it's weaker than the 56th pet that's the problem, but the fact that it is absurd that a necromancer has to pay 1 peridot for a pet that is not significantly an upgrade.  Why necros have to pay 10 pp for a pet that is significantly weaker than the mage equivalent whereas the mage only has to pay 5 silver like all his pets is beyond me.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All of you make me SICK!!  Having read this list is completely pathetic, because if all of these changes were made, then you'd all sit back and cry, complaining that "we've been nerfed!"  There's NOTHING in this list that excites me...nothing to look forward to.  You're ASKING to be nerfed!?!?!?  I happen to really enjoy playing this class because of the soloing ability.  Sure, group friendly spells...no problem.  But lessen my ability to solo?  NO WAY!  Why not ask for new things to look forward to, as well as fixing the OBVIOUSLY broken things (defoilation and DMF in Kedge Keep.  Give us more control over our pets so we can actually USE them on raids.  I like the idea about making them resist fear, but let's also give them some means to be used in raids without them going beserk and causing trains.  I like the idea of landing taps on big mobs, but what about our other dots?  We have GREAT dots...dots that can not only dish out damage, but reduce the enemies effectiveness...let's get those less resisted!  Sure, enchanters can crowd control much better, but why should a necro remove ST from their list?  Should't we be able to help out an enchanter if they're overloaded with crowd control?<P>I just think it's sad that everyone thinks the necro is just so balanced already, that we're ready for nerfs.  We need lovin' too, just like every other class.  We need more variety in robes and looks for mid level necros.  I'm tired of seeing advisor/oracle/flowing black robes all over the place.  I want some truly evil looking equipment.  I want looks that can range from leather to chain to robes....with stats that apply to a necro (int, char, stamina, str).  I want more items to hold that contribute to the look a necromancer to have...how about that animated blade in your inventory screen? carrying one of those would be nice..and give it some good stats..make it a mid level quest item?  I'm tired of any decent look/equipment being on only the hard monsters in hard to get to places..mostly in dungeons that a necro won't do well because of pet issues that need to be fixed!<P>There are my thoughts...do with them as you will.<P>Vamphyrie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I want to apologize to the majority in this thread. When I read the list, I hit "reply" right away, thinking that this pathetic excuse for a list was what people were asking for. After taking the time to read all of the posts so far, I've come to realize that those in this thread are as COMPLETELY AGAINST this list as I am. It's Absor doing the lamest job I've ever seen anyone do. I'd almost prefer Abash-Me's responses over this backstab.<BR>Absor, you fit into the category that so many others at VI do...unless you're one of the nice classes (paladin, cleric), you don't need help. You seem to have this misguided idea that necros are too powerful, and want to share mana at an incredibly useless ratio. If your changes were to go into effect, our class would be worthless everywhere. I've read every one of these talk threads, and I've seen one common denominator: You only bring to the dev team what YOU think is appropriate. That's BS. You're NOT US. WE play this class...WE want changes. It's NOT up to you to determine what is appropriate for VI dev to know and not know when it comes to our concerns...especially when you're so BIASED.<P>Your list is junk. Start again. Read these threads and learn. I've made some suggestions as well. Want another? Give different looks to some of the pets all the way up. Why can't we have skeletal wolves, or ghosts, or ghouls. You want something akin to summon companion? How about summoning skeletal cyclops and such? Sure, mages can be the "pet class", but we're supposed to be a tight second.<P>AND GET RID OF THE ESSENCE EMERALD!!! Who in their right mind would give up exp at that level? It takes DAYS to get that kind of exp..who wants to give it to a necro so he can res someone, or do a 1k lifetap?? I don't care if the comp is changed to a 500pp comp...I'll just save my pennies..not beg around for someone to waste many hours of gameplay. Time to get to work, Absor...and this time, your job description DOES NOT include pissing off an entire class by substituting their concerns with your own biased thoughts!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Necros are not now nor have they been overpowered.  <BR>They were made to satisfy those that wished to solo. By "Nerfing them" Verant is saying solo is no longer an option.<BR>If Verant was really worried about classes being overpowered they wouldn't be giving UBER weapons to melee and UBER items to "other" classes.<P>For example I have seen Melee weapons prock 100-150 easily, couple 3-4 melee types with a cleric who has donals BP on and pick your MOB lets say a SoV Dragon in this case its dead meat.<BR> Now to see if its balanced lets put togther a different group lets say any combination of casters you want shoot lets say any 12 you want, now lets put this group up against this self same dragon who do you think will win? will they even get a spell to stick? <P>When you do this type of comparison, one would hope that you would come out with something equating to a group 1 would win 90% group 2 would win 80% or vice versa. However everyone knows thats not the case it would be more like 90% group 1 05% for group 2.  Now if that show that classes like Necros are Overpowered I'd like to see What they base this on.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ignite Bones: No prob here, just fix it so its the same 'size' despite how it appears.<P>DOT/Corpse Poof: This happens if a mem blur is cast after DOTs are stacked on something. The DOT becomes uncredited and if something is killed entirely by uncredited damage guess what happens... POOF<P>Lich Series: Your also forgetting that Root/Snare do not affect someone in lich form PLEASE fix this bug as well! If your gonna fix the HP:Mana conversion ratio then why not just increase the number of HPs it takes to the point when its reduced by PvP damage it would have done the same as you wanted. I do not believe I have ever seen an NPC use a lich form before so it wouldnt adversely affect the gameplay either I also dont like the ideas of getting free mana for HPs they SHOULD be losing but arent. I have to fight necros more often than not and its an unfair advantage they have.<P>Trucidation: Just scrap the spell. What necro has more than 1500 HP? An essense emerald why is this required? Come on make it use a non-lethal reagent or make it chain castable  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pet Fear Immunity: They should be immune to the 'Fear' line but not the 'Spook the Dead' line.<P>Coffin Availablity: Arent they available in Paineel?<P>59th level pet: I assume this is the Spectre pet we're talking about. Why not just make it dual wield even if it dont show the weapons. If not then make it triple or quad attack regularly.<P>Dead Man Walking: Great idea for a spell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Group DMF: Nice idea for a spell... Us druids already get group SOW, group Wolf Form, group Regen and Group Chloro long before any Necro would even get this spell (group version of a 44th level spell hasta be like level 52).<P>Temporary Animation: Good idea. When we are summoned as an animation will all our armor be on automatically? If not make it from 2 minutes to 5 or maybe even 10. Will we get xp loss for this second 'lethal damage'.

</FONT><HR>I wanted to go over the current list.<P>ITEM: Lifetaps.<P>DESCRIPTION: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. A necromancer uses these spells, at least in part, to fuel there mana transfer spells. Allowing them to land on the big encounters would make them much more useful for doing damage and for transferring mana, and would help them feel more useful in the final encounters on raids.<P>&gt;&gt; A necromancer can use them to fuel 'their' mana spells (the guy can't even properly spell.) What they can or cannot do does not equate to what they will do.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Mana transfer.<P>DESCRIPTION: If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change. Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana. Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>&gt;&gt; The Lich series does not have a bug. Mana transfer spells are too powerful. Please consider removing all the mana transfer spells. Absor, you are WRONG. Please NAME the Necromancers that would like to see this ratio raised.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Defoliation.<P>DESCRIPTION: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. <P>&gt;&gt; This spell is too powerful. Leave Lich alone, then maybe you can get rid of this too.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Lich Series.<P>This series of spells is working as intended. It will not be changed.<P>Other ideas for this line would be to allow it more stacking (with Clarity and Heal over Time spells).<P>There is also some question as to why there are two Lich spells at level 60.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>&gt;&gt; That looks better.<P>Additions to the list: one that could be related to the lifetap issue, is class-specific pure caster disciplines.

</FONT><HR>OK I just DoTted myself.. Because my Blood is BOILING.  Absor.. Do you take us all for morons?  If Lich is nerfed my necro is shelved..  But I supposed thats exactly what you guys at the brain trust known as VI wants eh?<P>And whoever said necros are not, or were never over powered, well yah we were.  Here is my theory:<P>Why do you think Kunark was made so freakin big?  *DING* if you guessed Jboots then you win.  Kunark is filled with a ton of useless travel but I digress, this is a necro discussion.<P>Necros OWNED pre50, still do.  Post 50 we are nothing.  I speak with Experience since my guild does all the Uber mobs regularly on Fennin Ro.<P>Buffer_01 tells you, "Dump me some mana"<BR>Guild_Officer shouts, "Necros dump the buffers, healers nukers!"<BR>---<P>53 Pet is good for nothing.  1 or 2 resisted fears == dead pet, sometimes == dead me, most times I FD (when it works aiiie) or zone.  He more downtime because I am low health and almost oom!<P>You have entered Old Sebillis.<BR>You shout, "54 Necro LFG"<BR>No_one_00 shouts, " "<BR>----<P>Here is a cluepon for Mr. Absor.  Night time only spells, not a bad idea, however VEIL OF XARN SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF THEM.<P>Defoliation, heh sweet I get to nuke a ton of stuff in PoG. Err no I cant.. eh?  By the time we get this spell most foliage is green to us thx for the offer.<P>Pets.. Oh where to start..  2 AEs (if I am lucky) and the pet is killed by Hoshkar (Re: VP).  53 Pet has about as much use as a stack of bone chips.  OH WAIT I KNOW, a new DAY time only spell..  BAG OF BONES.  This is where you toss bone chips at mobs and score critical hits all the time!  UBER and it only costs you 500mana per cast 20sec cast time, oh and did I mention that it requires an essence emerald?  Did I also mention it only works on Undead Gnomes?<P>Yes I know I'll get a lot of boos and hisses.. But this NEEDs to be addressed. The Necro Epic.  Nice stats, CRAPPY effect. And hard as hell to get.  Hard not in the sense that I dont have the fire power, hard in the sense that the LOOT TABLES are hosed and that some of our stuff doesnt drop. Yes I said DOESNT..  Kinda whack when there is like 2 of those cloaks on the entire server, RE: Fennin Ro the grand pappy of all servers.<P>Heh and how about those druids.. Yes yes I am straying from the topic again.. Or am I?  How 2 kite 4 raptors at a time thx info.<P>Know how many post50 spells I use right now? 3.  Deflux, Splurt and Pet (although its  usually 49 so it can tank a bit).  Out of roughly 16 post 50 spells I use 3.  THAT ROCKS!<P>Absor, I emplore you to take a closer look at what you are doing here.  I can kinda live with the way things are now.. Nerf lich and I quit, as will a few hundres others.. Yes we dont mean much in the EQ money machine but you can damn well bet that I wont be buying another VI game as long as I have my head firmly attached to my body.  VI has proven OVER AND OVER to NOT listen to their PAYING customers, and it looks really good when the apparent PR guy just white washed us with that pathetic list after going over reams and reams of posts saying mostly the opposite of what he intends to suggest.<P>Time to die an Absor_00, you have ruined your own lands, you will not ruin mine!<BR>You begin casting.<BR>Dooming Darkness has been resisted.<BR>You begin casting.<BR>Splurt has been resisted.<BR>Taunting attacker master.<BR>You begin casting.<BR>Fear has been resisted.<BR>Taunting att....<BR>You begin casting.<BR>****re falls to the ground.<BR>You begin casting.<BR>Your gate is too unstable.<BR>You beging casting.<BR>You may only cast Quivering Veil of Xarn at night!<BR>You begin casting.<BR>You may only cast Levant at night!<BR>You begin casting.<BR>You died.<BR>Absor_00 hits you for 324 points of damage.<BR>Absor_00 kicks you for 203 points of damage.<BR>Absor_00 becomes ENRAGED!<BR>Absor_00 hits you for 400 points of damage.<BR>Absor_00 hits you for 400 points of damage.<BR>Absor_00 hits you for 400 points of damage.<BR>Absor_00 hits you for 400 points of damage.<P>You have been beaten to a bloody pulpy mess resembling something, err make that, resembling nothing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What about the upgrades to Shadow vortex and steal strength.  Its seems to me that part of the necro design is to steal things from the mob for heself, then transfer various things to other PC.  At the low levels we can do this with health, mana, and strength.  At the higher levels it becomes mostly mana and sometimes strength.  Give us a upgrade to shadow vortex, steal strength, and lend strength.  Then add spell that allowed us to lend our AC to some one.  Now of course this brings up problems with soloing.  It also seems to me that you should having coding so you cant cast a spell on a pet???? If our lend armor can't be cast on pets how would that make us better soloers?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*A lengthy plea to the gods of Norrath*<P>   My suggestion is that you make the pets resistant to fear, because undead fear nothing; resistant to disease, because undead are supposed to use disease as a weapon, not be plagued by it (no pun intended); resistant to poison, because they have no blood or nervous system to attack.<P>  I know this is a fantasy world, and "realistic" is a term commonly thrown around, but - while we can throw out realism and suspend disbelief in a fantasy setting - inductive reasoning and logical associations should hold true.  <P>   As for the other points, here is what the necromancer really wants (in order of importance):<P>1) Lifetaps/lifetap dot's that work at least 51% of the time on major enemies.  This is our bread and butter line of spells.  If one spell line defines the necromancer, this is it.  Pets are great to have, but we'd be a mage if we wanted powerful pets.  God knows verant nerfed ours to near uselessnes.<P>2) One "get out of nerf free" card, whereby the necromancer class can play this card at their leisure, when they feel they are going to be nerfed unfairly (again).  Ok, maybe this is just a fun one. =)<P>The real #2) Risk/Reward re-evaluation.  Pet improvements and/or dot improvements to bring our damage output inline with the other classes in the game would help.  Necromancers can outdamage bards.  That's about it.  We are pure casters - pure casters devoted to EVIL!  We want to kill.  At this time, druids, clerics (/boggle), shaman, and every other unlikely class can humiliate us when competing for damage.  We do negligible damage in battles with mobs over level 55.  Our pets cause more trouble than they are worth in the planes.  We cannot safely visit more than three cities and an outpost without struggling for days with newbie quests, only to be beaten down by some unrelated faction within a city.  The risk/reward for necros is nowhere near balanced.  The necromancer class is the most persecuted.  Shouldn't there be a reward for all of our troubles?<P>3) If not #1 or #2, then at least a different role than mana battery.  There are two lines of spells most necromancers would prefer replaced by two new lines.  That being the mana transfer spells and the essence emerald spells.  Mana transfer spells are a waste!  Why convert my mana to a person with a role, when I should have a role myself?  This is just plain humiliating to necromancers who have struggled through 50+ levels of prejudice and hatred to end up dumping their hard-earned mana to the high elf wizard so he can get off another nuke, or the dwarven cleric so he can heal someone.  Humiliating!  We want a job after level 50.  Give us something we can do besides tailoring backpacks.<P>   Essence emeralds are too costly.  Plain and simple.  It's nice to have powerful spells, but why bother memorizing them if their cost is unbalanced.  Would anyone in their right mind sacrifice hours of their play time so someone can gain 1000 mana?  NO!  Make it targetable?  Heh... why not just give it to all other classes but necromancer and make it free for them to cast.  Who do you think will absorb the high pricetag on this spell?  You guessed it - the person who casts the spell, not the one who receives the mana.  But, again, this is another case of necromancer mana being useless, so we may as well give it away to someone with a role in the end game.<P>4) Group DMF.  This should be in the game anyway.  It has no balancing effect, as the group wouldn't be waiting on necromancer mana anyway.  Mana checks are for clerics, enchanters, and anyone else who has a role in the end game.<P>5)  Make plants plants.  Yes, a druid had a great point that humans are, indeed, animals, so they should be able to charm them, but this would be unbalancing.  Plants in PoG would not!  Necromancers don't do all that much in PoG or any decent high level zone, for that matter.  If we cannot kill plants with defoliation, then turn it into a disease based dd that works on any type of mob.  The damage/mana ratio is not any better than that of any other classes ratios.<P>6)  Stop calling us overbalanced and get someone to play a level 51+ necromancer for a couple of months.  With all the resources you have available to you, one would think you could pay someone to play a necromancer.  God knows it might come to that if we are nerfed any further.<P>7)  When you're holding an apple in one hand, please discard the butcher's knife in the other.  Not only have necromancers received the most nerfs since beta, we have also been cheated out of precious skills by giving us flashy utility spells that none of us use after a week.  Examples: voice graft, deadeye, track corpse (that just started working, 6 months after implementation, but is too annoying for anyone to want to use), chill bones (which has yet to drop on my server).<P>8) Make necromancers groupable with other necromancers.  One necromancer per raid is all that anyone wants since you cripple our class with unstackable spells that aren't even that powerful to begin with.  Ignite bones would be *decent* if more than one necro could cast.  DOT's would be ok if they worked on big mobs, stacked, and didn't poof corpses (which still happens).  Our healing spells (which have HORRIBLE ratios, by the way) would be nice if they didn't take so much of our life, stacked with people's buffs, and stacked with other necromancer's spells.  <P>    Plus, not only do our dot's not stack with our dot's, but many of our dot's are not compatible with ANY enchanter dot whether it is of a related sphere of magic or not.  Shaman get half of the same dot's as we, and they get them sooner.  Guess what?  They don't stack either.<P>   I realize that necromancers aren't meant to be the most "group-friendly" class in the game, but give us a role, PLEASE!  Let us be wanted in a group BEFORE the cr begins.  Let two of us group together and not have to waste half of our time coordinating what we're casting and when.<P>   I may have messed up the order a touch, but you can tell which of these is important to our class, and which would just be nice to have.  I suppose I should have said first, and foremost, we want to be needed again.  I recall being a level 50 necromancer (a couple months into final), entering lower guk and getting /tell flooded from people wanting me in their group.  Now, nearly level 60, I enter sebilis - the kunark equivilant of LGuk - and beg for hours before I can find a group if my guild has no openings in their camps.  Any other class can enter that zone and be immediately snatched up.  Let me repeat that last statement; ANY other class can enter sebilis and IMMEDIATELY find a group.<P>   That is a slap in the face to those of us who worked so hard and spent so much time, effort, and hard-earned money, only to have our frayed ends of sanity snap back in our faces as we realize how much of our lives we've wasted to become useless.  If I wanted to be useless, I would never have taken the time to level up; I would have just sat around and roleplayed and done newbie quests.   <P><BR>   I ramble.  Hopefully you will find one bit of usefull information in my post, Absor.  If so, please take it to heart when I tell you that these issues are very important to us as well as you.  You offer a product that should build in value and customer satisfaction as time progresses.  At this point, you are losing many customers because you have pigeon-holed the requests of 9% of your customer base (9% is close to, if not exactly, the amount of necromancer main characters in the game).  We built up our characters only to see their relative power diminish.  What is the point?<P><BR>    Please, just give us a role.  Mana battery is not a role.  Second-best pet caster is not a role.  Third-best dot'er is not a role.  Worst nuker is not a role.  Worst items degrades our role.  I could go on...<P><BR>    We want to be needed and useful again.  That's not so much to ask.<P><BR>Azrael Deadlight<BR>Lost Soldiers of Darkness<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The main reason you and others are most likely wanting the change, is that necromancers can solo extremely well and therefore level too fast.&lt;<P>Actually, the main drive for wanting it changed is because its broken.  Having a broken spell or game mechanic bugs me, and it means that we have to always have that broken spell in the back of our minds when we do things for necromancers.  Its a terrific pain when youre trying to make a working game to have a broken spell sitting there like that.<P>asm495 wrote:<P>&gt;Whatever happened to the suggestions for self-only ports to a few select locations, targetable FD, pets with abilities actually related to their con level, esssence emerald modification suggestions (so someone might actually use them) and some form off DD upgrade in the 50s?&lt;<P>Teleportation is not part of the Necromancer package.  Your pets are pretty good, but Ive listed the one pet that gained the most concern.  Essence emeralds are supposed to be hard to get.  Ill add a note to the two spells that use it that dont raise the dead that if we are going to leave them as they are, then perhaps a new component is a good idea.

But it will certainly be looked at.<P>As for the mana transfer spells, there is no reason to remove them.  If you folks dont like them, feel free not to use them.  I cant really understand why this is such a problem.  I have also listed your request that Lifetaps work on more NPCs.

I would be happy.&lt;<P>Actually, most of those items are on the list.  But Ill go over them again, and talk about the others.<P>&gt;1st - The general idea that our role is mana pumps. First most necro's here agree that its not in their character & they dont enjoy the role. Possible suggest would be to make it like the old mana stone spell - but make it targets hit points to targets mana. ** (This would be better than what is suggested but shouldn't be the necro's only role during a raid) ** &lt;<P>Ive already explained that with the broken Lich series, mana transfer will not be getting better.  Whether or not this is something that you like to do, its still a viable spell, and works nicely as is.  Heh, no, were not going to make necromancers into living Manastones.  Those stones were removed for a reason.<P>&gt;2nd - Fearless pets and or fear resist spell. This was given to mages. Umm shouldn't this be given to necro to improve their function in a group. Make it so they could cast on mages pets. Give mages the ability to summon weapons tor ways to make pets more effective. (more in character) &lt;<P>Mages will always have the most functionality with their pets.  But youll note that giving this spell to Necromancers is on my list.<P>&gt;3rd - Castable feign death and/or group feign death. &lt;<P>Ive covered the reason this isnt on the list above.<P>&gt;4th - Damaging bosses with lifetaps (prob #1)<BR>why is this such and issue with the poor overall damage compared to other classes. &lt;<P>Already on the list.<P>&gt;5th - The issue dealing with the cost of summon corpse since SK's now have the ability. Spell is mainly used during raids which are done by 46+ chars so shouldn't we get the replacement spell before 57th. &lt;<P>Why does the ability of SKs to cast this spell mean that you should get the better spell earlier?  Im confused by this.<P>&gt;6th - Lich has been the way it is for quite some time. If changed it prob wouldn't effect higher levels who can't solo anymore due to reduced mobs. I don't feel I should have to sell out my younger brothers just to be able to group post 54. I would perfer just to let them be and enjoy the game the way i did pre 50th. An retire my char.&lt;<P>This has nothing at all to do with soloing.  I dont know where anyone got that idea.  The spell IS broken, thats all.<P>asmodiuss wrote:<P>&gt;Did you even read the thread absor? You posted the "Track Corpse spell is broken" thing again.&lt;<P>And this leads me to ask, did you even read my post?  I stated clearly at the beginning that I am going to update the Status section later, that I wanted to start with the full list.  It just so happens that the spell was fixed after I started making the list.<P>&gt;That seriously ticks me off that it appears that you did not read the entire thread.. &lt;<P>*sigh*<P>Sayleth said:<P>&gt;Servant of Bones and Emissary of Thule are incredibly rare.&lt;<P>Added, thanks.<P>soluis wrote:<P>&gt;it seems that you didn't even listen. why did you bother? leave lich, fix taps, improve our pet. that is what we want. everything else is just window dressing &lt;<P>*sigh*<P>Im confused again.

I fully expect the team to decide not to change it.  But its broken, so its on the list.<P>Other than that, everything youve asked for is on the list.

</FONT><HR>Some things I'd like to point out regarding <BR>necro pets:<P>Everyone remembers the dagger delay bug, where essentially the pet would have the delay of whatever the weapon was when hitting.<P>This was left alone.<P>The magicians then realized that their pets were NOT dual wielding. (despite Veran't claim that they were)<P>They fixed dual wielding magician pets by enabling them to wield weapons to get the dual wielding to kick in.<P>Verant realized that this was a horrible thing, essentially now the magician pets would now be able to take advantage of the dagger delay bug.<P>An earth pet with a dagger delay bug? No way no how.<P>Sooo, the fixed the dagger delay bug (you knew it existed and left it alone till you realized what would be next)<P>Uber earth pets. <P>Anyways, the necromancer community was up in arms, and rightly so, a facet of their class had been destroyed.<P>Fine. Then we have warriors constantly complaining they are being outdamaged by pets.<P>Fine. Give them crits make them have more MR etc etc.<P>Rogues were a sick joke, everyone would snicker behind a rogues back because his class had been neglected. NOBODY, and I mean nobody wanted to play a rogue or have one in their group.<P>Fine. Verant fixed rogues and no we have tons of rogues coming out of the woodwork. Can you guess why?<P>Game balance is so lopsided it's not funny. I know of MULTIPLE people who have 44ish necros parked permantly, stripped of gear while they work on their warrior or rogue.<P>Right now as a previous poster said, you're out of luck if you're not one of the holy trinity.<P>Cleric Warrior Enchanter<P>A lot of the current state of the Necromancer class is a direct result of that dagger delay bug.<P>I can't remember what it was you did to appease<BR>the necro community at the time, but It must have been insignificant and hardly a fair tradeoff for what they lost.<P>(If I could take a guess it would that mana transfer spell, I remember a blurb about making necros more group friendly.)<P>I don't know what the current solution would be regarding lich (even though you've said it was most likely to be left alone by the dev team.)<P>But here comes time for the necro to get a final balancing and you're throwing lich down as the one thing we need to trade off to get other improvements. <P>Sorry, again this is a case of a programming mistake that became an inherit class trait.<P>You don't wipe out these class traits and offer<BR>a mana transfer spell as a replacement.<P>It won't fly, and shouldn't fly.<P>Point of the matter is, NO mana transfer spell is going to compensate for the last decent thing the necromancer class has going for them.<P>I encourage you to create a necro of say level 50.<P>And go through each spell and see what it does.<BR>Visit EQ Necro, the have an excellent synopsis<BR>of each and every spell and how useful it is.<P>See if it can't be replaced to make the necromancer a viable character post 50.<P>Mana transferring is an not a viable role.<P>The ability to generate mana is the bane of the bard's existence. (I won't get into the bard problems) But essentially every bard out there has<BR>the sad role of just playing ONE song to appease other players.<P>No self respecting necro WILLINGLY wants this thrust upon their class. It's akin to somebody saying  "Step aside necro, I'll slay the dragon while you bandage me and make sure my boots are shiny."<P>Nobody wants to a 3rd class player. It's not fair, and more importantly, it's not what we signed up for when we created the class.<P>It slowly evolves into that. Before 50, necro's and druids for that matter have a good time.<P>After 50, it becomes blantantly obvious that every<BR>mob was designed with FoH in mind, thus causing reliance on people to do crowd control and heal excessively. This leaves 4 other slots to be filled. So then it becomes a study on who can do more for the party.<P>A class that casts slow acting dots and can't take a hit and folds like a wet noodle when his pet goes down?<P>A class that can buff and heal party members?<P>A class that can take hits and keep the mobs off the enchanter and cleric?<P>You know how the rest of the breakdown goes.<P>We've all thought of it (necromancers) and we know<BR>our role is not appealing to other classes, we can contribute so much, but then it becomes obvious that there are better choices than us.<P>Again, Mana not transfer is not what we want to be here for. There are items in game that were removed that did the same thing.<P>What really needs to be done is fix the entire post 50 line so that we are group friendly, so that we can play a new role. (other than mana transfer)<P>I hope you read this Alan, as our necromancers are important to us, and I'm sure not many of can stomach creating another character again.<P>I don't have the answers for the necromancer class, but at know how the endgame is going to be for him if things continue in their current progression.<P>It will either be I keep him parked to get items for friends, or I just cancel the account and wait for a game that allows me to be useful <BR>and have fun.<P>As more release dates loom, I can promise you<BR>that many necromancers and other classes that are not part of the holy trinity are going to stop fighting this battle with Verant and just move on.<P><BR>Buggwin of Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for the reply, and for taking the time to read the posts.  If the changes you have listed are implemented, I believe that they will indeed increase our value in the post 50 game.<P>However, there were two things that you missed, one rather major one.<P>First is the big one, and the one that we've really been calling for: some fast-acting post 50 dots.  If the mobs we fight are dead in 30 seconds, our dots simply have no time to be effective.  Give us one or two that do good damage in a short period of time.<P>Remember Venom of the Snake, necromancers?  Remember how great that spell was when you first got it? Something like 600 damage in 49 seconds?  A post-50 version would be nice; make it an upgraded version, maybe around 1200 damage in 40 seconds.  Fast, powerful, deadly, and actually useful on raids.<P>Another good and interesting idea was the reverse Splurt; does a high amount of starting damage, but does less with each tick.  First tick it does maybe 600, then 350, then 200, then 100, then 50, then 25, then 10.<P>One other one that was mentioned in several posts but I didn't see addressed was an Screaming Terror upgrade or two.  Nothing impressive enough to step on the enchanter's toes, but something that could supplement his role or act a bit better as emergency crowd control when the enchanter isn't around.<P>Personally, this is a niche that I think could be promising for necromancers in groups, especially in the mid-levels, like in the level 40 - 49 range.  As it is, groups tend to follow the idea that "if we can't get a cleric for a healer, we can make due with a druid / shaman," yet clerics are far preferred with that role, and have no trouble getting groups. Why not make it so that "if we can't get an enchanter for crowd control, we can make due with a necromancer?" Enchanters would still be far preferred, as they would still get better, longer lasting mezzes, but we could supplement that slot if need be.<P>Thank you for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000779-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000779&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000779&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
