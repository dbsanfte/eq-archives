</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>One thing that was repeated over and over as a problem, yet I did not see on the list is the hit/miss ratio.  On upper blues, blacks, or higher cons I miss very frequently.  I have not played a warrior or ranger in the 50's so I cannot vouch for their ratio's, but could you please check all melee/hybrids and see if this ratio is where it should be?  I miss quite frequently on greens as well, which I think should be a lot better than it is.<P>Once again lots have asked, and it appears it will be looked into, about the 1H and shield combination.  I just recently aquired one of the top 5 best 2H weapons in the game overall, and probably the 2nd best paladin useable 2H weapon.  Please don't discourage me from using this weapon as it was very difficult to get.  Besides that I am a dwarf and dwarfs in RP terms should be using Axes, which is what this weapon is.<P>Crits/cripples should be an innate ability to the paladin, perhaps at 16 (similar to Rangers being able to dual wield at 17), perhaps that is too early to give that to us.  But by level 35 I would think this should be standard, and perhaps every level after 50 increases the chance to do crit/cripple, since afterall we should be the masters of slaying the undead melee style.<P>I personally do not want the SOLE reason that I am invited to a raid to be to die for someone else.  This would be a great aid for us in groups in sticky situations, but in the big raids I don't want to be asked just come to the raid....target someone, take 1/2 their damage, and die.  That's silly and would be no fun at all, and I bet almost %100 of the time if you have to be within melee range the combination of their 1/2dmg and the AE's are going to get you.  Most likely they would make deaths from this permenant with no chance of getting exp back.  Don't get me wrong I am usually the one that falls first because I try to save the group at all cost's, but I think we need something else for the major raids.  Something more along the lines of being a KNIGHT perhaps?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>True I would like to hit more offen, and do more damage, but I dont think incressing our offense skills is going to help that much. If I understand it correctly at 60th lvl a Paladin has the same offense skill as a 50th lvl Warrior, if this is correct than I am happy with it. What I think we need to look at is the lack of good weapons for us. A quick trip to Eq-Lizer gives us the following numbers.<P>1H Blunt                   2H Blunt<P>Warrior 1                   3<BR>Ranger 1                    2<BR>Bard 1                      0<BR>ShadowKnight 3              2<BR>Paladin 1                   1<P>1H Slash                  2H Slash<P>Warrior  9                 12<BR>Ranger   12                2<BR>Bard     5                 0<BR>ShadowKnight  10           10<BR>Paladin  6                 8<P>Totals for Class only weapons (I have added Missile and Piercing class only weapons to this list to show how wide the gap in class weapons realy is.)<P>Warriors 34<BR>Rangers  29<BR>Bards    15<BR>ShadowKnights 31<BR>Paladins 18<P>As a secondary tank, our equipment is what keeps us alive, but this lack of good weapons is whats causing a lot of our offense problems. <P>This number is really a lot lower than 18 when you look at the drop rates and weapons removed from the drop tables. FA/FD, Nature's Defender (please put it back in), Blutcherblock Hammer, Zephyrwind (still not fixed yet), Halcyon Broadsword (according to a poll on PoN only about 12 have drop on all servers), Rod of Mourning (only 1 to 2 per Server). So by removing these weapons it drops the total number of Paladin only weapons down to 11, that is lower than the number of Bard only weapons and the lowest of any Tank class by more than half.<P>This is a very serious issues and needs to be reviewed and fixed.<P>What I think would make a huge diffences to the Paladin class is to have all our spell casting times reduced, we are trained to be able to cast in the middle of combat, this is one of our best functions, a quick life saving low HP heal, giving the Clerics time to cast their long casting time CH, could make all the diffrance in a big battle or raid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The new dscipline idea is horrid and would be a lame discipline.  If clerics won't heal us now why would they heal us if we got this ????????<BR>Take a death for the Team sure ya whatever. Let me hide in the corner and take half damage for ya bud and not be healed oh i forgot we get the really neeto new healing spell whats that 110 hp a tick wow thanks and if im fully buffed Lame On Hands may heal me to half.<P> No mention of offense being raised at all on our list but alas on the the ranger post you mention defense. Sure they need defense I can see they do just like I can see that we need OFFENSE.<P>Basically from these posts i see that class balance isnt the issue.  I figure that someone at Verant  must want to make a Hybrid (Lord knows why) and your obviously gonna make life easier on them.  <P>Pal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I wanted you to take note of this:<P>I'm glad you're considering Yaulp 4 for us at 59.<P>My problem with yaulp is it does NOT stack with Talisman of Altuna, Talisman of Kragg, and Major Shielding (off stave of shielding).<P>Could you please make it stack? I see no good reason why it shouldn't.<P>Also, what the others are saying is true, we miss an AWFUL LOT.  Raising our offense and weapon skills to 235 I don't think would be too much would it?  <P>Lastly, I'm glad you're considering adding crits to undead all the time - but IMO, it at least should be at the same rate as warrior crits - or even higher.  We are supposed to excel at killing undead - but our undead nukes take too long to cast.<P>Here's my idea on that from before:<BR>Add a new spell or two for 55+ paladins that would do 300-500dmg for 150-200 mana with a 1.0 to 2.5 second  casting time thereby being useful in combat and not wasting melee swings.  If you want to make sure we are in combat while using  such spells, just shorten the range of the spells to melee range.  For flavor, consider allowing paladins to have a chance (regular  warrior % chance) for critical and crippling hits vs. undead all the time at level 60 (or 50+ if you're feeling generous or "flavorful"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ).   Another neat idea is to add a spell similar to Divine Might at around lvl 55 (that would not stack with it) that would make us randomly proc a LOW resist 250-400 dmg vs. undead.<BR>Keep in mind how little undead there are around.<P>Last BIG issue that was not mentioned(imo):<P>- Root and Enstill - we get Root at lvl 22, Enstill at lvl 54.  Enstill is never used by Paladins because of the longer casting time - the fact that Enstill has a *potential* longer holding time is not enough of a  consideration for paladins in groups, and does not outweigh the longer casting time and increased mana cost.<P>Solution:  Consider replacing Enstill with Immobilize.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here's my thing..us pallys are last when it comes to damage...i think druids have better offensive skills the us..honestly.  the ideal pally is a swd and shield but yet our epic and SF are both 2hs.  *** is up with that ..why not make the pally epic a 1hs. so we can atleast use a swd and shield.  cause a 2hs is useless in the hands of a pally.  hell i think a 2hs would work better in a wizzy's hands then a pally.  you say our roll is defense yet you make us wield a 2hs and lose the shield inturn less defense for our epic.  hell why not make a shield epic for that matter.  anything but a 2hs.  i didn't even start to use a 2hs till 34 and that was only because i found out the epic was 2hs. the gb and shield is a perfect pally role.  why screw it up with a 2hs epic.  we can't damage as is..then you go and make it worse by takeing away what little defense we got by makeing a 2hs epic.  nice going!  i'd like to thank the moron who thought of that.<P>lvl 35pally that no longer plays cause pallys got the biggest shaft in the game.  and to anyone who thinks that there class needs work.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I, and *many* others, had raised the point of the woefully inadequate damage output of high-level paladins.<P>This DOES NOT APPLY to those under 50.  Read me: your damage is fine.  You do less than others, but it is not HALF what a warrior does.<P>Post 50 the paladins low weapon AND offense caps make each level increase a cruel joke as you fall further and further in your ability to hit a higher-con mob.<P>If these are items that you are bringing to the development team (without promising ANY changes), why isn't the request for offensive increases on your list?<P>If a silly transfer damage ability and bash increases are the result of this 'balancing' I strongly suggest all paladins either completely quit this game now, or go make up a warrior or rogue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is some info I pulled from the SK posting, they look like they might have some effect on us. We can only hope so..<P>ITEM: Shield Procs.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about a few shadowknight and paladin only shields that proc on a successful bash?<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item at this time.<P>---<P>ITEM: Casting Times.<P>DESCRIPTION: Now that there is no longer a weapon delay for hybrids when casting, there is one other thing that bears looking into. It seems that many hybrid spells have a longer casting time than those of the parent spell. In the case where a spell takes, say, 4 seconds to cast and the weapon takes 2 seconds to swing,<BR>casting a spell will still delay the swing of the weapon. The weapon will not swing until the spell is done, so the hybrid loses one attack when casting. This is certainly faster than it was before, though. Either allow the swing during the spell casting, or reduce the casting time (or at least turn them down to the same casting time as the parent spell).<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Spell Review.<P>DESCRIPTION: Now is probably a good time to review all hybrid spells. Look at the level, type, effectiveness and mana cost for shadow knight spells.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Archery.<P>DESCRIPTION: Maybe increase their skill cap on archery. Perhaps giving shadow knights an archery increase and a similar increase in something for paladins (disarm… I dunno what).<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Shield-based discipline.<P>DESCRIPTION: While we're talking about shields, perhaps shadowknights could get a more defensive discipline based on shield use.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Hit Points.<P>DESCRIPTION: Another way to make the shadow knight (and/or paladin) more defensive (and, really, more offensive as well) would be to raise their hit points.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Bash Skill Cap.<P>DESCRIPTION: Raising knights cap on bash to match warriors would add little 'power' to the class, but would help justify their use of shields.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Better Shield Use.<P>DESCRIPTION: Along the lines of increasing the shadowknight's (and paladin's) defensive ability, how about the addition of some skill that makes shields more useful for them. A shield block skill or something that would add AC. So if the character has a 100 Shield Block skill he might get a 10% increase on his ability to use a shield, so that a 10 AC shield would be worth 11 AC in his hands (figure out the balance and numbers to be more realistic…)<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Better Shield Stuns.<P>DESCRIPTION: As a way to improve the value of shadowknights in the higher level game, perhaps they could have a special stun ability with their shield bash. Either as a discipline or just as a part of the nature of the class, their shield bashes would to stun things (maybe even 0 duration, only for spell interruption) that are normally not stunable.<P>STATUS: None<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Paladins early train their 1hs and 2hs waepon skills as most pali weapons are of those categories. it costs too much to develop 1hb.

</FONT><HR>Duh.  What about offensive concerns?<P>We need more 1hs weapons with better damage/delay.<P>Sheesh, has Verant ever even looked at the damage output of a pally vs. any other tank?  We're not talking 25% less damage right now...it's more like 50% or less.<P>We can't take 50% more damage than other tank classes so why should we do 50% or less damage.<P>Our defensive capabilities are MARGINALLY better than many tanks, yet our offensive capability, partly due to skill levels and largely due to the fact that we can't duel wield is way out of whack.<P>I suspect the reason why Verant hasn't provided any numbers to suggest rough percentages of damage that classes should do as compared to each other is because Paladin damage is way out of whack--and anyone who says differently either isn't paying attention to their text window or can't count.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, even if these ideas are actually implemented I still dont see any chance a Paladin will be valuable on raid.  The idea that we will take half damage of a party member is useless.  Maybe if would could replace a party member by taking all the mobs off them we would have some worth to casters.  Yes, we may die in the process but part of being a Paladin is being willing to sacrifice yourself for the good of the group.  This ability would be priceless to an enchanter trying to get a mez off, or a caster attempting evac, or even a cleric attempting to heal the party.<BR>Overall though, we still can't fight our way out of a paper bag.  Who needs Paladins, when a mages pet will outdamage us and take min exps from the group?!<P>Jaybartu</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I am a 51 cavalier and I miss over 60 percent of the time when fighting even some high green mobs! You brought up pretty much everything else us paladins said but please bring up the fact that we are getting frustrated with our piss poor offense. And the fact that Shadow Knight and rangers have such a better choice in 1hs and 2hs weapons then we do. Exp the SK why does the sk have way better 1hs to choice from then we do?? And why does a lvl 46 necro pet do WAY more damage then I do! That is very unbalanced and I want to see some changes in Necro! Necros are way to powerful and Verant knows it! I just hate it when someone pet is a BETTER TANK then I am.

Pardon me, a level 50 with no dual wield, crits, or disciplines.<P>Anyway, you've illustrated the problem perfectly.

</FONT><HR>Paladins are warriors without the offense, but spells instead. Should be exact same hp/ac/defensive skills.<P>We should get the same riposte, parry, dodge and defense skills of a warrior. Same amount of hitpoints too. Our 55 Discipline is the most horrible piece of crap I have ever seen. I like the idea for the discipline where every round of melee we automatically bash, and it would hit, for 10 seconds or so. Another thing is our stuns. They don't work on mobs over 55! Change that please! At least give us a stun that can stun any mob, regardless of race/level. It could be a level 56 spell. We are supposed to be the ultimate undead killer? Why not give us crit/crip against undead all the time after level 55 or so? Make it more frequent than warriors, too, since we are supposed to be the ultimate undead killers. Our offense is fine, we cant melee well, do same damage output of a shadowknight, we are not supposed to be able to do much melee damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gelaen-Morell, you and the others need to understand we are never going to be frontline Tanks.. VI has made that clear time and time again, so lets go after something they will give us. Better shields, more skill/abilites with them. Better Drop rates on our weapons, Spells that will help on Raids.. We have to hit the same things over and over or they are not going to listen to us. We can request and ask they look into our Hit-to Miss ratio, but remember we use a diffrent "tohit" table than warriors do. So even if we had the same skill lvls we would not be hitting for the same amount or the same % they do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>These seem like they should take the highest priority:<P>Both Offensive Skills and Defensive Skills seriously need to be evaluated.<P>Superior Healing needs to be moved to 54, and give us a spell like Remedy at 57. Before level 50 we could be useful backup healers for groups. Now, with every mob hitting for 120+ , a 270 hp heal has little worth. <P>Celestial Cleansing: Utterly worthless. The only time this spell could be useful is when someone needs that 110 hps ASAP, but ummm, like I said before, kunark and velious mobs hit for 120+ .<BR>Drop celestial cleansing and put celestial healing in its place.<P>Please try to explain to me when revive could be ever be useful.  I doubt you can.  Point is, this spell should have been given to us at an earlier level when it might have had SOME benefit.  I dont see why giving us the 50% exp rez in the lower 50's would be even remotely unbalancing either.  LOL, come to think of it, this spell would probably never be used except on ourselves when we cant get a REAL rez from a cleric.  I dont think anyone would accept a 50% exp when they could just ask the cleric that sits next to me to rez em instead.  So:<P>Examine the possibility of giving us the level 39 cleric rez in the lower to mid 50's.<P>We have had to work so much harder to get to level 50.  We have to work so much harder to get to level 60.  We damn well deserve some changes that will make us USEFUL in the 50+ world; both with pickup groups, and raids. <P>Ashran Trueblade<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My opinion on this..<P>"ITEM: White Armor and Shield.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.<P>STATUS: None"<P>- Who cares?  I believe with the right euqipment, you can easily get the "Holy Knight" look.<P>==============================================<P>"ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS: None"<P>- Interresting yes. What would really be interresting is to find out if you guys actually code this correctly so that it's useful.<P>This would, on the other hand, be a very nice spell. But for a disc, Paladins and Shadowknights alike can agree, we need a version of the warrior's Defensive disc.<P>=========================================<P>"ITEM: Deepwater Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<P>STATUS: None"<P>- I'm happy with the armor, all in all. Just the Breastplate could use an upgrade to match the utility of the spells the other hybrids got. Or remove the component needed for the current effect of "Symbol of Naltron"<P>==============================================<P>"ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<P>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It would be nice to make them look fancier.<P>STATUS: None"<P>- In my opinion, it's not "NEEDED" to balance the class.<P>=============================================<P>As mentioned before in this thread. A small upgrade to offense, and 1h slash skill is needed. I land a hit a good 50% of the time on -low- blue cons. On "uber-mobs" it goes down to 20-25%. This is pitiful in my opinion.<P>============================================<P>All in all though, very nice work!!

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for Posting. We now have something with which to work on.<P>Paladins are "Defensive Tanks"<P>A tank is a big moblie gun with armour. It *Does* a *Huge* amount of *Damage*, But can *Take* only *Medicore* amount of *Damage*. (any old peasant with a Bazooka can take one out)<P>What we really are is sand bags - but without the sand. We are *supposed* to take the damage but we don't have the ability to give any back.<P>To make us into Defensive Tanks you only need the following.<P>-----<P>Offensive:<P>Dont need an increase in Offensive skill - but 10 extra points would be nice.<P>We DO NEED to have the Hit/Miss table changed though. We are Warriors, why don't we have the Warrior Hit/Miss table?<BR>Reasoning - get a Warrior and a Paladin at lvl 31 with exactly the same weapons. Both will have the same skill level but the Paladin will miss 50-60% of the time, the Warrior only 10-20% of the time.<P>Criticals/Crippling Blows vs Undead from lvl 1.<BR>Reasoning - We are Warriors. Undead are supposed to be our "Main Adversory". Even with our Spells a Warrior will "Out Damage" us. Crits/Cripple should be at the same rate as a Warrior.<P>Better "Class only" weapon selection.<BR>Reasoning - This way you can give us better weapons without having to worry about the "Balance" issue of Duel Wielding.<P>Make our "Holy Weapons" No Drop.<BR>Reasoning - Will stop Twinking and Farming. It will also cause Paladins to work for their Holy Weapons. Ever done the GhoulBane camp and had to watch as as the "non-Paladin" wins the roll and sells it?<P>-----<P>Defensive:<P>Defensive Skill increase is nice.<P>Shield Blocking Skill is needed.<BR>Reasoning - If its a Discipline then you FORCE Paladins to use a Shield. If all shield (or Bash) capable Classes have the skill then it is Their Fault for not using a Shield.<P>Parry Skill increase by 15 points.<BR>Reasoning - This is a Defensive Skill. 15 Points will not be better than a warrior but will only close the gap<P>Riposte Skill increase by 10 points.<BR>Reasoning - This is a Defensive/Offensive Skill. The extra damage will never be comparable to the Warrior output. 10 Points will not be better than a Warrior but will only close the gap<P>Armour Class needs to be raised.<BR>Reasoning - Quote "Paladins have the second best AC in the Game". Paladins have only a small advantage on Rangers with AC but are far behind a Warrior. Increase the Effect that Cleric/Paladin (Holy) AC buffs have on a Paladin's AC by 10%.<P>Hit Points need to be raised.<BR>Reasoning - In able to "Absorb" Damage we need something to absorb it with. At lvl 50+ a Warrior will have up to 100% extra HP than a Paladin. Close the gap by 50-25%.<P>-----<P>Magic:<P>Stun needs to be effective on a post lvl 55 Mob.<BR>Reasoning - The only spell consistantly used in Combat is Stun. Stun has no Interupet effect on lvl 55+ Mobs. Make it so Stuns effect these Mobs by interupting Spells ONLY, i.e. no movement loss.<P>Stacking needs to be implemented.<BR>Reasoning - With all the New Spells out there we have NO stackable spells, even our quest spell no longer stacks. Make all the Unique spells stackable with all other spells.<P>Mana penalty needs to be removed.<BR>Reasoning - We will never have the Mana Pool available or the spells needed to "Out Heal" a Cleric.<P>Fizzle penalty needs to be removed.<BR>Reasoning - Fizzling Stun with a remarkable consistancy when trying to interupt a spell is bad, especially when you have been using it for 20 levels.<P>LoH needs to be upgraded post lvl 50.<BR>Reasoning - Post lvl 50 there is a HUGH difference in HP between a Warrior and anyone else. For LoH to be Effective in any situation as a "Life Saver" it needs the same modification that happened at lvl 41 to happen at lvl 51 but with a greater effect.<P>-----<P>Disciplines:<P>HolyForge, either:<BR>1) Scrap it.<BR>2) Increase Duration to 20 mins.<BR>3) Make it Hit and Crit/Cripple every swing for 20secs.<BR>4) Reduce the recycle time to 30 mins and increse the number of "Undead" in Raids.<BR>5) Reduce HolyForge to lvl 30 so we can still find some Undead we can use it on.<P>We need a Defensive Discipline.<BR>Reasoning - We are Defensive, HolyForge is Offensive. Make a Discipline that will Parry every blow for 18 secs.<P>We need a Raid Discipline by/at lvl 55.<BR>Reasoning - We actually want to be invited on a raid before lvl 60. (The defensive one at lvl 55 would do)<P>Resistance Discipline needs the timer set to the same as a Warrior of the same level.<BR>Reasoning - Paladins are magical by nature. After using magic for 51 levels surely we must be able to "Shield" ourselves as well/often as a non-caster.<P>-----<P>Quests:<P>You said you will open a seperate Discussion for that so I will wait till then.<P><BR>-----<P>I will have missed something, but I am sure someone else will say it.<P>I have tried to put only the things I feel would make a "real" difference to the paladin class. A lot of the other suggestions are also quite excellant but I won't repeat them here.<BR>For those I did repeat - sorry - but I did not read all the replies.

</FONT><HR>Karlstrom, attacking one of the most noble and respected old school paladins, is not the best way to get your point accross. We all know we have issues with the damage output of Paladins, but VI HAS put us in secondary tank roll, that is not going to change.. ever! We have to look at what is going to make us the best support tank in the game, and thats what this topic is all about.<P>I really dont think this Class balance posts are going to balance up the classes, but balance out the groups. So we have to look at what does a Paladin bring to a group and work off that.<P>I really dont care to read warrior-like posts about how we can not solo a Mages pet. I know I can't but I know my group can.. EverQuest is about grouping and that also will never change..<P>So can we try and keep down the venting and flames and work together to make our class the best VI will allow us to..<P>thanks..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Asking Absor to put Offense on the list doesn't have to do anything with greed. This is just a list with topics they will discuss and it may be that none of those suggestions get implemented.<P>And I still believe that our dmg output should go on that list and that Verant should look into it. And from the posts here it looks like offense is an issue for many Paladins.<P>Personally if I could ask for one enhancement alone, it would be a better dmg output and not more defense. I think the amount we do less damage than all other meelee classes is just out of proportion, especially since bringing down mobs fast helps a lot more than tank a little bit better. I'm not asking to bring us on par with Rangers or Warriors, but the gap really seems to be too big.<P>Mihoshi, Lvl 58 Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, It just takes Three Things.....<P>All in all a good effort. I'm sure it wasn't easy.<P>Based on what I've been reading, and I've read A LOT of what's been posted, it sounds like you could do THREE things and make us all pretty happy in general.  While there are lots and lots of issues, it sounds like THREE things could fix the majority of them.  <P>Unfortunatley, You only mentioned two of them in your post.<P>OFFENSE<P>Improve our Offense!!  Enough said, it's already been posted 1000 times. Let us FIGHT, not just use up stamina by fanning the mob.<P>BASH/STUN<P>Allow us to bash and stun mobs at ALL levels to interupt casting. Make us the best at it. Give us Crits, shields that proc, etc. We are the only ones that use it. Give us a DEFINING stun spell (not just a rehashed Cleric parent spell) that will make us wanted and active participants in raids at upper levels.  It will take skill to apply it just right, like a well placed Bash. We don't have to stop their attacks, just have a good chance of interupting their spell casting. Sounds like that would get us invited on raids.<P>***Get the Pally, he can keep him from gating!!***<P>Instead of<P>***Take another warrior, the Pally's useless***<P>We're not going to replace warriors, but make it so the group would like to have at least one of us along!<P>And give us Crits/Crips on Undead.  <P>Do those three things, and just fix the issues that aren't working as they were intended to begin with, and all in all I think you'd see a happy bunch.....JMHO.<P>As for the Better Taunt capability, not worth a flip if all I do is stand there and get hit more without being able to attack back. Only good if you increase Offense also and by increasing Offense you will naturally increase Taunt. Just increase Offense and problem is solved.<P>Blocking to take damage for someone else. I don't like the idea of cowering in the corner, taking damage for a caster and not being able to actively participate in the conflict.  We want to FIGHT!!  We are KNIGHTS, not cowards.

</FONT><HR>"Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and the design was that they would be better at defense than offense. But in making any adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than a warrior."<P>First, I should define what I think of as a tank.  A tank is something that can take massive amounts of damage and still pack a punch offensively. Some people incorrectly believe that a tank is strictly a damage taker.<P>I believe we (pally/sk) should receive all defensive skills of a warrior and cap at max (defensively) just like a warrior. Our spells can then be used to push us beyond the warrior in defense (only enough to make up for the lack of offensive ability). <P>I do not believe that our offense should be raised, but that we SHOULD be the best damage takers in the game.  Warriors (like humans) are the standard, so they should never be the best at anything, but should be able to do everything well. They will still be the best tanks in the game, but the Pallys/SKs should noticably surpass them in ability to take damage.<P>If a monk is 70% offense and 30% defense, as compared to the warrior (being the standard) at 50%-50%. Why would it unbalance the game to have a pally be 30% offense and 70% defense and an SK 40% offense and 60% defense?<P>We are, after all, protectors/knights... this would define our class. Warriors would still have their role as the best tank because they aren't limited to offense OR defense.

How come all pure melees get equally maxed skills (252/252/250), yet hybrids are taken down the path of a "choice" of being offensive or defensive?<P>A Ranger at 60 is a MUCH better class than a paladin.  A Ranger's defensive deficiencies only manafest themselves when they and their group let the ranger hold aggro.<P>A paladin's glaring weakness is ALWAYS a detriment.<P>There is NO ROOM in EQ for second best at a skill (tanking) that DOES NOT STACK.  Offense stacks.  Two rogues outdamage a rouge and a ranger.  Do two paladins outtank a paladin and a monk.  No.<P>Unless massive revisions are made to the paladin class, it can not be balanced at 60 without offensive improvements.<P>You are still 'ahead of the curve' as far as levels go.

It will take longer to kill the MOB but they combo will be able to stay in the fight much longer due to the ability to taunt and heal.<P>In the pally/monk combo, the lack of HP/AC that the monk provides will be made up by the ability to finish the MOB quicker (and letting the mob do less damage)<P>As the game currently stands, the pally/monk combo is more efficient.  There are two ways to correct this.  Increase the pally's offense or his defense.  If the offense is increased all that will be accomplished is the blurring of the distinction between classes. If the defense is increased, it will create a niche for the pallys to fit into that would actually make them unique (similar to how the monk/rogue is known as the damage dealers and warriors are the best all-around characters).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Another thing, I read the ranger threads and it seems you are addressing that rangers need a defensive raise and more hps. While at the same time they are getting their offense raised. Hmm so you will not address our offensive problems?? I mean you posted that rangers wanted both offense and better defense so can you do the same. Really what would make me happy is for verant to make us hit more with our weapon instead of miss. It will help us taunt too so we can use our higher defense caps.<P>And it is not Greedy man, whoever posted that.<BR>I mean other classes including the ranger are asking for both offense and defense and well Absor even addressed the rangers defensive needs, so why can not absor address our offensive hit/miss ratio ?!.<P>51 cavalier<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
