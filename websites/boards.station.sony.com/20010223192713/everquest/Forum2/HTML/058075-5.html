</FONT><HR><BR>I agree with Grimstaff on his point of wizards not sucking (implying worthless)...  I think (lol, for once) that he's being a bit too positive.  (Verant: Look at this post by Grimstaff, maybe wizards aren't so bad after all!)<P>Also I would venture to say that SOME of the Wizard problems are MORE pronounced pre-50.  I posted more detail on this back in one of the earlier threads but here is a summary:<P>Level 44 (both with 200 int draining the tank with the best nuke available):<P>Mage<BR>580 * 7 = 4060dmg in 55.2 seconds<BR>Total mana expended: 1750<P>Wizard<BR>606 * 7 = 4221dmg in 51 seconds<BR>Total mana expended: 1750<P>SO, EXCLUDING pet and possible fire shield damage the wizard wins (being the DD master) by a tiny 161dmg (3%) and 4.2 seconds (7.6%) (not even a full med tick).  Post 50 wizards actually pull ahead more, but pre 50 this is what they look forward to..  Those are hard numbers folks, and I think that it shows that there is definitely a balance problem.<P>Wizards don't suck.  Wizards do have serious problems.<P>Just another note.  On just about every class thread I've visited I've seen a comment like, "Give X class and Y class this ability and you could delete MY class from the game!"  I'm sure Absor is extremely tired of this little line and it really has little substance to it.  Let's keep these posts out of our thread from here on out.<P><BR>Xien 53rd Channeler of Solusek Ro<BR>GuildLeader of Strength of Ages<BR>Ayonae Ro Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Well here's my 2sp on this situation, and given the fact that I've played a wiz prob as long as anyone else on the server, I think I speak fairly enough about my class.<P>Wizards effective??? - Well before Velious and the +32k hp mobs, I always felt that wizards were a very balanced class though I still haven't found a really effect use for Al'kabors' line.. lets take a look back.<P>Pre-Kunark - hmm didn't really have class defining spells, but could hold our own IMO.<P>Kunark - LURE, Fast AE's, Better Rains (though broken IMO).... Look out.. Wizards now imo have some good power. Lure line makes wizards really class defining, AE's bring a new exciting way to play around in dungeons (though we did goof around with SuperNova some, was never overly effective, maybe in L.Guk).<P><BR>Velious - Lures effectiveness dropped considerably, Rains still broken, AE's - well..can still be used, but very limited. To my knowledge, the only places I've seen that AE's in Velious are effect is while killing the Dogs in Velketors Lab. I'm confident that a single AE group could handle the Dog town in Velk... but then again, thats about the only place i have found them to be effective....PoG, Icewell, Skyshrine, Kael, oh ya my favorite - Frozen tower, all pretty much worthless.. I was shocked when green crap in the tower was resisting about 90% of my spells.. heh.. greenies... gotta love it. <P>Enter uber mobs with over 32k hps.<P>How is it that a wizard, kind of direct dmg is suppose to be so effective against a mob that had 200,000 to 1,000,000 hps? NOT. So far the ONLY way that I have found myself to be effective on the uber mobs is with the use of my blasting robe... but [censored], do they expect every wizards to get a VP/Velketors robe or that VP staff?? Oh ya, they put that 30second mini-lure on the PoG robe, but heh, 30sec cast for 320dmg? wooohoooo.. doesn't quite cut it.<P>IMO the only way to really make wizards effective in these uber epic battles is to do either or both of the following:<P>1. Fix resist rates for wizards so they can at least do the dmg that their manapool gives them.<P>2. Give them a better manaregen naturally that increases per lvl. Call it super meditate, call it built in clarity, call it whatever you want.. but the facts are.. Wizards without mana are worthless. All the other classes have some type of pet to fall back on that can do some type of dmg while they regain thiers... ya ya I know.. Enchanters pets suck, but they have built in regen.<P>Im not asking to be able to cast clarity, or anything like that, but a built in natural regen should be added, even if they wait until lvl 60 to do it. If they are extremely worried about the few wizards that do solo, well then make the regen work better with a group.<P><BR>Now, for my rant of spell issues....<P>Lures - agreed they seem to be a little screwy, but generally u can find some type = Fire/Cold/Magic that works well on one mob or other.. before any lure seemed to work ok against almost any...<P>Rain - Screwed imo... fix the damn issue with the pets negating the the waves dmg and work on the resisted rate. Currently it seems that the rains are resisted quite a bit and in combo with not being able to use them when your group has a pet makes them very limited on use. Personally, I still like them, and use them any time i get the chance.<P>Al'kabors line - Hell, just nuke them.<P><BR>But, overall, I don't believe that we need to increase the amount of dmg we do per blast, just increase the lasting power of the wizard without them having to rely on uber items with built in blasts. Hell, I did some numbers while using my robe in an epic fight the other day, and while i WAS able to contribute a considerable more dmg that I was without my robe.. hell i ran out of mana 2min into the fight...and had to robe from there.... but.. the funny thing.. even with the robe, I still wasn't able to outdmg a monk.. hell not EVEN CLOSE... after crunching the numbers I was able to about 60% of the dmg that any of the main tanking / dmging classes were... <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's the header to the Bard post. I imagine this will appear in front of all his class posts, so it's a glimmer of what we have to expect.<P>You can find the thread, and his complete post at <BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665.html<P>****************<BR>Posted by Absor on 2/16/1 in the Hybrids forum:<P><BR>About these lists:<BR>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I agree with Grimstaff about Wizards do not suck. I also went through a wizard depression about the effect and abilities of the class I had chosen to play. I also heard in Grimstaff's post about us wizards not having to buff. Aye, this allows us to be more focused in the combat portion of battle, but it also lends to the fact that we are not wanted in pickup groups. <P>When you are in a group, you are expecting all party members in the group to lend some sort of help in the upcoming battles. Each and every member has some way of helping in the group that they are in that is specific to their class. A cleric heals, a shaman buffs, etc. Our role in the group is nuking. It is our one and only ability. The problem with this ability is it has no way of telling the group that you are doing anything. All they see is, "some_poor_sob01 is bathed in a torrent of fire". There are no quantifiable evidence that the wizard did anything. For all the group knows that downward swing in the life bar of the mob could have been the culmative damage of all attacks by all players in that group. The wizard could have done full damage or he could have done 1 point of damage. How do they know? They surely know when the spell is resisted fully due to there being no spell effect text at all. So pretty much, you will tell them when we are resisted(failed), but you do not tell them how werll you did when you suceeded. This lend to the next point of contention, resists.<P>First off, I see the need for resists. You are not going to get a full damage nuke on every mob all of the time. Just like a warrior is not going to hit for full on every blow that he lands. But, I as a 52 wizard, have nuked mobs in a newbie zone and had multiple full resists on the same mob. First couple of times this happened, I chaulked it up to being unlucky and shrugged it off. The subsequent times I have had this happen it just makes me mad. I know, I know, NPC follow a different set of rules than PCs and they get more of a chance to live than we do, it has been stated endless amounts of times, but when a lvl 52 PC attacks a lvl 3 mob I do not think that these rules should apply. If you are going to make it so casters cannot hit a mob that is higher than them then you should inbversly make  it so lower lvl mobs have less of a chance to resist us too. Not in a mediocre way either, it should be quite significant. <P>Larger mana pool. I agree with most of the board on this one. I would like to have one but without adding to the exorbant med time penalty that would come with it. rather than make our mana pool bigger, the damage we do accomplish should be in better chucks for the same mana. This is all we do, we have no other way of doing damage at this point in the game. This also covers the mana efficiency portion of the debate.<P>Make us group friendly. This is by and large my biggest gripe. Unless I bring my own group with me(consisting of friends and guild members) it is almost impossible to get a pick up group. No one want's us unless it is a major raid on a high level mob and it needs to be taken down quickly. With the Velious mobs this is even made more apparent as the amount of damage  I can do to them is negligible compared to the melee damage that can be done in the same time. I would like to see some sort of group friendly spells added to our line up, something new, something that will make us wanted in groups.  My suggestion (as well as a couple of others on the boards) was to give us the ability to add procs to the melee damage. That way we would be contributing even while we are sitting on our collective arses. It would give us face time so to speak. I am sure that there are other ways to do this, but in my thinking this would be the most direct way of adding value to our class. Just think of the possibilities if you put a high lvl wizard, a shaman and a warrior in a group. <P>Bottom line is, the last problem in our class is the one that should be looked at first. Verant, you have stated that you frown upon soloing, but since I created my character that is all I have mostly done. I am tired of being the lone wizard that only gets called upon when a large raid is going on. I want to be considered valuable in a  xp group. I would like to be able to walk into Karnor's and shout for a group and actually find one. <P>Alonnar Touel'alfar<BR>52 Channeler<BR>The Forgotten Order<BR>Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not to be a troll SunSear, you have a legitimate point.  However you compare wizards and magians at a level where they are close.  You use as an example an extreme scenario in the pre-50 game.  It is like comparing the max damage of wizard ice and magician bolt at 34.  Compare magician and wizard at 29/39.  Then your numbers will have more meaning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I thought of a solution that would make wizards more powerful and wanted in group, but help their solo game very little.  Verant won't go for this, but you never know.  Give wizards a higher-level (pre-50) single target mez.  This would not only make wizards more wanted in groups, but it will allow most groups to fight without an enchanter.  I told ya Verant  wouldn't go for this, but it is interesting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You have great ratios in DoTs, for soloing I don't hear you complainings about that. That's what makes the necros class so special you got the best of both worlds tank and casters in a way. You got a pet to tank, and not a shabby one at that. I've seen warriors fight the necro pet for fun and guess what?? The tanks loses even being 1-5 lvls over the necro player. DO you complain about that? No. My domain as a wizy has been master of direct damage and I get resists with Lures even though they were meant to damage high lvl mobs.

Yes it is an extreme, and yes there are levels where wizards do get DDs and mages don't.  Does the fact that at a few spell circles mages don't get a dd negate the fact that at several spell circles wizards BARELY hold an edge in DD alone?  If a 44th druid or shaman could heal within 161hp of a 44th cleric using the there entire tank of mana in nearly the same time would the cleric be upset?  You suggest that my point has less validity because it is more balanced at 39-43 and 29-33?  <P>My point is that Mages should not ever be close.  If a Mage using all his tools, can output more short term damage than a Wizard using all his tools what is the point of the wizard?<P><BR>Being the master of DD should mean something at all levels not just a some.

</FONT><HR>Hiya all...<P>As a lvl 56 Necro, I don't want my Drain to be unresistable, I think I don't need it. The problem is : What kind of group may actually really need me (or you it seems) to be more effective, or simply to be effective in another way ? You (as we) are complaining about our inefficiency in several situations (at lvl 51+ these situations are something like 75% of the game). Please, stop pointing at us, we absolutely (or rarely) don't do so. It is true that if Necro get that kind of spell this would be a terrible BackStab for Wizzys...I hope Verant is aware that if we Necro need it (I still think we don't) it impose that YOU need it !<P>Necro are just searching for a (new) way to make them more wanted in groups (as target FD that would be good for EVERY player but Necro himself, as he already have it). The "Troll" attitude from some of all classes aren't significative at all. I think better is to not care about...<P>Good luck in all your will, God knows you will need it.<P><BR>PS : still no clue of what is about to happen, isn't it Friday yet ?<P>See ya<P>Coercitas Las'Ombras<BR>Lvl 56 ManaBattery<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*snort* So much for my first idea. I was a bit weird when I did that. The thing that we are all not paying attention to is the fact that Absor is not listening to us right now and not at this rate. You can stop screaming the same gibberish over and over. If Absor manages to read this then: <P>I applaud you for your concern of the Wizard class but there are major issues that have remained untouched. Some good points have been made, some stupid ones have. I am attempting to sum up what alot of us want. <P>Now for the rest of you, if I am right, then just stop posting. If I am not, then make sure that no one has already said what you want to say. <P>Awright, here we go, maybe I can finish by President's Day... Nah... anyway: <P><BR>============================================================== <BR>CONTENTS<BR>I Mana <BR>II Damage <BR>III The Main Advantage that you Present <BR>***A Little Ditty About Someone From My School***<BR>IV Pets <BR>V Teleportation <BR>VI Epic Quest <BR>VII Some Proof <BR>VIII Note to Absor <BR>==============================================================<P><BR>I MANA<BR>We are most definitively screwed in this part. We have to use alot of mana to fuel our spells and we have to wait a LONG time to regen. I understand that this is the same for all the other classes, but you are ignoring the fact that they can cast buffs on themselves, then have their pet stand guard (sorry clerics, you don't have pets so that last one does not apply to you). If they are melee, then they stand up and beat the thing with a large weapon, or some blunt object or the other, and they sit back down, they don't have much to worry about unless they are REALLY low on HP. We need something to happen here. We have far too little mana for the purpose that we are to serve in the group and we have no way of recouping that mana on our own or even in most group without the aid of an Enchanter (thank the Lord for you, you wonderful Enchanters). Most other classes also run down their mana stores really fast, but they have something to compensate. Usually a pet or some massive buff (uh oh, getting a bit repetitive). We could get a mana boost, but that means that we get the advantage all throughout our lives, and that may unbalance us alot during our lower level. So that may not too valid. How about some mana regen? If we are the Masters of Knowledge (or something like that) then would it not make sense that we would know how to replenish our magical reserves to become more efficient? Which brings me to another point. Our mana efficiency is a little off. We nuke for a roughly 1:2 mana for damage ratio. Granted, that sounds nice, but it changes and gets more as we go. It is generally this though, so I will focus on that. If mana is our major resource, seeing as how our AC and HP sucks, we should get some mana advantage. We can't use it for much besides DD so there is no real reason not to. <P>II DAMAGE <BR>We are suppose to be the masters of DD. This is not apparent. Master implies that we are exceptional. One moment, let me head to the dictionary... ah, here we go: <BR>Main Entry: 1mas·ter<BR>Pronunciation: 'mas-t&r<BR>Function: noun<BR>Etymology: Middle English, from Old English magister & Old French maistre, both from Latin magister; akin to Latin magnus large -- more at MUCH &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=much&gt;<BR>Date: before 12th century<BR>1 a (1) : a male teacher (2) : a person holding an academic degree higher than a bachelor's but lower than a doctor's b often capitalized : a revered religious leader c : a worker or artisan qualified to teach apprentices d (1) : an artist, performer, or player of consummate skill (2) : a great figure of the past (as in science or art) whose work serves as a model or ideal<BR>2 a : one having authority over another : RULER &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=ruler&gt;, GOVERNOR &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=governor&gt; b : one that conquers or masters : VICTOR &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=victor&gt;, SUPERIOR &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=superior&gt; &lt;in this young, obscure challenger the champion found his master&gt; c : a person licensed to command a merchant ship d (1) : one having control (2) : an owner especially of a slave or animal e : the employer especially of a servant f (1) dialect : HUSBAND &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=husband&gt; (2) : the male head of a household<BR>3 a (1) archaic : MR &lt;dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=mr&gt;. (2) : a youth or boy too young to be called mister -- used as a title b : the eldest son of a Scottish viscount or baron<BR>4 a : a presiding officer in an institution or society (as a college) b : any of several officers of court appointed to assist (as by hearing and reporting) a judge<BR>5 a : a master mechanism or device b : an original from which copies can be made; especially : a master phonograph record or magnetic tape<BR>- mas·ter·ship /-"ship/ noun <BR>If you note closely, the word was derived from the latin magister. I take latin. That means teacher. It is also dervied from magnus (as it says) which is large (again, as it says). This was because teachers in ancient Rome used to have a large measure of power over their students. In any case, on with the argument. If we are to be the masters (ie teachers) we should have the ability to nuke FAR and above ANY class. Should we not? Isn't that the reason that we sacrificed the research of pets and buffs? Because we would not need them in any case? If you look at one of the other definitions of master, it means a person holding authority over others. That would be because we have the power of nuking far better than anyone else, right? Not quite, as it stands, we can be outnuked by other classes at certain points throughout our lives. How does this make us the masters? If you go back a bit, you can find some statistics. At Level 60 an Enchanter can outdamage us by 200 points of damage. (sorry Enchanters, for what I am about to say) THEY ARE ENCHANTERS, THEY SHOULD AT NO POINT BE ABLE TO OUTDAMAGE US!!! (maybe I am thinking ths wrong) The stereotype of ALL Wizard in ALL RPGs besides this one is that they do not like to be with people, but they accept grudgingly when they must, or sometimes they are simply looking for some adventure, and they do not contribute much except for what they happen to know. Then at some point in the story, they decide that their help is warranted, and they blast the enemy into tiny particulate matter. Then they make nothing of it, sit back down, and go back to meditation. You don't read many stories, or play many RPGs, where the Wizard stands up for the first time, casts a spell and says, "Oh, sorry guys, this thing just resists my spells too easily, I think I will sit this one out, and Gate away if you happen to be losing too bad." TELL ME THAT THIS HAPPENS IN LOTS OF RPGS. Sorry, but no that never ever EVER happens. We are supposed to be the masters of DD so make us that. I am suggesting the following solutions :<P>A) Give us more power. Adjust the nukes as follows. <BR>Levels 1-10 2x damage <BR>Levels 11-20 3x damage <BR>Levels 21-30 4x damage <BR>Levels 31-40 5x damage <BR>Levels 41-50 6x damage <BR>Leels 51-60 7x damage <P>There are some obviously flaws with this system. A level 12 wizard would be nuking for somewhere near 150. It is fair though, since it balances near the end. At about 11200 damage per Sunstrike. With mobs that consist of about 100,000+ HP in Velious, it would make sense. Yeah, I know the obvious problems with such a system would be pronounced, a Wizard could kill steal like mad. That is not really a problem. If it turns out to be a problem (ie multiple offenses, continously) then simply watch the person and cut them out if it turns out to be that big a deal. You should not punish our class because a few jerks wanna use their massive powers to steal some loot. Don't change the agro on our spells though. Mobs on Velious do somewhere near DEATH with one shot, so it would not make sense to change the agro on the spells. This is kinda weird I know, but let's run through it. First off, what is happening now: A Wizard joins a Velious group. Let's assume 2 Warrios, 1 Cleric, 1 Enchanter, and 1 Necromancer, for comparison purposes. The Wizard joins up. They run in to take a mob with 100,000 HP, and let's set a trivial attack. How about 1000 damage per hit, no possible resistance (they do alot more). The Warrios let the Enchanter do a mez or two or something to help hold down the mob. They start beating on it. The Warrios take 1000 damage a piece. The Cleric heals them both. The Enchanter keeps trying to keep the mob down, it works half the time. The Wizard opens up with his most powerful AoEs and Nukes. Say, a Tears of Prexus followed by a Sunstrike. Assuming this mob can't resist (YEAH RIGHT), the Wizard just did 3675 damage or so. Woohoo!!!! Go Wizard! Oops, aggro! AGGRO ON THE WIZZIE HELP HELP HEL..... *chomp* Hey guys, the Wizard died again. The Warrios continue to beat. The Enchanter pops some nukes. The Necro has poisoned the mob, and snared him, and sicked his pet on him all in the time it took the Wizard to die. Granted, this may not be a feasible situation to have them win. But do you think they can't do it? Think again, the Necro jumps into Arch Lich, lifetaps the hell out of the mob and transfers the nice new mana to the Cleric. The Warrios stay at roughly max health, the Necro pet is fine since the mob is aggro on one of the Warrios, and the Cleric is happy, because he can sit and heal and get continuous influzes of mana. The Necromacer is happy to sit there and transfer Mana and some HP now and then, and is fine being his skeleton self. No problem. The mob will eventually fall. The Wizard treks back to his corpse, or the Cleric rezes him. He is told to leave, is disbanded from the group, and has to go find some other place to die. THE WAY IT SHOUD WORK: The group forms the same way. The Warriors run in, the Cleric starts healing, the Necromancer snares and DoTs the mob, and the Enchanter keeps taps on it. The Wizard sits back till a bit of help is needed, send off a salvo of 3 Sunstrikes, for a net damage of about 33600. The mob just lost a third of its HP, the mob was already down by about half its HP because of the Warrios battering, so another minute or two and the mob is down instead of the normal ten minutes. I don't think that is a bad way to have Wizards become more appealing in groups. As it is, a Wizard's main appeal is that he can kill things with one shot that are alot lower than him, so you can show off to noobs. Why don't you change the class name to "Silly old men running around shooting things with underpowered nukes, because groups have better classes to recruit" shortened to the acronym SOMRASTWUNBGHBCTR. Or Somrastwunbeaters or some stupid name like that to exemplify our uselessness. <P>Now for my next solution. You simply give us some percentage nukes. I don't like that much more, because it has more potential for abuse, and it does not help that much unless you make it about 10% for Level  60. That may help alot. It would solve our problems on Velious. The problem with this one is that it does not totally fix the problem. Wizards are complaining that their low levels are basically just stupid. The line that you give us about Wizard building up great power over time is bull, so just give us power. You can't expect us to wait until Level 60 for our best powers. BY NO MEANS SHOULD EVER RESPOND TO THIS BY SAYING: "Well this class gives you rewards based on the time you invest in it, as it gets better over time. If you don't realize this, then play a class that rewards you nicely on each spell rank." THAT IS NOT A SOLUTION. Just kill the Wizard class all together why don't you? <P>Another solution. Give us nukes that are unresistable as well as making them about 2x as strong AT LEAST. That way, we can at least do 1600 damage with one nuke, no problem, no chance of resists at Level 60. It does not make sense to give us no pets to back us up with melee then say that we get less resists, then not do anything that seems to make any difference in that case. We don't wanna switch classes, to a pet class, and we do not all want pets, although I am going to talk about the Lightning Elemental idea I have later on. If we were unresistable (and we are *wink*) then we would be much more helpful in groups where we wanna fight something that is alot highere level than we are. I think it is a problem when the first that a 60 Wizard says to a newbie Wizard is "change to another class, wizzies get screwed at high levels  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">" I don't think that is the way that someone should be talking about their own class. You can tell you have done something wrong. We are not gonna switch classes and lose all the time we spent building up, so give us back some power. <P>III THE MAIN ADVANTAGE THAT YOU PRESENT <BR>One of the other things that really gets my goat is the other thing that you said about Wizards. You state (I believe) that Wizards are the only class that get *powerful* (I say that laughingly) nukes of all three elements types (Fire, Ice, Magic). WHAT WERE YOU THINKING????? We are supposed to be happy that we can nuke pitifully with 3 different FLAVORS??? Kinda' like painting a tank different colors in one army, and loading them with lasers (so sue me if we can't make good ones yet, but let's say some realy powerful ones) and then saying to one side you have super-tanks in gray and saying to the other your tanks a crap but they come in blue, green, or yellow! Nah! Hell no! <P>*************************************************<BR>I interject with a small ditty I wrote about someone in my school, sing to the tune of "We are the Champions" at the part where they usually sing "No time for losers, cause we are the champions" <P>Mac is a bio!!!<BR>Mac is a homo!!! <BR>No time for straight guys!!! <BR>'Cause Mac is a MOFO!!!!! <P>Disclaimer: This is just a view of the writer. The term homo is used as an insult to Mac, although it is truly an insult to all homos out there, I do not use it as a derogatory term to imply that there is anything wrong with that. I simply use it as derogatory because of its place in slang. If anyone is offended by this, sorry, request that it be deleted, and I will repost another without such dirty lyrics involved. <BR>*************************************************<P>Back to the discussion, sorry, I got bored talking about the all the stupid things that need to be fixed that should have been dealt with. <P>IV PETS <BR>This was, at one point, one of my real solutions to the damage equation. Now that Velious is here, it won't help as much in evening out the equation but what the heck. My question to Verant is: Why don't Wizards get pets? I was given the answer that this was because Wizards have powerful nukes. Must I emphasize more on the untruth of this statement? No, I did not think so. My idea is that Wizards (being the masters of magic) should get a pet with the Magic property being its underlieing (did I spell that right) concept. A Lightning Elemental! It would be just like Mage pets, with the looks of a Fire Elemental (except sparking yellow and flowing colors that make up the light spectrum). It would have all Lightning attack and its special ability (like the Fire Elemental damage shields, would be something like self healing. This would be because the Wizard will have no healing spells for his pet. Being purely offensive, the Wizard would have the ability to summon an offensive warrior to help him out, and he would not need to depend solely on the Warriors. It would make grouping with Wizards easier too, if Wizards have pets, then there will be more reason to grou pwith them, they can nuke like masters (assuming you inlcude some of the other enhancements) and they can contribute a bit of melee with their pets. Ask the Mages if they would mind if you must. Not too many will say "NO!!!!" because it will not help us as much as it does them. <P>V TELEPORTATION <BR>This has been addressed before I believe. You already have the information that you need. I think that all the Wizard and Druid port sites should be protected by some sort of buff that makes attacking anyone inside them impossible. That way, they can serve as safe havens. Other than that, you have information on which teleport locations need changing, if you do not, you can check back a bit, or you can ask for clarification and I will provide it later on. <P>VI EPIC QUEST <BR>This I have a real problem with. The idea that the way to get it is to camp someone tediously over and over is VERY stupid. I think that something that deals with puzzle solving, or actual combat SKILL should be what is needed, and something that is fairly tedious-free. Perhaps a set of fights, in which the drop is common, but the fight is difficult. The epic reward should be reconsidered. It shoud be a spell and it should be some sort of summon spell. Even if it is Summon Epic: Staff of Four or something like that. The idea that we can LOSE OUR EPIC REWARD is not cool. True, some other classes are like that, but casters shouldn't have to. They should all have epics that are spells that summon the item. I don't know why it is only for Mages, other than maybe because, they are major time summoners. <P>VII SOME PROOF <P>a_monk00 <BR>The balance problem is simple. <BR>Wizards, pre-Velious, could do a significant amount of damage in a rather short period of time to a monster with 32k HP. Ice Comet -- with no resists -- is 3.5% of a monster's life. <BR>That same nuke -- again, with no resists -- is 0.11% of a Thrifling Focuser's (sp? The trees in PoG with 1,000,000 HP) HP total. <BR>This is not even mentioning the exceedingly high resists that all casters face in Velious, that is driving wizards to use FAR less damaging lure spells just to do any damage AT ALL. <BR>Either wizards are broken, and need HUGE upgrades in mana, damage, and efficiency for Velious (and ONLY Velious) -- or Velious itself is broken. It's up to you to figure out which one you prefer to fix.<BR>END OF ENTRY <P>Cutty <BR>Absor Wrote: <BR>&gt;"3) Epics should be hard, but one class's should not be obviously harder than others."&lt; <BR>Well, because I'm getting into a snippy mood reading this thread <BR>Yes, one class does have to have the hardest epic quest. That's just the way things go, they can't all be exactly equal in difficulty. And, well, wizards do not have the hardest epic quest anyhow ppthththththth! <BR>*sigh* <BR>Ok this is just rediculous, its not a question of difficulty-its a question of some kind of balance.<BR>On Tarrew Marr Server, if thing dont change, by this summer, there will be literally over a hundred of rogue epics-near or over a hundred cleric epics, tons of chanter epic etc ect..and oh yeah like maybe 5 wizard epics(maybe) theres one 1 that I actually know of..That is just rediculous!!!<BR>END OF ENTRY <P>There are some serious problems here... <P>Grimstaff <BR>There is another oddity that I find curious. <BR>Druids get a blast called Calefaction at level 44. Here's the information: <BR>Calefaction (Druid 44) 250 mana, 450 max damage, 2.5 second casting time, 45 second hold time. <BR>There is another that Magicians get. <BR>Scars of Sigil (Magician 54) 175 mana, 525 max damage, 2.0 second casting, 2.0 second hold time <BR>Now... I did a nice search of Wizard spells and here's the most powerful spell we get that has a casting time of 2.5 seconds or less: <BR>Flame Shock (Wizard 16) 75 mana, 110 max damage, 2.5 second casting <BR>Am I mistaken or wasn't fast damage supposed to be the Wizard trademark?<BR>END OF ENTRY <P>I really like what Grimstaff has to say, he makes sense... Everyone should listen to him... <P>Quinnell <BR>Lerahs, relax. Give Absor a chance to post. <BR>We're all frustrated and have been for 2 years. Don't pass judgement until we see the plan. <BR>I, for one, find myself with renewed faith. Of course, it could just be that I'm having a good day. <BR>Anyway, thanks Absor for responding. I'm hanging on this thread awaiting you list. I hope we've managed to inform you of our serious issues and I look forward to seeing how Verant plans to help us. <BR>Thx,<BR>Quinnell <BR>END OF ENTRY <P>There is some more info for you guys... <BR>That enough for now I think.. <P>VIII NOTE TO ABSOR <BR>Awright, Absor, I have told you before, but I will say it once more. We are not particularly mad at you. It may seem like that alot. We are just venting. Its been a long time since we first started asking for some help in our department. You guys just seem to have been not really taking much consideration in this matter, and it does not really endear you to us. We do know that you care, but it seems as if only now, and it does not seem that you are listening much to these discussions. I know that you are working hard at this, but I suggest you do something for us, you should do something little at least to get us to shut up. You say that you are doing all this stuff but no info has reached places like Caster's Realm. Places like that is where most of us check for our news. You can't expect to us to stop saying nasty snide things when you don't DO anything that you have said so far. Good luck, and keep up the good work (even if not on us yet). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry fellow Wizards, (esp. Grimstaff),<P>we may to suck completly... but we are very CLOSE to it. We have some good points, if those getting imrpovements. (I am too tired to go through this all again.)<P>But especially post level 51, and at many pre 50 levels we are close to be useless.<P>Compare a twinked level 30ish Tank and  Twinked level 30ish Wizzy... aye, porr Wiz will suck comapred to the Tank.<P>Druids Nad Mages doing very very close damage to us... regarding their DD's. And that shouldn't be either. Where is our role here then?<P>Apparently there are three classes:<P>Druids, Necros and Mages.<P>Druids are the mixture of Clerics with some Dot and nuking abbilities. As well they got travels spells.<P>Necros... self plaining.<P>Now Mages (Wizards):<P>Mages (Wizards) were split in three classes. In the old D&D Games, as well in all Fantasy scenarios this is only one class.<P>Now here are:<P>Enchanters (Enchanting, Charming etc. and nuking)<P>Mages (Summoning, DS, and Nuking)<P>Wizards (TP and Nuking)<P>So Verant made out of one class three classes. Each class got nuking abbilities. Furthermore Druids and Necros gpt Nuking abbilities as well. The Wizard class is the most specialized class of the above ones. They (Wizards) are only able to nuke nuke nuke... and they are meant to do it. (This regards towards doing damage.)<P>Unfortunaly Wizards are not doing duperior damage. All the other classes are sooner or later very close to them in DD damage. (Or even exceed them.) And fast casting doesn't really count in the high level game or any other exp group situation.<P>Regarding all that and taking into account that Meleers are great damage dealer, even in a short period of time, Wizards DO suck at the moment. The class COULD have many very good abbilities... but we are a little screwed at the moment.<P>Admit it, we are doing the LEAST ammount of damage, even in the short run. Fizzles and resists doesn't help really. All nuking classes get decent nukes past 51. ANd a beter mana/damage ratio by 0.2 really doesn't help us, don't start arguing with the casting time. This is completly uninteresting in exp gropus and the high level game.<P>We were ignored for a so long time, and in that time Meleers and other classes got great improvements, that we are really close to suck now.

</FONT><HR>Why do you think that wizards were left till last?  Hands down  (as you can tell by the number of parts), because Wizards whine the most.  Now, ask yourself  do you think there is a certain type of person that gravitates to the wizard class?  Specifically people that sit around all day and say, why me!  constantly pointing out the negative things in their life and becoming more enraged because nobody listens to them.  I dont think so.  We are all good people, and to treat us like we are just a bunch of 12 year olds who want everything their way is an insult to my intelligence  as well as everyone elses.  The reasons that there are so many complaining angry wizards is due to the inequality that makes us unbalanced.  Im level 52  I have 44 days played on my account.  This is fast considering this is my first character.  How did I get my level so fast?  I can tell you, it was not through grouping.  I have soloed about 80% of my levels.  Why? Because I cant get a group.  If I only grouped I would still be level 20.  If you have ever tried to solo a wizard, it is an INCREDIBLY frustrating experience due to the fact that root is our only defense and it breaks after almost every DD.  Snare works great (and even better now that snare/root stacks), but it is only possible to effectively kite when you have Jboots.  Im getting off topic, but what Im saying is that we are FORCED to solo.  This has been repeated over and over, but I have sat through all my levels and watch people having a much easier time at either soloing (mages, necros, druids), or being unable to solo  but having abilities that make them wanted in a group (tanks, enchanters, rogues, druids, bards).  We cant solo worth @#$# without Jboots, and nobody wants us in a group.  Absor, if you tell me that people want a wizard in a group then I must say you have never played the class, dont understand the class, and dont really want anything to do with the class.  We are not the most damaging class, we have the most downtime of any class, we have the least helpful group spells of any class, and we are completely useless when OOM.  The only times I have found when I wizard is really desired is when going after big targets  we might not do much damage with the Lure spell, but at least we get some spells in.  All the other classes are forced to resort to melee and pets.  I thank Verant for this since it is the ONLY reason we are needed at the higher levels  seriously.  If we are so balanced, then why are so many people upset with not just the individual nitpicky details as you call it but the class as a whole.  I repeat: Our damage is lower than other classes, our downtime is the longest of any (since mana is our only offense/defense), we have the least appeal in a group, and all our major benefits are shared by other classes that are more plentiful in-game (snare: druid/ranger/sk/necro, tp/evac: druid, stun: cleric/paly, Damage: mage, necro, rogue, warrior, monk).  Balance is equality  we dont have equality and are therefor unbalanced.  If you cant see this then stop mocking us like all others have done in the past and stop wasting our time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
