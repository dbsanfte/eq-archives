</FONT><HR>Once again, another proposed few arguments.<P>People keep mentioning the "big" issues as being haste stacking, and melee damage improvement.  I do agree with this whole heartedly, but if thats all you have problems with, then somthing is wrong.<P>Granted, we have to be able to keep in mind that other classes are going to have changes to help balance them out as well, I totally agree with the statment that we have to keep the game fun as well.<P>I'm just dropping in a few more suggestions, and offering arguments as well as a few counter arguments.<P>-------------------------------------------------<BR>As I said in an earlier post, a bard's abilities to mez are based on his performance ability.  So are others things.  I think songs should either take mana, and bards be given some sort of meditate ability, or nerf the Mana cost on every song.<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>A bard with backstab is just laughable, as I also said in an earlier post, Bard's should never ever get this skill, and I sure hope Verant doesn't considder it.  Point in case, a guy singing isn't going to slip a dagger into somone without being noticed.<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>Yes, bard deffintiely need some increase in fighting skills, but also a major increase in song abilities. As it stands now, it isn't very worth while with a bard to try and solo anything.  The experience vs. time, and hp cost just isn't worth it. (this is comming from a 16th level bard)<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>Some of these propositions on skills are alright, and I deffineitly would like to know how much an instrument is going to improve my song, and it would be nice if those instruments had a slight increase. I've had a group me to switch out using weapons to use a lute or mandolin with Hymn of restoration during a battle with a necro and it's pet in befallen , as well as other undead(this was at level 9).  The group was ticked that I didn't what they didn't understand was that taking my weapon away would have decreased the current damage output of the group to the point we would have had to run. Singing hymn was just fine and fighting, but with a bigger increase I may have been inclined to use hymn coupled with the increase on strings of discord. <P>just figured this one should have an example with it.<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>Lastly, the lute of the howler issue. Why in god's name are people bickering over somthing so trivial.  I mean come on people, focus on somthing real to whine about.  Granted this is a "unique illusion" but yeesh.  I don't know what it's effects are, personally I don't care.  My point is, people are too concerned with looks over effects, big deal, let this go and focus on somthing to "balance" the enchanters out.  I have no suggestion on what, I've never played an enchie, but I'm sure if people devoted time to it, they could find somthing more productive to worry about than an illusion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Listen up People!  Bards are not Tanks, that is not what they are supposed to be. Anyone tanking with a bard should quit playing a bard and start a warrior.<P>Bards are one of the msot powerful classes up to level 50.  All of the younger bards here are asking for way too much.  Bards probably solo better then any class up to level 30.  If you are having trouble Soloing your bard, you are playing him wrong - plain and simple.  When new non-split servers open, what class is usually the first to 50?  The solo bard, that's who.<P>This discussion is for balance, not a wish list for dream enhancements.  That brings me to my point.  After level 40. Bards become less and less necessary in groups.  Until after level 53, they are pretty much just used to restore mana.  What people have been hoping for in balancing the bards, is to give them something that makes them more attractive to groups in those higher levels.  As they stand now, ther eis very little a level 54 bard can bring to a group and especially a raid that is needed.  So Bards are being abandoned and players are starting other classes.  If you aren't in your 50's, you have no idea what I am talking about, but should think about what your goal is, do you really want to level your bard thta high knowing that when you get there, he is going to be completely useless?<P>Please repect the opinions of the players that have played Bards up to these high levels.  They know what they are talking about.  And for the love of God, put down that sword and start equiping your instruments. :-)<P>Tryx Stormsong - 54 Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(quote)<P>Bards probably solo better then any class up to level 30. If you are having trouble Soloing your bard, you are playing him wrong - plain and simple.<P>(end quote)<P>Yes, bards can solo fine up to around level 13 or so. And then of course I obviously haven't gone after higher end mobs, (heck I'm only 16)  and as I've already stated I don't want to be used as a mana battery either.<P>My point in this post is the higher end people obviously want to be more useful in groups, while the lower end people want enhancements to help them get to that higher end.  Right now, it's bad enough as it is soloing.  The few methods a bard can use are....<P>Bellow/Selos/Bellow/Selos/etc etc etc.  I don't know but it is often times just easier to stand toe to toe with somthing blue at my level because the time vs exp factor is much more worth it.  And doing this to somthing red takes close to 20 - 25 min for a little less than a blue-line bub (assuming you're not in a dungeon).<P>Toe to Toe/haste/discord/health/str etc.  This method is not as time consuming, but to rack up any worth while exp. this requires going against blues which is little exp as is.<P>Basically, all I think we need is a little boost in power all around at all levels, not just the higher end ones.<P>And I highly disagree that bards have it easy as being powerful.<P>I've played several other classes, and I think it's much easier as just about any Caster, and maybe even a Monk to solo at the same level as a Bard. (and I'm not picking on any other class o rsaying I want to be one, I like being a bard, but if they are trying to Balance things out, then hey why not raise a few opinions, I'm just trying to use examples from my experiences)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>WONDERFUL list and an impressive job across all the class lines so far. I had an expansion to your item on travel songs. Thank you for taking a look.<P><BR>ITEM: Travel Songs  - range<P>DESCRIPTION: When auto-following, it is common for other members of the group to fall outside of the range of these songs - Speed, Levitation, and invisibility, Song of travel(all 3). It would prevent unnecessary deaths without adding 'power' to the class to increase the range on these 4 songs. Many bards consider these songs too dangerous to their party members to use.<P>Whit Scarletsong<BR>Scarlet Horizon<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, there are alot of items that you got on the list aren't class balance issue. There are sure problems that bard is facing daily. But if our objective is about class balancing, many of the items that you list are off topic. The followinng is a list that I personally do not think they are directly related to class balancing.<P>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Drum Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION: Bards look like they are carrying a flute when they are carrying a drum. And when they play that flute/drum, the strum it.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>I have been playing EQ since launch, this animation issue bugs me alot and I would really want to see this fix, however, THIS IS NOT A BALANCE ISSUE.<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Casting Animations on New Songs.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that some of the new songs have casting animations attached to them, not singing animations. It would be nice if to have song animations on all songs.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>THIS IS NOT AN BALANCE ISSUE.<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Particle Effects for Songs.<BR>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice to be able to turn on and off song effects as a separate toggle.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>THIS IS NOT A BALANCE ISSUE.<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Song Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION: For everyone but the bard, bardic song effect icons are constantly blinking. It would probably be better just to have them remain solid, it’s less bothersome.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>THIS IS NOT A BALANCE ISSUE.<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Bard NPCs are wimps.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if NPC bards at least sang their songs when under attack. They also do much less melee damage than similar level NPCs.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>THIS IS NOT A BALANCE ISSUE. What is the relationship between bard NPC and bard player? Buffing up the bard NPC will help the bard player doing what?<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Firiona Vie Trainer for Bards.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is no bard trainer in Firiona Vie.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>IS THIS CONSIDER AS CLASS BALANCE ISSUE?<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Temple of Solusek Ro weapon quest.<P>DESCRIPTION: One of the bard quest NPCs says something about checking back later for information on a special bard weapon. Since this has been his speech for over a year, we should either add this quest or just remove the text.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>IS THIS CONSIDER AS CLASS BALANCE ISSUE?<BR>----------------------------------------<P>ITEM: Lute of the Howler.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps there is a story reason for giving bards the ability to turn into werewolves. But we should be very careful when we give the more class defining abilities to other classes. The ability to look like a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters. Even if we don’t remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving such abilities to classes in the future.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>IS THIS CONSIDER AS CLASS BALANCE ISSUE?<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>ITEM: Spell Gems.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be great if spell gems just turned gray rather than blanking out when in use. This would allow bards to see what songs they have running at any given time.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>IS THIS CONSIDER AS CLASS BALANCE ISSUE?<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Incandescent Bracer:<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems this item is only wearable in the waist slot. It should probably be a wrist item.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<BR>----------------------------------------<BR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>ITEM: Song of Shields (49).<P>DESCRIPTION: This song has no message. Previously it was spamming the group with messages, and now it gives none. It would be nice if to have it generate a single message like all other bard songs.<P>STATUS: None<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>Also, this song will creat a buff sound effect every time it refresh, this problem I mention here is not a balance issue, but it is really annoying.<BR>----------------------------------------<P>Erhin Libretto<BR>&lt;&lt;Dark Brethren&gt;&gt;<BR>1st lvl 50 bard in Bertoxx Realm<BR>Now serving in Terris-Thule Realm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Quote:<BR>Listen up People! Bards are not Tanks, that is not what they are supposed to be. Anyone tanking with a bard should quit playing a bard and start a warrior.<P>Disagree. There are often times where a bard's melee output can tip the balance. However, it is technically impossible for higher level bards to 'tank'; our melee output and lack of taunt does not retain a mob's attention.<P>Quote:<BR>When new non-split servers open, what class is usually the first to 50? The solo bard, that's who.<P>Piffle. I play on a non-split server. In fact I've played on two. The first classes to 50th were druids and necros. The first hit 60th were druids. The highest two bards on Torv. are 60th and 58th. You have your facts very wrong on this issue.<P>Someone asked about selo's activating indoors; this is a big no-no. During testing it was found that fast-movers in dungeons resulted in huge trains, so speed effects indoors were all disabled.

</FONT><HR>I'm tired of the people who want bards to be and enchanter/warrior. That sounds boring to me. I like the tremendous flexibility I have as a bard. I get to adjust to both group classes and skills. <P>I heard Absor say defense would be improved. I don't particularly need much better melee skills.  There is always someone to dish the damage, but bards take damage like little kids. Bards playing instruments or meleeing could use some defensive enhancements. Start dodge and parry earlier and give them much higher caps. It's not that hard to parry with an instrument. I have been a fencer and you'd be surprised how simple a weapon can be used to block any kind of blow. And many of our songs are major taunts.<P>The only thing I don't like about twisting songs and instruments, is that it makes it very difficult to carry on a conversation. Auto-twist might help there, and it might help those with dial-up connections.<P>I still say, the levels from 20-31 were the toughest. It seems the spells we get in that range are not the ones the other players in that range need for effective groups. The songs have value, but the circumstances are rare in action. Charm is ok but it comes late. <P>I don't know about 50+. I've never heard of a dragon raid that didn't include several bards, so I'm assuming that bards are much in demand. Maybe they just die too easily.<P>Mez is sometimes useful. It's awfully difficult to target in a battle situation with so much stuff on screen, and since it has such a short duration, it's near impossible to mez three and sometimes not even two NPCs. Same with charm. In really intense situations with lots on screen, the short duration becomes a problem mostly because of targeting. This might be fixed by providing some targeting upgrade rather than changing the spells up much.<P>Thanks for listening,<BR>Tzinger of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>three things<BR>1) somewhat better melee (changes on test may be enough if some of it filters down to the under 50 crowd)<P>2) BETTER CROWD CONTROL - i think this is an issue with resists on lullaby, mes, charm and snare - even with a 150 charisma i get resisted well over half the time on those critical songs (and this is against a range of low blue mobs) - PLEASE ADDRESS THIS<P>3) a bit more for the RAID and post 50 life - Add a song to increase melee damage - a group fire fist or something that adds 5 or maybe 10 points to melee attacks (or missile weapons).  This would not have stacking issues and could make bards nicely useful as it would make all melees in the group more useful.<P>if you take an average attack of 50 points from a high level warrior (just pulling a number out of the air) - 20% haste would add, effectively 10 points to each attack (averaging over time for the greater number of attacks) - about the same as adding 10 points to each hit would add via a this song.<P>Make the song in various flavors - fire, ice, poison - to add in strategy based on resistances.  Have the damage go up from 5 extra at level 35 or so to 10 extra at 55 and maybe 12 extra at 60 (just guessing numbers here).<P>then the bard has a great new role - adding in this damage plus damage shields plus melee plus another melee buff song and the bard can do directly or indirectly enough damage to really be useful at the higher levels.<P>Couple this with #2 and you have a viable class - the rest is bug fixes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>please consider this and put it on the list along with making sure you remember we need a bit more melee and a LOT more help with crowd control</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Your list is nice, but I would still like to see instrument skill being addressed.  Why at a INT of 75 am I only able to raise my skill 2 points an hour?  The only way for a bard to keep the skill up is to go afk for hours on end, leaving their bard in a safe area to play songs.  It is not possible to keep the skill up to par just by playing them while in groups.<P>It would be nice to see our ability to raise skill based on DEX, not INT.<P>-Calli</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First let me start out by saying that your post hit the nail on the head and I hope you can fix a lot of them. Seralas's and Starling_Bane's post hits the nail on the head for me aswell so I hope you take there notes into account. There are a couple of things that you have missed though.<P>1. Faction bugs, I can't believe no one has mentioned this yet. <BR>When killing monsters bards seem to attract everyone in the groups faction as they are automatically added to the monsters hate list every tic of a song. A buffing classes and healers are able to avoid getting too much faction by refraining from buffing/healing during combat although obveously this is nessessary in some circumstances. I have also experienced faction bugs when running through a zone and some monster hits me as I run past and although I ignore them and keep going I get faction from it when it dies. I can think of one way to avoid this, which is to not pass faction around if the bard do not actually damage the monster or heal the person attacking it (this could be harder at higher levels when songs have multiple components). Of course this would not be usefull in areas where you want players to get bad faction such as lower guk dead/live side rivalry so may not be an ideal solution. If you want to experience faction bugs as a bard go and fight outside the sarnak fort for a few levels  in the lake of illomen and I garuntee you will start gaining cabilis faction as all the sarnaks in the whole fort eventually start hating you. <P><BR>2.Giving weapons to others even though trade and drop is set to never.<BR>	This is very annoying and is still happening! When I set trade items to never and drop items to never I expect to _NEVER_ give or be given anything. I still occasionally give weapons to group memebers, their pets and monsters when trying to swap instruments and weapons around. Please fix this.<P>3. Bards songs do not effect pets except in a bad way.<BR>	Bard protection and buffing songs do not effect other players' pets. Players can buff and heal pets, but bards cannot. Also when casting area effect debuffs and attacking songs the bard hits other peoples pets. If a member of the party with a pet goes linkdead there pet will start attacking the bard when the bard has taunted enough to stop it fighting the enemy.<P>Other :<P>Seralas's second post about having 1 keypress stop the other song and start the new one would be usefull.<P>I have heard that there is a cap on mez and fear so we can't mez fear things over 55. Mezing as a bard is hard enough to use to warrent the need for an enchanter. Everyone elses spells seem to keep going much longer or they get upgrades. I think either give us upgrades to these songs or make the current versions keep working at higher levels. Lullaby is a classic example this song is never that reliable to be more usefull than an enchanters mez, so why does it stop working?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Transpotter.  The large majority of items on this list are:  1) bugs which they should have fixed a long time ago, 2) data problems which they should have looked at a long time ago, 3) annoying interface problems which they should have addressed a long time ago.<P>None of these have anything to do with "balancing" the class.  They have to do with making the class work correctly, as designed.  And none of them are remotely "big" enough to have the slightest effect on class balance at high levels, which is where I believe the Bard falls vastly short.<P>The Lute of the Howler, for example, is 1/100000000000th of my concerns about the Bard class.  I'd be ticked if I lost the EFFECT that this Lute gives me, I could care less about the illusion.  But overall, they can take it out of my hands directly, they can leave it in, it doesn't fix Bards one way or the other.<P>Our songs don't scale up appropriately at high levels.<P>Our resists are relatively meaningless.<P>Our songs don't stack.<P>Our offense is the worst of all melee/hybrids.<P>Our defense is the worst of all melee/hybrids.<P>Add our melee to our casting, we fall short of any other class in the game (except, arguably, Wizards) in aggregate power/effectiveness/utility/demand.<P>We're like the 30k per year utility infielder that gets called up to pad a major league roster at the end of the season.  Yeah, if everybody else gets injured, they have a body to throw in.  That isn't balance.<P>I would hate to see them fix all the bugs and tell us "see, we gave you far more of your items than we gave to anybody else".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The things on the list seem to me to be a decent summary of most of the issues brought forward on this board.  The melee issue being omitted does disturb me, though, as well as the lack of attention to aspects related to some of the larger issues.<P>I personally am not a great technical thinker  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  My overall opinion and hopes for my bard are simple.  I'd like to see defensive skills raised, and song effectiveness scaled appropriately (as well as broken ones fixed, of course  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But I can comment on artistic continuity and feel.<P>I'd like to give one example of some aspects missed from one of the items on your list.<P>Selo's Song of Travel, 51, is Selos, Lev and Invis, together in one song.  Your list includes the aspects of song range, as well as its graphic inconsistent with bardic behavior.  But it leaves a couple of issues out which I feel are important to continuity and realism.<P>What happens is, anyone who's hit by a mob who sees invis, loses all three effects instantly.  The problems I see with that are:<P>1.  Why does Lev cancel?  The Lev spell or song doesn't drop when in combat.<BR>2. Why does Selos cancel?  SoW or Selos doesn't drop when in combat.<BR>3. Why do effects drop instantly, instead of wear off as normal?<P>We already have the rather major disadvantage of transfering aggro to all groupies through song. If it was ITU, all other party members could simply wait there till person's death and drag the body away; or plain Selos, the rest of the party could still run.. But with the way this song works, we also have the liability of having _no effect while singing_.<P>I agree that, along with benefits of song, groupies should share in liabilities.  But giving the whole group the liability of having aggro transfered to them because the song was on them, but getting no benefit from the song, is a major drawback to even having a bard around (Nillipus March of the Wee springs to mind).<P>Is there any possible justification for that?  The song should, in my opinion, continue to affect all members in range, until turned or knocked off, and then it should wear off normally, not drop instantly (um, except for the invis aspect, of course).  I believe this situation applies to other songs, but of course I can't think of it right now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>A further issue is why are beasties able to hit us when we're 30k feet (so to speak) above them?  I've Dead Man Floated over Dreadlands numerous times and never been knocked out of the sky.  Is there something different about that spell or did I just happen to get lucky when using it?<P>Which is easier to fix, a game design/coding flaw (in my opinion) or detrimental artificial limitations placed on one class due to that flaw?  I don't know, but one or the other should be done.  The ridiculousness of the situation ought to embarrass Verant enough to fix it one way or the other.<P>There's also a semi-related aspect that bard songs can be knocked off even when the mob misses.  I can sorta see that 1pt hits could knock a song off, even if it isn't a bash... heck, maybe it startled me and messed up my song  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  But I do not see how misses could ever make me stop singing.<P>I'm not gonna summarize, because I already can't explain it very well, so this'd get more too long if I tried  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Maybe I'm the only one who sees these things as connected and as important as the main issue.

</FONT><HR>Absor I think the list you gave us is pretty good except it is mostly bug fixes. I'm not sure that much of it will really "balance" us, but lets see how it goes. We are so bugged that our true power as envisioned by the developement team might come through if we were just really debugged. Two issues from your list I'd just tweak a little.  <P>Post 50 songs not ramping up fast enough - I think our songs generally don't ramp up at the same rate as other classes, but with the increase in the curve post 50 it gets much more out of hand. Compare the power of our songs to others at same level comparing the oppurtunity costs of singing's time cost vs. mana cost and you'll see this.  <P>Need more middle level instruments - I agree in general but I hope that you are including the idea of other song modifying items. Objects like our epic should appear earlier, like one instrument weapons including singing focii that boost singing effects. It seems obvious our armor should have music enhancements, much more useful than duplicating our foraging skill.  We don't really get anything like a mana boost on any item until our epic, a song skill boost would be the equivalent. If you brainstorm you can come up with lots of stuff: a magical tape loop that we can sing a song into and it plays it back over a minute or some other set duration, or that sing a particular song for us for reasonable duration, bonus to songs of particular type, items that increase duration of songs...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thaddaeus - I disagree that Bards are balanced because they can solo. As you are obviously finding out post 50, Bards need to be balanced in a group setting. I have no problem with Verant Nerfing bards ability to solo, given that they make them more groupable. Balance should be geared towards making a Bard a balanced member of a group, not giving them more soloing power. I would strongly recomend that you no longer give advice for the pre 50 levels, and focus more on your post 50 level issues. Those are the issues you obviously have a better grasp on, I in turn will not give advice post 35 which is the limit of my experience.<P>Siranui-ToD - I can not agree with you more.<P>Dalakar_Daystar - LOL, well said.<P>Issue: To some of the issues regarding Bardic songs. There are several issues with the way our songs work. For instance a Druids snare spell will probably be resisted once or maybe twice in a given battle. Where as a Bards chains song will be resisted five to ten times in any given battle. This is because chains wears off faster than snare and must be re-sung to gain effect. In exchange it does not cost the bard mana to sing this song, where as a Druid will loose 15 mana for casting the snare song. 15 mana is barely a sliver on a druids mana bar BTW. So not only is the bard penailzed by having short duration on their songs, but they are also given the secondary side effect of their songs being resisted more often. I think that the secondary negative should be removed and bard songs have their resistance lowered except for damaging spells. In a solo instance, the resistance of say... charm doesnt matter much. You just circle around and keep singing charm and selos. In a group setting, failed charms on 50% of the time cause the song to be detremental.<P>Melee skills: Because Bards cant use 2 handers and cant double attack their melee skills are pitiful.<P>1st column: Level <BR>2nd column: DW Skill Cap<BR>3rd column: DA Skill Cap <BR>4th column: Chance to Double Attack <BR>5th column: Chance to Dual Wield <BR>6th Column: Chance for Three Attacks <BR>7th Column: Chance for Four Attacks<P> <BR>1 10 10 2.20% 1.83% 0.08% 0.00% <BR>2 15 15 3.40% 2.83% 0.19% 0.00% <BR>3 20 20 4.60% 3.83% 0.34% 0.00% <BR>4 25 25 5.80% 4.83% 0.53% 0.00% <BR>5 30 30 7.00% 5.83% 0.76% 0.00% <BR>6 35 35 8.20% 6.83% 1.03% 0.00% <BR>7 40 40 9.40% 7.83% 1.33% 0.00% <BR>8 45 45 10.60% 8.83% 1.67% 0.00% <BR>9 50 50 11.80% 9.83% 2.05% 0.00% <BR>10 55 55 13.00% 10.83% 2.45% 0.00% <BR>11 60 60 14.20% 11.83% 2.88% 0.00% <BR>12 65 65 15.40% 12.83% 3.34% 0.00% <BR>13 70 70 16.60% 13.83% 3.83% 0.00% <BR>14 75 75 17.80% 14.83% 4.34% 0.00% <BR>15 80 80 19.00% 15.83% 4.87% 0.00% <BR>16 85 85 20.20% 16.83% 5.43% 0.00% <BR>17 90 90 21.40% 17.83% 6.00% 0.00% <BR>18 95 95 22.60% 18.83% 6.59% 0.00% <BR>19 100 100 23.80% 19.83% 7.19% 0.00% <BR>20 105 105 25.00% 20.83% 7.81% 0.00% <BR>21 110 110 26.20% 21.83% 8.44% 0.00% <BR>22 115 115 27.40% 22.83% 9.08% 0.00% <BR>23 120 120 28.60% 23.83% 9.73% 0.00% <BR>24 125 125 29.80% 24.83% 10.39% 0.00% <BR>25 130 130 31.00% 25.83% 11.05% 0.00% <BR>26 135 135 32.20% 26.83% 11.72% 0.00% <BR>27 140 140 33.40% 27.83% 12.38% 0.00% <BR>28 145 145 34.60% 28.83% 13.05% 0.00% <BR>29 150 150 35.80% 29.83% 13.71% 3.82% <BR>30 155 155 37.00% 30.83% 14.37% 4.22% <BR>31 160 160 38.20% 31.83% 15.03% 4.65% <BR>32 165 165 39.40% 32.83% 15.68% 6.92% <BR>33 170 170 40.60% 33.83% 16.32% 5.58% <BR>34 175 175 41.80% 34.83% 16.95% 6.09% <BR>35 180 180 43.00% 35.83% 17.57% 6.63% <BR>36 185 185 44.20% 36.83% 18.17% 7.20% <BR>37 190 190 45.40% 37.83% 18.76% 7.80% <BR>38 195 195 46.60% 38.83% 19.33% 8.43% <BR>39 200 200 47.80% 39.83% 19.88% 9.10% <BR>40 200 200 48.00% 40.00% 19.97% 9.22% <BR>41 200 200 48.20% 40.17% 20.06% 9.33% <BR>42 200 200 48.40% 40.33% 20.15% 9.45% <BR>43 200 200 48.60% 40.50% 20.23% 9.57% <BR>44 200 200 48.80% 40.67% 20.32% 9.68% <BR>45 200 200 49.00% 40.83% 20.41% 9.80% <BR>46 200 200 49.20% 41.00% 20.49% 9.92% <BR>47 200 200 49.40% 41.17% 20.58% 10.05% <BR>48 200 200 49.60% 41.33% 20.67% 10.17% <BR>49 200 200 49.80% 41.50% 20.75% 10.29% <BR>50 200 200 50.00% 41.67% 20.83% 10.42% <P>This chart indicates that double attack is more efficient that dual wield.

</FONT><HR>&gt; ITEM: Song Damage Post 50.<P>&gt; DESCRIPTION: Most bard songs are intended to be<BR>&gt; used throughout the life of the bard. But bard <BR>&gt; damage songs don't seem to grow enough in their <BR>&gt; damage for levels over 50. Considering the <BR>&gt; difficulty of these levels, and the dramatic <BR>&gt; increase in the power of the monsters at those <BR>&gt; levels, perhaps a damage increase is warranted. <BR>&gt; And example from a player: "Chant series as an <BR>&gt; example (a targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50, <BR>&gt; the song increases from 39 damage for 3 ticks <BR>&gt; to 48 damage for 3 ticks (+23%). From levels 50 <BR>&gt; to 60 it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You <BR>&gt; designed the level 50+ spells to represent a <BR>&gt; larger increase in power than just 10 levels." <BR>&gt; The damage increases as a flat number (9 <BR>&gt; points) over both level ranges. But levels 40-<BR>&gt; 50 are much more linear, both in experience and <BR>&gt; in difficulty, than are 51-60. So perhaps <BR>&gt; increasing the damage of bard songs in this <BR>&gt; level range is in order.<P>&gt; STATUS: None<P>&gt; NOTE: Chords of Dissonance, Brusco’s Boa****l <BR>&gt; Bellow, Denon’s Disruptive Discord, Denon’s <BR>&gt; Desperate Durge, Fufil’s Curtailing Chant, <BR>&gt; Tuyen’s Chant of Frost, and Tuyen’s Chant of <BR>&gt; Flame.<P><BR>This is missing the forest for the trees.  <P>The problem is NOT that bard damage doesn't scale post-50; the damage is a specific example of the more general problem. <P>The problem is that other classes abilities improve non-linearly as they go up in level; with this non-linearity becoming more pronounced post-50.  <BR>   <BR>Damage is not a particular strength of bards; and one we get fairly late.  It is a reasonable expectation that roles will change over time; the role a bard might play at 20 is not the necessarily same role as at 40, nor is it necessarily the same role as at 60.  <P>Whether or not damage should be a role of bards post-50 is a matter of class-balance based on the Vision(tm) of what a bard should be.  This needs to be looked at in the context if the way ALL bard abilties develop over time, and not in isolation.<P>What needs to be addressed is that, IN GENERAL, bard abilities do not scale up in relation to other classes abilities.  While some abilities may come into, and out of, pre-eminence for a class... overall, the abilities should stay relatively the same.  <P>This can be addressed in a couple ways:  <P><BR>(a) Efficiency<BR>Bards songs might become more efficient; if they have 2 effects intead of 1... that's like being able to twist another song.  Resitances should be the same as each song individually.<P>(b) Effectiveness Caps<BR>Remove any caps on bard songs that prevent them from being more useful, and make sure all songs scale up over time.  For some songs, this might be to increase the area of effect and duration.  <P>(c) Non-Linear Effectiveness<BR>Increase the effectiveness of bard songs in a non-linear fashion.  One way of doing this is to give bards an extra effective level at 30,35,40,45,50-60.  (i.e. a level 47 bard's songs might be as effective as a current lvl 51 bard's songs.)<P>--------------------------------------------<BR>       PLEASE REWRITE THIS ITEM<BR>--------------------------------------------<P>ITEM:  Song Effectiveness<P>DESCRIPTION:    Most bard songs are intended to be<BR>used throughout the life of the bard, but bard <BR>most songs don't seem to grow enough in their <BR>effectiveness for levels over 50.

</FONT><HR>---<P>ITEM: Song Twisting.<P>DESCRIPTION: The problem is, the ability to twist songs is what separates the bad bards from the reasonably good bards (it takes more than the ability to twist to be a great bard, though). So while some bards are calling for us to come up with a way that they can twist songs without all the repetitive motion, others consider it part of the challenge of the class and want us to leave it as it is. Perhaps songs could keep going once started. Allow more than one song to run at a time this way, restrict it by either limiting this to three at a time, or have the number that could be sung at the same time by level, perhaps one at a time to 19th level, two at a time from 20th to 39th level, and three from then on. But also allow songs to be turned off as they are now, to continue to allow twisting.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>I don't believe song twisting requires skill at all and seperates good and bad bards. Even a monkey can hit 3 keys in order.<P>Couple problems with twisting:<BR>* I cannot communicate well with my group members; I cannot chat with them while twisting songs. Because I have to keep hitting these keys ALL THE TIME in order to twist 3 songs. So if you are in a continious-pulling group you have NO TIME chatting and therefore socializing.<BR>* Two Words: CARPAL TUNNEL<P><BR>Twisting more songs won’t make you a good bard. Selecting and playing right songs during battle and downtime makes you a good bard and/or crowd controlling with or without having an enchanter in the group makes you a good bard.<P>Let 3 songs play together after lvl 39.<P>my 2cp...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think something big has been overlooked:  Bards are useless in a pet enviroment.  Let me give an example:<P>I'll be a level 26 bard, now if I group with 5 mages I'm immediately pointless.  The mages will sit there to meditate, and they'll cast spells on their pets.  What will a bard do?  Well, he can't do any healing, the mages aren't taking damage, the pets are.  He can't do any stat buffs, the mages don't need +Haste, or +Str, their pets are fighting.  They don't need resists raised, they're not being cast at, their pets are.  We can attack along with their pets, but at that point we're doing a warriors work and why not just have a warrior in my place?  The one case bards are useful is in the rare need of escape, with our running song, but wait, no, Bards can't use their running song indoors, so we're back to being useless except as a weak warrior.  This isn't just with mages, either; its with Necros and enchanters, as well.  And I'll be the first to say that an all pet-group is rare, but the fact is this example is just the extreme, the point isn't any less valid when there is only one mage/necro/enchanter in the group.  We're almost entirely useless to them, they'd be happier with one of almost any other class in my place.  The easiest, and most sensical solution is to make pets affected by our songs, then we have a purpose.  "But, wait!" Absor and entourage screams, "that will make Bards way overpowerful!"  Well, I'd like to know how.  A shaman can buff a pets stats up the wazzoo, yet that isn't unbalanced?  A Druid can cast sow on a pet but that isn't unbalanced?  A cleric can heal a pet, yet THAT isn't unbalanced?  I could go on, really I could, but the point is bards being able to affect pets is in no way unbalancing.  Us helping them is as if we were helping the mages/necros/enchanters in their place, since we can't help them.  But now you may be saying, "What about twisting so that you're helping both master and pet at higher leverls?"  Simple:  their is only one song you can use to help a necro/ench/mage during battle, the mana song, which is pulse based, meaning twisting it GREATLY reduces its effectiveness.  So, we'd be only helping them nominally more than usual, once again that isn't causing balance problems. The only problem I see is Verant not wanting to make an underappreciated class look more attractive.  Then pet-classes might do something more than laugh when they see a Bard run past them strumming their stick...err...drum(wait...don't you beat a drum?  Oh well, silly bards).  Let me sum this all up in a simple statement:<P>Until we can affect pets with our songs, bards are useless to pet-relying classes.<P><BR>Thanks for reading this far, if you do, Absor.<P>Bralyst Maelstrum, 26th Verse Bard<BR>Cabrill Kalin, 16th Verse Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Byucu:<P>I agree with you wholeheartedly on the "twisting skill" pride issue... it's not hard, it's just tedious, and unfairly penalizes the slow refresh, slow connection folks (since Verant HAS balanced songs with multiple songs playing in mind ever since this first came to light in beta).<P>The only true "skill" a bard displays is the facility with which they "change up" songs to fit a situation. There's the skill... active management of a combat through song choice: whether it's dealing with unexpected additions through charm, or noticing the wizards are getting too many resists and throwing in a pixie strike or curtailing chant, or focussing on AC reducing songs when the warriors are only nicking a monster, or even screeching like mad to clear the area so a caster can get their evacuate spell off without being interrupted.<P>I'd really like to see an end to the "carpal tunnel" cries. If you're getting carpal tunnel syndrom from a double key press every 5 or 6 seconds, then you have a hardware problem, not a game design problem. I suspect these cries are simply an effort to push the issue into a more "serious" level. I think this sidetracks the issue and is not really helping the cause.<P>Much more annoying is the fact that while everyone else is happily chatting away, the bard has to press, wait, press press, wait, press press, wait.... while keeping an eye on the screen for the everpresent resists. You CANNOT have meaningful communications without losing something in the middle there, macros are not a clean solution either...<P>Finally, for those who seem to think that three songs being played at once is "unrealistic"... consider it a weaving, or twisting if you will, of those three songs. How singing a song for 5 seconds then swapping to another, and then another is more "realistic" for a bard, I'll never know.<P>In a perfect world, with unlimited resources, I'd say change the songs so you can pick a rhythm, melody, and vocal portion and create one "twisted" song to suit. It'd make a nice explanation why certain types are unstackable (can't play two rhythms in one song) and be a generally fun way to envision what it is we're doing.<P>but... as they say... "We're in their world now..."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is something I havnt seen posted anywhere, yet I experience on a daily basis with my bard.  Today it happened to kill me.  The speed songs and zones.  I find all the time while running through tunnel type and or smaller zones I run through them with selo's on.  As in right through the zone point.  For example today I am at the zone to karnors looking for a group, I have Selo's on and a train comes, it beats on me I run for zone..  I run through the zone, around the back portion that no one else goes to, backwards through the other side of the zone, making a circle..  Again through the zone I originally ran through and out again out the opposite side, now in case you dont understand the running in circles, I ran through the zone four times before dieing to the train.  Two full circles of the entrance to karnors.  I have this happen on a daily basis, running through the zone to Firiona from Dreadlans...  <P>On another note, I still run off the map, I know that most of these have been fixed but it still happens fairly frequently in newer zones..  I had a heck of a time getting my HS key because I couldnt seem to run through the tunnel to the Drogaz fellow, I kept running under the zone inside that tunnel.  I'd wander around under the zone until it decided I was far enough under the zone to teleport me to a safe point.  Very kind of the programmers to put the safe point a stones through from Cabilis.<P>Basically I guess I'm asking to please please fix current song bugs.  They are truly the most annoying things.  There are song bugs that have been around since beta that still arent fixed.  Such as the you slow down, you speed up, you slow down up thing.  I only played a bard in the beginning of eq for a short time simply because they were so buggy.  I've played one now till 54 and had a lot of fun except for the bugs.  The bugs make me more angry than anything else.<P>Thanks for your time...

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Resists.<P>DESCRIPTION: One of the key things that bards offer their groups, especially at higher levels, is resistance boosting. Bards would like to see a greater value for resists that get up to or near 255. There is also a rumor that there is a roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 that should be dispelled.<P>STATUS: None<P>Ok.. I am in a fairly large guild that raids often on the Nameless server.  I, along with several other members of my guild, have noticed that having resists exceed 255 does in fact make you resist less often.  A bard using the resist song sending resists flying well over 255 or even well into the 300s means you are going to get hit by whatever AE that dragon/uber is throwing out.  Saying you need to dispel this rumor means you dont think it even exists.. I think this needs to be looked at more closely because we raid constantly and this is becoming a big concern in fights where resists are THE KEY.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Since it is a potpourri you can consider this a new song. Verant can give us let’s say 3 more spell gem slots that we can compose our potpourri in it and we can play that with one keystroke.<P>About carpal tunnel, yes it is a real issue. Do the math:<P>2 keystrokes per 4 seconds (start song, stop song)<BR>2*15 keystrokes per minute = 30 keystrokes per minute.<BR>1 hour playing 60*30 = 1800 keystrokes.<BR>2 hour playing = 3600 keystrokes.<P>I don’t know what you think but this seems A LOT of keystrokes to me and it is UNNECESSARY since it can be fixed by better user interface.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello again,<P>Two things I would like to touch on in this post:<P>1.  I would like to reiterate my earlier suggestion that picking locks should be moved from an all-or-nothing based on skill to a time delay to pick a lock based on skill.  The higher your skill, the less time it would take you to open a lock.  That way, we can still be useful to upen doors and hopefully locked chests in the future, but not quite as useful as a Rogue for the same thing.<P>2.  I was lucky enough to earn a Harmonic Dagger today while fighting in Karnor's, but during the 2 hours of almost constant fighting deep within the castle not ONE SINGLE proc took--they were all resisted.  Keep in mind that I am level 52, and all the mobs were blue to me, some very blue.  This is far too often to be simply chance.<P>   In closing, I would like to cast my vote in favor of an auto-twist feature.  I can't stand not being able to talk to others while combat is going on, and it does produce a strain on my wrists to play this character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Song Damage Post 50. <BR>Bards songs damage does not grow at the rate that other caster spells do ever.  This is not exclusively a post 50 issue.  Please correct the damage curve to match that of other spell casters.<BR>--- <BR>ITEMS: Haste Song Stacking. <BR>Reaching the speed cap sooner doesn’t completely address the issue.  Bard haste should either be a viable substitute for Enchanter haste or should at least balance the damage reduction that occurs by removing a fighter from a group and replacing them with a Bard.  One solution would be to allow Bard Haste to exceed the 75% cap by 10% to 15%.  A better solution would be to allow Bard haste to reduce casting and recasting times.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Bard 'Snare' Songs. <BR>There should only be two Bard snare songs.  One targeted and one AoE.  Both of these should scale to continue to be effective through the entire career of the Bard.  Bard Songs should not need replacements if they work at a level appropriate effectiveness.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Mana Regeneration (Meditation). <BR>I would prefer that Bards never used Manna.  By preference use a recast timer.  Dennon’s Desperate Dirge should be reviewed as to purpose and effectiveness.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51). <BR>Any song designed to make travel safer and more convenient should be nearly foolproof.

Cap the number of songs a Bard may sing concurrently at something like Lev/15 +1 (round down).  Gain the skill sometime after 15th level.  As each song after the first is added to the medley a skill check is taken with a failure bringing all songs to a stop.<BR>This doesn’t seem easy to implement.  Please, at a minimum, cause a click on a song to simply stop the old song and start the new one.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Mid-Level Instruments. <BR>Access to mid-level or level appropriate equipment appears to be a general problem for all classes.  Support the non-twinkers, make mid-level equipment reasonable to get a hold of.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Brusco’s Bombastic Bellow. <BR>See the comments on Manna Regeneration, Song Damage, and Bard Snare songs.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Travel Song Range. <BR>See the comments on Aria of Eagles and Song of Travel.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Song ‘Stacking’. <BR>While you address stacking with Clarity this is a broader issue.  All bard songs should enhance or not interfere with spells cast by anyone who isn’t an opponent.  If someone has SoW and is grouped with a Bard singing Accelerondo, the faster should be active without overwriting SoW.  The same should apply to Bardic Mezz, Lull, Fear etc.  If the effect can stack without being unbalancing, it should stack.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Mesmerization and Fear Song Stacking. <BR>See comments on Song Stacking<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Instrument Building Skill. <BR>Please consider not only ‘cultural’ instruments but imbued and enchanted instruments as well.  Also see comments on Mid-Level Instruments.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Spell Gems. <BR>Grayed spell gems would probably not hurt any casting class.  Also see comments on Song Twisting.<BR>--- <BR>ITEM: Hit Points. <BR>I do not see a problem with Bards having the least Hit Points of any Hybrid class as long as the other abilities are balanced to take this into account.  A determination needs to be made as to whether a Bard is truly a melee class at all.  If it is, then either the Bards effective single target combat damage (not necessarily melee) needs to be increased or the ability to Tank needs to be increased (whether through increased HP or defensive skills) as Bards are not currently effective in either role after 20th level.  Please note that effective damage is not simply the ability to generate damage but the ability to do so in a group without dieing.  Monks can Feign Death and Mend for a reason.  Rogues get Evade for a reason.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Somebody wrote<BR>------QOUTE------<BR>I'd really like to see an end to the "carpal tunnel" cries. If you're getting carpal tunnel syndrom from a double key press every 5 or 6 seconds, then you have a hardware problem, not a game design problem. I suspect these cries are simply an effort to push the issue into a more "serious" level. I think this sidetracks the issue and is not really helping the cause.<BR>-----End QOUTE ----<P>Well I for one is starting to get damaged by twisting songs. I ve been playing a bard since beta and my current bard is from april 99  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> So ive been playing for almost 2 years and I can tell you that the repetive motion of twisting DO give you damages when done long enough. I personally have started to use my other hand for twisting since my left hand/arm/shoulder now a days will start to hurt after a short while.<P>As you also say there is other benefits from some kind of auto twisting Like the ability to fire off commands to group members during battle. <BR>I think the best sollution is to allow bards to start 3 songs at at time and then add a very small chance that we miss a note even after a song is started. I belive that today if we start a song it will never fail. For balance reasons I can see why this should be changed if bards where allowed to start more than one song at a time.<P>Musiker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the love of bards, the list of what should be added to fix/improve could go on forever.<P>Bards are a sum of their parts.<BR>Remember that.<BR>Tank problems are easy to identify, how do you make them tank better.<BR>Offensive damage dealers the same, just figure out how to make them better.<P>Bards aren't like that.  You have to look at the whole of what they do.<P>**People ask that melee skills go up so total damage output increases.  Do bards need that?<BR>Not really, with just sionaches and evensong I'm doing just fine, about where I should be.. part melee.  If we want to be more melee orientated(monk/rogue like) we would lose some other things, useful or not.. but still lose out on some abilities.<P>**People ask that our damage overall and songs be increased at the same curve as other classes.  Aye we should, as long as we keep the same proportion as was maintained prior 50, there should be no problem increasing mana regen, hp regen, haste %, stat buff, resist buff, melee damage, hp, etc.<P>**AC/HP is low say many.  The "plate" armor has low ac(odd melodic bp has 42.. yet gloves are less than SS?  Seems fishy) for plate, and our HP rivals casters.  I often group with a 54th wizard, and it is truely sad when she self buffs, her hp is 58 lower than mine.  3 level difference there.  I would have thought a wizard of all things to have less hp than a bard up to 10 levels ahead of the bard. <P>Are those not the 3 biggest concerns on improving bards?<P>The other concerns are not "improving" bards, they are improving "gameplay".<P>**Stacking.  Critical.  Things dont stack right, haste heading the list, followed by ordering of icons, if some are up others bounce.  If that remains true, at least put order to it.<P>**Pets.  I believe it was stated pets are balanced as is and any effects placed on them would unbalance them?  I have seen many times, shamans hasting pets, clerics giving them buffs, druids giving them damage shields, and clerics ch'ing them.  What did you mean by they shouldn't be effected?<P>**Illusions.  We really dont *need* lute of the howler.  Enchanters dont really *need* WW illusion either.  Yes that was a unique look.  But how often have you seen them display that unique look?  After they finally get that spell and scare newbies.. I haven't seen them use it since.  The boon is a good spell, but what is the problem with it on a self only lute?  Chanter casts boon on bard, bard turns into ww.  Bard casts lute effect, bard turns into ww.  As long as it is self only, where is the harm?  It is already established bards are the poorest of melee.<P><BR>**Twisting.  People complain about playing just manasong.  If nothing is resultant of the "autotwist" ideas, remember this, after a few rounds of massive twisting, just let them enjoy the manasong.. give your hands a rest.  Often times I am forced to reply to tells between twisting.. and change the song winamp is playing.  I hope autotwist does get implemented, but there are alternatives to getting carpal.<P>There is so much more that I could say, but does it matter?<BR>Any changes that come into effect from this class balancing, will always have pos/neg feedback.  Just please keep us balanced.<BR>Increasing our melee but taking away something else doesnt balance our class, it just makes us more one sided.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quote:<BR>A bard with backstab is just laughable, as I also said in an earlier post, Bard's should never ever get this skill, and I sure hope Verant doesn't considder it. Point in case, a guy singing isn't going to slip a dagger into somone without being noticed.<P>...<BR>  And a guy hitting an opponant about 5 times a second with two daggers probably can't do it without being noticed either. Backstab effect in EQ has no dependance on being noticed at all. Backstab was suggested as a way to raise mellee output because:<BR>a) We're supposed to be semi-rogue anyway<BR>b) It requires skill to use effectivly, especially when twisting songs and doing CC etc.<P><BR>  I do find the idea of pets getting boosts from songs laughable though...it's a lump of rock/a reanimated pile of bones... how is music going to stir it's soul?<P><BR>  Haste stacks are kinda moot in many ways post 50. By the time the chanter has Shizzared you (66%) and if you're wearing any kind of haste item (19%), then you're right on the 85% haste cap anyway...even if the songs stacked in there would be now increase in haste.<P>Quote:<BR>About carpal tunnel, yes it is a real issue. Do the math:<BR>2 keystrokes per 4 seconds (start song, stop song)<BR>2*15 keystrokes per minute = 30 keystrokes per minute.<BR>1 hour playing 60*30 = 1800 keystrokes.<P>...<BR>  This firstly assumes that you twist between pulls. I don't know any bards who do this except in real touch-and-go situations.<BR>  I type in the region of 50 words a minute (Slower than a decent secetary) = 200 keypresses a minute = 12,000 per hour. I've probably done more keystrokes in this post than a player would do in two hours. I don't have carpel tunnel syndrome. I might get a sore wrist once in a while when playing my bard like I did the other day when I did KC/fear/hate back to back with constant pulls for 20 hours, but it was gone by morning. Carpel tunnel syndrome is a problem amongs people who stress their wrists every day for years on end. I don't know any secetaries or IT workers who suffer from it.<P><BR>  The problem with the 51st travel song is that spells are designed so that when one componant drops then the whole thing crashes down. I explained in an earlier post why this was bad for the game in the case of this song. This is a utility song and is so used for decreasing down-time. When someone looses the song and falls 10k/gets lost/gets aggroed and died, this increases unessesary down-time further (something I understood VI were trying to cut down). The solution as I see it is for this song to 'create' 2 spells and 2 icons. One icon for the invis effect and the other for see invis/levi/speed. This way, if someone is aggroed he doesn't immediatly loose the rest of his group, fall behind and take falling damage.<P><BR>Siranui<BR>&lt;Tides of Destiny&gt;<BR>Torv<BR>forteymj@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>guys, about the twisting thing, first, a good bard, can, on a good day, with a good connection, and a good computer, twist 4 songs.  I've done it for a couple cycles, and it's really hard, about as hard as 4 ball juggling, but it's posible under ideal circumstances.  Also, I have to agree it's tedious beyond belief to twist 3, and is very irritating to be unable to communicate with everyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SIRANUI-ToD<P>Carpal Tunnel is a repetitive stress injury. Tendonitis also is a repetitive stress injury. It is self-explanatory really, As much as you repeat doing something higher chance that you'll get one.<P>I have been in IT business more then 13 years now and I have seen a lot of people getting repetitive stress injuries.<P>You may not have a repetitive stress injury right now but can you guarantee you are not going to get one? Believe me, when you get it, it will be too late for you to change what you did. So since you have an opportunity to change something now try to be supportive.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
