</FONT><HR>I am a part time EQ player and have only reached lv20 so far and find the reading in what is in store for me at the upper levels is interesting.  The overrideing theme seems to be that the role of the Wizard is undefined since the definition that Verant has given the Wizard clearly does not fit anymore.  Several people have given some keen insights to fundamental problems and some innovative solutions.  Kudos to them.  To the yelling, screaming, and criticizm of authors (rather than the class) even if it is polite, shame on you.  I would just like to add my opinions and comments to this discussion.<P>Epic Quest - I have no fundamental problem with a quest being X amount harder than another quest.  But is the risk and time worth the reward?  (I can't answer that since I don't know, but a phenomenal risk implies a phenomenal reward.)<P>Mana Efficiency - this would encompass casting speed, mana cost, resists, fizzles, aggro rate, effectiveness, etc ...  Wizards should be the best 'pure' caster in the game.  Our friend Al'Kabor, should represent the pinnacle of casters (his spell line not included).  If there are two spells that have similar effects (such as damage) the Wizard should do it better than another class and Significantly so.  Various aspects of this have been beated to death about this ... and I agree with most of what I have read.<P>Groupability - Again, beaten to death, but what gives us that Wizardly Aura?<P>A few other thoughs and ideas:<P>Tools - As the Class voted most likely to 'search for knowledge', how come we mem 8 spells just like other casters and have roughly the same quantity (albiet, different) of spells as other casters?  A wizard should have a spell for every occasion.  Should they all be useful in a battle?  Heck no!  How about a pyrotechnics spell for weddings and parties?  Gnomes can make fireworks, so it would be a simple add on.  Higher level fireworks spells could be different shapes or motion.  A larger range of tools would allows us to customize for zone, the MOB we are hunting, or the composition of the group we are in.  <BR>  A larger selection of memorized spells would allow us to use the mana we have more prudently by having the ideal spells ready to go.  Perhaps a spell slot becomes a double slot every 6 levels or so.  That would max out at lv 48 and would let us look forward to some of the intermediate levels between new spells.  We could also potentailly get more confused about what spell we put where and cast the wrong one.  Perfectly in line with the nature of a Wizard.<P>Upgrade/New spell lines - In the same vein as Tools.  While easy enough to say, they need to be creative so as to not duplicate other classes, which in turn could increase our group ability.<BR>  The image of a Wizard in literature is one where the heros/villans are held back from the Wizard by some unseen force.  Except for Root, I really don't get that feel and even Root doesn't really capture it.  Now most people are opposed to pets and, in the sense of how other casters get them, I am too.  But how about a line of shield spells that are centered on the caster and extend outward some distance.  This could be considered a non-attacking (okay, maybe just aggro) pet with so many hp before it dies and the MOB is free to attack the caster.  The distance it extends out should be smaller than the PB AoE spells so it could allow the caster to use these when he aggos multiple MOBs.  Now the Shieldskin line of spells I don't use since a hit still intterupts my spells, so it does not matter that I have extra hit points.  You could revamp this line of spells so it extends out for the Wiz and could also be used to protect any group members who are standing within the shield perimeter.  Drawbacks to this type of spell could be that the Wizard also moves slower when the shield is up.<BR>  A 'search' pet - Again, invisible so no new graphics.  Does no damage, dies in a flash, but you could tell it to "/Pet find Kizdean Gix" and it would wander around until it found Kizdean Gix and then tell you his Loc and die, or "/Pet pull A ORC" then it would wander around until it found A ORC, tell you "A ORC incoming master", then aggro it like Eye of Zomm does, die, and the A ORC would come chasing after you.  It would give the Wizard the option of being the puller for a group, although the downside of the pet wandering aimlessly around a zone or pulling at a bad time are obvious.  You could call it 'Zomm's Seeking Eye' so the pet casters don't get jelous.<P>  Skills - The ability to have a double effect.  Single casting time, twice the effect, 3/4 the mana, three times the aggro.  Again, would increase our rate and efficience to do damage but also put us at the top of the aggro list.<BR>  Also Dual cast, which could be used if you incrase the number of spell slots as suggested above.  This could be that the adjacent spell does not have a 'down time' when the first is cast.  Then afterward, the usually 'down time' after a spell is cast would be longer.  This would allow for combos for exceedingly fast damage ability (Lightning Bolt/Flame Shock), defensive retreat (Root/Fade or Fade/Gate), or combo (Fingers of Fire/Shadow Step).<P>Anyways, I'm just trying to not only comment and make class suggestions, but to try to help bring an identity to the Wizard class<P>Fredre<BR>20th level of Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry boys and girls.<P>Due to unintentional nerfing to the wiz class (resulting from class-balancing that has been occuring since the game went retail):  the quantity of issues with the wizard class are so great, VI will most probably NOT fix them.  It's sad really, seeing has how I too have a post-50s wizard on Tribunal.<P>But the reality of the situation is that you should do exactly what I was forced to do: start over with a class that VI cares about and wait for the next big thing.<P>You know it's actually kind of funny, in a sick kind of way.  Every night I log in my bard and I see dozens of shouts for TPs and offers of ungodly ammounts of cash.  Too bad that half the taxiers are now gone or playing another class.<P>Hey Absor, get bored sometime do a /who all 50 60 wiz and see how many of us are left around anymore.  Come on, I invite you to log into ANY production server and at ANY primetime and see.<P>Save your time and your breath brothers and sisters.  Nothing is going to change.  I know, because I've been screaming at the top of my lungs for almost 2 years now to no avail.<P>Be safe<BR>Trilidar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't think Verant doesn't care, else i wouldn't have wasted my time with this list that i Feel ALL casters should be given, not just wizards. <BR>--------------------------<BR>Class Balance Issue: Wizard Disciplines:<P>Why: Before Kunark, the classes were (supposedly) balanced. We wizards did 1/6-1/3 of the damage of a typical mob pulled for xp, and there were no disciplines. Post kunark, wizards spells did the same amount of damage (look at lvl 60 sunstrike, only a 500 point upgrade to ice comet, which does 1120 at lvl 50 already!… though the mana cost/damage is surprisingly better, thank you for that Verant.)<P>We wizards are being outdamaged by the second, in long and short term battles. Another wizard posted that the avg rogue in his guild does 80/sec while he was pulling 25/ but ONLY if 2 and only 2 of his lures were resisted, any more, and his dmg/sec took a greater beating.<P>What we need: Disciplines to make us more capable casters, along the lines of the ones given to warriors and the other melee classes. Personally, I believe that ALL caster classes need these disciplines, and will try to make them as non-class specific as possible.<P>Lvl 51- Discipline of Resistance: +3 to all saves, just like warrior discipline (reuse time the same as well). Since we casters have to be in melee range to cast on mobs with aoe damage spells, no reason why we should be the least resistant ones to such spells. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 52- Discipline of Void: While under the effect of this discipline, no spells will fizzle, and no spells can be interrupted, even if walking or running. Duration: 3 mins, reuse 15 mins. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.  Our spells will still cause agro, so chain-casting will still be unwanted, it just makes more efficient use of our mana, which all wizards need.<P>Lvl 53- Discipline of Channeling: When using this discipline the wizard will automatically land all casts against his opponent. In other words he will not miss. This discipline lasts for 14 seconds and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 54- Discipline of Mana: When using this discipline, the wizard will automatically receive the specialization mana-cost for each of his spells.  Discipline lasts 2 minutes, reuse: 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 55- Discipline of Redirection: When using this discipline, the wizard will not increase agro when casting. It will be just like if the wizard used concussion 3 times after casting his spell, particularly useful if spells are fully resisted but the full damage is placed in the monster’s agro table and it comes for the wizard anyway.  Duration: 3 minutes, reuse 30. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 56- Discipline of Evocation: When using this discipline damage output by the wizard is increased by a certain percentage. Say 10 or 20%.  Duration: 30 seconds, Reuse 30 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 57- Discipline of Duration: When using this discipline, spells cast by the wizard will have an increase in their duration, say 50% that is applied immediately to the spells duration. So if invisibility were cast, and it has a maximum duration of say 10 minutes, it will have a minimum of 5 minutes, and a maximum of 15 minutes when using this discipline. Duration: 3 minutes, recast 30 minutes. <P>Lvl 58- Discipline of Fell Cast: When using this discipline, a wizard’s damage will be multiplied by 4, but the mana cost will also be multiplied by 4, and specialization will not count when subtracting mana from the pool available. Duration 9 seconds, reuse 15 minutes.  Additional note: if the spell hits for 2 dmg, then the spell will hit for 8 dmg with the discipline, but still cost the 4x regular cost. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 59- Discipline of Absorption: When using this discipline, a wizard will be immune to any magic cast upon them, including dots and fears, but of course can be hit by melee. Duration 8 seconds, reuse time 60 minutes The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the wizard gains additional levels.<P>Lvl 60- Discipline of Haste: When using this discipline, a wizard’s spells will be cast at some fraction of their normal casting speed. Say 60%. I would much rather have caster haste items in the game, but I will settle for getting this discipline at lvl 60. This would be the thing that all casters aspire to, just like pre-kunark everyone aspired to getting Ice Comet. Duration: 3 minutes, reuse delay 30 minutes. <P>I feel that these disciplines address many of the posted concerns that I have read, including damage output and even my own personal wish: caster haste. I was unable to find the thread at graffe.com that had the disciplines, so I made these ones up (save the one about uninterruptible casting, I remember reading that one over at graffe.com—though I named it myself) based wholly on the warrior disciplines at the same lvls. <P>-Sawz<BR>51st Channeler of the SP<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We wizards are weak to start, and weak at the end, I was just trying to get us disciplines (which traditionally are post 50) that would help to bring us more in line with what we should be as a class, as well as what the other caster classes should be, in relation to melee classes. <P>What specifically do you feel is wrong with the pre-50 wizards, and how do you want them fixed?

</FONT><HR>Sawzem:<P>The pre 50 wizard has some of the same problems as post 50.  The main problem is that pre50 we still only outshined our fellow casters by a minimal amount or they outdamaged us (remember that 34 bolt spell that mages had that outdamage us....??)  Think if a Cleric was not the best at healing at all levels above 12?  We should be able to compare our class/level to other casters class/level and outdamamge the b'jesus out of them.  At least 20% more damamge.<P>We give up a pet, group buffs, hitpoints, attack rating, and Armor Class so we can do one thing really really good...direct damage.  Lets make sure that happens.<P>I do really like your ideas.  I would hope some are made into a Skill instead of a disc that we could get at say..lvl 34 and gain ability as we move through levels.  I honestly do not want to wait another 7 levels to get a disc at lvl 60 to make me wanted in a group...I did that for 49 levels to get Ice Comet.<P>Cheers,<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I, personally, have found nothing lacking as a wizard at 34.  I understand that mage blasts outdamage mine at this level, which sucks, but it doesn't particularly bother me.  I think fast damage is underrated by most players, but the reason I think that is that at my current level, mobs have sufficiently low hit points compared to my blast size that I can take them down really really fast.  If upper level blasts can't do the same, then the value of fast damage is reduced, and that makes me extremely nervous about what I will find when I get there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My first post on this topic. (I read all 6 discussions).<P>First, all of you..or a great majority have come up with wonderful suggestions in regards to Wizards. However, I think any fix that Verant puts in..or any change, will be two sided. After playing this game since Beta 4, I don't believe for one second that they will add something beneficial to our class without taking away something beneficial, or hindering us in some way we haven't yet seen.<P>Everyone who has eyes, and can read, pretty much knows what a wizard should be, especially in comparison to other casting classes, save the Necromancer, who should in essence be a dark wizard.<P>Now, I can't comment on stats, spells, abilities, etc, well..I won't, because you've all done a more than adequate job. But in a fantasy game, being a Wizard should mean something. I just finished Lord of the Rings, and the EQ wizard is laughable in comparison to Gandal, Sauron, etc.<P>Same thing in other books. Wizards, and Necromancers are supposed to be unbelievable forces. Mages also, except mages are supposed to be specialized in elements such as Fire, Water etc. But from what I've read, no one mage specializes in more than 2. Anyway the casters in EQ are more like, well, just that, casters. 3 Casting classes with a mixture of spells, abilities, etc..between them. The reason I say 3 is because the 4th, the Enchanter, actually lives up to it's name. No one can do what an enchanter can.<P>Overall, I don't know what Verant can do. Or what they can do. The classes should have been done right, and fixed, before the game was created, somewhat like AD&D. If they wanted to change the rules and abilities, they should have done it in between games, after EQ but before EQ 2.  I played my wizard to 55. But my wizard was at his best, when compared to the rest of the world, at level 49.  After that, things just became crazy. There were problems already, but after 49, classes just went haywire.<P>Don't give up the fight folks, but don't hope for two much, or think that any benefits won't come without a price. A steep price. Most of you have played for a long time, you know what VI can and will do to classes when they decide to change them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Doing melee damage is by far the way to go in EQ and as a class you'd better either be doing melee damage or supporting it.<P>That's the core problem in EQ, wizards are just the symptom.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No, no, NO!  You silly wizards got it all wrong.  /sigh   I apologize for all these crazy wizards Absor, many ideas are outside of what EQ is even capable of.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Not a "Group Harvest" that would give mana to the group members, but a mana bonus given to us when we are in a group to help us keep up with the group.  For instance, a level 60 wizard in a group of three tanks, cleric, and chanter could get 60 mana per group member, ie 300 mana, every 2 minutes.  A 60 wiz with two others could get 120 every 2 minutes.  A solo wiz gets nothing.<P>The whole point of this is to make wizards more useful in group-based situations.  We already solo just fine.  Would help with long fights too if we add an extra nuke every couple minutes.  <P>Here's a recap of "balance" issues I consider most important that you have not yet addressed or ackowledged:<P>1) Melee proof mobs.<BR>2) Group based mana bonus.<BR>3) Minimum amount of time Enstill type spells will last. (Leave snares as they are.)<BR>4) Resist Summon buff (need this or root worthless above 50).<BR>5) Alkabors: stun, mana eff as Jyll's, or transfer agro to targetted PC (nice idea).  <BR>6) Level 59 Vengence of Alkabor - should only cost 470 mana (similar to tbold), not 700.<BR>7) Make Lures less resistable like they used to be or improve mana eff.<BR>8) Level 60 Winds of Gelid should be 550 mana (more than Jyll's less than Pillar), not 875.<BR>9) Level 59 Invert Gravity should cost less than 200 mana not 500.<BR>10) Eye of Tallon should not magnify, get longer duration, 100% invis, and can attack to pull mob.<BR>11) Manksink should absorb dots, more damage, or a limited number of spells.<BR>12) AE roots, PB AE Concussion, or PB AE stun+dd.<BR>13) Elemental Armor, Resistant Skin, Thunderclap upgrades.<BR>14) Wiz Diamond Rod off Innoruk should not cost Peridot to cast.<BR>15) Manastone should work for Int classes that cannot abuse it.<BR>16) Increase Markar's Discord drop rate.<BR>17) Translocate should wipe the tank of all the coin on them!!! (should not be free).<P>Issues I find important you said you would address...<P>1) Evac clearing hate list.<BR>2) Spells fizzling way too much.<BR>3) AE rains hitting pets and resisted too much.<BR>4) Fix worthless pet.<BR>5) Add recast delay to items instead of cast delay(ie Velious robe)<P>Ninaeve of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk writes:<P>"We are a good class. However there are issues...we're a one trick pony."<BR>I completely agree that there are issues, but I also think that our one trick is severely underrated. My shaman is 52, and my DoTs and pet are impressive, but blasts are the only damage spells which can save a life.<BR>The thing that gets on my nerves is that most wizards seem to think that changing the "masters of magical damage" to "masters of FAST magical damage" was just a Verant cop-out. A wizard's nukes are surgical strikes--overwhelming force PRECISELY when and where it is needed, not infinitely sustainable damage capability.<BR>***********************************************<BR>That is your opinion.  The entire surgical strike does nothing to mobs with over 100,000hps.  And when there is a resist it can throw the entire thing out the window.  For supposed "MASTERS" of anything we sure get a lot of screwed-up/resisted/minimal damage casts.  With Atol's Shackles, we are masters at wasting mana on fizzles.  We may have "OVERWHELMING FORCE" but there are many classes that can do approximately 20 damage less than us -- not sure if that is overwhelming.<BR>*************************************************<BR>&lt;snip&gt;<BR>"It's maddening to me that it seems so many wizards just want to be able to chain-cast on every pull and never run out on mana--these desires mean that the REAL balance problems (Velious hit points, scaling of mob hit points in relation to a wizard's blast of appropriate level, and possibly the ability to do modest sustained damage, given we are 100% mana dependent) may go ignored."<BR>*******************************************<BR>I disagree here too.  Nobody wants to be able to chain cast and never run out of mana.  That's a rather immature conclusion.  We want to be true MASTERS OF QUICK DAMAGE -- either give us more damage, or give us more mana, or give us faster mana regen.  As it stands now, sometimes a wizard feels like he's there to blast a mob once and take away the last 200 hit points it has left.  I'm not a janitor picking up after the real players, cleaning up yard trash.  I am a master of the most destructive power the world of norrath has ever known!!!<P>FIX US!<BR>*********************************************<BR>"I liked how a friend of mine put the wizard's role: Every problem looks like a nail if the only tool you have is a hammer--but wizards have an entire boxful of hammers to choose from, and they all have uses."<P>Oh yeah, I have one hammer -- my fire spell from level 44.  But if it's fire resistanct, I can go back to my toothpick-sized cold spell from level 34.  Gee, that's an impressive and extremely effective use of tools there.  Compare doing 600 damage to doing 300 with the level 34 spell.  Show me some use for the sight line of spells (ie GAZE).  Absor himself said it doesn't really make you see further, or anything you couldn't see already.  Show me a good use for a rain spell.  Rather than a box of useful tools, we have a collection of broken wrenches.  Even when we have used the same broken wrench at maxxed out skill, it still fizzles and/or resists -- give us the tools to do our job, and make the tools work already.! GRRR.<P>Absor, by saying SOMETHING -- ANYTHING.,..you will quell the flames...but no, that would be too easy.  get back to us in another year ok?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's a part of the problem that has caused the class balance issue in the first place.  A melee should expect to get items with a higher AC, and perhaps stat buffs.  BUT, except for weapon procs, their items should NOT be able to cast spells.<P>How many wizard spells are in items that can be used by non-wizards?  Now, how many abilities from other classes are there in wizard items?  Let's see, no heals from wizard items, no mez, no clarity(the epic shieldskin effect isn't really a clarity SPELL), no charm, no disguise to let us go into Neriak to buy the gem needed to go to hate.  <P>I don't mind when casters get spells in their own area, but overall, look at the extras that have been given to Melees every expansion.  Look at the increased damage output as a percentage of what the damage output was before the new items.  If Kunark increased the warrior output with weapons alone(without disciplines) by 40% because of the new damage and defensive abilities, then why is the damage output from casters only 15 to 20% more?  Then you add the disciplines, and it gets MUCH worse.  <P>I don't blame or mind that the other classes got the boost, because with the mob hit points, the boost was needed.  BUT, the casters got MUCH less in comparison.  Level 50 we saw relative class balance, post 50 has gotten WAY WAY out of hand, and is far from balanced.<P>Add to my previous wizard discipline list to double mana recovery rate.  Let wizards get mana back faster, but leave us with the same spells we have now, and over the long battles, we can continue to contribute since mana comes back fast enough so we can continue to cast our nukes.<P>Or give wizards items which give us that sort of effect.  We don't want clarity, that's a spell effect which can be dispelled.  We want an inherant improvement, either given through skill, or item, that can NOT be dispelled.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk,<P>Yes making the surgical strike and correcting a bad pull is satisfying, but...<P>...waiting for that bad pull to feel useful is not very productive. Making surgical strikes is also not very productive. Ok so we put down a X amount of damage at the right time ...well while we are waiting for the right time we either sitting on our nice bony and callused butts or we simply watching the tanks hack away hit points.<P>Think we do as much damage as tanks? Sometimes yes, most of the time no ...especially with these new Kunark and Velious weapons.<P>Give a tank a Combine Sword (6dmg/28dly). Now give that same tank say the Crystallized Sword (11dmg/29dly) ...and watch the damage escalate. I purposely picked the 2nd weapon to not be an "uber" weapon ...got my Pally one for 199pp, but merely a weapon easily obtained and yet still proves the point. With these new weapons tanks can do the job just fine. All they need is some friends to camp the weapon they need or some pp.<P>Casters are not scalable. That is the weak point. That is the balance issue.<P><BR>Fix it by upping our regen rate (would be like decreasing the delay of weapon), increasing our damage, and/or improving mana efficiency of our spells. Now how you go 'bout *implementing* this is 'nother story altogether.<P>Just b/c we have teleports does mean we should be passed in our DDs. You tell someone that your level 34 spell is weaker than Mage's, and I will garuntee u that if they didn't know that before, they will something like this...<P>"Well that is not right, Mages have pets."<P><BR>Wizards say it, every class says it, xcept maybe the Mages.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>It is not 'bout wanting to chain cast, but more 'bout being more useful to a group. Now if that means chain casting is the end result, so be it. But waiting for the bad pull or the right time to nuke has limited advantages.<P>Yeah I agree, I do not think we suck. We can provide a lot but as the game progresses our usefulness is running out ...talking 'bout normal group exp here, not raiding.<P>I have made a lot of friends by grouping w/ people so I would like to think that as I wizard I do not suck and provide something. Why I do think we need help than? Mostly because as the game progresses we are needed less.<P><BR>Even in the old world, give those tanks some nice weapons like the Wurmslayer or better and we fighting to even get a nuke off before the mob is chopped and diced. Least we still have snare, stun and root ...sheeesh.  Oh and bad pulls.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"...waiting for that bad pull to feel useful is not very productive."<P>Depends on what you consider a bad pull.  I don't think that wizards need to only cast when the party is getting creamed; it's like giving a shove back on course when this pull threatens to cause further pulls to stop coming at a clockwork pace.  I think figuring out how often you can fire "routine blasts" is part of the knack.<P>"Casters are not scalable. That is the weak point.

</FONT><HR>First of all, I should at least say I have only been playing EQ for 6 months... and in those 6 months I have found myself playing my wizard about 8 out of every 10 times just to keep up with my enchanter and necro...<P>One thing I have noticed (I noticed the colour and spell effect problems but seriously... WHO CARES!) The biggest problem (I think) is that wizards have absolutely no way to go solo, just look at the statistics, ALL the other pure casters have pets, pets that can MELEE! (Enchanter pet not the best, I know) I have found that after level 20 or so there is no posible way to go solo unless you kil things blue and are magnets to magic damage... Wizards in conclusion are a pure group dependant class at level 20+ and, (this brings back to one of the earlier posts) wizards are the absolute hardest to get into a group... Groups may want you, but only if there are no other classes looking for a group or classes that they cant beg to come into the group to stop you from coming in (trust me, this HAS happened to me and a whole bunch more wizards from my guild).<P>Another thing... take off the aggro on wizards, it shouldnt be to the extent that a high elf can go wandering in neriak, but enough to make it so we can chain cast if we want to and not get overkilled by the multiple pulls.<BR>Also to help this, give wizards some kind of mana regeneration spell, haste spell (Like SoW), or medding while casting (Med standing up, as long as your stationary) and without having the spellbook open at about level 10 (Just being fair to all those wizards out there who are below level 35 and get aggro'd by green cons... I remember, its not fun while trying to kill a gnoll of orc while OOM and in a dungeon with MEGA trains)... trains were fun for me at level 5-15, but they get very repetative and VERY deadly for a wizard (I have seen a warrior around level 10 take out an entire train in BB single handedly, with few of my area effect spells). That brings me to another thing, make area effect do AREA effect. the effect shouldnt become diluted with every mob thats in range, if it does 200dmg then it should do 200dmg, REGARDLESS of how many mobs are in the target area ( I know its dangerous, but if they come into range its enough to make mobs aggro already, so we might as well hit them as hard as we can the first time)<P>I think im done now... just let me play EQ again to bring all the other problems back into mind.<BR>One other thing, make the eye of zomm type spells actually have hp and do damage, and with longer time limits!<P>Sorry for the long post (Not as long as some others though) but I think I have said what most people have already said...<BR>There is power in numbers!<P>just try cracking one stick over your knee, easy? try 20 or 30 at once!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not asking for all those other class' powers. What I WANT is some really good obvious reason for other classes to WANT to group with MY class, the Wizard (other than my charming personality). <P>Nothing that would change the class from its original concept, no pet, no panel of buffs to dispense, no summonings to speak of, no charms or mezzes, but REAL enhancements to the three things that Wizards were SUPPOSED to be GREAT at:<P>1. Having no rival in the area of doing magical damage. There are many ways of achieving this, choose at least three: increase the damage-to-mana ratio; decrease the mana used on each and every DD spell; increase the base size of a Wizard's mana pool; improve Enstill so it is a REAL upgrade to Root, with the same casting time, twice the mana, and a guaranteed duration of 15 seconds with no chance of breakage without a Dispel; give Bonds of Force a fixed duration of three minutes; improve the capability of both O'Kiels spells so that the FIRST one does 5 and the second one does 20, and both last for 5 full minutes; give us improved melee capabilities if wielding a magical weapon, and allow us to equip magical slashing weapons after level 30, with a skill starting at 30 and capped at (level/3)+3.<P>2. Being the seekers of knowledge, we should get a spell that allows us to summon/teleport an Eye of Zomm to any active Wizard port location and scout another zone until it gets or it evaporates; anything in the field of view of our Sight spells should be visible, all the way across the zone, as long as the range requirements are met. No clipping plane issues should interfere with Wizard Sight, it should be a hard-coded camera view, turning with the Wizard's head, set a particular distance away from the Wizard. Almost as if an Eye of Zomm was being used.<P>3. Wizards need a couple of truly unique Teleportation abilities that are actually useful. Translocation is a nice idea, but here are a couple of others that would actually make us desired in groups: <BR>Two bind points. Whenever a new bind point is set, the oldest one is erased, leaving the last two. Whenever the Wizard casts Gate, she appears at the bind point Farthest from where she cast it. If she dies, however, she appears at the closest bind point. <P>Another Teleportation idea that would truly make us desired, and would not be that unbalanced, would be the ability to teleport anyone who was standing in a Wizard TP location to the Wizard's current location. If a pull goes bad, instead of messing with melee binding, Verant can set it up so that a Wizard can TP the melee characters from whichever Wizard Spires they can run to. Put a permission box on it, so no grouping is needed. Solves a lot of problems in the game without doing anything more than adding one spell to a class that's starving for friendly abilities.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lets forget for a second that fast damage becomes more meaningless the higher you get. I would just like to see wizards actually BE the masters of fast damage.<P>Sure we can crunch the numbers and you will see that a chain casting wizard has a slight advantage over a BSing rogue however that completely ignores agro. In gameplay it is nearly impossibly for the high level wizard to chain cast more then 3 spells  without getting plastered and thats if they waited till the mob was below 70%. On the other hand the rogue will be BSing from the very begining and provided he has a tank or two to evade onto he will be fine. So while the numbers come out in favor of the wizard when it comes to fast damage in gameplay that just isn't the case. <P>What wizards need is to be able to do their fast damage without so much concern for agro. Several ways this can be done. <P>The easiest way would be to introduce an upgrade to concusion around lvl 54. Something with a 1 sec cast that wasn't resisted as much as concusion is and that would actually work when it landed. Nothing worse then opening up a fight by casting concusion (before you do anything else) and have the spell actually agro the mob onto you. <P>Another idea is to give wizard dds an inherently lower agro then other spells in much the same way they have a lower chance to be resisted (after 35).<P>Another idea would be to come up with a completely new spell line which would alow the wizard to transfer the agro from his spells onto a tank. Purhaps a way to channle the wizards spells through the tank making the mob agro the tank. Or a line of spells that transfers the damage the spell could've done into a single time proc from the warrior (thus agroing warrior). For example a 215 mana cost spell that produced a one  time 688 damage proc on the warriors sword. Or a spell to bind yourself to a certain tank so a percent of your agro is automatically transfered to the tank.<P>No matter what you do it there must be a way for a wizard to realistically outdamage a rogue in fast damage. <P>On a completely different issue wizards need a group gate spell. Currentlly it takes WAY too long to gather a raid. Even places that aren't too hard to get to such as PoG can easily take over an hour to get everyone to. Wizards need a spell which would gate the group to their bind point thus significantly reducing the time it takes to gather a raid. Seeing as you can't bind in any kunark or velious dungeon there really isn't any reason not to implement this spell.<P>Kunark evacs need to be regular gate spells or regular evacs. The whole "castable from kunark dungeons" was a nice try and worked for a while but now it just serves to annoy and hinder gameplay.<P>Mysthyl<P>P.S. evacuate needs to clear agro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>- "The classes are balanced."<BR>- "The game is evolving."<P>The expansions to EQ came with a massive load of new items for all classes. On a closer look on what those items actually do, nukers clearly got the short end.<BR>Melees:<BR>- higher AC<BR>- improved str/dex/agi/sta<BR>- better resist gear<BR>- effect items<BR>- haste items<BR>- new weapons<P><BR>Nukers:<BR>- better int items<BR>- better resist gear<BR>- new spells<P>While melees try to max str/dex/agi/sta, the nuker only cares about int for mana. Int is soft-capped, making it useless to go beyond 200. So what good is yet another ring with +5 int instead of +4? The int cap is reached very easily, so the new int items are practicaly useless.<P>Resist gear is the same for nukers and melees.<P>With the new effect items, melees can regenerate, buff, snare, stun, nuke, go inivs, gate.. All mana free.<BR>Besides the Staff of Temperate Flux and JBoots I yet have to find an effect item for my wizard. While my spells are more reliable since they don't need to proc, they are all I have and they consume my mana.<BR>No usefull effect items for my wizard from the expansions so far.<P>Haste. As I understand it, a 20% haste item increases a melee's overall damage output by 20%.<BR>There is nothing even remotely comparable out there for nukers. Spell casting time is unchangeable.<P>New weapons are used for their better damage ratio compared to the old ones. The nuker's spells didn't bring any increase in the mana ratio, they are rather tools like IVU to make getting around easier. (Melee's can achieve this through effect items.)<P>Summary<BR>While new items for melees result not only in better defense but as well in higher damage output, the nukers still stand where they were pre-SoV (and for lvl 1-50 pre-Kunark even).<BR>Mobs have become increasingly difficult in the new worlds to keep up with the new gear of the melees.<BR>So either the melee/nuker classes were unbalanced before the expansions or they are unbalanced now.<P>Fixes<BR>Nukers need an increase in damage output.<BR>Improve their spells. Many good ideas on this board.<BR>Create items for nukers that match the usefulnes of a Iksar BP or a FBSS. Items that decrease casting time, that increase mana regeneration or increase damage of nukes. Clickable items for mana free spells: Pet buffs for mages; Teleports, snare/root for wizards..  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
