</FONT><HR>"Gazz, is the one debunking you."<P>Yeah, too bad in the emails he says I was right.  He just doesnt like how I deal with jerks in the game, but thats life man.<P>I started this thread saying nothing about Gazz. In fact the post wasnt even about him, why he is acting like this I don't know.  But if you ask me that is immature just as much as people say my ranting is  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Not once do I deny I have a hot head, but the important thing is I only flew off the handle because I knew I was right.  And because I was told the group had loot problems prior to this, I thought to myself "nice.. now the dude is looting without /roll'ing.. god I hate jerks and im going to tell him this".   *IF* I had came to the group with no prior knowledge of their loot issues, and IF I had no prior knowledge that this group pissed off a 60th cleric who left, I would have handled it differently and there would have been no arguments.  I was "primed" by the fact that I knew what happened before and figured "here we go again".<P>Note: The prior problem was related to the 45th cleric who was still in the group, not the 42pally.  But the two were friends and guildmates, so to me I figure my god does everyone in this guild have loot issues. LOL<P>You had to be there all night to see this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seemed to me that it was a legitimate screw up. You can never know for sure, MAYBE: they were all planning on waiting on a drop, pretending to want to roll on it, then continually pulling, knowing full well that your superior ethics and game play would prevent you from even rolling, then waiting for the timer to just about run out and then bam, loot it on you! Yeah, good plan! Sure it just wasnt a mistake? Or do you really think that was PLANNED? Who is stupid? Lets see, you knew they had looting issues prior but you didnt establish rules immediatly when you joined? Then you pout like a child for a LONG time afterwards? Then you pout MORE and explain yourself over and over on the eq mesage board? And you are....in your 40's and successful? I doubt that, cant be true.

</FONT><HR>"Two grown men arguing this much over a cartoon... THAT is stupid."<P>I agree 100%.  And it wouldnt have continued if someone didnt revive the thread after 3 days.  Someone who ultimatly had nothing to do with my thread :P Hell if the 42pally came here to talk at least he deserves to post logs and give feedback to defend himself.  Who is gazz defending (I dont even mention names in the post at all so who could possibly care what I said)? Answer: Someone who he flamed in game 2 hours prior to this log.  Why? You got me.  I told him via email the day I posted this (4 days ago), why wait 3 days to revive the issue is beyond me.  I posted what I had to say 4 days ago. I emailed gazz 4 days ago. Last night this is kept alive here and in email, I am willing to forget it already.  But what pisses me off is that the log doesnt show the events that happened 2 hours prior that ultimatly lead up to this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Things that happened when you were not there do not excuse your actions against a person and the group for a mistake that you were partially responcible for."<P>Yes it does, simply because of the fact that they pissed off a friend of mine (Gazz).  Gazz dies.. Gazz lost a lvl 60 cleric group member due to 45cleric.  Gazz spends time arguing with them (I didnt see it, but he told me this)..  In my eyes just 2 hours ago they pissed off my friend, now they pissed me off.  Thats why I got real mad. Its not the loot so much as the fact that they ignored us when we wanted to roll for the item.  They sent private tells to 42pally telling him to loot when they knew damn well we were going to roll!  Would you stay with a group like this? Probably not.  Should I have not yelled and just left the group? Probably.. But given what happened all night I was mad, and when im mad I dont just disband and logout, I tell them im mad.<P>What blows me away is that instead of just stopping the pulls and rolling, they cause an argument. Then during the argument they wont even stop while gazz is making the loot rules. It would have taken 5 minutes, but because it wasnt an item everyone wanted to roll for they simply didnt care IMO.<P>The spam was flying, I was standing there working and asking when/if we were gonna roll. Im told to wait till later (gazz says this in the log). Next thing I know the item is looted because someone told the pally to do so privatly! My questin was WHY?  So now im mad at 2-3 people. The looter and the people who told him to loot.  Apparently I wasnt important or something, I dont know. But in any case i feel that was rude of them so I got mad due to this and prior knowledge.<P>You know after reading posts here and listening to just about everyone complain in the game (including gazz), im starting to notice that being high level sucks.  There are always people fighting or complaing about something.  I'm not saying I do no wrong, but man the fun drops the higher you get in EQ.  And everyone gets pissed off... Guilds break up... Loot arguments all the time.. Raids take hours on end... One thing I miss is being level 20 and logging in to have fun without having to deal with pissed off uber crybabies (myself included).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah who am I defending  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Personally as I stated MANY MANY times that night if i were the pally I would have looted them too. I would have group said "hey im looting them so they dont rot"  and looted. So yes as Ive also stated, Slayer WAS right in getting pissed, BUT Wrong in how pissed he got and what he did.<P>Why did I revive this thread after a couple days,<P>Well I got an email (which i normally check daily but didnt check for a bit) from Slayer stating he started this thread and how "ONE PERSON AGREED" <P>So I set out to find the thread and see if others agreed.<P>It outraged me that his summery of the evening was wrong, and that in the wrongness of it he defamed a GUILD.  Sure slayer you mention no names.. Just a whole freaking GUILD.<P>So I posted a small 4 liner to ask slayer if he wanted the log posted. Oh and on a side note I log everything not due to being paranoid, its convinent to be able to remember info that people give (auction prices etc) and quest info also.<BR>I turned log on in my eqclient.ini  and forget it till I need it.<P>Anyhow back to this...  after I posted the four line reply I went and played a while and did some other things dinner etc then checked to see if slayer answered on the log comment. well 28 posts were now there of people saying post the log.<P>So I did the name replacing and posted it.<P>Slayer this is what happens when people dont DROP IT, like I asked you to that night.<P>And your right , I get hot headed usually after you start pointing the "jerk" finger when a mild "moron" finger is needed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Your also right in that I would rather solve a problem without anyone getting hurt.<P>Your wrong in the number of times I have logged pissed over your actions. You claim 3  which is a good number (1 is too many) but its more like 15 or more, 3 where I was pissed enough to make a stink out of it.<P>We do have nights where things go ok all night, I refuse to gamble anymore as to weather your going to be a hothead or not on a hunt, therefore I will not hunt with you. Its sad, but true. (OMG will metallica come after me for that? hehe)<P><BR>And since you posted your favorite quote here is one of mine...<P>If at first you dont succeed<P>  Skydiving is NOT your sport.<P><BR>Gazz<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hehe.. believe it or not its not all about the lewt. I just like a decent group, decent xp and a fair chance to roll when loot does come.<P>I only camped an item 3 times<BR>1 - Testament of Vaneer (got it)<BR>2 - Celestial Healing (got it but not while camped.. i bought it)<BR>3 - Ring of the Ancients in OOT (LOL.. group spent 12 hours and AC didnt pop once).<P>All i ask for is a group who can play fairly together.  Honestly I dont have the hours it takes to get good items either by camping or by huge raids.  Its nice to win the occasional drop when/if it happens.<P>In fact while we were in this zone only 1 item was of high interest, and thats Turning of the Unnatural spell.  But I knew we wouldnt roll for that rare thing because I knew the level 60 cleric was going to get it (and had no problem with it).<P>Man the scary thing is I talked to the 60th cleric after this happened. And she didnt get it that night. I asked why bother for a level 39 spell anyway and was told that its the only spell the cleric didnt have yet.  My god 60 levels of spells and still no level 39 cleric dot? LOL  Talk about ULTRA RARE, this thing is nearly impossible.  Funny thing is if it werent for this spell nothing would have happened that night because it is sorta what helped trigger all these events.<P>Why on earth does VI (with their "Blurry Vision (tm)") see this as fun when they make level 39 spell that is not even all that great so damn rare.  Then they wonder why people fight over camps and loot.  The other thing is it seems the xp there wasnt even all that great (Karnor castle was better for me anyway).<P>I suppose if it was so easy to LevelQuest the $10 a month would stop flowing in so fast *grin*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The 60th cleric was in the group prior to me joining, but he left after the 45th cleric argued about the ToU spell drop  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  A bit later the 60th cleric came back because we told him if any of us gets the spell we will give it to him.  So he buffed us and pulled for us in return.<P>I have met both the warrior and cleric in game before and get along fine with them.

</FONT><HR>Um, there are too manby little snippits to pull out, but in the end it really doesn't matter..<P>You guys really sahould stop saying you are "friends" No friends that I know of talk to each other like this on a message board. You might be guildmates, you might even be acquaintences (sp) but you sure are not friends.<P>Looking back on all this, would it have not just been easier to let it go as a mistake and misunderstanding? Oh, getting this bent over one piece of l3wt is pretty silly.. Did it make the game more enjoyable? Are you having a better time now because of the actions of that night?<P>I try and not do anything that makes the game less fun, and if I have a disagreement with someone and it looks like I am not going to be able to resolve it, I leave the group. Simple as that. If I have RL friends in the group, I explain to them that it does not have anything to do with them, it has to do with the person I am having a problem with.<P>As far as not randoming for an item while pulls are going on, if all the parties are there, typing /rand 100 900 is not that hard to do.. if nothign else, it will show that you wanted the item to everyone and it would have been clear that you were trying to get it.<P>If you are fighting in an area where there are constant pulls, then you will have to /rand during pulls.<P>And as far as the party "Leader" leading, in every "good" group I have been in, it is a democracy, not a dictatorship.

I think Gazz told me the 45th cleric was also whining about not getting XP in the group due to all the high levels (and the level 60).  The leader should have disbanded her (btw.. Gazz wasnt the leader then).<P>So snuggles, thanks for agreeing with me because you would have deleted the cleric and thus none of this would have happened :P  See what happens when you make dumb comments on things you didnt read?
