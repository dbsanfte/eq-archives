</FONT><HR>For any of you who read this far and wonder... Why should the bards expect a patch?<P>There are a whole slew of bard songs that are in discussion as to whether they were broken or are working as intended. We don't prance around like angry fireflies over those.<P>The two songs affected by this are the heart of the class. The one time a bard song has been a hot issue before was when mana song was broken, and that warranted an emergency patch - even tho no single bard *asked* for as much.<P>If gate was broken, wizards, mages, enchanters, necros - you'd want your patch. Our affected songs are THAT vital to our class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pet: Almost every patch has included an "accident" to a bard song as far back as I can remember. This mistake, to what perhaps only someone who has played a bard can understand as a class-critical feature, is just too much. Update, damn right. But for me, this was just one too many. Note that you don't see me screaming for bards to protest or quit. I'm not even complaining the fact that the change was intended to stop us unrooting ourselves.<P>I'm focused here on an issue, and I'm describing it from the perspective of someone who has played nearly 2 years, 4 different classes, and from that perspective I am saying for /all/ bards this is a class crippling issue.<P>It affects the whole range of bards. Bards who are too low to fight in dungeons. Bards who were about to do their quests.<P>If that extra speed isn't so important - how many of you would be happy to hand in your jboots?<P>If all you ever use your jboots for are travel, then you can't possibly understand. The vast majority of people I know who have jboots regularly praise them for such-a-time when it saved their lives. For a bard outside a dungeon, that's your run song time and time again. And now it's broken until, hopefully, the next patch at the latest.<P>Remember when they made it possible for a gate to be unstable? And that happened 100% of the time. That's what it's like.<P>Selo's is every bards "slot 8" song. I don't know if I can explain more clearly how important this song is.<P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wrong. Complexity wise, EQ is a horribly simple program. Seriously. If you think the way Verant is handling bug reporting and Q/A is GOOD remind me to never hire you into our Q/A dept. I would like to see a PUBLIC bug database (even if is a subset of an actual bug database) so we don't see the SAMN DAMN complaints coming up over and over and over again. This is not a tough thing to do. *WE* should not have to be responsible for reminding Verant when they lose the Post-It that has, for example, the "fix mage 54 water pet" message on it.<P>Verant's Q/A performance IS sloppy and sub-par by any standard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If Selo's didn't work, it would warrant an emergency patch, however, Selo's without a drum is still faster than SoW most of the time, assuming same level of player.  Yes, this will make travel a bit annoying for a week, but not getting away from many mobs.<P>It was a mistake, obviously involving the root change (hence why it only affects such a small subset of songs), and yes they should have read the bug reports, but this is not class crippling, this is annoying, and measure it against the good stuff they added.  They are doing well, and turning around.  Bugs happen.<P>I still can't believe people are talking about the Test Wipe... It was in every piece of documentation about playing on Test: "There is good chance of complete character wipe" on day one.
