</FONT><HR>/em pats GrollerTheBard on the back.<P>Yes, very funny, you are so witty, you are so brilliant, thanks your input here was so needed, you are the best Groller, now please go post 5000 times on some other topic so people can actually discuss the issue here now that you have been recognized for your wonderfulness.<P>The rest of this is for the rest of you who don't feel the need to boost your self worth on a message board.<P>-Thogg- has his own style, and yes, quite often he is deserving of flames. <P>But its a big issue, and if you haven't been tank number 4 on Velketor, or tried to swap aggro to warrior 2 whose defensive is fresh while yours just expired all while Klandicar is quadding you for 540, you perhaps don't understand how the big events run, and could perhaps learn a few things.<P>The only thing that allows me to gain aggro at all using 2hs is the proc off Fangol. So what Verant did was just made Fangol ideal for not gaining aggro, and jade maces ideal for the lead tank.<P>Any 2hs that had a proc was just rendered useless for taunting.<P>What this will do is make the main tank wield 2 fast 1hs, and the secondary, tertiary etc. tanks use 2hs until their time comes.<P>Why does Verant feel the need to hose warriors that choose to use 2hs? Do they not understand their own game mechanics?<P>With the defensive nerf, the Donal's nerf, the rogue nerf, the complete healing aggro addition, and the blatant non-retuning of these MOBs that required these techniques to kill, it is going to be very interesting to find out how Verant will try to screw the top level players if they manage to beat their precious uber-mobs again.<P>Too bad most of the people here who can't even discuss the issue will be stuck managing aggro on moss snakes. Maybe there is a legit complaint in all of this that YOU don't perceive?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-Throgg- is right ya know. Sure, he sounds like an 8 year old kid with a southern liiisp in saying it, but I think the fact is that ...<P>1) Warriors need to get hit in order to be useful to a group. Good warriors WANT to get hit. =0)<P>2) The pinnacle of Warrior-ness is the epic weapon, being, you know, epic and all. A proc was added to the weapon in order to help with the lack of taunt it was creating, because of being soooooooo slow.<P>3a) Procs don't cause as much taunt any more.<BR>3b) Healers cause more taunt when healing +51 mobs.<P>Ergo, Warriors are less effective at doing their jobs. Meaning groups on the whole are less effective.<P>I'm pretty sure that's what -Throgg- is trying to say.<P>-----------<P>But is this a bad thing? Something a lot {oh, and just as a side here, it is "a lot", not "alot" or *shudder* "allot"} of people complain about is the predictability of Everquest. Start fight, send in the fighters, heal the fighters, nuke baddie through last %40 of health, mez any baddies that add, watch blue bar move by a pixel. Repeat. I personally think that a bit of strategy will be required now to be successful. How is this a bad thing? Who knows, it might add a bit of fun back into a predictable game.<P>However, the problem is that the game mechanics don't completely support this. Quite simply, if two warriors do 1000 points of damage in 60 seconds, one using a 2h sword and the other dual wielding, the dual wielder will be much more hated by the mob, given the dynamics of Taunt. So, again to refer back to -Throgg-'s post, why would any warrior worth their salt use a 2 handed weapon? Especially when you factor in the taunt spells cast by Pallies, SK's and Rangers can cause.<P><BR>My recommendation? Make Warriors have an inherent taunt factor. Each successful hit causes %150 normal taunt when using a 2 handed weapon, or causes the mob to consider it self hit TWICE for the same amount of damage when considering damage, or some such. Given the enchanced taunt cased by healing, methinks this'd be a fair solution. And the strategy of "Has the warrior done enough damage for me to heal him" is still there, as opposed to thinking "I can't cast CH because the Warrior hasn't done near enough damage!!!"<P>Oh, and if I had my druthers, this is what I'd love to see ... healing doesn't taunt the mob for the amount hit points healed ... it taunts the mob for the amount of damage the PLAYER has done to it. Divided by a modifier for the type of spell cast, of course. =0)<P>IOW, one tank has done 1500 damage but has only lost 200 points of health {yeah right!}, and the other has done 750 points of damage, and been hit for 1200 hit points {due to the increased taunting ability, of course!}. Cast CH on tank one, and the mob thinks "This guy has done 1500 points of damage to me, and you've completely healed him! Yeeeeeeeeeeargh. Even though you only healed 200 points of damage, I hate you really bad right now!" Cast on tank two, and the mob thinks "He no hurt me dat much, so I only hate the cleric over there for 750 points."<P>I stop my blathering now, and hope that made sense. =0)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

GUess what i cant keep a mob on me 100 % of the time compleat heals will still pull the mob off me."&lt;<P>Well, for one things, the taunt effect on your epic weapon has not been changed.  The change only affects that were debuff procs and things like that.  I suppose the patch message wasn't clear about that, though I also suppose the it would have only taken you a few moments of play time to discover it.<P>&gt;"Lol UM no way in hell a greater caussed no more hate then a ch. I have seen it in action a ch woudl peel mobs off me verry fast whiel remydies wouldnt even make em react."&lt;<P>True.  But we never said that Greater Heal was causing as much aggro as Complete Healing.  However, it was close.  I'm not going into details and again I would suggest that you play with the new changes before making these rather wild accusations.<P>&gt;"Agresive is now a nice dicipline but defensive has been wiped out its USELESS when you use this discipline you are supposed to be abel to cut your adamage taken."&lt;<P>There was no change to the defensive part of the Defensive discipline.  Only the offensive portion of those disciplines were fixed.<P>&gt;"agro is so much easier to controll by swingin some 18 delay weapons then it is by any proc."&lt;<P>Ok, then how is it that this change to the aggro generated by procs is such a big deal, as you claimed in your original post?<P>&gt;"they have no clue how there own dam game works its sad."&lt;<P>Again, I disagree.<P>Zur wrote:<P>&gt;"Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed." <BR>AND THEN they go and nerf the warrior's ability to taunt and defensive. <BR>It makes no sense, no idea what they were thinking on this one."&lt;<P>How about playing with these changes before condemning them?  You will find that the game makes a lot more sense this way.  A warriors ability to taunt has only been reduced when using a few specific weapons.  Clerics will discover that they can easily adjust to the change.  And Defensive was broken.<P>I fail to understand why it is that some people think it is our desire to harm the game.  That makes no sense to me.  These changes will work to make a better game, not a worse one.<P>In all of this, my point is that perhaps you all should play with these changes before proclaiming so loudly that we made a mistake.  See how it works first.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor: here is where the hostility is coming from. On the warrior class threads -- and you know this -- by far the unanimous opinion of warriors was that high lvl taunt wasn't effective enough. Now, as a response, you actually made it *less* effective. How much? I don't know. But surely any rational person can see that if a large group of players ask for A, and you turn around to do the OPPOSITE of A, you should expect a hostile response.<P>You read the threads, you know what warriors wanted. So you should expect to hear what they're saying -- you seem a bit tone deaf to this.

</FONT><HR>-wither- said:<P>&gt;"Absor: here is where the hostility is coming from. On the warrior class threads -- and you know this -- by far the unanimous opinion of warriors was that high lvl taunt wasn't effective enough. Now, as a response, you actually made it *less* effective. How much? I don't know. But surely any rational person can see that if a large group of players ask for A, and you turn around to do the OPPOSITE of A, you should expect a hostile response."&lt;<P>I understand that.  But this change was not made in response to those talk threads.  I know that sounds odd, and I'm not trying to tell you that we are not aware that there has been a request for a better ability to taunt.  That issue has yet to be discussed as part of the process of looking at the classes.  This change was made because, plain and simple, some spells were causing far too much aggro.  Ask your local enchanter about that…<P>The other thing that people are not taking into consideration is that this only affects items that proc a debuff affect.  This won't affect every warrior.  It will not cripple most people's ability to taunt.  It will have an effect, that's certain.  But the way that those debuffs were causing aggro was way broken.<P>Yes, we listen.  The concern that an enchanter was automatically killed by casting one spell was just as important as the warriors desire to taunt better.  In the long run, and looking at the game as a whole, this change seems to be the best.<P>Again, it's not as though we are done doing everything we plan to do.  Let's see how this works out before pulling the plug.<P>Drakewyn wrote:<P>&gt;"Can I ask you how we were supposed to know this?"&lt;<P>I have no idea.

You want us to try it, fine, remove xp loss on death for 48 hours or so while we try it or tell the gm's to provide free xp res to any and all clerics who die from an impossible to taunt after c-heal critter.<P>This is sounding more and more like the brainchild of your predecessor, Mr. "if you don't like the nerf we just screwed your character you've spent a THOUSAND hours on just delete it and restart a new one".<P>I think you should maybe get a clue and realize that people are tired of beta testing ( i.e. losing tons of xp ) your "fixes" to something 99.99% of the players never saw as a problem while the problems 99.99% of the players view as critical and detrimental go unaddressed or even unacknowledged.<P>You people have a message board, you have in game polling, you have a TEST SERVER but NEVER did you EVER mention changing the agro system.  Did you EVER even mention this or test this on the test server where if you are WRONG as Verant has many times been you only screw a few 100 to a few 1000 players who are warned this sort of thing can happen?  Why are you people always so eager to crash test this stuff where 300,000+ people can get royally screwed if you're wrong?<P>EVEN if verant is right and the change to healing / agro is not as bad as it sounds this should STILL have been discussed with the player base and tested extensively and PUBLICLY on test servers first.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Whew I can't believe I'm saying this but I have to agree with Thogg here.  Although I was really happy with a lot of the changes made, the CH nerf has pretty much destroyed the cleric class.  It would be really nice it they would try testing these things before they put them into the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've got to admit it, Thogg is right. It may be hard to read his pont, but the fact remains, he's right. <P>Also to add a lil, I can see all those warriors that spent Thousands of plat or hours at a time camping an item who's proc was know to be a good taunter.. willsapper, etc.. Kicking themselves right now.<P>And yes, clerics will be dropping like flies in Velious now. No way in hell you can drop a Uber Mob that hits as hard as they do out there without using CH in combat, and without having to use it as soon as they have to. No way can a melee keep up in damage or hate enough to outdamage a CH when they'll eventually need one, or several smaller heals. Mem-whipe spells? Don't forget about resists, and the fact that allowing an Uber Mob to get Mem-whiped would be bad in Verants eyes. A CH worth of melee dmg is gonna take a lot longer to build up than a cleric has time to live (remember, the mob doesn't take into account what every melee around him is doing in damage and then turn on anyone of em, it waits till ONE guy can get up his hate) <P>I'm still on the fence about everyday 50+ hunting, but from what little I've read so far on various boards, it doesn't look good. Methinks it's time to take a vacation from EQ for a bit :/ .<P>PS About all the Thogg bashing going on, it's beyond the point of just being 'cute'. Used to be people would disagree with his points and bash him more with that. Just saying 'Duh, yuo can't type' makes yourself sound as stupid as you're trying to make him out to be. At least try to make a point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-thogg- is 100% correct Absor and you know it. You can paint this picture with your little diplomacy paint brush all you want and you know what?....It's still a picture of a pile of crap.<P>In VI's attempt to "balance the classes" you have given to hybrids {which I am ok with though I think you also royally screwed the rangers} but you have nerfed the big 4 ....warriors, clerics, rogues, and enchanters to the point of absurdity.<P>Many of us saw that we were never gonna be group friendly at 50+ with a druid, necro, mage, etc so we made a warrior, cleric, etc. Now having invested many hours on these "mainstay" characters the cerebral wizards at VI have very unfairly " changed horses in mid stream ".<P>Answer the guy who asked you why you didnt talk to the player base on this or try it out on Test? Lets see ya paint that picture into something that doesnt stink  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059756-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059756.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059756-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059756&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059756&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
