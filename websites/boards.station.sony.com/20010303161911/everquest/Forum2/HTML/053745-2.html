</FONT><HR>I really hate to sound like a broken record in bringing up something that's already been discussed, but I don't think anyone has adequately explained our concerns about Chains (the bardic version of snare).<P>Absor wrote, "Well, it may have a much shorter duration than a druid snare, but you can also re-snare it, what, every 6 seconds? But I guess I can see that there may be too many restrictions on it. But keep in mind that this is not really intended to be a song that you can lock down something forever with. There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance)."<P>Druid/ranger Snare, necromancer/shadowknight Darkness, and wizard Bonds of Force effectively slow a monster's movement rate for a set period of time.  Druid/rangers can "lock down" a mob for 10 minutes (fixed duration) at a very minimal mana cost.  Necromancer/shadowknights can "lock down" a mob for a fixed duration (length of time varies according to which level darkness they use, as does mana cost).  Wizards can "lock down" a mob for a set period of time (length of time increases as they level) at a very minimal mana cost.  Bards, on the other hand, have a snare effect that breaks randomly, and can even break immediately upon application to the monster.  This is a balance issue.  All other classes that have some method of slowing the monsters down have an effect that will last a guaranteed length of time.  I cannot perform my duties as a snarer in group anymore, even when singing this song repeatedly...the monsters can still get away.  Couple the random duration of this song with its naturally high resist rate and it's almost worthless.<P>You mention a limitation on songs as they are "free".  Keep in mind the mana cost on everyone else's snare effects, they are extremely small.  Even IF this song was never resisted AND had a fixed duration a bard has to give up 1/3 of his song ability to use this.  What Verant seems to fail to understand is that bard songs are not free.  We can only maintain three at a time, therefor by keeping a monster snared we can only hope to keep up two other songs.  Again, this is a balance issue...the cost to the bard for using this song (1/3 the bard's song potential) is much higher than that for any mana-using caster.  Let's assume it's a necromancer doing the snaring using the high-cost Dooming Darkness effect...120 mana for about 1.5 minutes of snare effect.  That's less than 5% of their total mana, given a very realistic 2500 total mana pool.  That necromancer will recover the mana used in about 12 seconds while meditating with Lich on.<P>I don't know if I can explain it any more clearly than that, but having five classes in the game with a guaranteed duration snare versus bards having a highly-resisted and random duration snare is extremely unbalanced.  That's like making everyone's Root spell work except wizards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor answered this post: <P>"Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>Absor answers:<BR>"And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power."<P>And here lies the NUMBER ONE problem with Bards. That statement was the vision, but in reality is NOT true. <P>I have been on since day one of public and have played many class's. At 51 I assure you it is an absolute struggle to figure what songs I can juggle that are actually useful to my group. Out of all the songs no more then 20 are used at all. Only about 12 regularly.<P>The main problem is all the songs are FAR outclassed by other class's (Mainly Chanters and Shaman) spells. Sure they dont use mana, but the trade off for that is they last 18 seconds max. Each pulse also raises your agro. A caster can buff the group and get that mana back by medding through one fight. Then everyone is buffed for a long time and hes safe from agro. <P>Second problem is that haste/slow songs dont stack with spells. Theres a hard cap anyway, not allowing stacking just makes our songs useless.<P>Third problem is all the songs that are not useable due to bugs, nerfs, poor design etc. I wont go into all that as they have been well documented at The Concert Hall and transfered here as well. <P>Bard damage output is a joke, thats well known. I honestly would love to stand back with instruments and play total support Bard. Thats what I had in mind when I started a Bard. Instruments in a support role and melee with weapons as a secondary role. The problem is the songs are so uneffective and the effect of instruments is so small that you might as well just melee. Melee damage is so bad I cant go toe to toe with a green mob 15 levels below me.<P>The Bard nerfs so far frankly just burn me up. The things people complained about to get these changed were made out to be much better then they actually were.<P>Lucid Lullaby (sleep song) was NEVER, overpowered. It was fine as it was. Heres how it worked. You could stop a small train of mobs sure but their were catchs. First you had to play the song constant with instrument to be effective. Every round at least one or two mobs would resist and beat on you. They might even bash you. Every mobed hated YOU the most. With low hps I have alway found a mob can generally take about 10% of my health with one hit. See where I'm going? It was always a big race for the group to kill the mobs and a challange to keep the Bard alive. That song was never a godly song. Not even close to an Enchanters mez ability. They can AE mez, single target mez, Charm one and stun even, all in the same fight.<P>The Chains nerf is rediculous. Your talking about a song that lasts 6-18 seconds max and is highly resisted. There were a few ( I would guess less then 1%) Bards who found a way to exploit a song and you ruined the entire line. (The fear AE snare thing.) Shoulda just removed the song and redone it. Fear kiting is WAY overrated by people who see someone who actually pulls it off. It was never a practical way to get exp and just doesn't work as well as people make it out. What usually happens is your resisted and get the tar beat out of you. You get alot of resists from fear and chains. You cant survive more then a couple resists either. It takes forever because Bard melee damage is so poor. Its pointless because its way easier to kite with chants on a macro. The main use 99% of the time for chains is to STOP RUNNERS to prevent a train.<P>Which brings me too my number one problem and that is Bard mana usage. This was put in because of the misconception that the 27 song is too powerful. What a joke. I gotta admit I am very good at charm kiting, I've done it thousands of times. I did not start out good though, it takes alot of practice and is not that easy. First you have to constantly twist and move. You get carpel tunnel. You get resists, wandering extra mobs, pets dieing etc. Its not as fast exp as grouping. Bards have a nasty exp penelty and it dont help sharing with a pet. It takes a long time to kill the mobs. <P>The only differance is we have long fights and no down time while other casters have short fights and some downtime meding. Druids, Necros and Mages certainly solo better. Shaman solo pretty good. I solo well with my 46 Monk for that matter. So whats the problem? Its not like we can level faster then any of the class's I mentioned.<P>Bards should not use mana at all! With med skill of one it takes me 40 minutes too get Full Mana after a rez. That is an outrage! How is that fair?I could easily use one full bubble of mana just doing crowd control on one fight with the 39 song. Isn't it bad enough the charm breaks every 18 seconds and the mob quad hits me for 100+? Other casters get their mana back at a reasonable pace and there spells are so much better. <P>You don't know how much it galls me that the only song anyone wants a Bard for (Chorus of Clarity)doesn't affect the Bard. "Sure guys I can have you FM in 5 minutes, but I'm screwed for 40 minutes." <P>39 should not use mana! That does not stop soloing. I can kite easy with 3 chants on a macro and sow or jboots. All it does is diminish its Crowd Control usefulness. Who cares if people solo anyway, its not great exp or loot. Its just something to do when you have limited time or cant get a group. Lots of class's can solo.<P>I want to be able to do crowd control again, have usefull group buffs, haste/slow stacks. In short, I want to be able to use all the songs. I am so sick of being just a mana battery that I rarely play my Bard anymore. Thats truly what Bards are at high level. You could go afk with the mana song playing and people dont even care. Its sad really. I loved my Bard in the high teens early 20s when my songs were useful, effective and had varity. After the chains and lulliby nerfs I doubt I would love it again. <P>I see no point of playing to 60 as things are today. 51 was enough torture. Its just too much work twisting for so little return. With the high agro, low hps, weak damage, and uneffective songs its just not fun anymore. I would much rather play other class's as Bards stand now. I still hold hope you will fix all the bugs and finally finish off this class. It has been 2 years after all. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance)."<P>The limitation on our songs is that they are extremely short duration and can only be combined with two other songs.  A very serious limitation indeed, the bard can provide only three buffs to six people at a time.  The bard can only sing three damage songs at a time.  The bard can only sing three debuffs at a time.  Bards cannot buff 6 people, debuff the monsters, sing DoT songs, provide damage shields, charm, mez and fear all at once.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I've been a bard for a long time and don't get me wrong i've looked through all the threads and agree with alot and disagree with alot as well. <P>However, i'm not going to rehash the problem and irks of the bard community, but i do ask that you take a look at Thotts posts and most other bard's post in these threads.<P>If you look at our posts, 90% of them are not threats, whine's or snivels.  They are legitimate bugs, problems or requests to problem songs, bugged equipment or even new ideas to fix these problems. <P>Basically i love my bard and i can't deem to play another class because they are not as fun nor as enjoyable as this class can be.  <P>Since im a high level bard (close enough to 60 and in constant contact with all high level bards on my particular server) WE all basically agree on the same problems with the bard line of songs.  Most bards are adequate up until 50, after 50 we diminish in value and group performance.  <P>Please i urge you to consider alot of what is said and that we do need alot of either upgrading of songs or more viable group stance songs.<P>As for equip...i won't comment on it all cept to say we need more decent balanced items, instruments and not some silly bard effects that don't work worth a crap (because we have better songs) Give us something worthwhile yet not overpowering our class. <P>My only REAL pet peave is about epic weapons.  I'm almost 60 now, i know what all the songs do and don't do. Yet here i have been sitting for a month, looking for a scale, trading for a scale, can't get enough twinks together to go beat on Vox (or its camped to high hell anyways for those guys that want to rip us off selling it to us).<P>Now as a high level bard, what were you thinking.  I cannot go beat on vox so i have to go beat on Gornaire.  I am in an "uber" guild on our server, yet no one wants to do Gorn for various reasons such as:<P>a) The bard resists don't help worth a crap against Gorn even maxed at 255 we still get feared we still get ae'd.<P>b) Mass link death occurs even if you want to try her because of the other 80 people in the zone when yer gonna cream her butt.<P>c) The amount of damage we do to her pales in comparison to the amount she does to 40 well trained people. (not saying that she cannot be defeated but it hasn't been done on our server yet)<P>So that leave's me with teleing day after day to minor guild's and other rip off artists asking if they have a scale for trade. (You would not believe the things people want for a simple dragon scale i coulda got long ago IF the epic quest was implemented before i ever hit 53, which it wasn't because i was long past 53 when you implemented it)<P>I beg you to change the scale to something else for bards only off a different more reasonable mob (60 dragon is fine whatever, just something reasonable) or change it so that it drops more often on a different mob that i can actually take my guild to and smaketh down.  That way i don't have to compete with all the casters for the nice white scale cloak or the warriors for their quest.<P>I do understand the difficulty of this quest, but i mean beating trakanon, gornaire (or vox), talendor (or nagafen, ragefire) phinegal (kk), and countless other things we have to drag people to to get our epics is really really absurd.  <P>Thank you for your time and i do hope you take some of my requests to heart because this is the first probably the last bard post i will post about bards in general.  Unless you decide to totally whack out the bard's so that they are not the bard's of old class anymore.<P>Aggravator Sunrunner<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with a lot of the posts I've seen thus far:<P>-  I'd really like to be able to have my combat speed songs stack to some extent with buffs.  This is probably one thing that could do us the most good.  If there's an enchanter in the group, I'll just play DOT-DOT-Mana with my drum out.<P>- I think we get resisted too much (I'm thinking of the chain song), especially given that we have to keep recasting.  I would prefer to remove secondary effects from songs if that would let me stick the primary effect.<P>- I'd like to do more damage in melee OR have better defense.  You can decide which.

If defense, then please let us have better armor/hitpoints than at least one other fighting class (rangers? rogues?).

</FONT><HR>3 things Alan; <P>A. Why we focus on damage dealing post 50. We need more damage it may appear.<P>B. Add more lowlevel instruments for the benefit of all. <P>C. WHY on earth are many 1h weapns warr/rogue/caster only. DOH<P>A: Our damage DoTs. <P>The highend game requires enchanters. Enchanters and shaman do most of the utility bards can do. (debuff, buff). So quite often the bard is left to do what most other do : damage.<P>This is where bard song linearity comes in. Our songs increase lineraly from 1 to 60. Other classes spells & melee increase so much more, especially from 50 to 60. <P>We bards then feel that our damage dealing capabilities should be looked at, and be ensured to do a fair amount of damage, let us say on par with most classes but the monk and the rogue. (We must compare to the melee classes here I think). Our DoTs will do roughly 30 dam/sec (3drum dots) at around lvl 51-52-53, with a 25% bonus drum. Is this good? Rogues can do a steady 60-70 maybe 80 dam/sec. (I parsed that crazy guy Tigole in Plane of Growth). I dont know how good monks are in this connection, or other melee.<P>(What on earth did you think of overdoing the rogues that bad, thre are rogue twinks all over the place now, everybody has seen that rogues are twice as powerful as any other melee in the endgame). <P>Forget about bard meelee; It is pitiful; My guildie at 32 isnt even allowed to melee by his guild anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>B Instruments.<P>Another worry for me is the lack of lowlevel instruments with a bonus. Please add drums with 5%, 10%, 15% bonus. Right now there is the 17% and the 25% bonus drum. (and 35%).<P>Also there is one 5% lute, and then one 20%. For the stringed AE DoTs this has value, for the healing song its moreor less pointless. Please add 10% and 15% string instruments. And why not a 35% string instruments on level with the 35% drum. This will benefit lvl 2 & lvl 48 DoT/AEs.<P>You can also consider giving us even stronger drums to take care of the song damage post 50. However this would lead to stronger twinks, so upping song damage directly past 50 would be the way to go.<P>C: weaponry<P>I just cant see why so many good weapons out there, piercers fex, are warr/rogue and not bard. Where is the logic? I just got me a walrus tooth from a guild mate and I cannot wield it. What a bummer. Where is the logic?<P>This is in line with armour; Where is the logic in restricting both weaponry and armour from us bards, as we are both a plate and any 1h weapon class?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What bothers me about Alan's post is that he did not once mention the fact that we have asked for some sort of added melee damage.  There are many ways that have been suggested to do this:  up our weapon/dual wield numbers, gives us a low capping double attack, or a low capping dual wield.  I think this last possibility does fit into our "class" as we are (in my eyes) part rogue, part enchanter.  <P>Another thing that was not really addressed is upping our pick locks skill.  This is useless for bards once we get it.  Please lower the level when we obtain the skill, our up the skill level so that once we DO get it, it is actually usefull.<P>It sounds to me that he really doesn't think that our incompatability with shamans/enchanters is a problem at all though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Currently the lockpicking cap on bards is too low to be of use anywhere they might be hunting at 40+.  The only class that can now open ANY of the higher level doors is rogues, making them a requirement for many dungeon areas.  Couple suggestions:<P>1.  Increase the bard lockpicking cap so it is actually useful at the level received, at least for SOME doors, if not all of them.<P>2.  Add a song that modifies lockpicking skill to the point where it can be useful.  Perhaps have it be cumulative over time so they might have to play 30 or 60 seconds to open a really tough door.  <P>From an RP perspective you could consider it a form of identify / discernment song, detecting the inner workings of the lock.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello, i have been thinking about that fact that we are defensive hybrids.

</FONT><HR>Singing Steel Breastplate:<P>As it stands, the effect is (honestly) worthless... And i'm not just whining, let me explain:<P>The effect on this breastplate is Selo's Song of Travel, a song which gives Running Speed, Levitation, Invisibility, and See Invis.<P>I can right click my breastplate, and a few seconds later, I have this song effect on me. The problem is that this effect still has the duration of a normal bard song. Why is this a problem? Because with the normal song we can keep it singing constantly without having to resing it every 15 seconds or so. This is not the case with the breastplate. Every time you re-click it to refresh the Song, it cancels the song itself! (Because part of the song is an invis component!)<P>The fact that it only gives us the speed we would have with the normal song, with NO instrument (Even if we have an instrument equipped when using the Breastplate) doesn't help either, but that's sort of a moot point unless something gets fixed first.<P>My suggestion would be to make the Breastplate give Selo's Accelerando (With drum speed please, bards simply will not use it without this) rather than Selo's Song of Travel. This will get rid of the problem that clicking the Breastplate to use the effect will cancel the effect itself.<P>Hope this helps!<P>-Adres Tal, 57th Troubador</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, it may have a much shorter duration than a druid snare, but you can also re-snare it, what, every 6 seconds? But I guess I can see that there may be too many restrictions on it. But keep in mind that this is not really intended to be a song<BR>that you can lock down something forever with. There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance).<BR>----------------------<BR>Do you remember that we're talking about a snare equivalent here and not a root equivalent?  Snare does not "lock down" a mob (atleast not until it is at very low health).  And as others have pointed out, it is not exactly "free" to devote 33% of our resources to slowing down the mob.<P>Yes, we can re-sing Chains if it breaks, but that can take several seconds.  A mob can go a long way in the time it takes me to start this song and have it pulse.  In dungeons this can be fatal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm very concerned by this notion that non-bards have, that our songs are "free" because they don't use mana.<P>Imagine a caster with<BR>Max mana of 10, unbuffable<BR>Mana regen rate of 10 per tick, unbuffable<BR>3 second casting time on all spells<BR>Max 18 second duration on all spells<BR>All spells cost 10 mana.<P>That's a bard.  The spells are not FREE -- it's just that we can only spend mana at one rate, and we regen at that rate.<P>This is NOT a particularly favorable ratio of spending rate to regeneration rate, when compared to other casters doing similar things.  ANY caster (including hybrids) can regenerate mana used for snaring, stunning, mezzing, etc. far faster than they need to spend it to make the effect work.  Bards have the WORST mana-efficiency of any class, hands down.<P>Let's talk Chains again.  A bard responsible for Snaring will melee while singing Chains continuously.  That means he's using 100% of his mana-equivalent for snaring.  In return, he can manage to keep most mobs snared about 80% of the time.<P>A ranger in the same role will cast Snare until it sticks.  Even if it takes 2 tries on average (50% resists, much higher than you would really see), that's only 30 mana.  The ranger will recover that mana, even while fighting, in 3 minutes without any mana-regen buffs.  Typically, the ranger will recover all of the mana spent on Snare without incurring any downtime or time not meleeing.<P>If you ask me which of these two Snares is FREE, it's pretty obvious to me: the ranger's Snare is free.  He doesn't have to give up anything at all to guarantee that the mob will not run away at full speed, 100% effective for 10 minutes.  No extra downtime, no reduced melee ability (other than the time to cast Snare once or twice at the beginning of the fight), nothing worth noticing.<P>This makes no sense.  The bard spends 100% of his magic capacity to get an 80%-effective Snare, while the ranger gets a 100% effective Snare for no cost.<P>Absor, which part of this cost analysis do you disagree with?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, first off, thanks for starting all the class posts and asking for our input. I thought I’d put down some specifics on song scaling.<P>Song Scaling.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>You used the word "free" in response to the bard snare.  Please understand that bard songs are NOT FREE!<P>Every song a bard sings takes up one third of his/her potential contribution to a group other than melee damage.  This is a very high cost compared to what casters can do.<P>I play a 52 bard and a 52 chanter. With my chanter, I can keep my tanks at 60% haste (SLTW), MR debuff the mobs by 33 (tash), lock down three mobs reliably forever (dazzle & med), and keep myself and other casters in clarity (clarity). I can do this while being at a net positive in terms of mana.  If there are caster mobs present (theft of thought!), or if the puller brings less than three at a time, my chanter regains mana even more quickly, allowing me to slow the mobs by 65% (shiftless deeds), buff the group's MR (group magic resist), throw around a component free rune, stun mobs reliably, and do all sorts of other stuff.<P>I can maintain all of the above contributions to my group at all times with my chanter, and every one of them is about TWICE as good as the contribution my bard can do to a group, with the exception of clarity, which is closer.<P>The mana regeneration ability of a 50+ spell caster allows them to easily do more than three effects simultaneously, whereas a bard can only do 3 things at once. In most cases, the things that a chanter, shaman, cleric, necro, or other caster does are actually better, in a quantitative sense, than what a bard does.<P>For actual details on how to balance a bard's ability, look at Thott's power curve analysis.  There are concerns on the bard boards as to whether you have read it - please indicate that you did, as it is crucial to understanding how bards are not balanced.  <P>TANSTAAFS - There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Song!<P>Wagner Diewalkure, 52nd Bard, Druzzil Ro<BR>Enki, 52nd Enchanter, Druzzil Ro<BR>Officer of the Valiant Elite</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We have to make that CHANCE roll EVERY time the song pulses.  It should not be this hard to land.  You say that it is because we don't have to pay a mana cost.  Well do druids really pay a mana cost either?  Snare lasts 10 minutes for their one cast.  They run 20 feet from the mob, med a couple of seconds and they have all their mana back.  So for 9 minutes and 50 seconds thier spell is manaless, lands much easier, lasts somewhere between 50 and 300 TIMES longer WITH a fixed duration.  I don't see your "Manaless must pay the price" argument holding much water here...

</FONT><HR>Absor:  Your comments on snare and haste were very dismaying to me.  Snare is, in my opinion, the most egregiously unbalanced song in our songbook, and for you not to implicitly understand our concerns says to me that we're never going to get balanced properly.<P>Here is a comparison:<P>Druid/Ranger:  <BR>1.  Needs to snare on average twice to have it take effect.<BR>2.  Cost is 30 mana (regens in 3-30 seconds, call it 10 at high levels), plus 5ish seconds of casting.<BR>3.  Snare lasts 10 minutes, fixed, no question.<BR>4.  Length of effect/Cost of effect:  600/15 = 40:1 effectiveness ratio(!)<BR>5.  Snare does not need to work for 10 minutes, but this allows the caster to cast at his leisure, and to regen the mana whenever is convenient.  Assume 30 seconds of required snaring, ratio is 2:1, with an assurance that it will work and the convenience of casting it whenever it best fits in.<P>Bards:<BR>1.  30-40% resist means that, in order to snare a mob for 30 seconds, it is necessary to sing it every single song attempt (3-4 seconds), and even then the resist will sometimes allow mobs to run (3 resists in a row is not terribly common but still possible, it happens about 5% of the time we sing this song 3 times in a row, or roughly 15% of the time we try to lock down a mob for 30 seconds).  This means that we CAN'T snare a mob as effectively as any other snaring class, period, based on the resists and the short duration alone.<BR>2.  To attempt to lock down a mob for 30 seconds, we need to sing this song for 30 seconds.  This is an effectiveness ratio of 1:1, half as good as the ranger/druid.  We can melee for all 30 seconds, the ranger/druid is casting for 5 and doing something else for 25, so that is a small benefit, but does not make up the shortfall.  Plus, we do not have the convenience of choosing WHEN to sing it, we HAVE to sing the song at the end of the fight, no matter what else may be required.  This means that our snare is vastly less efficient than other classes, and is in addition far less convenient and far less flexible.<BR>3.  In ADDITION to both of the above, every other snare in the game has a fixed duration.  Ours has a random duration of 0 to 12 seconds.  This means that roughly 1/4 of the time, the snare "wears off" BEFORE WE'VE HAD TIME TO SING IT AGAIN.  And THEN we have to face the resist check!<P>The net effect is that we have to devote vastly more of our resources to a snare that DOESN'T WORK.<P>I am referring here to a level FIFTY ONE SONG.  If you can't see that this is blatently unbalanced, there is really no hope.<P>To parse your statement:<P>"Well, it may have a much shorter duration than a druid snare, but you can also re-snare it, what, every 6 seconds?"<P>Recast time isn't the point.  The Druid can recast every 2.5 seconds.  The point is the utter ineffectiveness of the song.<P>"This is not really intended to be a song that you can lock down something forever with."<P>But the point IS to keep the mob from running.  This song doesn't DO that.  And the concept that we can do this "forever" is irrelevant.  If ALL that a druid/ranger does is:  snare, med, snare, med, they will use a total of 5% of their casting potential to keep a MOB snared forever, and IT WON'T MOVE.  We will use 100% of our casting potential, and it will get away repeatedly.  And what is the value of snaring a MOB indefinitely in any case?<P>"free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance"<P>Bards songs aren't FREE.  They cost 3-4 seconds of our time to cast them, they last 12 seconds.  We can only do (on average) THREE THINGS AT ONCE.  Compare this to ANY other high-level casting class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know that bards are MEANT to be a group class, but the fact of the matter is that post-30 (and REALLY post-50) bards do not make very good group members, especially if there's an enchanter in the group.  <P>In "broken" groups bards continue to excell, because we can provide the hastes, slows, snares and crowd control which are missing from the group.  Once you add an enchanter to the group, our main addition to the group would be in damage dealing (sucky) and that's about it.  <P>It appears that many of the Kunark (if not SoV)dungeons are not really do-able without an enchanter.  Now the addition of the level 53 mez song has helped this somewhat, but once again, this means that your group has to be broken in order for the bard to be useful.<P>There must be some way to make bards useful in a group that already contains an enchanter.  <P>One method is the "haste-stacking" method which would allow the bard's haste songs to stack with other haste spells.  Haste-stacking for all our haste songs is not the answer, because lower-level bards would become essential to any group becuase no-one is near the haste cap at low levels.<P>The current SoV haste-stacking songs would be a great way to solve this problem if they were slightly higher hastes (say 10-20% at level 50) and if they did not require an instrument in order for them to be used.  Making them instrument-only just makes for a zero-sum (or negative-sum) situation where the damage you lose from the bard not being able to melee is counteracted by the extra melee damage form the tanks you're now hasting.  You could always make the extra haste increase by using an instrument, but apparantly that's broken too.<P>I understand tat all this haste-stacking sounds dangerous to Verant, but it really wont make that much of a difference at the very higheset levels anyway becuase they're alrady at the haste cap.  Once you hit the haste cap, haste stacking won't work.  If you limit haste-stacking to only the high-level bard songs then a bard might actually be wanted instead of another melee/pet class<P>Other ways of making bards more effective in the group is to make songs scale better, as has been said many times before in this thread.  If the damage shield, DoT and regen songs could be made to increase exponentially instead of linearly that would perhaps make up for the exponential increases in mob strength between 50-60.<P>Allowing the level 34 cantana song, Niv's, rune and heal songs all stack with each other would also really help (as well as the level 55 cantana as well perhaps).  Some decent regen stacking might allow the clerics to save a bit of mana from time to time as well.<P>Of course, the main solution to almost all the balance problems in the high-level game would be to remove the complete heal power from the clerics, and to rescale the mobs from that point on, but I guess we don't want to go there.<P>Thanks for listening,<P>Metrech<BR>level 51 Bard, test server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Instead of thinking of bard songs as manaless spells, think of them as weapons. They have a damage/delay ratio. We can't use more than 3 at one time, a warrior can't use more than 2 at one time. To use one weapon, he has to switch out. For a bard to use one song, he can't use another. Indeed, a warrior might have effects on a weapon which last MUCH longer than a bard song. Snare/slow/malise/tash all from weapons a warrior can wield last longer than a bard song.<BR> Use this outlook and you see that bard weapons(songs) are not updated with anywhere near the frequency of bard songs. Weapons start out at 5-36 and go to 13-20, can be affected by haste, and strength. Bard songs.. go up linearly, the best effects (haste) are not effected by insrument, and no stat affects them.<P> Suggestion: Have bard damage songs scale with other weapons.<BR> Have a stat affect bard songs<BR> Have instruments affect haste/slow song components</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
