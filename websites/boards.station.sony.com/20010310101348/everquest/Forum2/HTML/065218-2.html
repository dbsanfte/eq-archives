That makes sense.<P> I'm sure you have much more experience with the problems of post-50's casters, too, right? And more experience with the gradual decline in caster power, relative to melees, in the post 50 game, too? How much experience do you have in any of the planes or high level zone? Yet you still feel qualified to speak about these things with the people who actually know about them from... experience?<P> So far I've only heard a few people with reasonable arguments against the idea. The rest have merely made ad hominem attacks like "You think you're uber?!?" "You think you're better?" etc.<P> Well, to answer those: We didn't say we were "better" than anyone. But we do know some of the problems we're discussing first hand, unlike the sub-50's (or 55's, or whatever...) Say what you want, but post 50's have been in your shoes.

Verant would do well to ask those guys that just sent in the commons tunnel "hey why do you just sit here... and is there anything we could learn from that? implement so that it might have a broader appeal"  EQs weak spot has never been in its hack and slash.

</FONT><HR>Honestly, it would do a lot of good.<P>When a bunch of high level players post "rangers have problems in the high end game", it won't get translated into rangers suck by the general population.  It'll help to weed out people from taking statements we make about the high level game and applying it to the low level game.  There are quite a few people out there, playing the game in the low levels that believe rangers suck because we high levels stated a concern about high level rangers... and they've taken the idea and ran with it for all levels.  Thankfully, that idea is starting to fade somewhat.<P>Additionally, it'll give the low level board a proper perspective.  For us, the low level game isn't a challenge.  We breeze through it the second time around.  The first time around was over a year ago for many of us.  And it would be good to not have our skewed view impact issues that effect the lower levels.  By removing the higher levels who know all the answers, the lower level board becomes more friendly and more useful.<P>I think it can be said accurately that one of the biggest problem with this board is people posting on things about which they have no knowledge.  Now, I don't care how much you've read or think you know.  Until you've fought the Dain, you don't know how to fight the Dain.  Until you have CH'd in Air, you don't know how CH is in air.  And until you've seen the clerical bp used and fought the mobs the high level fights, the fact that you know how much it heals and the casting time means you know squat about it's power.  Likewise, when your level 30 is a warrior with mostly cobalt and fungal tunic, wielding 2 1h weapons with better ratios than most 2handers, you don't have an accurate opinion of the level 30's.  You've passed it, you are beyond the curve.<P>It'll get rid of the experienced people telling the newbies to shut up.  It'll get rid of the low levels telling the arrogant high level chumps that they'll be glad to see them gone.<P>51+ is a different world.  The focus of the game shifts.  This is why many guilds don't survive the transition from pre-50 to post 50.  The game changes, the needs change.  It's a different game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>=I would assume, since you are able to gather subscriber info from posting for bans/warns, you would have little or no trouble creating a filter based on poster.=<P>Just to concentrate on logistics here a second as I don't have an opinion on the idea either way.<P>It would be extremely hard (ie not practically feasible), to hack up Ultimate Bulletin Board so that every time you went to post it queried live server databases for information on your character level.<P>Think about it a minute, your screen-name could represent dozens of different characters, spread over different servers and of different levels.  How is a bulletin board ever supposed to include the kind of 'intelligence' needed to guess which character's viewpoint you are posting from.  <P>What you would have to do is query all servers to see if X-screenname had a character anywhere &gt;51 and then let that person post on 51-60 board.  Ah, but wait - now you also have to let them post on the &lt;51 board since they may well have Alt characters who are of that level.  <P>Now here you have a problem.  If Player-X's lvl 60 character is a warrior (randomly picked class), how do you stop him posting in the 51-60 forum in threads about the Enchanter end-game?  He knows less about the Enchanter end-game than a lvl 49 Enchanter as he, in fact, doesn't play an Enchanter at all.  Now, how do you also stop him posting his level 60 warrior views on warrior threads in the &lt;51 forum?  You have to let him in there because his twink is a level 25 rogue - but now he's messing up threads which are not meant for his level.<P>In conclusion, having a forced system would be too hard to code and too impractical to use.  Simply having an extra board for the 51-60 game would, but then everyone would have to be prepared for &lt;51's posting in the high-end board and 51-60's posting in the 1-50 board.<P>In other words, total segregation simply doesn't work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Should a lower level person have input on items which they will never obtain,seen, or may not for years to come?

</FONT><HR>One major problem I have with this, that hasnt been really discussed.<P>Given VI's track record on how, when, and why most things in the game itself are added changed or fixed...<P>the 'lesser players' board would rarely be seen by VI. It is no secret that the game is tuned/tweaked/and added to, for the high lvl minority.<P>Not only would you see a segregation by level, you would also see the high lvl board far more active with official posts than the lesser players board. I honestly beleive this. VI has a history of working hard for the minority and ignoring the majority, why would this be any different?<P>Now, dont get me wrong here. I would have no problem with another section of the baords being opened for the "High Level (50+)" discussions. But to set it up to be exclusively posted by and for the high levels would be a gross error.<P>It would only further increase the "EQ Caste" system of ubers, high levels, mid levels, and lowbies.<P>BTW....I honestly feel the term 'newbie' is a rank insult. Especially when applied to anyone that has played the game game for more than a few hours /played. Why? because the term carries with it a connotation of ignorance and naivette about the game, that is often not present at all, or if it is, is soon gone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Although I do think the limit should be 46-60 as its the plane limits, or 1-52, 53-60 pre Vox/Naggy, Post heh...  But yeah it seems Verant is looking at a lot of the things players are 'complaining' about and yet they do not take into account that it may be a lev 25 shaman complaing about a lev 60 enchanter.  The issues are just completely different and should be looked at from the point of view of the poster.<P>100 to 1 odds that instead of making a seperate board they just change the boards to automatically post your chars info, kinda like they changed it so you had to have an active account to actually post on these baords.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A person whose highest character is level 49 will be over level 50 very soon and will care about the 50+ game.

You *could* have two boards but the use of them would have to voluntary as there is no possible way for Board software to know which 'character' you are posting views on behalf of.  Just because you havea level 60 Monk doesn't mean you know more about a level 51-60 Bard than a level 49 Bard does - but your level 60 Monk is free to post his opinions about Bardic end-game problems simply because he has access to that board.  Likewise, he's also free to tell level 25 Monks they don't know what they're talking about on a &lt;50 Board, because his Alt characters are below 50, even though he's no longer supposed to be posting there as a Monk.<P>As a 'compulsary' idea it is, i'm afraid, totally unworkable.  It would have to be voluntary and you'd simply end up with 2 boards where people give their opinions even if they aren't based on first-person experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know how much this smacks of elitism, but seriously folks, it's a good idea.<P>It's not that lower level folks can't have good ideas; it's that their experiences often simply aren't applicable to the problems higher level folks talk about. Useless and obviously wrong information just clutters up otherwise good discussions that pertain to the high level game. I'm not going to say that every player over level 50 will be right, a good player, or experienced; but they're certainly a lot more likely to know what the issues are. Think of it this way. Most characters I know of in their high-50s have spent a lot more time from 51 on than they had all the way through 1 to 50. That means that they might have seen more about post-50 issues than a 50th level player has seen all the way so far in his gameplay.<P>The heal changes really showed the necessity of this. You had these changes operating on many different levels, affecting different levels of characters in drastically different ways. Unfortunately, people would immediately jump into threads that concerned another level range and clutter it up with ideas that often displayed laughable ignorance. Heck, even the multiquesting discussion shows obvious level biases in people's opinions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(and by the way, the Ebay trades continue, i was just over there looking for scubadiving gear, and did a search on "everquest" and  got 7 pages)<P> i have also encountered some higher level players who actually had played the game thru to a high level who really had a surprising lack of accepted group / team / Guild tactics on a lrage raid.<P> i think the original post was well meant and not intended to incite trouble, but bottom line is, if you really dont KNOW the subject first hand, stop , listen, and learn something from those who do, rather than toss in an uninformed opinion or flame.<P>    Hey, lets all play nice together to make it a better game/world for all concerned, i try to respect all players of all levels that show respect for me, and i ignore those of any level who do not treat all other players in a decent manner.<P>        thats just the way i was raised!<P>                  cheers<BR>                   NEB<P>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
