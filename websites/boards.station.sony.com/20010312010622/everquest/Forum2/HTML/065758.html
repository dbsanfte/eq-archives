&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Last night on Brell, after 10 hours of preparing a raid to the PoM.  24 raiders were teleport out of the Plane of Mischief upon entering.  Currently there is a great deal of debate going on about the use of /q as a means to enter the Plane.  This thread is NOT for this debate.  Please do NOT post your comments about if YOU feel it is a exploit or not. <P>This post is regarding the method in which the Guides and GM's handled the event, and VI constant changes to the ToV to keep us out of this Plane.  <P>Before you read my post, check out this web site.<P>WWW.PlaneofMischief.COM<P>The map is a little off. The number of KoS dragons around the PoM zone entrance is about twice what they show on the map. Also there is an equal number of drakes/dragons who are on the CoV faction tables. <P>For those of you who do not know what using /q to get by mobs means, think of it like this.<P>/q is an uberinvisibility spell. The casting time on this spell is 90-180 seconds depending upon your connection. The effect erases all faction standings for 7-14 seconds.<BR>Using /q, you can run for seven seconds and then /q again to avoid aggro. <P>A group of 24 raiders spent ten hours setting up for a raid on PoM. During those ten hours not once did a GM or Guide mention to anyone that /q was an exploit. During those ten hours guides and GM's were present. They knew what was going on. They let people get their hopes up and feel as if what they were doing was ok. <P>A Guide or a GM could have sent anyone a tell at any point and they could have spent their time trying to get there another way, or could have raided something else.<P>I believe the last minute denial to the Plane of Mischief was due to the fact that the zone is not ready. Please check out the following threads...<P>pub13.ezboard.com/fthesaf...5749.topic<P>boards.station.sony.com/e...65255.html<P>Please go to these threads and post how upset you are. Demand that VI move the zone entrance to PoM someplace more accessable.<P>DEMAND for those raiders an apology!!! Guides and GM's watched them for 10 hours!!! Silent, sitting there, waiting for them to get ready to zone in and then teleporting them out afterwards.<P>Danni<P>PS: I myself am canceling both of my accounts.  My boyfriend is canceling his accounts.  My roommate is canceling his accounts.  <P>There will be more online games.  I'm leaving this one so I can rest up for the next one.  If you feel as if VI is allowing their guides to turn discretion in to discrimnation, canceling your account is the only real power you have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ROFL.<P>Nicely done by the GM's.<P>Sorry, but using /q all the time is obviously an exploit.  That isn't what it is meant for, and you know it.  The change was made because of people zoning into a zone and getting killed by supposedly friendly mobs before their adjusted factions kicked in.<P>So the GM's nicely let you waste your time, cheating.  And then booted you back out instead of out-right suspending you.<P>Be happy you got off lightly.<P>And, next time, if you aren't sure about the legality, ask a GM.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Do you guys not read my post?<P>You keep saying, this is an exploit.  Yet people use this "exploit" every day.  People have used it to get in to PoM, monks use it every day when they fd and then /q.<P>Have any of you ever used /q?  I find it hard to believe that you do not.  This post isn't for you to come and sound off about how happy you are someone else suffered a loss.<P>The point is that not everyone is aware of what is an exploit and what is not.  You would assume that with a guide or GM standing right there that what you are doing is ok.<P>Sooner or later you will be on the short end of some kind of unfair treatment.  Hopefully people will show you a little more support than your willing to extend to others.<P>Once again, please don't post here if all your going to do is point out that using /q is an exploit for some and not for others.  This post is strictly for comments regarding if it is fair for a guide and GM to stand in front of you and let you do something without mentioning that they don't want you to do it.<P>Ask a guide if it is ok???

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;You keep saying, this is an exploit. Yet people use this "exploit" every day. People have used it to get in to PoM, monks use it every day when they fd and then /q.<P>Monks use it to clear aggro after feign death, without having to get up.  I'm sure Verant considers this a bug, but has left it as is.<P>However, that wasn't what you were exploiting.<P>You, were exploiting the ability to log in with indifferent factions and then move forward during that time.  Not /q.  No, they put in a fix so that we wouldn't die upon zoning in due to mobs with friendly factions misconning us.  This fix was that upon entering a zone, everything views you as indif for a little bit.  You then proceeded to abuse this to move through a KoS area.<P>Anyone with an ounce of common sense can see that you are trying to abuse game mechanics to avoid factions/mobs.<P>So, yes, we are going to laugh at you.  Because it's funny.  It's good to see Verant do something smart from time to time <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You idiots.<P>Gee, I wonder if taking advantage of Verant's fix for the faction bug is an exploit. Nah...it doesn't specifically say it is anywhere.<P>Nowhere in the rules does it say "You are not allowed to /q and zone in again in order to take advantage of the indifferent faction. This is an exploit."<P>Guess it's okay then, right?<P>Since there are no laws saying I'm not allowed to go around shooting people with a gun that I got from my grandfather while wearing a pink tutu and a ribbon on my head, I guess that's okay. I mean, they weren't very specific about their laws, their own fault!<P>I don't care if this isn't the thread to debate it. You *******s are going to get this nerfed and ruin it for the rest of us. I like zoning back after an LD and I have a chance to live. I'm not going to abuse it.<P>Oh yeah, they handled it well. They wanted to teach you ****ers a lesson. Don't bi tch and whine about it, you got what you deserved. I hope that in those 10 hours, you could have camped the uberest loot in the game, but they were wasted. Good, damn cheaters, you should have been suspended, or better yet, banned.<P>Maybe the GMs were checking with each other. Maybe they did want to teach you the lesson you SO deserved. Your own damn fault if you think what you were doing was okay.<P>Cancel your accounts, Norrath is much better off without cheaters.<P>Bye.<P>(Haha, first time I really ranted like that.

</FONT><HR>(Jairn of Brell)<P>Danni, I posted about this on this board as soon as I woke up this morning, VI decided it was best to delete my threat. Why I have no idea.<P>But VI I would like your explaination on this, We was in the zone for hours prior to the final run into POM. One guide stated that there were lots of VI people watching us get there. Why didnt you warn us the first time you saw it used? <P>I WAS NOT AWARE THAT I WAS CHEATING. I WAS NOT AWARE THE THOUSANDS OF PLAYERS WHO PLAY YOUR GAME EVERY DAY ARE CHEATING WHEN THEY TYPE /q.<P>You could have said 'Thats an exploit, do not use that tactic or you will be warned and it recorded on your account'<P>But instead you took the iron fist of VI approach, treated us all like we were hacking or something and gave us all a mark on our account. You ported everyone back to their bind spots therefore making any CR that had to be done in ToV a massive task. <P>Have you honestly got 36 of your testers together, put them at the zone line of ToV and said 'Ok guys, get to PoM'. I seriously doubt you could stay awake for the amount of time it would take. The way you treated us is wrong, we as paying customers at least deserved to be told what we was doing was wrong and allowed another fair attempt.<P>And you flamers, try posting something constructive once in a while.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that 7 seconds of factionlessness you get upon zoning (anytime you zone, not just when you /quit and reenter the game) was to allow for you're (personal) faction to "load" so that people wouldn't be killed by usually nonhostile NPC's (those that started KoS but are no longer due to faction work) upon zoning because of a faction/zoning bug.  No doubt this will be taken out soon and people will go back to dying when they zone into places that they've worked on the faction to become non KoS.  Yes it was exploiting and yes they should have told you as soon as they realized what you were doing, but then I think they sometimes like to watch for laughs...err... "to find out how the exploit works" yes... that's it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Gotta love that thorough testing ;P.<P>It's also kind of amusing that when the bug negatively impacts players (ie, people getting eaten by Wuoshi even with good CoV faction) it can take them months to fix it, yet when people are benefitting from another bug they are much quicker to take action.<P>Just think of the 10-hour set back as a challenge.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why didnt you warn us the first time you saw it used? I WAS NOT AWARE THAT I WAS CHEATING<P>That's the exact purpose of a warning... To give you the benefit of the doubt and let you know that whatever you are doing is not allowed.  We just record warnings so we can see who still deserves the benefit of the doubt.  <P>Now just to be clear, warnings aren't an entitlement.  As I mentioned above, they are used when the CS staff can give you the benefit of the doubt.  There are times when stricter action is warranted immediately, like when something is so inappropriate that there is no way that a reasonable person wouldn't understand that whatever they were doing was inappropriate.

Why were they allowed to go thru this procedure, probabaly several times, and then when they acheived their goal, THEN they get the warning? It seems to me, they should have been warned of the abuse, but it should have happened the first time they were observed doing it, or discussing it. <P>You know like this, "hey guys, we heard what you were planning, if we see you doing this you will be kicked." Or, "Hey guys, we saw what you did, don't let us see you doing it again, its an exploit and you can/will be suspended for doing it." That is good customer service.

Instead they decided to waste 10 hours of time of 'YOUR' customers.<P>Here is list of things players everyday that are no so called 'exploits'<BR>-Use a necro to someone corpse from aisle to aisle in PoA because their is simple lack of keys per island.<BR>-Clerics Divine /q during a bad fight.<BR>-Monk drag a Mag corpse to a safe point with a vox rez staff to rez, so the mag can CoH people to safe point.<BR>-Monk /q to clear agro.<BR>-zone in and out of zone till a harmfull buff wears off<BR>-/q while porting so that the porter doesn’t get ported<BR>-Leave a corpse outside of a zone with a key on it. ***NOTE: Sleeper's Tome keys are not soul bond, that means if you die in there, you have no way of getting back in to get your corpse. So here is the tactic used. Create a corpse outside the zone, loot everything but one item, zone in. once you are in you created a new corpse. Loot all but 1 item, then get rezed out, make a new corpse, this time leaving your key on it. Get that corpse rezed, then get rezed back into Sleeper's Tome. So Why go through all this? It's simple ST is designed for you to lose your corpse. When the final boss is spawned he zone wide DT. Yep that means everyone is instantly dead! Losing your corpse and two years of playing time is just not accepted in EQ.. Their have been stories floating around about GMs destroy and or moving corpse with keys outside a zone, so now most people have to waste another 10 mins per player to port them to a bank so they can bank the key.<P>So what is my take here? A group people used a design flaw to get to a zone, while GMS were watching. The GMs let it continue so they could see how people fight in the zone, so they could change it for the future. When the GMs thought they had all they could know from this group of people, they removed them.<P>My question to you Gordon is, Why do we the paying customers, have to be responsible for your design flaws?<P>You made the mistake, not us, you need to correct the mistake, without, spiting in our faces,<P>Ernie<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

IE, not farming 24/7, not duping, not naming ourselves "Baybe Pumpa," not digging and scratching to wring every single last iota of advantage from every single little thing in the frickin' game engine, etc.  Those of you out there that do this kinda crap bring down most if not ALL of the nerfs. Nobody enjoys nerfs, least of all VI.<P>3) If for some reason you simply can't grasp point 1 above, and can't agree to point 2 above, and you simply HAVE to "beat the game," GO PLAY QUAKE, you microcephalic twitch jockeys! <P>Verant added this new faction delay TO MAKE CUSTOMERS HAPPIER, and avoid needless deaths.  (And don't even hide behind the "They shoulda designed the game better so we could not do this" excuse, go read point 2 above again.)  <P>Now you chuckleheads are doing your level best to exploit it, which will lead VI to nerf it, which will make everybody unhappy.

</FONT><HR>How can you say that you didn't know this was an exploit?  Make all the excusses you want, you KNEW what you were doing was wrong.<P>You exploited a "safety net" that was put in to help players with a faction problem.  You used it to avoid risk in your quest for reward.<P>Considering that you were doing this to get to the Plane of Mischief, I think it was very fitting.  The only thing MORE fitting, would have been rerouting your zone-in to VP.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Oh well, bye bye.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Straithlin: they would still be able to read the /petition lists while they did this.  One or two of them could pop out whenever they needed to, and still leave watchers in the zone.<P>I think they MIGHT have been watching to learn how it could be done, and what to watch for to spot it happening again later.  Think of it as a Guide/GM training session, hosted by a bunch of exploiters.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I suspect the reason they didn't warn you earlier was the same reason in the example to follow. I would like, if I may (and look at that I can)to relate it to the real world.<P>Okay lets say I am in electronics boutique with a backpack that for some reason they didn't ask me to check at the door. I see a game I want .. lets say the new "Alice" game. I put it in my back pack. Unknown to me a plain clothes store detective sees me do it. I Wander around the store for a bit. He fails to come over to me and stop me instead electing to trail me and alert other security in the camera room. I am feeling confident I go to leave (avoiding those sensor things) No one touches me until I walk past the last place I could pay for it. Why ? Because until I reach that point of no return I have not commited a crime. Yes it looks like I intend to but until property is removed from the store no law is broken.<P>Was it wrong for the camera's and plain clothes guys to watch me .... nope they  presumed I had intent.<P>Was it wrong for the guides to watch you and probably smile to themselves nope.<P>If I had noticed I was being watched/followed and asked why should the detective tell me .... pretty sure he has to though at that point I haul it out and say i was just looking around more before i went to pay sorry for your trouble but i feel uncomfortable in here now I'll go elsewhere and buy it. And the store will probably tell me i am not welcome in there for thirty days.<P>If I didn't ask him why did he have to tell me voluntarily .. hell no .<P>If you asked the guides/gm's should they have told you, yes , If they hadn't and then did this you might have a leg to stand on <P>But did they have to volunteer it nope not at all. I for one would be leery if i saw a buncha guides watching me do anything .. Heck I get paranoid when the "you feel the eyes of the gods watching you" comes on once every so often       </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Miladian-GC<P>because the GM had to be sure they are about to exploit /q in a way to get into PoM and dont gimm the they were able to see that 10 houres earlier crap.<P>If the GM would ve appeared and said sorry folks you are cheating, everybody would ve said:<P>Us? never we are just running up this tunnel for fun, we never intended to break into PoM by this really we promise.<P>GMs and Guides have to observe such things in order to do something so when Oribi watched em for 3 maybe more hours she was aware that something isnt right there but she just cant pop in and warn everybody only to be yelled at (like: you are saying I am cheating? Why do i pay for this game? I will write a mail about you miss GM).<P>They cheated and took their chances and they got what they deserved.<P>Darrke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The other day I was shoplifting for a half hour.  I took a bunch of things.  I know the employees saw me but they didn't say or do anything until I was outside the store when they had me arrested.  They should have given me a warning.  If I had known they didn't want me shoplifting I would have stopped.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065758-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065758-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065758-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065758&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065758&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
