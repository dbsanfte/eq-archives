</FONT><HR>Another point i wanted to make was about the PoG armor effects. Verant listened to casters and gave them effects on their armor and i am truely gratfull however i think the effects need to be looked at a bit.<P>Boots: effect of O'Keils radiation. No 46+ wizard would EVER use this spell. Its duration is too short to use for the fire resist component and its damage is just not worth the trouble. I sugest that flickering flame is put on the item instead OR put improved invis on it as those are two spells that while not being used alot at least would get some use.<P>Bracer: effect of chillsight. I personally never use chillsight over plainsight since i'd have to use see invis + chillsight to get the same effect as plainsight. This is another effect that i never use. I suggest you upgrade the effect to plainsight so it can get some use. As it stands now i don't even wear my PoG bracer since its effect is useless to me and its stats are much worse then 3 other bracers i have.<P>Robe: effect of enticement of flame. The problem with this is its 28 sec cast time. Not only is that a LONG time to be casting for only 320 damage but it locks the wizard into a 28 sec cast and doesn't allow us to change with the situation. I get 32 mana per tick (with C2) so in a 1 min period (roughly 2 robe casts) i would get 320 mana meding. With 320 mana i could cast a regular 640 lure spell so in the end you get almost the same damage just meding without locking yourself into a dangerous 28 sec cast.<P>One way i'd suggest to fix this is to change its cast time to 15 seconds. You still have to commit to 15 seconds but thats not nearly as bad as the 28. This would also give much better damage/time making it better then just plain meding and casting while still coming no where near what a mele or pet could do. Second way to fix it would be to introduce a way to abort the casting so if you did have to adjust to chainging circumstances you could.<P>Leggins: effect of elemental armor. This effect is fine. I never used spell before but now that i have item i do find occational use for it.<P>thats it, thanks<P>Mysthyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>-- XP Grinding --<P>SUMMARY:<P>Without clarity or a mana song, I'm highly inefficient in an xp grinding group. They'd be a lot better off with another tank/anything less mana dependent.<P>Sadly they know this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>DETAIL:<P>I'm painfully aware that without an enchanter or bard in my group, I am effectively a wasted resource.<P>I play a warrior too, and sadly its obvious that this is a problem. In this situation a rogue is often ideal (its amazing how much faster mobs go down with 2 tanks and a rogue). Almost anything is better than a rogue however.<P>This is an issue across all the levels. Remember we have mudinflation in EQ and people's expectation have changed from release. When most level 30 tanks are in full crafted and duel wielding yeks (items that used to be considered higher level), its nigh on impossible to really contribute as much as we take...<P>SOLUTION?:<P>Perhaps clarity gives too much of a mana regen and maybe it would be more equitable to have higher base regen. I can understand higher base regen with Clarity having a potential downside but how about nerfing clarity on wizzies a bit (and only wizzies), but upping base regen to compensate?<P>Other option of course is to knock a reasonable amount off the mana costs of our spells.<P>Another option is to give more classes a way to speed our mana regen in an efficient way much as there are secondary healers that make tanks more effective. We rely on one class that is HIGHLY in demand to be useful. I like this symbiosis idea as it won't make us uber kiters. Having said that don't want to step on chanter toes, so maybe it needs to be useable on a wizzie only or something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hi everyone. im a 55 wizard on nameless.and i just realized that i lost the last 8 month leveling mi wizard.im not enjoying it.i though everquest was all about *group* and meeting people.the problem is that im not usefull in any group. why ? sigh this could take a lot of page.... why dont we have anything that other class cant offer ? why didnt we get something that make us feel usefull in a group. i mean im tired of throwing a couple of nuke then sitting for 10 min while mage pet and necro pet still helping the group. i even dont call a wiz looking for group when i play my other char. i rather get a pet class. they are much more usefull then wizards. and what about *MASTER OF DAMAGE* hehe i got ksed by a shaman 1 week ago. wow im the god of damage.... . i feel like not playing my wizzie anymore and thats sad cause i put so much time in it. i would have been lvl 60 already if i started a cleric or enchanter cause i wouldnt have to bother searching a group for hours.people just prefer to invite pet class since they have so many cool option like COH for mage and boon of the garou for chanter (very cool spell) and necro can outdamge us easy with dots. and i dont need all those statistics about dmg ratio or wathever cause that is obvious that we are weak. <P>well im happy that i can express some of my frustration.<P>hope something will happen soon cause im not enjoying my wizard when i see what the other class can do. <P>i nuke and sit.<BR>can i do something fun ? plz cause nuking and nuking and nuking and being oom is boring.<BR>plz do something.....<BR>teleport...sigh i dont mind not teleporting anymore if i can just have a nice feature added to my spell book... just look the post i dont even need to say more..<P>cronosi actarus lvl 55 evoker. /lfg on *grin*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally have two complaints about the wizard class.  <P>1) At higher levels, you are nowhere near as damaging as other classes, although you are led to believe this.  This is not a class envy thing, this is a playability issue.  Groups pass us up in favor of other classes.  Hours of not finding a group means we log in our tanks or clerics or chanters so we can actually play.<P>2)  Cazic Gate -- This gate really is useless for a LONG time.  The higher level gates that drop into a dangerous area are tough, too, but at least at that level, you are playing with clerics that rez (or at least Verant assumes that).  At 24th, Cazic is the worst portal in the game.  Druids get no dangerous portals until MUCH later.  I think moving the Cazic gate to Rathe Mtns or Lake Rathe would be good.  It would not infringe upon druids title as "masters of travel" because they still get more TPs sooner.  At 20th, they get 4 useful TPs, we get 3.  At 24th, we get 5, and they get 4.  But our 5 include Cazic (useless), and NRo/WC/Nektulos.  Three TPs in the same vicinity.  We don't get SRo until 39th, which closes off the southern part of Antonica for the longest (have to run to Guk from NRo or NK).  The worst dungeon to get to is actually Cazic LOL!!  No one is going to TP into it, so you have to run from NK or NRo, instead of SRo.<P>Anyway, just some ideas.  Grouping really needs to be an option, and it isn't usually, because groups want efficiency.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aye.. I'm a 59 level Wizzy on Terris and I draw this conclusion...<BR>Why can a Wizard gather mana from his surroundings, and is the raw power of the Arcane(or supposed to be), but why at level 51 when we are dubbed a Channeler can we not atleast channel our mana to others withing our group like Necromancers(Children of Verant) can??? At the beginning of a raid when buffing and all sorts of preparations are being made I sit at FM while we wait for Clerics/Chanters to get twitched and get to FM... It would make us more useful and attractive to a group, and it's bad enough ya put Clerics and Chanters gear in Hate in the beginning so they won't show up for Fear raids... *LOL* We got the Shaft!!! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warining - This is a littlv class envy.  Feel free to skip this post.<P>I was so encouraged when I read the Druid Post.  Druids are almost our equal in Direct Damage and better than wizards in teleport in addition to their healing, buffs, DoTs and damage shields.  Now they are talking about improving their healing and adding more teleport locations (among other things) for druids.  This was great!  If they would do this for the druid class what would they do for wizards?<P>I was. to say the least, a little disappointed when the general attitude on wizards was, "We may change a couple of manir things, but we don't see a lot that needs worked on."<P>I would MUCH perfer a druid or mage in my group to a wizard.  Each of these classes can nuke almost as well as a wizard and adds SO much more to the party.  If you are limiting us to 'nuke only' - no healing - no buffing - no damage shield.  We should nuke head and shoulders above the rest.  Now we are only a little above the field.<P>Look into the maximum damage a wizard can do as a percent of the monsters hit points in the origional 3 continents.  Now look at the maximum damage a wizard can do as a percent of the monsters hit points in RoK.  Lastly look at the maximum damage a wizard can do as a percent of the monsters hit points in SoV.

</FONT><HR><BR>--- DMG Output ---<P>SUMMARY:<P>Our equivalents in dmg dealing appear to be monks/rogues. We just can't compete with dmg vs time with them in any sense. Clarity sure isn't as useful as CH...<P>DETAILS:<P>People suggest that giving more dmg output will:<P>a) Unbalance us.<BR>b) Get is killed.<P>Well addressing the second point first. No one said that it has to have a corresponding level of taunt.<P>On the first point, one thing that I don't understand is why its not desired that in a non-exceptional situation, wizards can do the same amount of dmg as a monk or rogue over time(our corresponding melees). When I say overtime, I mean being at approximately the same mana you started at whilst doing equiv dmg. This needs to be balanced with pulling rate, but thats not different to balancing heals.<P>Monks are rogues are very similar to wizards, they do dmg at the expensive of hp (and thats only if they get the aggro!). We do dmg at the expense of mana. One of these expenses costs an awful lot more than the other in terms of downtime... <P>The exceptional circumstance I referred to being, needing a fast burn down in emergency. Which I feel we should still be able to do, but it might require 15 mins top get back to that state...<P>SOLUTION:<P>Address mana cost of evocation spells.<P>Even if the spells do what seems to be a large amount of dmg in x seconds, remember its balanced by:<P>a) controlling aggro.<BR>b) medding to keep at the constant mana ideal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only reason I can get a group is because I know what I can do in a group, and many of the Enchanters I've kept alive can vouch for it *looks at Edmerlin*. My use of Stuns when Mezzes are resisted, or pets get on a mezzed target and can't get that sec break a Mage needs to pull em away from melee with a mob is why I get groups. I can't recall how many times I've stunned mobs to separate stacked Frogs so chanters can target, or stunned mobs so the chanter could get their Mezzes off. We definitely need a hand up on our spells, eventhough we are Mana efficient we are overall damage and gear deficient. Being a GM at another site before coming here I can ascertain a change has to be in the cards for us as Wizzies... It's a sad day when the rest of Norrath has to cater to Clerics and Enchanters because their is no alternative at higher level. We all have a role in this game and for once I'd like to see a Wizzy who at least has the option of calling his own evac, instead of letting Chanters and Clerics assume they get the final word on that decision.

</FONT><HR><BR>-- Multi Group XP Assignment --<P>SUMMARY:<P>No one is quite sure how the game now decides which GROUP gets xp, but it sure seems odd.<P>DETAIL:<P>A month or two ago something strange happened to xp allocation. It used to be dmg related, now it seems to be tied to aggro or number of hits perhaps. What it essentially means is that the melee group ALWAYS gets the xp on a raid now. This is bad news for caster groups, especially wizzies, as getting in a non-raid group isn't trivial.<P>Last night, in a multigroup raid, an ungrouped monk was consistently getting all the xp. Thats just not right.<P>Its also a problem on raids as if the melee group goes LD, then we have a corpse poof problem as we sure as hell aren't going to be able to get the kill assigned to a non LD group. In fact the other day a melee went LD in a Wuoshi raid. He got back on in time and got all the xp! (apparently whilst LD he continued to mack the mob and when he got on this wasn't disregarded).<P>SOLUTION:<P>Put it back on dmg, hell its perfectly equitable!<P>If you can provide a good reason not to do the above, then at least make it so that LD people don't contribute to whatever it is that now decided the xp assignment.

</FONT><HR>Bah - hit the wrong button :-) lets try that again<P>1. Fizzles<BR>Atols Shackles fizzles FAR too much - I am level 58 casting a spell 7 spell levels below me and I still get as many fizzles as sucessful casts.<P>2. Very little damage improvement 51-56, in fact 51-59 in some regards. Possibly smooth the graduation out some.<BR>The damage for the first 2 lure spells is the same (640) and the third at level 58 a very minor increase (680). The final lure spell increases the damage significantly (800+) and is available at 60th.<BR>The draught line does basically the same damage (3 different spells) 51-56. A small increase for the level 57 draught of ice then no new DD's until 60, where you suddenly get 2 new big nukes.<BR>Possible improvement to increase the mid level (51-59) nukes rather than have all the improvement at level 60.<P>3. UBER Mobs<BR>This is much stated in other posts and relates to the fact that the very high hp mobs in SOV are barely dented by Wizzys. <BR>The %ge damage option is much discussed above.<BR>Another possible option would be to have very slow casting very high mana/damage ratio nukes. e.g. 12 second casting 600 damage 100 mana - to pick some numbers out of the air.<P><BR>4. Alkabor line<BR>I am on a pvp server so I wouldnt use these anyway - but I cannot see any purpose to them when you have the pillar line.<BR>One possibility specific for Rallos Zek - make this line NOT hit other players (as per Point Blank AOE)<P>5. ROOT Line<BR>I have 5 root spells,<BR>Root, Enstill, Immobilise, Paralyzing Earth, Fetter.<BR>These appear to vary on casting time, mana cost and duration only.<BR>To be honest - if I only had the level 4 root available I would notice very little difference. The Root line is so unreliable anyway (doesnt have a fixed duration) and any nuking of a rooted mob seems to have a very high chance of breaking the root regardless of which type of root is used. <BR>Solution: Make the different types of root actually mean something different.<BR>e.g.<BR>Line1: Root / Paralyzing Earth<BR>Operates exactly as now.<BR>Line2: Enstill / Fetter<BR>Crowd control root. Fixed duration - but always breaks when mob is hit.<BR>Line3: Immobilise<BR>Nuke root, i.e. higher chance of holding when nuked.<BR>There are plenty more variations. e.g. low resist nukes. <BR>The basic point is lets have some reason to actually mem something other than "root".<P>6. Mana Regen<BR>Same old complaint - mana regen is too slow or mana usage too high for wiz. The harvest spell is nice - adds a few percent to the overall regen rate, but it is not enough IMO. Manaskin is pretty pointless for mana regen pusposes - you have to keep it running for 20+ mins to repay the mana cost in casting it - AND its all to easy to get hit a couple of times and lose it.<P>Just some babble to ponder.<P>Tekk (58 Wiz - RZ)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see changes in a totally different direction than most of the other posters. Wizards should do damage first, travel second. To that end, remove the root, snare, O'kels, and "pet" lines of spells. Double the casting time for all attack spells across the board, leave mana the same and increase damage by 50%. And finally, drop the artificial resistance caps or at least increase the levels up we can hit depending on the size of the party.<P>This would leave the wizard too slow to kill steal, greatly reduce his ability to solo but being a true master of damage because when he gets a spell off, monsters die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>CLASS BALANCE<P>Wizards are clearly underbalanced compared to many of the other classes. If this were not so:<BR>1) Mages who can easily solo casters, hill giants etc. with there pets at levels which would be suicide for wizards would not be the case. As it is I see Mages use their pets wonderfully, doing things at lower levels that I would not think of doing at 4 levels or more higher.<BR>2) Compared to other Casters, our mana to hp damage is negligably better. I agree that we should as a class be give either an improvement to our specialization, or IMPROVE OUR CHANNELING ABILITY COMPARED TO OTHER CLASSES. THEN EVEN IF WE GET HIT BY A HIGHER LEVEL MOB WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT DOING DAMAGE. ATLEAST AT HIGHER LEVELS. IT IS SAD TO SEE A MELEE CLASS DEALING OUT DAMAGED WHERE WIZARDS GET BEAT TO THE GROUND AND GET NOTHING OFF. If we are to be the masters of DD and casting in general, then we should be able to get the spells off if we get hit. <BR>3) Being masters of DD it seems only realistic that we would be able to buff ourselves agains magic attacks better than other classes don't you think? But at high levels (when wizzies are supposed to come into major power) our self buffs are only half as helpfull as other classes group buffs. High level wizzies should be able to resist most magical attacks or allow us to specialize in resisting a specific magic attack similar to the disciplines that warriors get at level 50.<BR>Im not saying we should be able to solo things any earlier than others but if a class can solo mobs of higher levels earlier than another class, that is not class balance. That is why people say wizards are only good for teleporting, and there are druid for that.<P>Just my oppinion. There are definately class balance issues. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Couple of things I didn't notice as I read, butI think are important for the earlier life of a Wizard.<P>1.  I cast Fade over 200 times and my Alteration skill only climbed 2 points. I am level 9 and still have Feeble Alteration and Abjuration skills. I can only get root to go off 1 time in 5 and then there is about a 50% resist rate on level 6-7 critters. It takes 4 attempts every time to get a Lesser Shielding to not fizzle. Are these skills going up too slowly, or am I missing something?<P>2.  How about a Counterspell skill?  We know damage spells better than anyone (supposedly) so we should know how to goof up someone casting an Evocation spell. This would make us group friendly as we could in essence provide "cover-fire" against incoming fire. Make it interrupt enemy casters so they still get a Channeling check to get the spell off.<P>3.  Why not make casting time on spells shorter as you rise above the skill needed to cast it. Either a 1% per level casting time reduction to all spells, or a 1% per 5 points in the related skill. This would be aggravating our OOM problem, but would put our chain-nuking capabilities up. To balance at higher levels, the casting times would scale up so the base value is the same at the time the spell is gained.<P>4.  I know this was addressed, but I feel our damage caps should be placed at the level before we get another spell of the same element. For example, Shock of Frost increases until you get Shock of Ice</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, one other thing,<P>Absor, your suggested BLINK spell, which procs a shadowstep when you get hit, is an absolutely horrid idea, and outside of PvP would never be used.  Additionally, it would be WAY overpowering in PvP.<P>On a PvE server, outside of duels, NOBODY uses shadowstep type spells, as; 1) They dont clear agro 2) The mob instantly knows where you are and hunts you down 3) They are bugged (z axis travel).<P>Now on a PvP server, having wizards insta shadowstep whenever they got hit, would be just HORRIFIC for tanks...<P>However, if you are game to entertain new spell ideas such as this, what I would LOVE to see is the following series of spells:<P>Instil Flame (lvl 20):<BR>Target:Others in group only<BR>Effect:Installs a 25 point damage proc in targets weapon, resisted on the lure resists.<BR>Duration:5 Minutes<BR>Mana:100<P>Then:<BR>Instil Frost at 24th. Dur=7 minutes, dam=33, Mana=130<P>So, that at level 60, a wizard could more or less, buff a tank to proc similar to the Paladin epic proc.<P>You have the code to do this (the Paladin proc is an example, plus you have coded lures.  It is inline with the character description, and does not really step on anybodies toes.<P>THis is a different solution that giving wizards damage shields (which is OOC).  The wizard remains an offencive caster, but now has the ability to contribute passive damage to a fight, thru all levels starting at 20.<P>This line of spells alone would go A LONG way toward making wizards MUCH more desirable to groups, without taking ANYTHING from another class.<P>Please consider it, if you offset our class, by giving us another useless spell ala BLINK (to add to the 30 useless spells already in my spellbook), im going to go insane...<P>Serapth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I havn't seen it yet, but rather than giving "spell" effects to wizard items, why not have more things like wizard only mana regen robes?  The number of GOOD wizard only items are VERY VERY VERY VERY low.  Ok, mid levels, +int is great, but 50+, the majority of people have their int way up, so you see more +mana items.  Why not have the uber items give you a higher mana regen without the need to click to get the effect?  More items that disable the need to cast a spell for an effect would help as well.  How about an item that is wiz only that would reduce casting time by a given percentage, or lower the mana cost, or up the max damage on all our spells, or lower the taunt of all spells cast?  THESE sorts of things would re-define the use of wizards at higher levels, since they are high level items, probably be nodrop, and would also give WIZARDS a reward.  Focus items are nice, they are really useful, but where is the wizard version of something like this that boosts the things the wizard focusses on.<P>The best items should allow the gate spell to be cast in 2.5 seconds instead of 5 for example.  Faster casting for the same spell, 50% bump.  Or make it a discipline or something for wizards.  Or enhanced damage, +50% damage for all spells.  Give us SOMETHING in the 50+ range.  Note that the upgrade from 1120 ice comet is only in the 1600 range(don't have it yet so don't remember the exact damage).  Same casting time, yet DoT spells do more damage.<P>Or Damage over time spells that fit the image of the wizard.  Give us something to enhance what we have.<P>And last but not least, take the mob cap off area of effect spells.  How can a spell with an area of effect not work on ALL in the area of effect?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally I think it's incredibly sad that after months of posts about the problems with wizards Verant doesn't take any of it seriously.  I leveled my wizard up to 55, but now routinely sit in zones like Sebilis looking for a group for 2+ hours along with 5 or 6 other wizard.  I'm totally fed up.  Things have only gotten worse with SoV. The only way I manage to get a group is with guild members or when I form it myself an manage to grab the very much sought after cleric and enchanter before other groups do - and before you flame me I have an extremely good rep on my server.<P>I had hope when I saw the topic of the thread.  No more.  They've sent us a clear message that wizards are screwed and we'd better live with it.<P>I now spend all my time these days playing my cleric, enchanter, and necro.  All of these characters are considered much more powerful by players than wizards, and in their roles are quite a bit more powerful than wizards are.  Verant may not think there is any balance issue, but I guarentee you that 99% of the players in EQ think there is. <P>I've played since the beta test but if Verant only comes out with window dressing changes for Wizards then I quit.  I enjoy the other classes I play, but a wizard has always been my favorite.  Now that it's weak compared with the other classes that we can't find groups anymore then I think it's time to move on to another game.  So much for the new more responsive Verant.<P>- Balk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>-- The Uber Velious mob problem --<P>SUMMARY:<P>You are aware of our issue against massive hp mobs!<P>DETAILS:<P>Whilst I originally promoted % dmg spells, its occured to me that this isn't the actual issue. This is a symptom of an overideing inbalance in the wizard class. It all comes to dmg/time. I already covered it in the post below.<P>Essentially we cannot consistently dmg at the same rate as other classes over time. Not even in the slightest. The massive hp on velious mobs just serves to highlight this issue. Its not velious specific!<P>Please bare in mind that the wizard's forte, fast dmg, is actually pretty worthless in most grinding situations.<P>SOLUTION:<P>Address this fundamental flaw and I think a lot of other problems will disappear with it.<P>Using normal spells (not lures) we should over time be able to do as much dmg as monk/rogue. I don't care if a few support classes are required to pull this off (equiv of healer), but right now its chanter or bard only and even then we don't compete on dmg.<P>Remember its balanced by:<P>a) controlling aggro.<BR>b) medding to keep at the constant mana ideal.<P>In fact why not just do the mana pool is joined to health pool thing - then we can just use the healer class framework that exists already. Health would have to be at a 2:1 ratio to equiv mana though as wizzies only have 1000hp. This would make us work in a similar way to melees. In fact there are numerous ways of tying this up. The best bit would be that in emergency we could dump mana/health and seriously jeopardise our life expectancy in doing so (balance). In fact we could kill ourselves!<P>--- DMG Output ---<BR>SUMMARY:<P>Our equivalents in dmg dealing appear to be monks/rogues. We just can't compete with dmg vs time with them in any sense. Clarity sure isn't as useful as CH...<P>DETAILS:<P>People suggest that giving more dmg output will:<P>a) Unbalance us.<BR>b) Get is killed.<P>Well addressing the second point first. No one said that it has to have a corresponding level of taunt.<P>On the first point, one thing that I don't understand is why its not desired that in a non-exceptional situation, wizards can do the same amount of dmg as a monk or rogue over time(our corresponding melees). When I say overtime, I mean being at approximately the same mana you started at whilst doing equiv dmg. This needs to be balanced with pulling rate, but thats not different to balancing heals.<P>Monks are rogues are very similar to wizards, they do dmg at the expensive of hp (and thats only if they get the aggro!). We do dmg at the expense of mana. One of these expenses costs an awful lot more than the other in terms of downtime... <P>The exceptional circumstance I referred to being, needing a fast burn down in emergency. Which I feel we should still be able to do, but it might require 15 mins top get back to that state...<P>SOLUTION:<P>Address mana cost of evocation spells.<P>Even if the spells do what seems to be a large amount of dmg in x seconds, remember its balanced by:<P>a) controlling aggro.<BR>b) medding to keep at the constant mana ideal.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Wizard damage on the new high level mobs in SoV is woefully inadequate, this needs to be addressed. That has already been addressed so I will move on.<P>2) Conjuration  - this skill is hardly ever used for most wizards. I would like to see some of the summon spells useable by wizards. Not the bulk summon spells of the magician or higher level spells, but some of the very low level utility summon spells. Summon food, summon water, summon bandage, summon arrow. I don't care to be the master summoner, but I would like something useful to use for conjuration. Eye of Zomm has some limited uses, but not enough to maintain a good conjuration skill. Nor do I think these should be low level wizard spells, but rather accessible in the mid levels 20 - 39. <P>3) Sight spells - In the wizard description this is listed as one of the wizard highpoints. Why would it be unbalancing to allow the wizard to buff sight? Enchanter - shaman have better things to do with their mana, let me help out in this area. After all it is one of my supposed specialties. Am I not already capable of casting see invisible - sooner than any other class.<P>4) Healing - With bind wound capped at 100 and only able to heal to 50% this skill is pretty worthless to wizards. What I propose is to enhance bind wound or give the wizard a low level healing spell similiar to the healing line of the ranger. This would have limited use. You could never be the groups healer, but it could be useful to top off group members HP to balance your mana pool with that of the healers. I group with some druid friends frequently. And with the druids buffing healing and snaring it is typical for me to have less mana strain.<P>5)O'Keils line - These 2 spells are near ridiculous. Since the damage component is pretty worthless, I propose increasing the duration. This could be level based from it's current duration at the level received to 30 minutes at 15 to 20 levels above the spell level. That might make it worth casting on a semi regular basis.<P>6)Clickable spells - long casting times on clickable items makes these worthless for the most part. Could these be changed to recast time? This is the same penalty as far as ability to use but would allow the caster to med, move, go on to the next spell etc. Perhaps 5 sec cast with 30 sec recast.<P>7)Everquest? - Most anything worthwhile in this game is not quest related. It is camp related.<BR>Extemely long arduos quests to add statpoints, spell advantages, new spells, mana regen , running speed, etc. would be very beneficial from my viewpoint. I often get in the game for an hour at a time, at my level an hour is not enough time to do much of anything. If I could start on some epic quest that did not revolve around camping a rare spawn with a rare drop needing 40 people or more to take the mob I would be most appreciative. Even if the quest required many steps, money, mob drops at the appropriate level, I would even trade in some XP for something worthwhile.<P>8) Enduring breath - this is a general utility spell that could easily enhance a wizard in a few situations that would not infringe on other classes. I hardly think a shaman or druid or enchanter would be refused from a group because the wiz can already cast enduring breath in an underwater group. Again a minor utility spell that could help balance an underwater groups mana useage.<P>9) Mana regen - HP regen These should be enhanced, even if it must be quested for. I started noticing in my early 40's that clarity didn't seem to make the big difference in downtime that it did when I was in my 20's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
