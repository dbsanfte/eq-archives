</FONT><HR>On aggro:<P>Verant is right on the money with aggro. The more damage (direct or indirect) you do, the more angry the mob will be with you. Wizards should have to manage that fact. There are ways to deal with aggro both solo and in groups. I've never liked the idea of reduced aggro spells. Wizards should be powerful nukers and MOBs being attacked should hate them.<P>Aggro should be based on damage done, not potential damage. If I were a MOB getting whipped by a warrior, I don't think I would be all that concerned about that wimpy wizard who I just resisted his Ice Comet for 2 points.<P>A critical dd hit for a wizard is a TERRIFIC IDEA!<P>A 5% might be low. I only say that because of the number of spells that a wizard throws on average per hour. If you're a warrior then a critical hit occuring 1 out of every 100 or more hits might be ok because you are hitting thousands of times per hour. For every 100 swings of a warrior, the wizard casts far fewer dd spells. I'm not sure the median number, but for the sake of argument, let's say it was 5. It would then follow that the wizard critical hit should be a percentage 20 times more than the warrior.<P>I don't know the exact numbers, but I encourage Verant to do the math and balance the percentages appropriately. This is a great idea. But if it only goes off once in an 8 hours session then it will be a dud.<P>--Les<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see other effects besides extra damage from wiz spells. Remember wild mages from AD&D? They were a hoot just because you could end up fighting mobs dressed in tutu's or other wacky stuff.  Maybe a table of stuff including extra damage, minor spell effects on the mob, minor spell effects on the wiz, or just about anything else would actually be a fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>I love the idea!<BR>I love the idea of it being based on DEX!<P>I think that it should reasonable occur once every 3 - 5 fights roughly.  Assuming a high 3 casts per fight that 6% - 11% chance.  The variation could be based on DEX.<P>The damage could be variable too, which would address the "over the top". Say 50% - 100% more effective, again this could be based on DEX.<P>Third, given technical feasibility, the ability could be implemented as a Self Only Buff, allowing the Wizard to control whether or not the ability is active.  This would solve the problem of some Wizards being opposed to the idea.  Also, while I don't think this is necessary, a component could be added to this buff to help balance it.<P>/em drool<P>/beg Abashi<P>Thanks for the post all, and thanks for the comment Abashi.<P><BR>Xien 37th Wizard of Solusek Ro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think this is a great idea. I don't think it fixes everything, but what does? It'd be a nice little extra feature and I've always wished for some kind of critical blast with a variable upper end on the damage. <P>I wouldn't worry in the slightest on the increased aggro. Already as wizards we have to learn to deal with aggro and just because a foe gets mad at us for a few seconds doesn't mean we're going to instantly die. This happens all the time. Wizards are able to draw foe attention and survive. You let the tanks taunt a foe off, you back off for a little while, you hit the foe with Concussion, you allow another caster to blast to distract, and you use your Skin lines.<P>I ALWAYS have a skin line up. It's well worth the price. Prior 52nd I always kept Steelskin up, and since 52nd I almost always have Manaskin up. Yes it's expensive but I find it well worth it. It allows me to take the accidental aggro hit or two, concussion the foe, and go on with business as usual.<P>You can cast an ice comet on a foe without aggro'ing it. You can cast 2 ice comets on a foe without aggro'ing it. Extra damage doesn't automatically make a foe angry, particularly if everyone else is doing their job and you're good at timing.<P>It's true if you're already pushing the edge on aggro and you get a surprising extra hard hit you may put yourself in danger, but I think that'd add to the excitement. It might also let you kill a foe a little quicker and save someone, or stop a runner or just hell do a little more damage than you're used to, which is a good thing.<P>I fully support this idea.<P>Also I definitely support the concept of having this based on a stat we don't ordinarily have a use for, namely Dexterity. Yes, keep the max % low to keep it balanced so it doesn't happen all the time, but keep in mind with a full mana pool on our top-level spell we're not casting it all that often, no where NEAR as often as a melee person is swinging. <P>Allowing this to go on a stat like Dex would be a huge boon given how many caster items have this stat, and how we were originally given the impression Dex would be a meaningful stat for a spellcaster. Dexterity so far as I can tell plays 0 role with a wizard the way the game is presently designed, so that'd be a nice thing to have. (Yes, I am a gnome and I do have over 100 dex, so maybe I'm biased!)<P>I know if this happens there will be whining from other classes, but I think it'll be a good thing and not unbalanced even if it goes off with some frequency.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Gordon, there is no obvious logical reason why the critical cast should generate more aggro than the regular cast. As far as I know, spells generate a fixed aggro, and a fully resisted spell generates the same fixed amount of aggro as a spell doing full damage; so, why should a spell doing more-than-full damage generate more aggro than the fixed amount ???<P>But you probably assume that the enhancement must be give-and-take. If it turns out that the enhancement HAS to be give-and-take (extra aggro for critical casts), then DON’T DO IT. It’s part of a Wizard’s basic job to contro aggro (either in order to pass unnoticed or to provoke), and that kind of unpredictability would be a major pain in the neck. But, must the enhancement be give-and-take ? Hmmm...<P>Let’s separate two very different cases: pre-50 and post-50. Oops, I mean pre-50 MOBS and post-50 MOBS, not pre-50 Wizards and post-50 Wizards. First of all, are you able to code a chance for critical cast which depends on the level of the target mob, instead of depending on the level of the Wizard ?<P>Pre-50 mobs: let’s admit it, Wizards, whatever their level, do quite enough damage on pre-50 mobs. It would be COOL if the critical cast feature was added (it would confirm Wizards as magical mirror images of Warriors), but it would be essentially nice-to-have, and, if you do it, give a very small chance, far less than 5% as you said; it’s OK, just for the rare fun of it (but no added aggro).<P>Post-50 mobs: there is this emerging issue of Wizards losing their power against post-50 mobs because of rocketing mob hit points. The happiest (?) of post-50 Wizards (I mean those who fight 51+ mobs, not those who limit themselves to bullying mobs in their high 40s) seem to be those who have accepted good-heartedly the challenge of making AE damage spells their MAIN OFFENSE. But there’s something very wrong with the idea (as I hear them say) that using DD on post-50 mobs is "a waste". Apart fom this minority showing much goodwill, players won’t forgive you for forcing them into that kind of diluted, non-flexible, low-sting AE fighting, and you will have increasing complaints. This critical cast thing can be a solution, if you give a rocketing chance for critical cast when casting on a level 51+ mob, to follow somewhat the mob hit point curve; possibly to the point when the critical cast becomes something to be relied on; I wouldn’t be surprised, considering the current spell stats, if the DD spells actually needed a chance for critical cast (potentially doubling the damage) of about 50% when cast on high 50s mobs.<BR>This could make sense in roleplaying, if you pretend that Wizard DD inherently resonates with the life energy level of their target, and tend to burst into critical damage on the mobs having the highest life energy (i.e. mobs of level 51+).<BR>At any rate, keep a fixed aggro for the spells; you can possibly raise somewhat the fixed aggro of some higher level spells, depending on how often you think they will generate critical casts; but no variable aggro, or forget the “enhancement“.<P>Oops, last note: I hope critical casts are for DD only, not AE. Pre-50 AE damage spells are bad (I mean, two spells out of three are bad), and need a much deeper fix than the addition of critical casts. Post-50 AE (except AlKabor) is good, and there’s nothing to add.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>How about giving wizards (If this is technically possible) a self-only buff that gives them a chance to critical cast? This way the wizard will choose if they want to risk the extra taunt, and this way you can also give the wizards upgrades (I.E, 3% chance to crit at 12, 4% at 24, 5% at 39, 6% at 49, 7% at 55, 8% at 60 or something of the sort). Or if you are worried about power, give them a line of spells similar to the enchanter charm spells (They get worst every level, but you can't use the more efficient older one to charm mobs of your level)... I.E 10% chance at 12 which won't work on nukes above 20, and going down...<P>If that isn't a technical possibility, is it technically possible to make the added damage not taunt?<P>And finally, if neither of these are possible... is there any way to put it in the options tab for Wizards if you want to critical or not? Or put in another nuke with identical efficiancy to the nuke at that level every few levels (Again... 12, 24, 39, 49, 55, 60 or something of the sort) with the possibility to crit?<P>Or does Verant think that the possibility of the wizard killing himself by adding this ability is a good thing? As an enchanter, if I get a few resists and rile up the taunt on post-50 mobs, I end up wasting half the healers mana... I'm not sure what most wizards think, but a way for us light-armored and low HP'd casters to taunt more sounds pretty horrible, no matter what the benefits are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon, a way to improve our group-friendliness is to make stronger crit chance, crit dmg, etc graduate higher depending on how many people a wizard is grouped with.<P>This also eliminates any KS problem potential.<P>It also makes us much more desireable in a group, knowing the more people in the group the higher chance and dmg our crit can have. Even paired it should be something, but noticeably better in a group (where we of course are taking on much stronger mobs anyway).<P>This also works in with the post about following the mob HP curve more, since obviously those take full groups if strong mobs.<P>I also agree completely that either keep the aggro the same whether resist or crit, or give us the fairness of aggro based on actual dmg for both. But not one w/o the other (and I prefer the first alternative of keeping it constant anyway).<P>What do you think about the dependence on group size for really good crit dmg?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Matisse, I had had the same idea of a power depending on group size, but it was for mana regeneration. I thought Wizards could have a self-only Clarity which would give extra mana depending on how many members there are in the group, i.e. nothing for 1-3 players and an increasing bonus for 4-5-6 players.

</FONT><HR>I know this is kind of low lvl, but I conducted a primitive test with my lvl 20 mage and 20 wizard to see damage output.<P>The "subject" was an aviak harrier. My wizard di 157 dd, and killed the bird 5 out of the ten times he tried.<P>My mage, on the other hand, using his fire pet, did 146 dd, with a pet that was hitting for 22,bashing and kicking for 8, casting dd and damage shields. Yes, the mage was outdamaging the wizard, yet every time the pet died, and without root, the mage was toast shortly thereafter. <P>So, the wizard won5 out of 10, the mage 0 out of 10. This means that wizards are better soloers, at least in most cases.<P>However, in a group, Wizards get nothing of value except a little more dd, and an evacuation at later levels. <P>Mages get attacker/tanks, almost as much dd, damage shields for tanks, and VERY useful summoned items. <P>Enchanters get clarity, mez, stuns, etc. <P>Necros get lifetaps, some dd, ungodly DoT, attacker pets, fears (though not often used for train reasons) and mana/hp leaches.<P>Druids get 95% of wizards DD with dmg shields, buffs, SoW, Skins, etc etc etc <P>Clerics get heals (didn't know that, did ya?) and some ok but rarely used dd.<P>Bards just rock, don't ask.<P>That covers all the casters, cept hybrids. In a group, wizards are CLEARLY less useful. This is a damn fine idea, this crit damage.<P>HOWEVER, I was under the impression that warriors have a 1% chance of a crit. In an average fight, the wizard casts 2 times, to the warrior's 25 or so swings. <P>So, In order to make it even, Wizards should have a 25% chance to do up to about 25% more damage. This decreases the variable range, thereby making aggro easier to control. However, you would do about the same TOTAL damage, just having the crit bonus spread out over more casts. Still with me? God I hope so cause it's not too complicated.<P>So, in the end, I have played MANY classes, and oddly enough, my favorite caster was BY FAR Wizard, and my favorite tank/attacker BY FAR was Rogue, commonly regarded as the 2 most useless classes in the game.<BR>This is because they are FUN- They don't lvl up as fast, they don't camp well, but they are FUN. This is a game, a good game is fun.<BR> THis is a damn good game. If you campers want to sit there and bore your asses off holding the same spawn for 5 hours be my guest, cause I don't want to camp. Can you guess why?<P>Happy, funloving wizard of the Tribunal.<P>P.S. The reason  why is because camping isn't fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all I like the idea as well. As far as careful use of dmg as to not agro the mob... all the more reason to be careful, and a little more added danger and need for group cooperation and attentivness. <P>BigBadBunker just a side note on your comparison. Although I hate comparison discussions  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> anyways. What spell were you using. You said lvl20 wiz. the only new DD there is Force Shock. Which is all or nothing spell ranging from 171-179 depending on level. You said your 20 wiz hit the harrier for 157? The 2 next lower DD's max at 125 and 110? something doesnt add up for me. In addition the Mag spell is a line of sight spell here. These can be difficult to use in some situations, this situation seemed to be ideal for a LOS considering how open and flat SK is. Also the Force Shock is a specialized weapon, and in my opinion this wasnt a good place for that one. First it is all or nothing spell. Gets checked twice for a full resist. It is poorly suited for a red opponent or verh high yellow as Harriers range from 24-26. I am surprised you could land any of them on a red target. Ideal target for this spell would be blue or even and a caster since it has a nice stun to interrupt the targets casting with, as opposed to a tank like a Harrier. Anyways I realize you were saying that the Wizard was a better solo player in this case. Your numbers just didnt add up on my calculator (although it is a tinkered calculator i got from some shady gnome) <P>Noslom Tallandpale 33.9th Wizard<BR>Erollisi MArr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The nature of the aggro of spells is still a little bit of a mystery and I don't think we've ever figured it out exactly. I'm just posting in reference to a previous post where it was indicated all spells aggro the same, which just isn't true.<P>The amount of damage does seem to factor into aggro, although I'm not sure exactly how. But I definitely have in the past modulated aggro by casting many smaller nukes vs. a larger one, and if you go to a small enough nuke you can chain-cast without drawing a foe's attention if there are others involved in the battle.<P>This said, I don't think it's the most important factor and I don't think it'll immediately make the wizard a smear of blood on the ground the second he rolls a critical hit. I can hit a foe with an ice comet and not get attacked and I can hit a foe with a Draught and not get attacked, yet the IC is almost twice the damage of the Draught.<P>I think there is something that happens when a spell is resisted, it tends to have highest possible aggro. I think maybe this counts as a different "category" of spell. This would be hard to test, but I have a feeling an Ice Comet of 1120 damage does less aggro than a full resisted Ice Comet. I would be willing to bet the resisted spell goes in the "extremely aggro non-damaging spell" category, similar to a stun or a major debuff.<P>Any wizard who has nuked alongside an enchanter will tell you enchanter nukes have huge aggro, most likely due to the 0 second stun component. I think this spell basically counts as TWO spells for aggro... One as a "high aggro non damage" and then also aggro for the damage itself.<P>I once was helping a considerably lower level enchanter fighting hill giants. I was casting Ice Comets and he was casting something like a 300 damage range DD. Without exception the hill giant was generally chasing the enchanter instead of me, unless I cast 2 times.<P>We are all aware of roots and snares being relatively high aggro, along with the shaman slow debuffs, enchanter mesmorization & charm, etc. Some of these DO seem to be variable, however. I think charm aggros more than root, etc. No one knows exactly how these equations work, and it's a very hard thing to test.<P>But I do remain convinced that on a basic DD which is just damage, the higher damage will cause more aggro, but I also think the critical hit concept will NOT cause that large of a problem, particularly if wizards are already prepared to deal with aggro...<P>A 48 level wizard is casting a 600+ point DD, conflagration. He gets Ice Comet and is suddenly casting an 1100+ damage DD, almost a 100% improvement. Yet most wizards don't just immediately die because of this. You still space out your blasts. Yes this could cause some additional aggro at a bad time, but I say this is EXACTLY what happens when a spell is resisted, which is also an unforeseen circumstance...<P>If I'm fighting a foe with my usual mix of stuns & DD, I sometimes get a nasty surprise. I toss a stun out early, with the intention of hitting with Concussion after... The stun is RESISTED, making the foe very angry... He runs at me, hits my Manaskin a couple times, I cast Concussion on him, and he goes back about his business, then I DD him once I feel the tanks have gotten his attention properly.<P>Having the critical hit would be similar, but at least have the very substantial advantage of DAMAGING the foe, even more than usual. I'd very happily take some added aggro for hurting a foe more vs. NOT hurting the foe at all because of a resist and still having to endure increased aggro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well lots of different versions of the critical strike for wizards have come up. I think something along that lines is a good idea...but 5% chance of 100% increase? thats crazy. a) its suicide for wizzies b) its WAY too powerful.<P>Someone once proposed a teired system that had a .5% chance of 100% extra damage, but at the other end of the spectrum a 20% chance of 20-40% increase.<P>Something like that might be useful. Another route is a random chance of decreased casting time...<P>These are all ideas to kick around, but i would much rather have wizards granted some form of a group friendly ability. Abashi offers us the fact that we have the highest damage/mana ratios of any class in the game as our 'group friendly' ability. He also offers evacs. Evacs are nice, but why would anyone take a wiz as an evaccer when theres a druid around (And tehres *ALWAYS* a druid around, given that at any moment theres at LEAST twice as many druids on as wizards)<P>So how about some small ability that makes us valuable to a group. It could be somthing thats totally worthless in a solo situation! Damage sheild upgrades? (to our 4th level spell) Mana sharing, or a group harvest? Other target elemental sheilding? <P>Actually, it comes to mind there is a low level drudi ability, a self only attack buff that basically causes you to proc a 1 or 2 point fire spell on melee (I *THINK* thats what it was anyway) What about something like that? 'Soandso skin flares with searing flames' and the effect would be when the player hits a mob he can do 1-50 extra points of elemental damage? Even handier, give us progressively more powerful that are bound to a psecific element. Like a fire one at lower levels, ice at intermediary, poison or disease at higher or whatever. Hell, give us the ability to cast rabies on a mob. Thatd be a handy ability. Temporarily prevent mobs from regenerating hitpoints. That might be enough to make wizards a valued element of a group.<P>Verant has told us repeatedly that wizards are not broken. Im inclined to agree. Wizards arent broken per sey. We output massive damage relatively quickly. (4000+ in &lt;30seconds at 46) BUT, we arent group friendly at all and that is frustrating and difficult to play with. <P>So verant, consider talking to us. We wizards know a lot about our class really....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
