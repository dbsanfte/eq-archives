Essentially, we are adjusting the level at which some of their spells are attained to make them more in line with their power.<P>Here is a list that I, once again, stole from Everlore because I'm lazy and because it seems accurate:<P>a) Add Endure Cold at 22<BR>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59<BR>c) Add FireFist at 22<BR>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39<BR>e) Add Spikecoat at 49<BR>f) Add resist cold at 55<BR>g) Add Panic Animal at 22<BR>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors<P>Let's talk about these changes and others that might be needed to 'balance' rangers.<P>Keep in mind that I primarily want to talk about 'balance' here. I'll certainly list any bugs that you would like to see addressed, but the focus should be balance. And please be concise when responding. These threads will get very long, and it helps me to be able to read all the responses if they are to the point.<P>Let's hear what you have to say.<P>Alan<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm a Level 57 Ranger, and have very few complaints about my class and here they are:<P>-After our level 39, Dismiss Summoned, Rangers recieve no upgrade DD vs summoned mobs. Banished Summoned (Level 44 Druid Spell: 225 mana, 585 dmg) would be an appropriate upgrade at level 58.<P>-Drones of Doom (The level 54 Ranger DOT) is not used by rangers unless they are messing around, if this is of any concern to the test team. It is not worth getting one's conjure skill up just for this spell.<P>-Make the trueshot discipline do equal to or more than the damage a ranger does while meleeing.<P>-Add some new fletching materials to make bows with. Don't spend time making new arrows, because everyone makes the cheapest ones, or summons them with the tolan's bracer (unless you could make an arrow with a snare, slow or stun proc perse).<P>-I honestly don't care how many hp's or defense points I have, since I have not tanked for a few months. Jolt works great for me, although I rarely use it. I love how rangers have turned into non-tanking melee damage class. This is exactly what I wanted to be all along, but it doesn't really happen until level 51+.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, another thing I would like to bring up is mitigation of damage.  That is the biggest issue to me.  The difference for me on high level mobs when from 900ac to 1180ac is nil.  I get hit for full at about 60-65% no matter the ac.  If we could get a higher mitigation on this I would be extremely happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I may not have a popular view here, but I think that the level 22 fear spell(panic animal) should not go live. <P>Aside from the roleplay part where we protect bears and not frighten the crud out of them (poor Cross Treewind must be turning over in his grave), I really don't want to see the Rangers become a D00D class in the public eye down the road. (Where everybody solo's through to high levels in record time) <P>It's a strong soloers spell for levels where Rangers can solo pretty well already.<P>Just the way I see it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I shall speak candidly. This is an exercise in futility since the changes that NEED to be made, won't. It is as simple as that.<BR>No matter what candy changes are made they will never restore the balance there once existed prior to ROK. Do a simple ingame poll. Simply type /"class" count. You will see 2 to 3 times more warriors than any other melee class. There's a reason for this. No other melee class can equal the defense and hps of the warrior coupled with their offensive abilities. Only a desperate group would choose a hybrid over a warrior for it's tank. PERIOD. This WILL NOT change, that I am confident of. Unless drastic changes are made to the hybrids, they are a peripheral class at best, obsolete at worse.<P>Rangers have some nice utlity spells, but cheap and readily available potions exist now. Sow, levitate come to mind. Fine, rangers don't have to buy this.<P>What groups want from their tank is DURABILITY. and make no mistake about it, rangers ARE a tank. They are primarily a melee class with weak spells. To cast these spells means to do LESS damage than melee.<P>The concept of BALANCE died the day ROK came out.<P>You truly want to balance the classes? Then do the things I and many others have suggested since the day ROK was released.<P>1. Give ranger the same defense as rogue/monk. None of this up it 20 or so points. That's just begging. I have YET to hear a sound argument justifying the defense discrepancy between these three classes. Neither the rongue/monk can wear plate; neither the rogue/monk can taunt; and both are the highest in melee damage. They are designed specifically NOT to tank. Yet they are given the highest defense. Ranger in many cases is forced to tank and is forced to TAUNT to get the critter onto it. <P>Understand, however, that this will make ranger defense equal to the plate-wearers too. But remember, the platewearers armor gives them a substantial ac boost as a result. Without this defense the ranger will ALWAYS remain a poor melee choice.<P>2. Give rangers a group evac spell. I've tried to think of SOMETHING UNIQUE and GROUP DESIREABLE for the ranger. This is it. Want to go in a dungeon? Can't find a druid or wizard? Hey let's get that ranger looking for a group. We've suffered enough as being the outcast. Give us something that would actually make us sought out for for a change. Since this spell line is from our parent class it is completely justifiable.<P>3. Increase ranger hps. Why would a cleric want to use Cheal on a 2k hp'd class when for the same cost he can Cheal a 4k one?<P>4. When will a tracking scroll bar for ranger be implemented? I'm tired of only seeing the last 20 spawns in the zone. And give it to rangers ONLY. I'm also tired of being penalized for having a high tracking skill.<P>5. I WILL say this, because the more I thought about it the more it DOES make sense. Give ALL HYBRIDS gate/bind. There, I said it. ALL casters have these LOW LEVEL spells. Hybrids ARE casters too. Are we SO STUPID that we are incapable of learning these spells? Fine let the rogue/monk/warrior drool over something we hybrids can do that they can't for a change.<P>The warrior/rogue/monk HAVE replaced the hybrid as the melee class of choice, with warrior being literally the MOST desireable. If you just TINKER with the hybrid by giving them piddly changes and tweaks this WILL NOT change.<P>You did something that you SWORE you would never ever do (see your own FAQ), to wit: do away with the exp penalty. I applaud you for this. Now do what you MUST do to give hybrids EQUAL DESIREABILITY, you owe this to those customers who have played these classes since this game came alive. <P>Maxxius Insanius<BR>Level 57 ranger The Nameless server<BR>Level 52 ranger Tholuxe Paells server <BR>Level 50 ranger Cazic Thule server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>As a long time player of the ranger class (August of 1999), I would like to lend my support to the earlier posts on the ranger issues.  Especially the ones that have been mentioned multiple times over concerning defense.  I will not repost any of the covered issues because they have been stated much better than I ever could.  As of now, there are 2 minor issues that I hope could be looked at.<P>Issue 1: The Raincaller quest bow.  This bow requires turning in a fletched trueshot bow.  I personally fletched my very own trueshot and did the every single step of the quest for my raincaller.  The stats and the range are very nice additions to the Raincaller.  Without a way to recharge the right click firestrikes, they 5 charges are considered useless.  Especially at higher levels where a single nuke from other classes can outdamage all 5 charges.  The main problem with the bow is that it remained 20 damage and 45 delay.  This is the exact same statistics as the trueshot that was used in the quest.  I would request that you go back and upgrade the Raincaller bow to 25 damage 40 delay.  This would significantly improve the bow and would keep the raincaller in use by many more high level rangers.<P>Issue 2: Tolan's Dardwood Boots.  While you have seen the posts concerning the questionable effects of tolans armor, my concern is with the location where the boots are dropped.  Every piece of tolan's besides the breastplate and legs drop off mobs that are in good experience and loot areas.  The boots are very rare drops in the sewers of Karnors, a spot which is rarely every camped because of its difficulty and lack of reward.  I would like to request that you consider moving the boots to another more frequented mob in Kunark so that the rarity of the boots is lessened.  I personally have seen a level 60 ranger in full tolans minus the boots.  The boots should be no more rare the other tolans pieces.<P>I would like to say that I am drooling at the expected ranger tracking enhancements soon to come.  Please HURRY with them!!!<P>Many thanks to you for the improvements that have been made to the Ranger class lately and on test.  Let us hope that you are able to continue the great work.<P>Aravan Windwalker<BR>53'rd Season Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I would like to see happen to the ranger class.<P>1.) Have our hps increase to that of at least the Sk/pally level. Rangers take a double hit on that with having some of the lowest Ac gear and hps in the tanking class. Its much like the hybird mana pool.<P>2.) Give us at least the defensive skills increase that all the other tank classes got at the release of Kunark.<P>3.) How about an upgrade to the Agi buff for rangers.<P>4.) If were to be the offensive hybird how bout giving us the dmg bonus that the primary hand gets in our off hand.<P>5.) Triple attack would be nice but dont think it will happen heh.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I have a few different requests.<P>Please consider making eyes of the cat's duration much longer, I play a human ranger and have to keep this spell memmed all the time because of its short duration.<P>Please consider making calefaction have the same or better mana/damage ratio as firestrike, and consider reducing the recast time considerably.  Firestrike at 52 is the best ranger spell for mana/damage ratio.<P>The level 49 spell call of fire (quest not doable till 50 though) has an 18 second recast, please consider removing 1 second per level past 49.<P>I would really like to see dual wield and double attack skills increased to warrior like levels too.<P>Being a dual wielding class, we should be better at skills like parry and riposte over classes that are limited to one weapon.  Being limited to lighter chain classes of armor would make you believe we should be able to dodge better then someone in full plate.  Its pretty amazing if you look at it from that angle that ranger dodge/parry/riposte are lower then Paladin/SK's.  I understand everyone wants more defense, but if our dodge was in the neighborhood of Rogues (who also wear likewise armor) and parry/riposte were more like warriors (whose weapon skills we should be equal with) then I think we would be hit less often and not need a serious defensive upgrade.  although 210 or 220 defense would be nice.<P>I'm not sure about the endure/resist cold lines of spells. LOTS of other classes can cast these spells.  how about something a bit more useful, like regeneration at 39 or 49?<P>Trueshot was a great addition to raids and such, please consider upping its damage potential.<P>More HP would be very nice, but I'm not sure how many to suggest.  It would be very nice to have enough HP to survive long enough for a Warrior/Monk/Paladin/SK to taunt a mob off of me though.<P>I would love to see channeling go up, as well as all the different spell schools too.  Meditation would be really cool too. I find myself sitting on my butt way too much when I should be pulling.<P><BR>Please do not consider moving SOW to 30 or lower will help balance Rangers, it will not.  <P>Also please do not consider that personal ports/gates or bind will balance Rangers, it will not.<P>We really just need to be able to survive encounters well enough so that groups will consider rangers worthwile additions.<P>Thanks for listening<P>Droth Callandar<BR>53 Human Ranger<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some really great posts been made already, I'll just briefly state which I completely agree with.<P>Defense: 230 cap makes sense. *something* needs to be done.<P>Hitpoints: Our survivability is the absolute core of our issues. HPs figure into this as much as defense.<P>Jolt: Unresistable and level 51 at the latest. We're damage dealers (in your Vision) with a poor hate-reducing mechanism that needs work.<P>Offense: New Test caps will help actually make us deal damage (as apparently intended) but please do not forget dual wield and double attack. We sacrifice so much for these in your Vision.<P>Archery: Major issues discussed previously. Trueshot is still abysmal (even with maxed skill which takes a LOT of work). At the very least please make TS disc have improved accuracy, we still have to contend with LoS problems.<P>Velious: Please take a look at availability of ranger armor. As a follower of Karana, there are NO reasonable high level quests available. No dropped ranger armor either.<P>Could post more but won't, just voicing support for certain issues.<P>Tynan Kestrellia<BR>Outrider of Karana (57th)<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well I have read through most of the posts above and while I agree with most everything there are a few things I do not agree with. <P>For the most part, since the latest changes have gone live I believe that Ranger class is very nearly balanced. I am happy with the class as is with some minor tweaking.<P>-Give Rangers More HP: We are the only melee class that does not recieve significant HP boosts post 50. Pre Kunark we were right on par with the other Hybrids HP wise given same level and Stamina. This should continue post 50 as well. The reason is that HP is the most important thing in combat at these levels. It all comes down to how long you can stay alive. Currently should we get into trouble and find ourselves tanking we have too little HP for clerics to get off their Complete Heals and sometimes even Superior heals. This is what fosters the Mana Drain image. Give us the same HP base as the other hybrids. Regardless of skill caps the HP should be a level playing field among Hybrids. HP is also a major factor in the Hate list. MOBS like to hit things that go crunch and crumple the fastest. More HP's means we are less squishy and less of an appealing target to mobs.<P>-Defense: I for one do not want to see a defense increase. We don't need it. Quite simply our job is not to tank. We don't need defense if we are not getting hit. I would also like to remind people of the spells we get and the spells that we would be getting if the test changes go live. the Thorncoat series will be improved and existing spells lowered. This means LOTS more AC. Getting Skin Like Nature gives more AC and more Importantly HP regen. Add in Call of Earth and the end result is more AC from spells than the 15 points of defense we asked for when Kunark went live. At lv 53 I have 894 AC self buffed in pretty average equipment. I only have Tolan's Guants and TV Arms and Legs. The rest is stuff that any average Ranger would have at my level. I will strongly argue against Defense increases because we don't need it, and I feel that this would only take away from the areas where we really do need help.<P>-Move Jolt to lv 49 or 51 and change the resist rate to equal that of the Lifetap series of spells. I.e. nearly unresistable. The reasons are that lv 51 to 54 are accepted as being the hardest time in a ranger's life. This is mostly due to the places we have to fight in. Everything we will fight is either High blue, even, yellow, or red. There are no low blue mobs that we can really fight. This makes mobs hard to hit, hard to dodge/parry/riposte, makes us get hit harder and more often than opposed to a fight with a low blue. Giving Jolt at the start of these levels will considerably ease the uphill battle we face until MOBS beomce low blues instead of High Blues. <P>-Stacking Issues with Call of Earth and Str of Nature. As it stands now there are several lines of spells that these do not stack with that don't make that much sense given the effects of the spells. These two spells make our group desirability go up quite a bit. Not being able to use them due to stacking issues can hurt us a lot. Call of Earth is a 5pt dmg shield and a 25 AC boost that can be cast on anyone. Very nice spell. But wont stack with the augment line of spells including Speed of the Shissar. If a melee class has to choose one or the other of these spells they will choose the Haste every single time. Str of Nature does not stack with Divine Strength. Little need for our Spell when you get the pally spell. <P>As an addendum to this I would like to propose that both spells be changed to be "pack" type spells. I.e. one casting will buff the whole group. The reason is that both these spells cost quite a bit of mana. When I am in a group I generally choose to cast this on myself and maybe 1 other tank in the group to avoid going totally OOM. Even with only buffing 2 people I will still go through half my mana bar. This hurts us because we rely on our spells a great deal in combat. I usually pull for my groups. Not only am I very good at it the ranger class has a lot of tools especially for pulling. As such I am casting a lot (DD's, snares, Roots, dmg shields, etc.) and have VERY little time to med. Also I have a much smaller mana pool than a pure caster. I can't wear a lot of wisdom gear so my Wisdon never even comes close to the 200 cap that every single caster makes sure they get to. Even with Clarity 2 on me these 2 buffs will drain my mana very fast and impair my ability significantly. There are 2 ways to fix this problem. 1. Lower the mana cost of each spell by at least half. 2. Make both spells Pack spells so that with one cast of each we can buff the whole group. Also increase the mana cost of each spell to compensate for the pack effect. I prefer the latter method of fixing this.<P>-Tracking Changes: When these were promised to go live every single ranger in the game wept tears of joy. This alone will go a long way to balancing the class and making things more fun. We are trusting you to follow through with these changes and will keep the faith and hold confidence that you will indeed get these on the live servers. This is just a reminder really that we have not forgotten about them and are eagerly looking forward to them.<P>-Epic Battles: Not sure if this falls under the category of Balance but I guess it never hurts to ask. Concerning the Epic Quest. There are 2 Bottle necks in the quest. The 1st is Venril Sathir. The second is innoruuk. Both drop a gem that we need to complete our swords. The problem is that currently with each being a once a week spawn only some people ever get the *chance* to fight and kill these guys. I would suggest making these battles triggered Spawns. I am using the Cleric Epic as an example because I feel that the methods used were perfect. The fights in their quest are HARD. But as long as you put for the effort, time, and show enough skill to complete the quest steps everyone has the opportunity to fight the big fights in those quests. Whether or not they win is another matter. But everyone gets the chance privided the have completed all the steps leading up to each battle. Basically what I am saying is that every single Ranger who has completed his Runecrested Bowl and recieved Part of the Nature's Balance gem has every bit as much right to fight a big battle for the second part of the gem as Joe Blow from Uberguild_001 does. Right now though only Joe Blow has the opportunity to even try the fight because his guild camps the respawn to the second on his server not allowing anyone else the chance. You can even change the MOBS in question. <P>For instance, here are a few ideas:<P>-VS stone: Have a conatiner placed in a room deep in Karnor similar to a Forge in a town but with only 1 slot. This being an alter to the God of Hate or some sort of Conduit in which VS has been using to taint the Wildlife and the land as Telin first explains in the very beginning of the quest.  Place your half of the Gem in the container and hit combine and the 4 Drolvarg Bodyguards and a single named lv 56 Drolvarg slawn. By putting his gem inside bascially uses the power of Natures Balance to disrupt the flow of power from this conduit. The drolvargs of course spawn to stop you from doing this. Though would be an all or nothing fight in that you have to kill the named Drolvarg to get your "completed Natures Balance" back again to continue the quest. If you lose you lose your items and have to start over again. Much like the Coldain Signet ring quest (which is very good BTW). Now the Ranger/Druid has disrupted Inny's plans on Norrath. Next is to destroy the source of this power so that it cannot be made again. This leads us to Hate and Innoruuk himself.<P>-Inny Stone: Make another container like item in Hate back in some room maybe near Inny's room. Possibly inside Inny's room even. Make it so that you have to once again place an item inside the Alter and hit combine which spawns another guardian. Say maybe another Dracolich or possibly a Huge Golem. Say lv 60 or so with appropriate abilities etc etc. Upon killing the guardian a Unicorn spawns in it's place and in a similar fashion to the Ice Forged Shackle quest after you converse with the unicorn to find out that she was kidnapped by Inny and had her powers stolen to power the corruption of nature on Norrath. Say a key word and meet certain faction requirements (will have to add faction adjustments to the quest to make sure the ranger has appropriate faction by the end) and she will give over to you the item by which she was being drained of her power. The Shattered Gem of Corruption and the quest will end as usual.<P>These are just a few ideas to give you a picture of what I am talking about. You can make the triggered fights as hard as you like. Dificulty is not the concern. I am of the beleif that these fights should be very dificult. But at the same time I feel that more than just an elite few should have the opportunity to try to do the tough battles. <P>Anywho, that is my list. As I said there is not much left to do as far as balancing the class in my opinion. It is very close. Just give me these few tweaks and I will be very happy.<P>Vanidar Moonwhisper<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Shall we talk of balance?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lets see where to begin.  <P>My first issue is lack of plane drops in POG.  This applies to Paladins and Druids as well.  My other thread got little attention on this.  Fact is being "Forced" to quest for armor when all other classes get drops isnt appropriate.  Not to mention that the quest armor AC/Stats isnt very good. No reasonable explantion for this.  <P>Lack of Quest helm for Karana rangers (im a tunare ranger myself).  Again unbalanced.<P>Defense.  Lack of it has been pointed out rather well by others. So i choose not to get into that as much.  Up to between 215-220 (allowing for our dual wield as the modifier for less than 230 like SK's Palis Offense.<P>Do NOT up offense to 252.  I really dont need it and dont appreciate being able to outtaunt warriors as it is.<P>I had an idea for self only gates.  One to LFay, One to Ewastes, One to Kithicor, One to Frontier Moutains and one to Toxxulia.  (each of the continents) Why is this appropriate?  We are part druid.  Gained at 30-55 one every 5 levels. Placed in areas that arent exactly "Safe".  (See Kithicor, placed at ranger guild could be interesting if you land there at night). Casting time of 45 seconds.  Recast time of one hour.  This would alleviate rangers having to constantly shout for groups in the same place and have a viable option to check in other places for a group.  Yes its balanced.  We are after all part druid.  (does anyone else not see the logic in this?)  On the other hand we are also part warrior and its understood that any warrior/melee can buy potions of gate.  Perhaps a reagent of significant cost (say 100p to dufrenite at 200p)<P>Perhaps being able to self gate as a melee would be relatively balanced against LoH and HT.  Perhaps make it so its on a timer similar to LoH and HT.<P>Thats all for now really.<P>Walksinshadow<BR>Warder of Rallos Zek <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Vanidar_Monnwhisper, so you, for one, are completely happy that Rangers were the sole class singled out to receive no extra defense in Kunark?  It does not bother you that we have the same defense as many caster classes, in spite of the abuse we take on a regular basis?<P>I'm sorry but I cannot support that.  There is a numbers deficit, a triple defensive penalty, and a need because of increased agro, extra mob ripostes from fast weapons, and spell taunt.  The case for restoring a balanced bump in Ranger defense is pretty clear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't know that we need higher HP. If we had an additional low level agro management technique OR higher defensive skills OR archery were effective then we would be fine without higher HP (or higher AC).<P>The problem comes that we don't have ANY of these. We have low HP, low AC, lower defensive skill caps, no agro management until 55, and archery is a waste of time. <P>I am actually against us having higher HP and AC. That makes us to much like warriors and knights, leaving us with the same tactical choices. I want them to diversify the game by giving us equally effective, but different tactical choices.<P>Sadly enough I think one way or another fixing Rangers will require us to become more like one class or another. If they don't make us more like warriors then they are going to have to make us more like Rouges. Too bad they won't make archery a practical combat skill. Adding a second source of distance damage to the game could give Rangers a reason to exist without making us some kind of knock-off of another class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Balance this class:<P>1)The pro offence changes on test are a good   start.<P>2) Serious consideration has to be given to increasing the defence and defence related skill caps. <P>I will not repeat all the justifications set out in the first thread - but it needs to be done to balance this class.<P>Def prob should cap at 220-30 to create a balance within the class and a balance between the classes.<P>Slight increase in riposte as well.<P>3) Post 50 - HP increase.  Reason: Survivability.<P>4) Add a questable cold based DD at 49 - same general spell stats as CoF. Reason: Adds diversity to spell line up/ fulfills vision of damage dealing class by blade and spell - even againt high fire resist mobs.<P>5) Change Archery Damage - If you decide its not appropriate to increase def and def related skill caps, archery should be altered to do a lot more damage post 40.  <BR>  <BR>   There should be:<P>     a) damage bonus post 40<P>     b) double attack with bow at 45<P>     c) triple attack with bow at 60<P>Reason: Without changes to def and/or jolt (less resist shorter cast) this class is required (and in fact previoulsy encouraged by Abashi) to "back out of melee" to control the hate list.  If the vision of the class dictates they are pro offence - they must be allowed to continue to inflict damage even if they have to back out of melee range, which requires better archery. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually Howwl yes that is exactly what I am saying exceot for one change. <P>We are NOT suppose to get hit. We don't tank. I think the Ranger community has become obsessed with the defense issue. I pointed out already that through spells we have already gotten much more AC than the Defense points we were originally asking for anyway. <P>The key here is NOT getting hit. What we need are tools to insure that we get hit as little as possible. Defense is not the answer. Defense has nothing to do with how much you get hit for at the higher levels. I can change my AC by 100 points and still get hit for the same amount from the same mob. It all comes down to HP. Period. Which is why I said more HP. More HP means less taunt, and more time for a cleric to heal us.<P>I really think that everyone has gotten so fixated on the defense issue that even after it has become a moot point people are still crying bloody murder about it. <P>You guys need to rethink how you see your ranger. The truth is that if you see yourself as someone who will be tanking and taking hits on a regular basis then you will disapointed with the Ranger class. I repeat, we are not meant to get hit at all. Sure we might get hit with transitory damage by riposts and get hit by an add until it can be root parked or messed or whatever. But you should not be taking much damage at all. And in those instances when you do have to tank the only thing that really matter at that point is HP. <P>This is why we need Jolt Lowered in level and made less resistable. This is why we need an HP boost on parr with all Hybrids. Do these things and you WONT get hit. I am smack in the middle of what everyone says is the worst levels in a Ranger's career. And you know what? I am not having much problem with aggro at all. Sure there are some situations where I get into trouble but it is not often. <P>This where Jolt would pick up the slack. Generally I have very little problem shedding my aggro and keeping the mob on the main tank. I am more than happy to let the Pally or the Warrior Tank his heart out while I hapily carve up a MOBS backside. That is what I do best.<P>And please don't try to tell me that I don't know what I am talking about. I prove exactly what I said every single day I play my Ranger. <P>Please open your mind up and really think about this defense issue. are 15 points really going to make a difference? I think not. 300 to 600 HP will though. And it will make all the difference in the world. We are NOT tanks. We are damage dealing melee classes. We are NOT meant to take damage. You do NOT need defense when you are NOT getting hit. <P>Vanidar Moonwhisper<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We're still the class 5x handicapped.<P>-the 5 terminal handicaps-<BR>1. Chain based AC = no access to high AC items, and Casters with equivilant AC in the 55+ game.<P>2. No HP bumps 50+ every other melee/hybrid class recieves HP bumps 50+ leading to a 300-500hp deficit with other hybrids at 55+ (more than 1k behind warriors at 60 [but warriors are SUPPOSED to have boucoup hp, in fact I think they need a boost] we'd just like HP similar to other hybrids)<P>3. Defensive skills capped at 200 (except dodge/parry). Other hybrids that are "defensive" have the same defensive cap as warroirs, but their offense is capped at 230 - Rangers recieve no reverse parity.<P>4. Smallest mana pool of any hybrid. All other hybrids recieve significant stat modifiers to their mana attributes on their armors, it's not uncommon for sk's/pali's to have 30-50 points more wis/int in their "max AC configs" than rangers. It's almost ludicrous that a 55 Paladin can switch to "cleric mode" sacrifice 100 AC, have a 200+ wisdom and STILL have more AC than me.<P>5. Add to this that Jolt is completely useless in velious, and on many high level Kunark mobs. This either needs to be changed to a skill, or the resist rate/casting time reduced. Also should be moved to 49-51 range no matter how implemented.<P>Add these up and you'll find...<P>Ranger's are still the "squishy dolls" of norath.<P>-Terminal Overbuffs-<BR>I Like the new spells, the only problem is that as a class we have TOO many self buffs, and group buffs, that aren't replaced by other classes buffs. This leads to a problem where we can get to 15 buffs before we have the chance to tell the other buff classes "STOP!". Strength of Nature and Call of Earth are great spells. Can we get those 2 spells consolidated into 1 spell with an equivelant mana cost? this in and off itself would easy the situation tremendously.<P>-What I'd like to see done-<BR>1. defensive skills moved into parity with sk/pali's ranger=230 defense/250 offense pali/sk = 250 defense/230 offense. OMG? you expect me to do damage AND live with both the AC and defensive skills of a pure caster? I was embarased that a Shaman had better AC than me in a recent group. That just doesn't make sense.<P>2. HP boost in line with other Hybrids. It only makes sense, and it's equitable.<P>3. Jolt either fixed/dropped to 49-51, or replaced with the Evade skill. We're light, agile, and dextrous. As a competitive International fencer, and Renaisance player I can tell you from experince that agility,dexterity, and 2 blades = you don't get hit. Plate armor, stamina, str = you get hit, but it doesn't do much (usually hehe).<P>4. Disarm. who's joke was this? get rid of it...<P>5. Class/hybrid defining spells/skill. pali = revive/XP res. SK = corpse summon. Ideally, I'd like to rangers (50ish?) get self gates to imited destinations (1 per continent?) and at the same level pali's get XP resurections a group gate (1 per continent) The ability to group gate could be limited to once per EQ day much like Harmtouch, or Lay hands currently is. That would make it Class defining, yet not a threat to druids/wizards.<P>6. More wisdom/mana added to our gear, again, parity with our other Hybrid cousins.<P>7. Recognition that a good portion of your Ranger community doesn't worship Tunare. The best Helm in the game is Tunare only - with no equivelant available to their Karana cousins. Give us an equivelant quest, or please change it so that the helm (Helm of the Tracker - Plane of Growth Quest) can be worn by Karana worshipers.<P>7. Tolon's Boot drops. OMG... who's idea was it to put this drop in a place with such BAD pathing that you get 8-20 (not kidding) mobs on every pull. (or just by walking through the area)<P>Shugamayatu Mistreaver<BR>56 Outrider of Karana, Innoruuk server.<P>Sildawenu Lifespinner<BR>37 Cleric of Tunare, Innoruuk server.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Playing a Ranger was so frustrating for me at lower levels that I eventually switched to become a bard. I don't know what playing a Ranger is like past-50 but most of the people I know who have tried playing Rangers never made it to level 50 because they were so frustrating to play to begin with.<BR>I honestly believe that Rangers don't just need new stuff above 50, but they need to be revamped from the first level at which they get spells. You could make their level 50+ spells and disciplines alluring, but what good would that be if people quit playing before they make it that far?<BR>Problem 1: Rangers' lower level spells are nearly useless. Their first set of spells includes Skin Like Wood and Minor Healing. By the time a Ranger reaches level 9, these spells are nearly useless. At level 9, the spell fizzles like mad, and past that you can heal almost as quickly by sitting and resting as you can by standing and casting Minor Healing repeatedly for 10hp per cast. Flame Lick doesn't do enough damage to be worth the time taken to memorize it.<BR>The situation doesn't get much better at level 15. Sure, that's when we get Cure Poison, but who's off killing spiders at level 15?<BR>By the time we get any sort of offensive spell or lull spell, the mobs we're fighting resist these spells easily, or they only work on mobs that con green to us. We get Calm Animal at... 39. By that time almost all animals con green to us.<BR>Even worse is that we can't do anything a Druid can't do until... what? Level 49 with Call of Fire?<P>The solution? Give Rangers some more interesting spells at lower levels. Befriend Animal at level 19. SoW at 22 and Calm Animal at 24.<BR>In addition, the 7-9 levels between spell levels are very, very boring, and by the time we're reaching a spell level like 15 or 22, our spells have gone from useless to embarrasing. Give us a handful of spells to keep the game interesting midway between our 'main' spell levels - say, a couple spells at 19, two or three spells at 24, etc.<BR> Also, give us a few lower-level spells that Druids can't do. Wouldn't True North be a great addition to the repertoire of the level 9 Ranger, a class devoted to tracking and exploring the outdoors? How about some less mana-efficient but still effective healing spells? (Instead of Minor Healing at 9, how about a version of Light Healing that costs 2X mana? Give it a more rangery name, like 'Healing Balm.') We won't supplant the role of Druids in a party, but we can assist them in a pinch.<P>Problem 2: Tracking is, frankly, broken. Tracking starts to become ineffective before we even reach level 10. We can track a stationary merchant across the zone, but somehow our tracking doesn't detect the Hill Giant about to step on our toes.<BR> <BR>Solution: Just add a scrollbar to the tracking list so as our range increases, we can actually track all of the mobs in range. In addition, list the mobs in order of distance, not popping order, so closer mobs are first on the list and more distant mobs are farther away. Right now, older pops (like merchants) crowd out younger pops (things we might actually be hunting or trying to avoid) in our measly short tracking window.<P>Problem 3: Rangers just... can't really do anything interesting at lower levels. We really need some more unique skills or at least heightened abilities. If all Rangers started with at least a 20 or so in Forage, that would help, and fit with the theme. Better archery starting around level 11 or 15 would help a great deal, too, to make us more unique and compelling.<P>Right now, all Rangers are are warriors with a handful of pointless cantrips.<P> -- Morgan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't believe we are not supposed to get hit.  We are a light tank.  We are not supposed to get A LOT, but we are supposed to take hits.<P>In other words, if there is a Rogue and there are casters in your group, as well as a main tank, they should prefer YOU getting hit over the Rogue or casters getting hit.  Of course you want the Warrior hit the most, but nobody can turn that mob around faster than a Ranger.  You should be able to hold that mob on you until Jolt works or the Warrior/Knight can taunt it off you.<P>What you are proposing is that we shouldn't get hit at all.  Why do we have a taunt button?  Should we not cast spells?  Should we just not get our Epic weapons (because that slow spell is a BIG taunt)?  We DON'T belong in the same category of fragility as the casters, and in fact should be able to take a hit better than a Rogue.<P>I have to respectfully disagree with your point of view.<P>It is OK to ask for defense AND offense.  Offense of course only if the Knight Defense gets upped as well, like on test.  But we also need Defense for all the reasons outlined above (and see my original post on the first page of the original thread).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Summary(With test changes considered):<P>Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Paladin, Shadow Knight = 252 defense. Ranger, Druid, Shaman = 200 defense. Rangers will be the only fighters with a wis caster defense. Rangers also have the lowest fighter AC armor and lowest fighter HP. They also have low dodge, parry, reposte. Rangers are the highest natural taunt fighter. Jolt is too late, fails too often, costs too much mana(Half Elf Rangers start with 65 wis), costs damage output to cast, and ADDS aggro on failure.<P>Move Jolt to the 49 spell set, decrease Jolt's mana cost, provide a minor HP increase before 60, and up the Ranger defense to 220 or 230 by level 60. <P>Jolt will still be resisted(and add aggro), Jolt will still lower damage output to cast, Rangers will still have the lowest defense, AC, HP but the gap won't be so huge to the other fighters. If a Ranger is too restricted from dealing damage because of agro, then they can not be very good to a group as a damage dealing class.<P>P.S. I'll say it one last time. I personaly, my opinion alone, don't think that Panic Animal should go live for Rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, Absor,<P>Mild Disclaimer:  I am speaking as an under-50 ranger, and a causual player.  I am hoping that this discussion will not be focused on only the higher level player and their concerns.  /mild disclaimer off<P>The changes to tracking and exp penalties went a long way towards balancing this class.  Bravo!<P>I do not need, or want, more spells as a ranger, or even more great big items.  <P>My only area of concern for my class lies in archery/fletching.<P>Archery is the class defining skill for rangers.  That is why our symbol is the bow and arrow, not tracks, or another weapon of some sort.<P>Archery is not very useful in a group situation.  yes, I can pull with it, but that is the limit of my ability.  <P>My suggestions for archery:<P>1)increase critical hits, and damage done with crit hits.  Tie this in to skill level... a master (over 100) archer should be able to crit hit more than 1 out of 30 times.<P>2)bow double attack.  will cost two arrows per pull, but do twice the damage.  the cost of quality arrows will keep this from becoming unbalancing.<P>3)I should be able to shoot down or up hills, at a reasonable angle-- say, not more than 45 degrees.<P>4)a damage bonus for stationary archers, as opposed to shooting on the run.  This would not kick in for bow kiting, but would be in effect in a group, encouraging rangers entry into groups.<BR>  <P>fletching:<P>as archery's flip side, fletching is another essential ingredient for a ranger.  <P>My suggestions for fletching:<P>1)foraging basic arrow components.  for example, a ranger could forage a bundle of wooden sticks, and use them for arrow shafts.  <P>2)possible enchanted arrows?  could even use existing enchanted silver, etc, and when added in different combinations could add things such as stun, snare, fear to arrows.<P><BR>Thanks for your time.  As a RL archer, it would mean a lot to me if changes like these could go into effect.  I would be very happy if rangers could be seens as archers, trackers, and woodswise, instead of being seen as an inferior tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a 51 ranger but only infreqently since the release of Kunark.  It was my main character till then.  The major problem I had post Kunark is the one most every ranger has mentioned before and that is our defensive capability to survive our massive offensive taunt.  I'd like to see a modest increase in our defensive level above our parent casting class level (Druid=200) and/or some higher AC armor.  We are the only mele to have a defensive level equal to our caster parent and with our lower armor and HP we dont survive much longer than some of the casters.  <P>The other change has also been mentioned in the threads and that is to fix archery to give us a really unique skill.  This means new bows with the ability to shoot magic arrows and in combat situations to hit the target if other mele fighters are in our line of site.  As long as we can see some part of the target, we should have a chance to hit the target.  Also would like to see the elevation (up or down) limit increased slightly for rangers to make us more useful in pulling for groups where other archers can hit the target.<P>Lastly, I would like to see the tracking changes that were promised several months ago actually go live.  <P>Otherwise I think lots of the ideas in the prior posts have a great deal of merit and should be considered in the balancing the classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok i never posted here and i dont know why my handle is set to my warrior, but i hope this gets thru.<P>When you say balance i assume you mean "what will make a ranger just as desirable in a group as any other meele class", since thats what i consider a ranger. <P>I definately like the changes on test, we need more innate offence as i always end up running out of mana in a long fight so i hope you keep it that way. <P>SPELLS<P>the spell changes are good too. I have no beef with our current line up except for a few things:<P>1) Greater healing should be taken down to lvl 52 or 53, as our last one was at 39 and is not very good starting at around 50.  this little enhancement would allow for us to heal more effectivly in emergancies, and help with down time, which could make a group want us.<P>2) this is a long shot, but i think that since its so hard for a ranger to find a group in any specific zone, that it should be easier for us to travel to another spot to look for groups,  self ports?  <P>3) Ok another longshot, evac.  this would DEFINATLY help us get groups, and i dont think it would take away from druids since a ranger would NOT be able to port the group back to DL from EJ(which actually might even get the group pissed at us heh).<P>Call of sky is anoyingly short, making it nessassary to keep it as a permanent spell gem. can we have 45 mins at least? str of nature too plz.<P>BUG: sometimes wen i cast call of flames the gem will refresh before it should, and i end up trying to cast it to no effect, ie. anoying<P>MEELE<P>Ok, beeing the offencive hybrid i doubt yer gunna raise deffence and HPs.  BUT we need HELP in this area.  seeing as how we are the quik, nimble sort with less weighty armor and such, i think that maxing out dodge, parry, and riposte to that of warriors, or even beyond, will keep the ranger within your "vision" of our class, AND help us live longer, thereby helping us get groups more.  maxed out riposte will also make us more offencive, which will help us be more effective wen we run out of mana.<P>Fizzles, GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.  We dont have enough mana to afford 5 fizzles in a row (happens to me ALL the time), making us run out of mana thereby making us resort to pure meele.<P>a minor self dex buff?  we rely on procs alot and since you've given me an AC complex, i shun dex gear in favor of AC.  This would give us more offence do to proccing, thereby helping us get a group more.<P>Theres more but i forget what it is(.

</FONT><HR>The Howwl we will just have to respectfully disagree because I am going to stick by my reasons. <P>In the end game AC means almost nothing anymore really. The mobs in Velious and Kunark hit so hard anyway that ac does not matter. Take Jello's in Icewell Keep for example. They are ~lv 55. I have gone down there with groups including warriors and paladins. Sometimes not both at the same time but one or the other. In each case yes I did take some hits. So did they. I lived so did they. In each case MY ac was at least 200 AC less than theirs. In each case we both got hit for the same amount of damage per hit and pretty much the same frequency. They didn't hit me more often then the Pally or the warrior. Think about this for a moment. The MOBS offense is so high that no matter what your AC is you are getting hit for Full damage. BTW, these Pally's and warriors were sometimes 3 or 4 levels higher than me and still got hit for the same amount and the same frequency as I was. The difference between us was all HP. I fell behind in HP by at least 1 K if not more.  This made the difference between the healer being able to CH me vs the other tanks. <P>HP is really the key folks. Everyone here seems to think that more AC more Defense will make a drastic change. Unfortunately it wont have much of a change at all and it will surprise a whole lot of people. <P>I'll say it again. The single determining factor in combat is HP. Everything else is just fluff. More AC means more survivability and more time for the healer to heal you. <P>And I did not say that we would not get hit at all. In a real situation that will never happen. In an ideal situation we would not get hit no, but the ideal rarely ever happens. Again AC and defense wont play much of a role in this. HP will. As far as a light tank? Sorry but that is not what the ranger has become. That is what we were pre 50. Post 50 it just isn't happening because of the strength of mobs vs the player. As I said if this is the way you see yourself then you will be disapointed. Might be hard to swallow but it is the truth and it is one that I see confirmed every single day. <P>Our job is not to tank. Sure we can pull a mob off a caster and we can already survive long enough to push the aggro onto the real tank. Giving us more HP will make this even easier. Giving us more Defense wont because we will stil be getting hit just as often for just as much damage as before with the saem amount of HP as now. <P>I will respect your opinion Howwl, but I also will maintain my reasons for my opinion. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the biggest things I would like to see done is have stats like AGI actually matter. I've sacrificed AC and put on a lot of AGI gear, got the shaman buffs to get above 180 on AGI and have seen no noticable difference in the amount of dodge or parry that I did. Many of us come from a stat based background in regards to games and I quiet frankly miss it. Melee Stats have negligable effects after around 100. Light, agile tanks is erroneous description for this class. Easy to hit and quick to kill is more appropriate. <BR>I won't suggest what changes to make, I am not familiar with the inner mechanics of the game. I just want to point out that Verant needs to rethink their concepts of all the classes, describe each ability and role of those classes and try to figure out how to make that happen. Right now we are seeing a blend of abilities and a blurring of the uniqueness that 14 different classes were to offer. We do not want to be generic, or simply warriors in green armour. We would like to offer something to the group that no other class can. We are not asking for or wanting to be the most damaging, or the most able to withstand the poundings, simply something that groups would find desirable enough to decide to have us with them. So far I've seen suggestions that, though nice, are only tossing a bone to this abused class. Players are complaining. We are being given something that is similiar to treating the symptoms, not looking for the cure. All these class talks might have been better starting with "What is my role" or "What *is* a Ranger". Start with the concept and work from there. We suffer low AC, low HP, low offense/defense caps. Is this justified by our spells that we get? If so, I truely think someone needs to re-evaluate the usefulness of these spells, and do it against a group situation. Will Skin like Diamond be cast in a group with a cleric, or a druid? Will we be buffing the low 50 group with Endure Cold? <BR>The concept of the class needs to be defined and then measure what we have now against that. Take into consideration the problems and complaints present now and come up with acceptable solutions for both the player base and the designers. Take another look at how stats effect combat and see if they are truely working as intended. <BR>Thank you, Absor, for plowing through all the posts, the misspellings, the mistypes, flames, whines, complaints, and sorting through all of it to compile a list that we can comprehend and work with. Thank you for starting all these threads and listening to us, the players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a 59 ranger. Observing myself in groups, with c2, I use only 3 spells - snare, root, jolt. <P>When in a group I find myself oom all the time. All of my mana is expended in jolting MOBs off me. I find myself relying on my Tolan gauntlets to snare because I'm so pressed for mana. <P>The only time I get to cast offensive spells like calefaction or dmg shields are at the beginning of the night when I'm fm, but very soon my mana is depleted and can never catch up again. Fights with krup knights require around 4 jolts. That's 240 mana per fight, doing nothing more than saving the cleric mana. The mana is well spent, because the cleric would need to use 2-3 remedies without jolt per fight, each costing 175 mana. <P>I love jolt, but it's cost is simply too high - not only is it high enough that I cannot cast other offensive spells, it's so high that I often cannot cast jolt itslef when it's needed because I'm oom.<P>Please consider raising med caps of hybrids. We do not get to sit and med as much, and with lower med caps and the fact that we're standing and fighting all the time, we get a double penalty.<P>All the other hybrids get full utility of their mana pools. Paladins go oom stunning, SKs use their DOTs. Rangers use all their mana jolting. I think this spell should cost about half of what it does, about 30 mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Changing a few skill maxes here and there is nice and all.  I would rather you implented a skill or spell to make the rangers the best at pulling.  Then no one would complain that they tank as good as warriors etc, but they would have a use for the group and be fun at the same time.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright, first off, I'll just say a few things I think are needed that have already been said.  <P>1) More HP, rangers don't mind not being tanks, but we are a melee class, and the reason rangers don't have Paladin/SK level HP was because several months ago, before kunark, ranger and Paladin/SK HP and AC were very close.  And with no way other reasonable and fair way at hand, Verant increased the plate hybrid hit points.  I had no problem with this, but now with kunark/velious equipment out, there is an AC disparaity, a very large one in some cases, and I believe it is time to up the ranger HP, just for survivabality.<P>2) Defense, I understand we are the offensive hybrid, and Paladins/SK's the defensive, but, trying not to seem like class envy here, the plate guys got offensive increases, along with defensive ones, and rangers just got offensive.  Rangers should get about 20 defense points, and up the damage negation skill, parry/dodge/reposite.<P>3) Jolt, I'm currently 52, and haven't gotten a chance to use Jolt, but there have been many, many times when it would have been nice to have, please lower Jolt to about lvl 50.<P>Alright, spells.<BR>1) I believe all the hybrids should get more spells.  Paladins and SK's give up offense, and rangers give up a lot of defense for them, so please give all hybrids more.  You have this done on test, but I believe more need to be added.<P>2) Please do something about the fizzle rates on all hybrid spells, espically on the 50+ ones.  It is no unusual for me to fizzle 2 to 4 times while trying to cast firestrike, that's any where from half to a full bubble of wasted mana.<P>3) Paladins get Heals and nice buffs, SK's get life taps, feign death, and pets.  Rangers don't get any spell that their parent casting class is really known for.  I DO NOT believe rangers should recieve group ports of any sort, but that personal ports to the current druid rings, or just to the 4 ranger guilds, ie surefall, kithicor, greater fay, and FV, are not out of the question.  A level 50 ranger should be able to cast these spells, you would think in 40 levels of casting, and 50 levels of adventuring, that we would be able to learn something a druid learns after 19 levels.<P>4) There are other spell changes I think should be made.<P>  1) endure/resist cold (already done on test)<BR>  2) pre-50 regen, some where in the 45 to 50 range.  We get chloro at 55, wouldn't we learn the lower spell in the series first?<BR>  3) move greater heal down a few levels, to at least 55, if not lower, we are never going to be combat healers, but it would be nice to spend less time chain casting 90 point healing spells, than medding to recover the mana from them.<BR>  4) Some have said move SoW down to level 22, or 30, I have to disagree, the lowest SoW should be moved to is 35, if it is moved at all, any lower than that, and you significantly change the balance of nearly every mid level zone in the game.<BR>  5) Please replace our calm animal line, its highly resisted, and many don't even have it in their spell books.  Replace spells for lvl 9 are slim, but there is a vareity to replace lvl 39 one with.<BR>  6) Please move ward summoned down to lvl 15 from 22.  At 22 we also get ignite, which has the same mana cost, cast and recast time as ward summoned, and ignite does 4 less damage.  Also ignites targets are not nearly as limited.<BR>  7) We don't get an upgrade to stinging swarm until level 54, and then it jumps a spell in the series.  Please add in creeping crud at about level 45.<BR>  8) Enveloping roots at level 60.  Come on, a rangers reward for reaching level 60 is a lame root spell?  Please add in or replace the root spell with Starfire or drifting death.<BR>  9) You have done a nice job with the new ranger buff spells call of earth and strength of nature.  Please make these spells stack with everything.  I see no reason why call of earth, a damage sheild and AC buff, will not stack with the Augment series enchanters get.  I also see no reason why strength of nature, an attack and Hp buff, will not stack with Divine Strength, a paladin Hp buff.<BR>  10) Also, in the 50's, where those 15 buff slots get filled up real fast, and rangers generally have between 8 and 10 self buff spells that are typically kept up all the time.  Is there any way you could add a spell, that is a combo of strength of nature, and call of earth, a bit upgraded, around level 57 or 58?  It would cost about 300 mana, and give 100 hp, 30 ac, 40 atk, and a 5 point damage shield, and would not stack with call of earth and strength of nature.  To give us an extra buff spot.<BR>  11) please give rangers see invis.  Ranger are currently the only class that gets a general purpose invis spell, but doesn't get any sort of see invis.  The easiest way I see to do this is to add a see invis part to eyes of the cat, thus making it useful to all rangers, not just human rangers(I never bought this spell), and upgraded chill sight, to plain sight.<BR>  <BR>4) Please remove the disarm skill, it currently caps at 50 skill points, and if it ever works I would probably soil myself.  Take those 50 points and put them into other skill, ie defense.<P>5) Also, something should be done to make archery more powerful for lower level rangers, and rangers in general.  Maybe put in a minimum damage, put in the double damage bonus for level 20 to 50, and make it triple for 51+.  Make double attack work with archery, it would of course take 2 arrows for every double attack.  Maybe actually give rangers the summon arrow spell some time in their lives, but I personally don't like this idea.<P>6) Also, rangers are excelent pullers outdoors, maybe you could add in a spell to make rangers better at pulling indoors also.<P>Nalyn Evershot<BR>Pathfinder of the 52nd season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards, Rogues and Monks are supposed to tank less than us, that's why we have had a taunt button since before release. They have 252 defense either not so they can tank, but to lower the aggro that is inherent with doing lots of damage/buffing a whole group at once. High ac = less taunt.
