</FONT><HR>Mastis there are a few things you have failed to mention in your rebuff.<P>First of all, sebilite juggernauts(and any level 56+ warrior mobs) ENRAGE when they are at TEN PERCENT health.  They are usually fleeing at that point, or if not a wizard or two can simply nuke'em and they'd be dead.  The only exceptions to this rule is King Tormaxx of Velious, who enrages every few seconds, and that is why he has yet to be killed.<P>Second of all nobody wants to solo to level 60 in a game that Verant DESIGNED for groups.  If they had taken into account anything regarding soloing and catered somewhat to the soloing players(e.g. maybe put their class-only armor in soloable areas, have them raid planes that are soloable, etc.) then nobody would be complaining.  Verant cannot simply say they made a soloing class but does not support soloing and be done with it.  You do not make a soloing class and then tell them "The game of 50+ is based on grouping and raiding, not soloing".<P>Third of all I see alot of requests here that are quite unreasonable, but I can see that most necromancers are trying at least to be objective and intelligent in their posts.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to be more useable in raids. <P>That said, I think one of the biggest and nastiest hamperings of the necro and mage class from raid groups is the bad pathing in some of the dungeons.  Absor, if you are going to fix anything first, please fix this.  You said that necromancers are good throughout the raid except at the uber mob... I disagree.  When I can't even use a pet before he aggros half the zone down on me or seriously hamper the power of enchanters, that arguement is void.  Mob pathing in a variety of places HAVE to be fixed.  Sebilis, HS, Chardok are all problematic in this area where once you go deeper your pet has the tendency to fall off a ledge, go down a hole, aggro something it shouldn't have, or take ridiculous routes to find their enemy.  This is not so much a matter of the necro's skill as it is the pathing problems in the zones.  <P>This would even apply to the final raids.  If necros or mages can use their pets on Velketor or Yelinak or some other uber mob that doesn't die in 30 seconds, they would be greatly helpful.  However, when this is denied the pet caster because of bad pathing in Velketor's Labrynth(the pathing seems fine until you tell ur pet to guard me, then it seems to fall off every ledge there is) or Skyshrine, there is a problem.<P>I recognize that some monsters are simply the province of other classes.  E.g. VS and Trakanon are the province of warriors and wizards and clerics, almost without exceptions.  It's fine with me they resist Lifetaps 100% of the times, seeing how VS is a necro himself and Trak is an undead dragon.  However, why you make most uber mobs in Velious like this is beyond me.  Why not scatter the advantages a bit, so that more classes can be used in a raid?<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about, instead of making pets *immune* to fear spells (which, yeah, would be imbalancing) they simply change the way pets respond to it: they turn away and stop attacking, but they don't run.<P>The major issue with pets and fear seems to be pathing.  Rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater on this one, address the problem, which is the running and not the fear itself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A fantastic, yet balanced and raid-focused idea:<P>Necromancers could temporarily resurrect PCs in their group as TRULY undead minions... <P>The PC could be resurrected in the heat of battle with some sort of balanced melee power.  Whether the resurrected PCs were actually pets or controlled by their owner could be left to coding.  However, I'm believe the idea of a necromancer utilizing death and destruction in the heat of battle to temporarily augment the melee force in a raid is quite tempting and applicable. <P>-Natrulyan, 57 Gnome Necromancer of Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Masthis, you just don't get it. <P>It is not a question of play style, when a class is reduced to three spells, and 99.8% of the rest of what they can do becomes worthless, there is a problem. <P>See, if you were stuck to doing nothing more than pulling a mob, and then eating the DT, and ALL of your melee attacks are either a) not allowed or b) will not work, and you are not able to do what you do 90% of the time, it is a issue.<P>As for whining, an class envy, no, no one is asking for bigger DD spells, pets are strong as mages, better healing spells, or more buffs. You have a group of players that just want to be wanted, that is all. Yes, there are issues for rangers an mages, those can be addressed in their own threads, you did not see tons of necros all hopping into the shaman thread, and telling them to deal with it, since necros have issues.<P>Also, Masthis, you play a monk, why do you feel a need to open your yap and talk about a class you don't play? How do you have a clue about necro issues? Some how, I am willing to bet you are not all that high lvl. I doubt Pouty, Loatze, or even Lonefist would try telling another class how to deal with their issues.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Three more ideas... one a little less fantastic than the other:<P>1) The ability to summon the corpse of a player who is not in the zone.  You are able to ressurect someone who isn't in the zone.  If necromancers are the masters of undead, what stops them from sensing a particular corpse and bringing to their feet?  Off subject, but still a fun idea.<P>2) Unholy Retribution, requires essence emerald... 1200 mana, casts some sort of high damage lifetap that drains the life from the monster and heals the group.  Too expensive of a cast to use in group situations, but a one-time group heal that would aid in raids.<P>3) Some form (possibly group) of illusion: skeleton, adding some amount of disease, poison, and perhaps fire resistance (Necromancer specialties).  Give this type of spell short duration but high mana cost, so again--useful in raids but not common groups.  The illusion: skeleton would make identifying players harder and give it a drawback.<P>-Natrulyan, 57 Gnome Necromancer of Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>#1 - I know you have a 'firm no' here, but again, restoring lifetaps to their original unresistability is pretty much the optimal fix here.   It does not increase our power in general as resists are only an issue on ubermobs, I dont see how it upsets game balance due to their horrid Mana/Damage ratios, lure spells are considerably more efficient sources of damage.  In order to keep abuse low, only apply unresistability to the post 50 taps (Deflux, Vexing Mordania, TOuch of Night, and Trucidation) to make sure you wont see a return to lv12 groups taking down SGs.  <P>#2 - Post 50pets have increased very little in power, so why not have them increase in intelligence.   Allow a /pet tether # command, issuable only to pets summoned with a lv 50 or higher summons, that causes them to teleport back to their master if they leave a range of #.  This would not realy increase their power or the difficulty of proper control of the pet at all, just prevent instances of bad pathing causing problems that should'nt occur in the first place.<BR>Additionaly, allow Necro and Magician pets summoned with a 55+ lv spell to be given a /pet stand down command that would cause it to not attack anything unless told to (even if it or its caster is attacked).  This would have the duel purpose of making pets usible post 50 even in raid situations, and making pet classes feel like they have actualy been upgraded for earning their post 50 levels - the 55 upgrade to pet control would be a major incentive to using the 56 and 59 necro pets wich are VERY marginal upgrades to the 49 pet currently.<P>#3 - Let the night only spells be used 24hrs, these spells are not overpowered at all as is.  Skin of Shadow in particular pretty much is just a combination of Gather Shadows and Shadowsight wich are lv8 and lv24 spells.<P>#4 - Eliminate either the Essence Emerald cost or the extream Load/Reload time on Trucidation and Infusion.   Either cost balances the spells pretty well, both makes them useless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The main problem many of us outsiders have with this whole issue is the facet that you're trying to focus on one aspect of the class.<P>If I say, wanted to start a thread on, "Why Wizards should be given group-friendly spells because we're useless during the buffing stage of a raid," I'd be laughed at.  Or if I comment on the fact that when I group in a dungeon, due to the necessity of high levels of mobs in grouping-designed dungeons,  I loose the ability to multi-kite, I'm laughed at again, because I'm not looking at the "grand" scheme of things.<P>But in respect for the Necro community, which has summoned my corpse out of some of the strangest places on Norrath (BTW...don't go exploring if you don't have several necro friends), I'll keep my comments focused not on the versatility of Necro's pre uber-mob, but we'll keep this on that oh so epic encounter.<P><BR>Here goes.<P><BR>Ignite bones is a pain in my ass.  As a wizard, I'm -all- for this being changed.  The  illusion pisses me off as well, just not melee people, because suddenly I'm not sure if I'm nuking Trakanon, or if I"m nuking Jobaber.<P>Due to the fact that wizards contribute -nothing- to raids other then our damage output, I feel strongly that nobody else should be given any type of spell that affects the hitpoints of a mob directly other then a wizard.  This does -not- mean however, that I don't that some classes who's offensive capabilities are their primary weapon shouldn't be able to contribute to the damage game.<P>Now, against many Velious mobs, the insanely high hitpoints of some uber mobs make Necro's more desired then wizards.  Trust me on this.  The -reason- wizards -seem- to do more damage, is we've been trained by Kunark to bring 8 wizards along on every raid.  Hence, my solo 7-15k damage, is catapulted into the 50-100k damage range.<P>Were situations reversed, and suddenly people were bringing along 8 Necro's, against non-fearing mobs without sick AE's, the pet's will simply dominate.  Against a mob with 70k hp with sick regen and CH, my 13k damage down is pithy, but in the end, your pet has just sacked him for over 20.  By itself, it doesn't seem so uber compared to the 30+k the tanks are doing, but it beats the pants off of my damage.<P>However, -many- Kunark mobs have AE fear spells which make pets useless, add to it that many mobs come attached with AE nukes, and the low resistances on pets make them little more then an efficient way to increase the agro against you.  What then should be done?<P>I think a new spell is in order for Necro's.  Not one that necessarily does damage, as I've said, I'm not in any way for any caster class but wizards getting a spell that lands on uber-mobs like so.<P>What kind of spell though?  If not damage, what then?<P>What's one well known ability of Necro's?  One that was the envy of every class pre-50....Fear-kiting.  Now listen to me here.<P>Fear seemed to be one of the most useful tools of the Necro class.  Without Fear, the name they've earned themselves would be without substance.<P>Hence, what I propose, is a spell, castable by Necro's, that would prevent a mob from using AE fear.<P>What do you all think on the matter?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll just clarify another reason why I think lifetaps shouldn't be made unresistable, even the post-50 ones, on Uber-mobs.<P>8 Wizards are brought along on every uber-raid simply because we can do said amounts of damage.  If 2 Necros could suddenly replace 1 wizard...why bring wizards along at all?  Just bring 6 or 7 necro's.  Not only can they fill the role of 1/2 a wizard, but they can do a hellova lot of things on the pre-uber-mob raid.<P>Need I make mention, -once- again of the facet that on any raid, I spend most of the time AFK except for against that epic-mob?   That's my -sole- role on any raid...down that uber mob.  Other then that, I might as well get my warrior a few more levels so I can be useful on raids as it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm..  Well, given the restrictions, there really is not a ton of ideas available for the thinking.  No new spells, No new Enhancements....<P>OK, Pet Possesion is neat, but I don't want to play a tank, not even a surrogate tank.<P>My big question about Sacrifice:  Why am I sacrificing my friends, or at least usefull allies, when there are thousands of mobs around far more deserving of Death?----In fantasy Lituature, this would fall under the power at any price type of thing, which is fully in the Necromancers Vision.  But what Power.  I do not see any spell other than the Res being even remotely worth the cost.  <BR>__________<BR>IDEA<BR>__________<BR>Make the Emeralds be a Dropped Item as well as a createable one.  Would not Necro mobs be carrying these around for the use of there own Magic?  Of course, no one ever uses these spells, so maybe not even the mobs don't see the point, but still, it would soften the blow if there was another source of the emeralds.<P>Then, all we need is something to do that is worthwhile with the Emerald.  The mana transfer is a good Idea.  Making only the level 60 lifetap unresistable is an Excellent Idea.  Not all the lifetaps, but just the level 60 one.  No way to abuse that.  If just the level 60 lifetap is unresistable, then we would once again be "working as intended".  The VISION(tm) of Necromancers was slow, Inexorable, death.  Unresistable lifetaps were part of that vision.  We give up all pretense of decent DD till level 24 and Shock of Poison, because our spells are not resisted by anything in range.  Even on the outside of that range when the DoT's are acting like superballs and bouncing at every cast, we still have a fighting chance to land the drains, and hopefully nuke the SoB into the ground--with the help of our pet.  Not often mind you.  The spells do so little damage, and the pet does not taunt effectively enough, but there is the *fighting* chance.  That was the vision.  We are not Clerics, We are not Chanters or Bards.  We are not here to give life or mana to those in need.  We are Death walking.  So, at the pinnacle of our career, we come to spell so powerfull that they need to be fueled by freely given sacrifice.  That is the Power of Death.  The Spells we fuel with that power should be as final as death itself.  The Vision all but demands that our final lifetap be unresistable.  It is not a matter of 6 newbies taking down something beyond them, because at level 60, there should be NOTHING completly beyond the power of a Necromancer- nothing beyond the power of Death. We would still need the assistance of the other classes, and our wisest heads have alway recognized that the others are helpful, even essential, but nothing should be utterly immune to our ultimate class defining power.<P>just my 1 cp.

</FONT><HR>Firstly - thanks for starting this thread Absor. Secondly, here's my response  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  :<P>ABSOR - "Unresistable Lifetap: Probably never going to happen. I understand the whole concept of Lifetap to power mana transfer. I'm just telling you with a pretty firm tone, that it's really not likely to happen."<P>Whilst this was in the 'not for discussion bit' I feel I have a possible solution. The lvl 50+ lifetaps should change to lure-based resistances (deflux say fire-based lure and touch of night cold-based lure, you can do what you want with trucidation as I'm never going to cast it - see later note). This allows us to do direct damage to a mob with a horrible mana ratio but with the powerful side effect it allows us to lich/pact (i.e. allows us to WORK). The balance to this is it makes the spells LESS powerful in non-ubermob raids, currently lifetaps are unresistable within 6 levels, going from guaranteed full damage/hp gain to partial resistability is, I think, more than enough drawback to balance the gain vs ubermobs.<P>ABSOR - "Mana Transfer: The rate will probably not be improved. As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana. Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana. The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points. That's the right ratio, really. There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out."<P>If we are allowed to lifetap then mana convert is about OK as is, without lifetaps landing then mana dumping is broken. One suggestion I have is introduce high level necro items that have superior ratios (maybe even change the duck stick effect to a 1.25:1 convert) we are one of the few classes that have no use for their epic reward in epic encounters.<P>ABSOR - "Poofing: with the next patch, this should be pretty much fixed.."<P>Great news, I hope it not only works but you add a MOTD broadcasting it so we don't have to convince those who don't read these boards  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>ABSOR - "Ignite Bones: I'm willing to suggest some change to remove the skeleton. I think to do that we need to have something that does the same sort of thing, but I don't know what that is. This spell will probably never be changed into a standard direct damage spell. I like some of the ideas (like changing the tinting on the target), but unfortunately most of them don't seem possible technically. I'll keep thinking up ideas. Post any you have here."<P>This is a tough one, I'd like to see the illusion flat-out taken off. In it's current form it's simply bugged - turning anything into a human skeleton is not only totally unrealistic but it's also confusing and worst of all shrinks the bounding box (area around a mob you can hit it) - this is what breaks it on raids. My only suggestion would be add high-level particle effects to the spell (flames for ignite bones, frost column for chill bones) that covered a mob, this would still give the spell a huge visual effect (which you seem to like) but would allow those of us who turn off particle effects to be unaffected by it.<P>ABSOR - "Group Feign Death: I haven't mentioned this idea to the team yet. I suppose that there might be a lot of reasons not to implement this idea…"<P>I think my posts in the Group FD thread show why it would be balanced (even with similar cast/recast times to normal FD). If you want me to restate them in one post here let me know.<P>ABSOR - "Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines."<P>This is the biggest disappointment to me. It's not pets that are broken in this regard but ubermobs. With 100k+ HP ubermobs it should NOT be the norm for them to have devastating AE damage spells or AE fears (nor insane resistances). Do you not see? You've finally overcome the 32K HP limit that led to so many of these ubermob secondary attacks (which eventually were increased in power so much they are now considered the primary attacks) but you still tune the ubermobs as though they were 32k HP ones. Sure some mobs should keep their AE attacks but some should have them changed to things like AE stamina drain (I know a few do this already) and AE stat debuffers (e.g. taking strength down to 20-30 for a period of time - this would make pre-raid stat buffs more important but would also have negligible effect on pets). Until you guys realise you are tuning ubermobs incorrectly a lot of issues are going to remain - I guess I'll start a fresh 'ubermob tuning' thread...<P>"Possessing the pet: that's a cute as heck idea (maybe 'cute' is the wrong word…). Another one that I'll mention to the team. But keep in mind that I'm not really looking for totally new stuff. I'm not advocating that we start making up new spells and whole new concepts. It would be hard to justify spending a ton of time making new concepts at this point. But it's certainly interesting…"<P>Whilst I like the idea I think it's probably too powerful. Also I chose a necro to do damage in conjunction with my pet, not become a pet. Pet possesion could have many unintended non-uber raid side effects that would lead to it being nerfed into uselessness. I agree with you - concentrate on fixing existing stuff before adding completely new stuff.<P>ABSOR - "Essence Emerald: I'm kind of in favor of using this device as a way of changing things. It's a very expensive casting cost… For example I kind of liked the idea of allowing the mana transfer spell to be usable on others, considering the cost."<P>Sorry I completely disagree with you over essence emeralds (EE's). I personally like the sacrifice/ressurection ability (at the cost of an EE) it's well thought out and makes sense, it's also balanced due to the cost of the gem. But to use EE's for anything else but ressurection is plain wrong. The only way EE's are viable components for lifetaps and mana infusions are if you're in a guild that power levels chars just to sacrifice them. I've only ever owned one EE and I used that doing CR for a party in Velketor's (wipeout by kobolds). It was the perfect use for the EE (I obtained the EE by spending 30minutes  treking to permafrost and doing a corpse summon/res for a high level wiz - he gave me two sacrifices with a secondary char, one for an EE to res his wiz corpse, the other as my payment).<P>Trucidation - currently next to useless even if it had no component at all! 10 minute recast (which also means mem time) plain breaks a lifetap. Currently it is also resisted like all other lifetaps. Solution: increase drastically the mana used for the spell (maybe 1:1), reduce the recast time to 1 minute and change the component to something like a black pearl (non buyable but not ultra rare, although maybe something rarer than a black pearl - it should be hassle to acquire them).<P>Infusion: Again the EE cost is way too high for a self-only 1000 mana boost (not even half my mana!). But changing it to non-self-only would make it unbalancing in ubermob raids (for those guilds that have the resources to acquire dozens of EE's), I don't want to only be allowed/useful on uber raids if I have a stack of EE's ready to burn. Solution: Either change it to complete mana (i.e. mana equivalent of complete heal, but self-only) or (my preference) change the component. Create a new component and make it like a no-drop, lore, no rent mana rod but one which took 1000hp (and gave a 1000 mana or better). That way a necro could only usefully use them sparingly in ubermob raids and elsewhere. I would suggest a new spell costing around 1000 mana, using an emerald as a component (that is transformed into a Soul Emerald which is no drop, lore and no rent). This Soul Emerald would give us a one-shot huge mana boost (maybe complete mana is unrealistic) that can make a difference in many situations (not just ubermobs) which is surely the point of the Infusion spell as it stands - only the cost is currently way way too high for the reward. This wouldn't infringe on mage mod rods as the Soul Emerald would be no drop (and Infusion would remain self-only).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Ok, absolutely no detail here at all, a simple suggestion. Since uber mobs have the potential of being almost unlimited HP now, why not just put things back into the perspective of how they were before. All us Necros grew up being resisted at various times with all of our spells exept lifetap (out of level range being the exception of course) all you would really have to do to calm the necro comunity down is these simple things.<BR>1. Make Uber MoBs have High resistance to Lifetap line of spells, but not 100%.  That is simple enough.<P>2. Get rid of the skeleton illusion with the spells that concerns...I mean for gods sake how do we turn a dragon into a human skeleton anyway?<P>3. fix the pet pathing issues and give us some way to use our pets (which up to this point have been our bread and butter)in these types of encounters<P> Thats it, I dont want to be omnipotent, I just want the ability to continue playing realatively close to the play style that I have developed over the last 50+ levels 100+ days of playtime.<BR> Lets face it here, most Necros over level 50 have put ALOT of time into developing thier own personal style with the weapons that they have, if you remove what they have engrained into themselves for all that time completely and force them to play otherwise whether its possible or not, is irrelavant. They are going to be unhappy because now, they are having to re-learn their class all over again so late in the game...kinda goes back to the old saying "you cant teach an old dog new tricks". I personally think you can teach them, your difficulty lies in getting the old dogs to even learn them, believe me your better off "leaving sleeping dogs lie"<BR> DOnt make us relearn a new trade, let us use the trade we have worked so hard at developing. How would you react if after having a long and wonderfull carrer as an executive for a large company and near your retirement, they came and told you your job had been reclassified and you were now a Janitor?<BR> I realize I digress, but this one is trully heartfelt, let us do what we do, dont make us change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here goes.<P>First I'd like to thank Absor for starting this thread. Even if nothing happens at least someone is trying to listen to our plea.<P>I think if the DoT bug and skeleton illusion from Ignite bones were both addressed, that would be a HUGE step for us, and probably solve the matter all together.  At least giving us a chance to do some damage.  But if that will never happen at least allow us to preform our roll as a support class.  I liked the idea of the lifetaps healing, but not damaging.  Well, still sucks, but at least it allows us to do our work.  Make DMF and the subversion line able to be chain casted.  Having a recast time on it is a pain, and I really don't see it as being unbalancing.  Try having 15 people (there were 2 necro's helping buff) asking for DMF, and they see you medding between casts. They think you forgot about them, and start sending the tells (Soandso tells you, 'hey man, what's the eta on that DMF?')<P>To The_Perfect_Flaw.  You say that you should be the only casters able to do offensive damage because you don't do anything before or after the fight?  Tell me, what do tanks do before or after a fight?  Necro's are offensive casters first and foremost, and should be allowed to fulfill that role on any encounter (within reason).  We go from having a lifetap that is unresistable, to can't land it to save our lifes (literally).  Also you say that raiding parties can add 2 necro's to replace a wizard? Sure, and have the lag from 16 necro's instead of 8 wizards.<P>I think it was Grave_Robber that mentioned adding a flame partical effect instead of the Skeleton effect for ignite bones. Not a bad idea, but who has their partical effects turned on during a raid?  Though honestly I can't think of anything else that can be done =\<P>Back to the DoT thing.  You say that after this patch it will be fixed.  Not to argue with you, or bash the company, but we've heard that things will be fixed/added before, and it didn't happen.  And what are the odds that someone would be willing to risk losing an item for an epic weapon, or a CoF on your word.  So are guides going to be there to witness it now for a while?  Or at least be told that the encounter is happening, and take stock of the items on the mob, and reimburse them to the raiding party if the corpse does happen to mysteriously poof?<P>One last thing. To Masthis. You say that we should pick a class that reflects our play styles? We did.  That's why we got to a high level with it.  The only problem is, the class role get's changed, and no longer fits the style we enjoyed for the last 50 or so levels.<P>Well, that's all for now. I really hope that something can be done so necro's can be used for raids sometime soon.  As it is, mine is still sitting in OS where he went LD 2 weeks ago.<P>Danimal Shadowwalker<BR>51 Heretic on The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just one bit from a non-necro about the spells that turn mobs into Skels (I can't remember the name, sorry).  These spells have been flatly banned from use during raids.  It is simply too hard to keep track of mobs who change from large dragons/gods/what ever into small skeletons.  Large scale combats are already confusing enough without out having to play 'where did the mob go'.  The damage done is just not worth the confusion the spell causes.<P>Rhyse</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Copy of previous post I'd like to see a reply to:<P>Ok, so there is a little envy going around, and why shouldn't there? Many classes have gotten some kind of upgrade or change lately while necros have been left alone. <BR>I've always seen Hybrids to be very useful in groups and raids, but they have just gotten some upgrades, so why shouldn't necros? (I am not saying that the hybrids didn't disserve the upgrade BTW).<P>One point of Veriant is that necros need a downside to go along with their ability to solo to level 50. If a necro enjoys the game he cannot solo to level 50. Why you say? He will be board out of his mind 50+ because he has no friends to go do things with. <P>50+ necro turn into support characters. I have no problem with this. Make me a support character, but make me more useful then a mana/DMF pump. DMF cannot even be used in many places. DoTs are just burning mana on raids, chanters refuse to work around pets, so we are left with support. <P>We have Screaming Terror, but a chanter will take care of that area. We have healing spells, but that's a cleric/druid job. We have a buff (DMF), but that is only worth a little on a raid (Useless in many raid zones). What are we left with? Lich and mana transfer. <P>This brings me to 2 suggestions. <P>1) If you intend on keeping our raid job as only Lich/mana transfer, make it faster please. I'm not talking about ratios; I'm talking about the amount I send over. With the recast time and the small amount of mana sent, mana sent over is not very useful to a raid unless many necros are there (which brings up connection and organization problems).<P>2) If you are willing to adjust our abilities, I would be thrilled to see a new buff for necros to cast. Death Pact may be inline with the necro character, but I'd like to see a buff that would give Melee a proc of some kind like Vamp Embrace (the way the spell works, not the general effect of it). You would have to make this spell non-useable on pets or remove the lifetap proc from our 44+ pets in order to retain balance.<P>Either way would make me feel more useful to a raid while not making us overpowering solo.<P><BR>Thanous Soulbleeder<BR>55th Pre-Paineel Erudite Necro<P>PS I shouldn't have to put up with downsides of the necro after having to start with my guild in Tox, bad sight, and NPCs that don't care for me. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehehe, I agree,  the faction issue is the invisible downside.  Most others who have not tried a Necromancer, especially an Erudite one, don't really respect having bad faction everywhere but your starting city.  At least the Dark Elves, Gnomes, and Iksar can leave the first zone and go else where.  Erudites are Trapped in Tox till 8th when we can invis, and squeezing 8 out of Toxx is like pulling Chicken Teeth.<P>On to the topic at hand.<P>I have to reiterate that Necromancers are not a support class, but if I were to toy with the Idea,  I would like to see this-<P>Share Soul.  Allowes normally self only spells to be cast on a party member.  Have it cost one of the precious essence emeralds. The lifeforce contained in the emerald is used to forge the bond.<P>This would open a whole new world for Necro's the support arena.  We could grant Vamp Embrace, Banshee Aura-such as it is at that level, but at least it lasts a long time-, the Sheilding Series, and in a perfect world, if the Share Soul was targeted the way impart strength is, allow the draining spells to feed the tanks instead of ourselves.  This would allow Necromancers a truly unique buff, and if we are going to be buffing, at least it is connected with Necromancy, if not our usual area of study.  I understand that this will never happen, and I won't cry over it-since I don't agree that we should be buffing anyway.

</FONT><HR>Gaeorn:<P>I'm not telling anyone how to play or what is best for them.  They pick it on their own.  How they do this is at the character selection screen where they click the button that says "CREATE NEW CHARACTER".  From there, they go to a screen with a series of buttons on the left side where they choose their race.  Some races have benefits over others, where some races are only limited to certain classes.  Below that, you choose your sex.  Male or Female doesn't make much of a difference except for how certain stalker-type people might treat you.  Then you choose your facial appearance at the top middle of your screen.  There's several selections, choose the one that you like the most.<P>Now on to the really important part:  The class.  That's right folks, you can only choose to play one class at a time, not multi-class or by some hack be able to have two buttons selected at the same time.  So be careful with which button you select for class, you're stuck with it for that character.  You're stuck with that character's abilities, spells, versatility and soloability.  Surprising as this may sound, it's all very true.  Now take a deep breath, let it out and take another one.  Arrange your stats then push next.  You're well on your way to creating your character.  Make sure you chose an acceptable name as well, because the way people treat you or react to you is greatly dependent upon how ridiculous of a name (or offensive) you pick.  This also plays a big part in how often you'll be on raids.  Pick a dumb name, chances are people will shun you.<P>The classes are balanced.  Get over it, or don't get over it, it's up to you.  And for the last time, pick a class that suits your playstyle.  If you don't like your class because you can't do the things you want to do, then you didn't pick the right class for you.<P>The only thing in this thread that is even remotely close to a reasonable solution is to fix horrible pathing.  This has nothing to do with the classes themselves, hence it would be neither a nerf or a buff to any specific class.  It would be a solution to a problem that has existed since EQ existed.  If it were somehow coded that everything takes an "As the crow flies" route to it's target, then the problem would be solved forever.<P>Necromancers don't need a power increase, resistance checks changed, higher ranges for "stickable" mobs (that 6 level cap is actually a 7 level cap, and applies to all classes that can cast spells, not just Necromancers).<P>I could name a whole slew of problems with my monk, my enchanter, my wizard, my bard, and my warrior.  But guess what?  What would be the point?  I played those characters up to high levels because of what they are good for.  When I want my class to suit my playstyle as it changes, I logout and use the above directions for character creation to make it so.  The game isn't fun when you reduce yourselve to complaing about your ONE character's shortcomings.  What is fun is finding a solution on your own, and in EQ, that generally means to play a different character.  It's a class-based system, and that's how they work.<P>Masthis, 50th Monk<BR>Falumben, 50th Enchanter<BR>Aliuolen, 53rd Wizard<BR>Gorefeast, 60th Warrior<BR>Loliealien, 49th Bard<BR>Yidanu, 28th Cleric<BR>Snakari, 8th Necromancer, and proud of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Okay I'm posting my idea's here for the necro class.  I do not believe any of them to be unbalancing to the class.<P>SUGGESTION FOR IGNITE BONES:<BR>Currently when an Ignite/Chill bones hits a target the targest radius to hit decreases, so casters/tanks get messages that they are either resisted (because they aren't right under the mob anymore) or "you are too far away" because the "to hit" radius on the mob has shrunk.  Keep in mind this is just for encounters with LARGE mobs like Dragons, Gods, etc.  <P>What I would like to see this spell do is the exact opposite.  While the mob is in the skeleton form from the spell, the "to hit" radius of the mob is increased to much bigger.  Now when a necromancer casts this spell on a large raid, people will be able to hit the target more easily, instead of less easily.<P>While I don't know the logistics of this and if it is indeed possible or not, I do know that there are smaller mobs in the game that have a "to hit" radius that is very large.  Some of the ratmen in Dragon Necropolis are like this and tanks love it.  This small change to the spell would not only please necromancers, but make them a more viable part of a large scale raid.  <P>GROUP DMF:<BR>I posted this before and I'll post it again.  How about a Group DMF spell?  I see no way where this could unbalance the class and it would make the one necro on the trakanon raid's job much easier(one Necro for Trak is almost more than enough.)  This is a 44 buff, I can't see anything wrong with making it a group buff post 50.<P>VERSION OF DMF WITHOUT LEVITATE:<BR>Since Verant has decided to nerf DMF in some of the zone's you'd most likely want to use it (Siren's Grotto, Plane of Sky, Kedge Keep, Velketor's Labrinth) can we have a version of the spell without DMF and with just the Enduring Breath and See Invise component?  You want to help necromancers feel more a part of raids, make it so this spell is usuable in some of the raid zones.  Levitate is just ONE component of the spell and really the least usefull one except for travel.  People would still love this buff without Levitate and it would make us more useful in more zones.<P>I have no problem that I cannot damage some mobs in this game, there are many mobs in this game I can, I'd say probably 99.99999% of the monsters in EQ I can do damage to as a necro.  Every class has it's limitations and I accept this limitation, hell I still have a pet that is UNRESISTABLE to any mob in the game.  What I'd like to see is the improvements to the spells listed above.<P>Zotreth Beion`Dhevel<BR>-=60th Warlock=-<BR>Coterie Nocturne<BR>Ayonae Ro Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

No necro is going to use this in normal non-raid situations as a necro with pet and with his other spells is much more powerful. But it would let us actively deal damage in epic battles.<P>You could give the first of these spells to lvl 50 necros and give us an update every 5 levels.

Fine fine, that is logical, I agree.<P>What about making it so that they are not totally useless against dragons? Give them a 50/50 chance of being resisted...or even worse, just make it so that a lifetap CAN work on an ubermob.

</FONT><HR>Please explain to me how I was so useful to my guild last nite.  We're in lavastorm to kill a mob for the monk epic, which is in the lava.  I get there and cast DMF on everyone.  I then sit in lich and feed mana to the chanter.  I then sit around the rest of the time and do nothing.  That is exactly what I did during this whole thing.  I was happy to be there, but was ashamed for feeling so useless.  Were it not for my friends in my guild I would never even have the potential to see things like this unless it were before or after the fact.  That's just not good enough.  <P>In case some people don't know, it's not just uber/epic mobs that totally resist any form of lifetap.  I just love being in a group and see something like a shambling cube in skyshrine only to realize that nothing I can cast will stick on it.  I might as well be getting powerleveled cause that's the equivelent (sp?) of the situation.  Other than my pet, I have no way to be of help in these situations.  Granted, that's not exactly an uber mob, but it's still at the heart of the matter.  How about phin and his guardians?  Can't tap them or bond them either.  Phin's guards are blue to me.  Do you honestly expect me to believe that I would not be stronger in my magic skills that I wouldn't be able to tap a mob which is lower in level than me?  <P>Some people have made some really logical suggestions on how you could make us more useful.  We are not jacks of all trades, we are killing machines.  <P>I don't have the levels for some of the spells that use the essence emeralds, but I can tell you this much.  Getting these things is next to impossible and judging by my fellow necro's out there who have had a chance to use the other spells I see no point to even waste my time with getting the emeralds.  Need a res?  Excuse me while I laugh hysterically.  HAHAHA, call a cleric.  I was lead to believe that infusion would allow me to give myself and one other 1k mana, but now I'm told it's self only.  An emerald for a lifetap I would only use during an epic battle is totally resisted?  Nobody in their right mind is going to let me sacrifice them for these things when they benefit nobody.  I've had 2 emeralds since I got the sacrifice spell.  I will not use a waste of page space for a third.<P>You want to put us into a support role?  Fine, give us something to use to do support with.  Summon corpse, dmf, and mana dump just don't suffice to make us a viable support class.  They are limited in their usage and everyone knows it.  While lifetaps do some damage, they in no way overpower a wizard in the amount of damage done.  They do at least give us a way to heal ourselves so that we can dump our mana as you seem to want us to do so badly.  <P>The solution is simple.  Fix lifetaps so they're useful during epic encounters.  If we're to stay in the support role, give us some means to be supportive with.  Extra buffing capabilities would be nice, even the pet buffs that make them immune or highly resistant to fear seem viable to me.  Forcing a class to completely change the way they were designed to play doesn't sit well with them.  <P>The limited support spells we do have just don't make us a welcome addition to a raid.  It's just as every other necro has posted, we are able to help getting there and once there we might as well camp and log on an alt that can be of real help.  I'm not offering any solutions in this post because I think plenty of good ones have already been made.  In the meantime, I'll be working on my cleric so I'm at least wanted for something other than a corpse summons and dmf. <P>Aieklul Soulleach<BR>53 Necromancer<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings.<P>Former Necro player...current Mage player. I stopped playing my Necro and focused solely on my Mage. Primary reason: time; secondary: my self-imposed insistance on logic. The Necromancer Class in EQ, the design of it, struck me as illogical. The Hodge-podge spell lists, too many spells, too many spell series that seem completely unrelated or 'stolen' from other classes. The final, ultimate realization of this is, of course, Dead Man Floating. When I saw this spell, I kept thinking: oh, please! Someone on the Dev Team is reaching waaayy out there to include such an uber spell for Necros. <P>So, I quit the Class.<P>But I still have a perspective on it. I think the primary problem is the 'role' of the Class. Someone else mentioned it above. The role of the Necromancer is being changed post 50 and especially on uber/plane raids. I completely agree that a Necromancer is all about damaging/cursing/harming all other things (and in many cases him/herself) as a means to the ultimate reward of immortality and power. To suddenly become an 'enhancer', 'buffer', 'supporter' plunges deeply into the surreal. <P>I feel this has happened because the Class, itself, was not well designed from the outset and the thrust of the Class was changed long after the game was launched. At first, the Necro was granted overpowering abilities in comparison with other classes simply because they were expected to solo forever. THEN, the 'force players to group' mentality occurred to the Live Team--and the powers of the Necromancer suddenly became glaringly too much. So, bad design gets worse as they try to juggle power and ability.<P>What we have is a theme vs gameplay conflict. The LT wants uber-mobs to be almost unbeatable---possible only by the combined efforts of many players/Classes. Each class then must contribute something to the effort without dominanting the scenario (the melee argument aside). Unfortunately, the theme of the Necromancer doesn't fit into this formula--is, in fact, almost completely opposed to it. Why assist others to power and glory? Enlightened self-interest, I suppose. But Necromancer magick isn't geared for it either thematically or mechanically.<P>I think the problem should be resolved by designing new magick from a thematic view: Necromancers realize that, eventually, they must at least 'appear' to assist others and so develop new magicks towards that end. Abashi has said, soon all class issues will be halted and 'content' shall become the focus of the LT. Well, this, IMO, is a content issue. What the LT needs to do is design some new spells that fit the theme of the Necromancer, stay within the boundaries of power they set for the Necromancer, yet more clearly demonstrate utility in the Planes. <P>Perhaps if you guys brainstorm from a thematic point-of-view, you can find the proper solutions.<P>thanks<BR>Alc<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are the thoughts of a retired level 51 necro (I now play a lvl 58.8 magician.  Gave up the necro for the exact reasons being discussed here.):<P>I know it's not something you *wished* to do Absor, but the only true fixes for the "can't scratch the boss mobs" problem are a) Remove the illusion effect from the DDs or b) Give necromancers a new, "boss mob only" DD.  <P>Since you seem reluctant regarding solution A, here is what I would suggest for solution B.  Give necros a "Bane of Champions" spell.   A high mana cost, high damage, low resist lifetap that ONLY works on lvl 55+ mobs.  <P>This would accomplish several things.  It would give necros a way to actually deal damage to boss mobs during a raid.  Since necros could actually tap health back, it would also allow them to use demi-lich/arch-lich during the epic fight to mana-dump clerics/enchanters/wizards (which is what you seem to want them to do even though most of us picture a necro as a master of death and debilitating, not a master of charity.)  <P>Don't get me wrong, but who's a cleric going to save their heals for in an epic fight?  The melee'er/wizard who's actually doing damage to the boss mob or the silly necro who hasn't managed to scratch the mob but has liched all their health away?  If VI wants necros to wear the Energizer Bunny ears, the ability to lifetap health from the mob is ESSENTIAL.<P>The superior mana/damage ratio and superior cast times of lures should be more than sufficient to preserve wizards' egos and raid desirability.  Using lures, a wizard would be able to deal as much damage as two life-tapping necros combined.  In the long epic fights, the increased mana-regen of lich would help even the necro out versus the wizard, but isn't the "long" fight what a necro is all about?  At least that's what all the slow DoTs seem to imply.<P>By giving necro's an "uber mob only" lifetap, it would eliminate VI's concerns about class-balance in non-epic encounters as it simply could not be used for normal mobs.  If charm can be level-limited to preserve a trait of the enchanter without making it exploitable, surely a similar thing can be done for necros?<P>The last issue that a "Bane of the Champion" lifetap would solve "can't find the stupid skele-form mob" problem.  By using a lifetap solution, the skeleton-form effect could be left on the Ignite and Chill Bones spells.  This would preserve the *cool* factor of necros' DD of which VI seems to be so fond (even though most players find it annoying after the initial "ooohhh"s).<P>There ya go Absor.  A solution that is not exploitable, that does not infringe upon wizards' supremacy of DD, that is not usable in non-epic encounters,  that does not irritate all the tanks, that is in-line with the ideal of a necromancer and that allows a necromancer to serve as a mana-battery if that is what they wish to do.<P>P.S.<P>Sorry for the mild sarcasm in some of the statements, but I still hold a grudge against the way VI conveniently changed the Vision(tm) of a necromancer.  The necromancer was originally billed as a selfish, solo-type class with good damage dealing potentintial in *prolonged* fights.  Then VI got the bright idea to make them "group-friendly" and gave them the band-aid fix: mana-battery spells.  If I wanted to sit there and give people mana, I'd have chosen an enchanter.  Repeatedly being told "don't nuke or DoT, just sit there and mana-dump the cleric/enchanter" was the final factor in my decision to retire my necromancer.<P>Cameeria Nerfomancer<BR>Level 51 Pre/Post-raid Mule (aka Necromancer)  =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ideas to make necros more "useful" in an epic lvl situation:<P>With the current spells:<BR>Mana trasfer: <BR>   Casting time is quick enough casting recast time sux. clerics/encahanter/shaman/wizard need mana right away as fast as possible. let us truly give them that mana as quick as possible. As it stands at lvl 59 i can cast this spell from start of the encounter to the time the thing falls dead and still be at 40m. its too slow of a recast time.<P>Mana trasfer rate:<BR>Currenty max 400:150 or 2.6:1<BR>Cleric heal rate excluding Cheal is avg 2.44<BR>Ok in a static situation a necro with<BR>800hps 0mana<BR>and a cleric with<BR>800hps 0mana   <BR>After necro meds for one trasfer and passes it to the cleric and cleric passes it back along with the avg 2.44 ends up<BR>necro 760hp 0mana<BR>cleric 800hp 0mana<BR>Personaly this needs to be looked at. Yes your right the ratio is giving less then it can currently give back. Wouldnt mind seeing this brought closer to the one to one give and recive if not a touch higher. Realise that in these encounters where it is used the clerics are not going to be healing the necro they need the mana for others. In regular situations one to one converson vs return wouldnt be overbalancing, since you couldnt get more then you can give. if it was a bit higher return then casting time i could see a possible abuse of. But most times necros are not around clerics, there around druids or shamans which have a lower return vs mana then clerics do, if not solo all together. So change it to 400:166 or 2.409:1 with a return rate at a standered 2.4 of clerics turns back 398.4hp.<BR>    And if your really worried about useing it to mass increase mana pools with Cheal then try it. it alredy can be done. Takes about 9min and increases the mana pool by 275 to 350 in relation on the necros hps im useing the 2000 that i can get from cleric and necro buffs with a 200 hp buffer so that i dont kill my self liching. Thats 9 min of doing NOTHING else but making mana time enough for a full party to med to full anyhow. Even if it was slightly higher mana return it wouldnt be useful. Ask your playtesters make them show you.<P>Quick note: You confused 80% of the necro population when you said it would double there mana pool in one of your earlier posts. most dont group so there not thinking how some would abuse the only spells they see as useful.<P>Dots: they work. one mabey two debuffs and the proper type for the mob your going against and they will stick. No problems with poofing lately at least a few months as long as you dont go LD then your dodts wont poof it. teach your guilds make them see they work thats on your own shoulders.<P>Essence emerad spells:<BR>   Ok these suck at least as it stands. Heres Some ideas.<BR> The spells them selves:<BR>1: Make the tap unrestible. verent this is the only thing i could qualify using some ones life for. <BR>2: Allow us to use the mana spell on others 1000 mana to us is for trasfer since we can not use it to real effect ourselves is 375 mana to another class and that still takes me between 28 and 42sec to give it to them. Bascicaly to little to late for the massive cost. <P>The emeralds:<BR>under stand that each emerald really equals 4 to 6 hours of a real players LIFE this is a MASSIVE cost, it should at least be relible. If you dont think this is a massive cost, then spend 4 to 6 hours on a puzzle then tear it apart and start again till you finish. About the same feeling.<BR>Ideas:<BR>1: Make it so we can umm... sacrifice our selves so we can judge our own loss vs the situation danger<BR>2: Make a new fashion of emerald that requires a quest to make or a trade skill. costing around 1k to 1.5k to make, Useing soul stones droped off 50+ mobs or even 55+ mobs. this cost to the player based just seems ethicaly wrong.<P>Drains:<BR>Saw your posting unrestible drains. dont want them dont need them. Thats not what were asking for. Were looking for PARTIAL or less resisted drains after a couple debuffs instead of totaly resisted. As a core of what necros do we should at least have a chance. lits kinda like telling wizards hey you can use IC/Lures on everyting but the last mob there you have to stand around and gate if things go badly, but dont feel bad your a support class in these situations.<P>Pets:<BR>Personaly like the idea of increasing fear resist but... there are only dragons that fear and not even all of them. enchanter or cleric magic resist on them and i havent had much problem.<BR>The teather kinda idea is intresting but not really an impact vs epic mobs.<BR>Would personaly like if pets 53+ were just stronger faster versions of the rest of the line.<P>Scent of Terris:<BR>Make it debuff magic so we have more chance with the other debuffs to stick a drain.<P>Fear:<BR>Make it so that with massive debuffing that epic mobs could be feared.<P>Thrall of bones,Enslave death:<BR>On that possession deal.. would love to be able to charm the pets of those high lvl epic mobs. make it check wis or cha of the other caster vs wis or cha of the necro. But as there are lower lvl creatures that have pets its not epic lvl only.<P>NEW SPELLS:<BR>1: A new debuff in the same series as sent of terris but debuffs magic at a higher lvl 58 or so so we can stick a few drains.<P>2: Lure type drains 600 mana for 300 drain low resist. And if ya say that we dont deserve lure type spells again well... wizards concentrate on four schools for dd they were given one of these spells when they first made there chrs. necro consentrate on one school of dd thats drains we also get one when we start the game. Its really a shame being told that a spell we get at lvl one we cant use at lvl 60. plz justifiy it.<P>3: A Short duration, high dmg, high cost dot resisting off disease or poison. max time 20 sec.<P>4: A mass mana trasfer at currnet ratio. cost 1100 mana trasfer 412.5mana well 412. enough for one Cheal in a shot casting time 4 sec. So a desclipine can be used to stave off death from the warrior in enough time for us to trasfer the mana to the cleric and the cleric to cast to heal before the warrior dies. Or at the new ratio suggested above cost 1000mana give 415mana<P>5: A Stun like screaming terror was when it first came out but lasting only 6 sec hehe was way to powerful before it was changed belive me =)<P>6: Spells to give other chrs or pets special procing abilities poison/disease/cold based max dmg per proc 20 or so but make it frequent proc rate casting cost 200 + peridot or other valuable gem mabey a fire emerald or black pearl. enough to make shure its not used in common situations.<P>7: Group HarmShield great idea but would really infinge on other aspects of the game. but would be rocking to see a necro turn the party into a group of skeles immune to pain for 10 esc. escape. time to med that last second of mana for evacer. time enough for that warrior to pull that light healing potion to last the few seconds till the cleric can cast again and put that cheal on him.<P>8: Group DMF um.. a nicety but would make us even more unneeded there as is.<P>9: Improved DMF higher resistances so we can resist the AE's better. giveing us the ability to lich with a regen and full buffs for faster mana trasfer.<P>The rest of my ideas are defnitly not just epic though they do deal with high lvl necro play. but as your request i will post those elsewhere.<P>Vapors d'Deathwind<BR>Veeshan<P>Meloshski@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've always wanted a /pet ignore command to make the pet back off even if it gets hit again, because they keep breaking mez because of this.  Also, we get parties killed a lot because of poor dungeon pathing causing them to run off and bring back mobs.  And nothing is more frustrating than sitting in a dungeon with nothing near you and hear "Taunting attacker master."<P>Also, in a few dungeons, Befallen being the one I am most familiar with, pet's get stuck in some pathing bug and teleport to the zone of the dungeon, then try to run back to you at the bottom and cause a huge train as well as aggroing mobs that are far away onto you in your peaceful, empty hole in the bottom.<P>I also think the /pet assist command would be useful, I currently have a macro sitting on me that does /assist then a /pet attack.<P>These are just a few things to make necros more peaceful in groups.<P>Now the main concern is that we change roles later in life.  If I wanted to sit on the side lines and wait to be needed before and after a fight, I would have made a cleric.  I wanted to solo and use necromantic powers, and since soloing is out of the question on uber raids, I want to be a necromancer, that's what I was trained to be andhave spent months being.<P>And Absor says that mage pets would have to be improved if necro pets are, but why?  Mages are a pet class, yes, but mages stay mages from lvl 1-60, they also have powerful nukes that they can use in uber battles as well as a dot.  Their epic is the best in the game, what room do they have to complain?  They can fight in uber-raids and are a decent substitue for wizards.  Their pets are also better than necromancer pets AND they get 4 types of pets.  Get a necro and mage together, get them both to summon pets until both are the same lvl, and let their pets duke it out 1v1 without the casters doing anything.  The mage pet will win most of the time.<P>If making our pets more useful on raids is an answer, mages can stuff it.<P>How about giving us, say in the low 50s, a new drain that has a longer casting time and higher mana cost but is resisted like a disease or poison spell?  Something that we can use at later levels to tap uber mobs.  Even give it a higher recast time than normal drains.<BR>Or make our DDs more useful.  We get shock of poison, lvl 24, then torbas acid blast at lvl 34 (good addition btw) then ignite bones at 44, then chill bones at 55 (with same damage as ignite) so 500 damage is the most we can do, and this is an all or nothing spell.  Druids do just over 1000 damage at lvl 60, magicians do the same, enchanters do 675, clerics do 670...need I go on?<P>510 is our max DD, our drain is resisted, so the 720 on touch of night doesn't count, plus the casting time and mana is like casting Deflux twice.  Just wondering why clerics (healers) and enchanters (crowd control) and druids (fellow soloers (that get good healing abilities) can all do more damage than us and be more useful than us in raids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
