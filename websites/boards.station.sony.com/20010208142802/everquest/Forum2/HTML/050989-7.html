</FONT><HR>Once again, you'll not see a single post in which someone states that the wizard is in fact balanced.  (unless it is someone working for verant)<P>Its not just wizards posting here, almost all classes are posting here about how wizards need something more to offer.  <P>The only people you don't hear saying this are mages and druids, in fear that you will decide to nerf them if we seem not powerful enough.  You only hear them say, "please do not compare my class to yours, please do not compare my class to yours, please do not compare my class to yours."  They say they are not balanced either as well!  Ha!  <P>I don't really know, since i've never played one, but i think the fact that they are all worried about being nerfed even when they think they need some powering up tells you what they think of wizards in the food chain as well.<P>Please, can one million players all be wrong?  It doesn't matter how much you debate or reason.  Time and time again, when you play the game it is obvious the wizard is an inferior class.<P>Take my ability to quad kite, PLEASE!  It is so boring and if this is what prevents us from getting balance then remove this ability from the game.  I LOVE AE when i can find a group to do it, but quad kiting is so boring.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didnt want to post my ideas when i wrote my above message but now that i have read most of the other peoples posts i feel that a good portion of them are either asking for things that will unbalance the class or would be to tough to implement. So here goes what i think might help that would also be feasible. (Remember im talking about level 60 balance issues)<P>1)Make super mobs have a higher AC and thereby limiting the damage done my tanks, this way you increase our role in raids. Keep in mind that some zones might crash when you have 50+ people in one area and you cannot make the mobs killable by only huge groups of people.<P>2)Create a line of low resist spells that have a huge recast time(maybe 10 minutes or more, hell make a once a day spell for all i care) but deal out a good portion more of low resist damage for a good mana to damage ratio. These spells could start at 53 and come in sets of 3. <P>Ill explain.<P>At lvl 53 you would get 3 low resist, high re-cast time spells (fire,cold and magic based) all linked to the same recast delay so you could NOT memorize all 3 OR only one could be memorized at a time. (Give the wizard the "you have already memorized this spell" message if you try to put up more then one.)<P>At lvl 56 you would get another 3 low resist, high re-cast time spell like above. Now at lvl 56 you would be able to cast ONE of the lvl 53 and ONE of the level 56 spells.<P>At lvl 60 you would get your final line of 3(same fire cold and magic based spells). At this point against mobs w/ 100k+ hps we would have a chance to cast 3 good mana to damage low resist spells. <P>By limiting the recast time to, let just say one full day and separating it to levels 53,56 and 60 you would minimize any unwanted balance issues and rekindle our role as damage dealers in major raids by giving us the ability to memorize and cast the lvl 53 56 and the 60 ice based spells for example. I truly believe that having a huge recast time and low resist for this line is the key to making this idea work. This idea would take a little bit of time to organize BUT all the effects of this spell line are already in the game in some manner shape or form so new programming would be minimal. This unique line of spells would again separate us from the other classes as the damage dealers.<P>P.S. I hate to get off point but I never thought I would see a pet more stupid then the enchanters, well until I casted my pet spell. Is there any way we could get our pet intelligence upgraded from brainless and suicidal to just brainless? If you didnt know our pet spell needs a target to cast and after the mob is dead it suicides. I would be happier if it was just like the other novelty only pets. (clerics heh)  =) <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to break this into two sections, "major" and "minor".  The major issues are the ones that really make us viable as a class.  The minor ones are, well, things I'd REALLY like to see but of little overall import.<P>MAJOR ISSUES:<BR>1. Al'Kabor line.  It's been detailed above, so I won't clutter the board by repeating information.<BR>2. Uber HP mobs.  Even on full burn, assuming no resists, we can't even begin to scratch them without going OOM.  Once OOM we are 100% useless to the group and the raid.  Can't even Evac (like you would from an encounter like this.  The more popular method is to save the clerics and die).  If we sit to med, instant agro and we find ourselves at our bind spots.  Solution?  Already in game: Harvest.  More on this later.<BR>3. Normal exp grinds.  We cannot keep up with the melee classes here thanks to our mana constrainsts.  We sacrifice a LOT to be "the masters of magical damage".  Low low HP and AC, mana constraints, had to stare at a spell book until 35, etc.  I believe to compensate we should be able to do considerably more damage than the melees are capable of.  Not only in the "short term - IE manadump, agroed and dead" but in the long run, the normal single mob pull exp grinds.  After all, I made a wizard because I wanted to do THE damage.  Solution?  Again, Harvest.  See number 5 for a proposed solution.<BR>4. Spell fizzles.  Atol's Spectral Shackles comes to mind...<BR>5. Harvest, a spell that most pre-50 Wizards have memorized at all times.  Roughly three quarters of a bub of mana...  10 second cast time, 10 second stun.  10 minute recast time.  This spell is great.  The ability to pull additional mana out of the air in a sticky situation is truly amazing.  Off set and balanced by the 10 second cast and stun.  I like that.  I find myself WANTING to cast it but unable to risk being stunned.  This spell is amazingly balanced, and I tip my hat to the design team.  HOWEVER, the 10 minute recast time seems to only be in place soas to not make us solo kings.  I can appreciate that and wholeheartedly agree.  But in a group it should function differently.  In a group it should not have that restriction.  And so I propose two possible solutions, one of which may not be possible to code and the other trivial.  ONE: reduce recast time by 90 seconds for every member of the party other than yourself.  It makes sense that a larger group would be pulling faster and killing more.  Thus, with a six man group Harvest would have a recast time of 600 - (90 * 5) = 150 seconds, or two and a half minutes.  This would GREATLY enhance the wizard's mana supply and therefor the amount of damage he can generate for the group (and therefor his appeal to the group).  It also does not enhance that same wizard's ability to solo.  AT ALL.  However, this may not be possible to implement under the current system.  So the second solution I propose is this:  Scale the amount of mana harvested by the number of members in the group.  Above, in a six man group the wizard can harvest four times faster so this way he should get four times as much mana - but only once every 10 minutes.  Perhaps you should also increase the length of the stun, to keep the same balance as the spell now has.<P>MINOR ISSUES:<BR>1. Our spell lineup seems to indicate that we are the king of self only sight.  True North, See Invisible (not self only but a sight spell none the less), Halo of Light, Heat Sight, Chill Sight, the Bind Sight series, and the Glimpse Series...  And Sense Summoned.  Which brings me to the issue at hand.  Where is our Sense Animal?  Sense the Dead?  Sense Plant?  It seems only natural to me that the king of self only sight would be able to sense these things as well as Summoned.<BR>2. Sphere of Light.  This has always seemed a bug to me.  It irritates me to no end that I am able to conjure something out of thin air using Divination.  This spell should be on the Conjuration skill.  Not only for roleplaying purposes but for gameplay as well.  Until the upper 50s wizards have TWO, yes that's right.  TWO.  1 + 1..  Spells that use the Conjuration skill.  Eye of Zomm and Halo of Light.  Both have long reloads and for their level, hefty mana costs.  Thus it becomes quite difficult for a wizard to practice his Conjuration skill.  Why do we want to, you ask?  Because of point number 3:<BR>3. Flaming Sword of Xuzl.  At level 59 we get this "pet" to throw at uber HP mobs or 100% magical resistant ones.  Unfortunately, the mana cost of this spell is way to high for the life expectancy of this non-flaming Flaming Sword.  One riposte or AE and its toast.  And even if it survives, it suicideds when the mob goes down (rendering it totally useless in normal exp grinds).  700 mana down the drain when we could have fired off two Lures or three Draughts.  Please either up the life expectancy of this "pet" (increased HP, level, AC, etc. and no suicide) or decrease the mana cost.<BR>4. More teleport spots would be nice.  I liked the "old world" where there were portals everywhere except near Qeynos and I knew I had at most two or three un-SoW'd zones (smaller zones, too, I might add) to run.  With the addition of Kunark and Velious I find myself relying more upon my Bard, Ranger, Druid, and Shaman friends for traveling than on my portals.  Would be nice if this were not so.  /e daydreams of how things used to be.<P>Thanks for not only reading our posts but responding as well.  I normally do not post on this board but right now I feel that for once I may truly be heard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have just logged from playing, and I have a very specific example of what is broken with wizards.<P>I am currently a level 51 wizard.  My guild joined with another to take on Ixiblit Fer the fire elemental in Burning Woods for the cleric epic quest item.  Ixi is reportedly about level 62 or 63.<P>On our first run we got wiped out, and as it turned out neither me nor my other guildmate wizzy could even hit Ixi.  We both got full resists within melee range until we got killed. (which by the way was instantaneous when he quad hit me for 550)<P>Guess what?  After we got rez'd, we had to leave.  There was nothing we had to contribute except add to the lag, so we had to leave.  Have you any idea my frustration?  How worthless I felt?<P>I want to know what on earth I can contribute when the target is too far about my level cap? (which is what, 6 or 8 levels?)  I want to know what there is that I can provide when chanters are debuffing, clerics are healing, mages and necros have pets meleeing, and the tanks/hybrids are meleeing?<P>I need to know.<P>Thank you<P>Valherru<BR>51st Channeler<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bearing in mind that I haven't read the entire thread, and I'm not a wizard (44 Rogue), please forgive me if this has been heard before.<P>Absor, the problem of an expanded mana pool only some of the time can be dealt with as a Discipline.  If it's possible, a /disc to expand the mana pool, increase the regen rate (being sure to stack with Clarity, etc., though), or maybe even the overall damage dealt in spells, all seem like ways to increase the short-term effects of a wizard while keeping them "normal" for the next hour or 2.<P>Another idea are spells that cost less mana at the expense of other stats, or maybe health.  Imagine, a fire spell so dangerously uncontrollable that it stands a good chance to kill the user if abused...but so insanely powerful that it's well worth the risk.  That sort of thing.<P>Just a few ideas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I just want to chime in with my two cents worth. I play a very young wizard and can't really comment on the "high level" issues, but I do think I can see the problems on the horizon. I'm not going to reiterate the other suggestions that have already been made on this quite lengthy thread, but I will ask that Verant carefully ask themselves why so many wizards feel that they are unable to contribute to a group.<P>The idea of using teleportation as a more defensive (or even offensive) tactic is one that I think has a lot of potential to help make the wizard more useful. It does seem to fit the wizard very well, and would be fun to use. I see two easy ways this is helpful. <P>First, a self defense buff as has already been suggested (the Blink idea.) This would be great, but it should teleport you only a very small distance away if at all. It would effectively become a magical dodge -- perhaps it should even work like dodge with an increasing chance of success as the character gains in skill. This will help keep us wizzies alive a bit longer while not turning us into trains waiting to happen. It would probably also interrupt casting, which would help prevent it from becoming a mega kiting tool.<P>The second is more offensive, where the target is teleported a distance directly away from the caster. This could be very helpful in crowd control situations where *someone else* is being beat on by the monster and can't get away, such as the cleric or enchanter when things go wrong. I don't think this spell should include the random direction element of Shadow Step since it would be too disorienting for the group (you'd never know which direction the monster was going to be returning from) but the random distance is probably a good idea to keep things interesting. This also allows a little bit of tactics on the wizard's part, so he or she can judge where to best send the monster and must maneuver a bit to do so. This could also be part of a line of such spells (in fact one could argue that the Disintegrate spell is the culmination of this ability.)<P>And, I know I said two ways, but a third just occured to me. What about an "anchor" spell that works as an anti-summoning defense for those tough mobs that want to summon a fleeing party member? This might also help make those in-zone evacs more useful. If this sort of thing is implemented, please make sure that the protected party member gets a message so that they know the wizard just saved their life. Something along the lines of "A %T tries to summon you, but you are anchored."<P>Also, I might comment on something I remember reading from Absor's post about having to make zone changes to move the portal. Well, why not be a little more creative! Don't change the maps, simply change the location and make a story out of it. You could park an NPC wizard at the new location that will tell you ... "I am here investigating this [strange phenomenon] of planar dislocation." After a while, when the technical staff has had a chance to rework and test the new zone, make the change to the zone and the NPC can move on to investigate other things.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well since everyone else is putting in their 2 copper's worth I guess I will also. I would like to say first, that I play a 54th level wizard on  the Tunare server and love playing one.<P>First off, I don't think their needs to be any changes to the CT gate spot. I used it when I was a young wizard, died and never used it till I was at least 45th. After that time I use it a ton to go to Fear raids and such. The WK gate needs to be moved, always has and always will, the only thing nice about the WK gate was the hole in the world right near it that you could pop over to the Qeynos hills zone.(No I never used it.) :rolleyes<P>Since we are "The Masters of Magical Damage" this is what I purpose on the subject. All int casters have a hard cap limit of 200 int for the mana= int/5 +4 method of getting how much mana you get. (I am pretty sure on the calucation, but it doesn't matter). The first thing I purpose is this, raise the cap on that to 255 for wizards, most of us that have 50+ levels under out belt can acheive this with some work. Yes this would increase our mana pool, but only to the effect that we could become what you so state that we are. <P>Next, change the basic way the AE's work in the game. Make them centered on a tank, when you cast it, the mobs believe that the tank is the one that inflicted the damage and are aggro'd on them and not the Wizard who casted the spell. This would improve our grouping ability and prevent clerics from saving more mana and just res'ing us instead of healing.<P>Thirdly, add a upgrade of the concussion spell at 49th. This spell would be like the cleric/enchanter spell that wipes the mobs hate list. Make it use 500 mana and takes 10 seconds to cast. The reason for this is to wipe out the mobs hate list so we can med in piece.<P>Next, I do agree that Harvest needs to be fixed post 50. I used to see decent movement in my Mana bar when I used it in my 40's, now I might as well med with C2 and Bards song running. What a waste of a Spell slot after you get Ice comet.<P>Lastly, our epic needs some major revamping. The way it is set up is just insane. Lets take a quick look. I am supposed to get a skin off of a GOD, who spawns ONCE A WEEK. AND IS AN ULTRA RARE DROP. So if I am luckly, and in the right spot at the right time, and the person who is running the Fear raid at the time doesn't have a guildmate / friend lined up for it, AND I am the most senior wizard in the zone, AND if it drops, I get to loot it. Hmmm, I think I might see a CT Skin about may 10th, 2009. Which I doubt very likely I will still be playing this game then. What I suggest is have it be a Ultra rare drop off of the fetid feinds and CT. It is not that far off to think that they are made of the same materials. This would put more 50+ people in the plane and get more of them out quicker, plus you wouldn't have people fighting over a GOD kill, just for a stupid line of code that is called an epic. And finally, the buff it casts needs to be able to used others as a buff. This would severally improve our grouping ability with one. It would help on buffs for caster classes and would cut down the need for chanters to rune all of the tanks on uber fighting. We could finally contribute on CR runs and help out in general.<P>TTFN<BR>Salena Crimsonheart<BR>54th Level Wizard<BR>Tunare Trade Coalition</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why do you try to placate wizards with such useless gestures when you very well know that there is nothing better to give them?? Delete those spells...give us something useful in exchange or delete them altogether so you have no reason to say we gave you something just for the sake of adding spells.

</FONT><HR>Please, look into the resist rates on rain spells.  I have tried them out in single mob situations many times, and the resists are high.  After a while, most wizards will realize that you can cast 2 draught spells for less mana, more damage, and in a shorter time, than you can with a rain spell... <P>Also, it would be nice it we got directional shadow step spells.

</FONT><HR>I think the wizards primary weakness is that we have no staying power. We are sprinters in a fight and can't last past the first round. Our tendency to be quickly spent hinders the rest of the group in that they are waiting for us to recoup mana after a large fight. Mana efficiency is of primary importance for us because unlike any other class without mana we are useless.<P>Most of the suggestions that i see are for bigger damage. Slower casting. Larger cost or some combination of this. <P>I offer three solutions.<P>1. A new spell line of relatively slow casting ultra mana efficient low damage spells. I'm thinking of 10damage:1 mana:1 second ratio. eg. a 50 damage costing 5 mana that takes 5 seconds to cast.<P>This would allow us to deal massive damage in a long fight without running out of mana but would be inefficient for kiting due to the time needed for a kill and the danger associated with re snaring.<P>2. An expensive upgrade to harvest. An emerald component or even more expensive harvest that replaces all our mana. (or an expensive mana potion that does the same.)<BR>Again i suggest this to counter the concerns of verant. It would effectively double our mana reserves but ony in "important" situations. Soloing would most likely not be worth the pp involved but would be available when the group needed that wizard power.<P>3. As stated many times in this thread. Allow my spells to land on MoBs the tanks in my group are able to hit. A Wizard is the only class that is worthless when a mob is pulled that is more than 6 levels higher than the caster. Pet classes deal damage with their pets. Support classes continue to support. Meleers melee. Wizards are asked to leave.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clarifying my point, one lure spell, about 3000-3500 dmg, god/boss/level 63+ mob only. <P>Any other solution would unbalance the class. faster mana regen? That's enchanter/bard territory. <P>Wizards were, for the most part, satisfied with their class in Kunark. Boss  mob hp's in Velious, however, were raised a LARGE amount. Wizards should be given a velious lure that's increased an equal percentage. <P>32,000 hp's in Kunark and Norrath for the average boss, to 200,000+ in Kunark, that's almost 8 times more hp's. Given Verant's conservative nature, they won't want to give wizards 8 times more dmg. Give them 5 times more damage on the lures, and make it boss mob only. <P>One spell, it's the most simple solution. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>As a post 50th Wizard, the only things I could suggest are such:<P>-- Introduce the Lure series at a lower level than 52nd.  I am an advocate of a spell series that will not be resisted, but cast at a higher mana cost than those given.  The reason being is not that Wizards are not resourceful with the spells that they do have, it is that they are often resisted at lower and mid to high levels too often.  Some steps were taken to help Wizards above the 34th mark I belive, but the "fix" only cured a symtom, not the disease.  Lure spells cured the disease, yet at what cost?  Requiring that we must be 52nd or above to be almost completely reliable.  Over the past two years it seems, the resists really were the bane of my existence.  I can not tell you how many times I would be meditating, to stand up while my group was fighting and fire off a nuke, and have it compeltely resisted, thus me not contributing anything to the battle at hand.<P>-- For a wizard, mana is our life blood, more so than any other class.  No defense, no melee, and hitpoints almost as sad and pathetic as an Enchanter (although they always seem to die faster, I wonder why).  Since we contribute nothing in the scheme of Player vs. Environment other than a mana-to-damage ratio (if you exclude the hand-me-downs the druids gave us in teleportation), I see no reason why Harvest should not be a level 1 spell.  The reson being is that the spell is easily scaleable to give us rougly 20% of our total mana pool back per cast (10 second delay, stun, 8 minute recycle).  This is hardly unbalancing.  I've played every class and taken note of how they contribute to a full group, and by a long shot Wizards add the least (this is a very vague general testament to their lack of group friendly contributions).  Therefore the other classes that have pets, heal, have damage shields, buffs, manastone effects, single target snares, really have no room to complain in the whole grand scheme of things.  The problem with the whole mana-to-damage ratio is that Wizards really do not do a good enough job of it.  Quite frankly we need larger mana pools than other classes to be effective.  However that is a little too big to ask.  Harvest is a good step in the right direction, but again its trying to solve the problem by addressing a symptom, and not the core of the issue, in that Wizards are far more dependent on that blue bar.  A set of fizzles followed by a full resists can potentially leave us drained and useless.  If we had some balanced way to accelerate the regeneration of our mana (manaskin and harvest are good at this, with the addition of bards and enchanters which yes I always group with - mind you that not every group of the day I can get an Enchanter or a Bard to group with - sometimes I am stuck with a Cleric and a few tanks only).<P>-- If your idea of "class balance" is to make each class as equally desireable as the other in a grouping situation, then Verant is far, far off the mark.  The problem with some classes, such as wizards, is that specialization breeds weakness.  Every "balanced" group starts with 2-3 tanks, and a cleric.  You simply have to have someone to deal/take the majority of the damage, while the cleric keeps them alive.  No other class can adequately substitute that at higher levels, period.  Clerics are by far and away the most desireably and solid class in the game.  They should be!  I mean honestly, they almost completely negate any downtime between pulls, and can restore weeks worth of experience within about 90-95% accuracy due to a train while you were zoning into a big nasty dungeon.  No other class can even come close to that with such ease.  Once you have you "uber class", followed by its two or three pets (tanks), you have two or three slots to fill in.  Currently my partners are three tanks (ranger to snare, warrior/paladin/sk to take damage, monk to pull), myself (wizard), enchanter, and a cleric (of course).  This works relatively well for our needs.  However, all in all I do not do near as much for the group as any of the other classes.  For every class in the game I can probably name two or three things they contribute more to the group than myself.  Most if not all other casting-classes have not only direct damage spells that rival (although do not equal) mine, and many other abilities that dwarf mine in the heat of battle.  If Verants scope is to balance classes in the eyes of grouping, as it seems to be centered around, then what can you do for me to make me a better grouping class?  For 44 levels, all I longed for was J-boots, so that I could kite.  Why?  Because there is one thing I could do better than most any other class... kite.  Solo.  Yep, thats how I got from 44+ thus far, by kiting.  Find a blue mob, Atols, run and nuke, and occasionally make sure Journeyman Effect was still on.  It was boring, I hated it, but it was what I was best at.  I went through two years of: Stand up, partial resist, sit down.  Stand up, full damage, sit down.  Stand up, full resist, sit down.  It does not take rocket science to show that there are other ways in which a wizard can be useful.  Unfortunately most of those ideas are bestowed upon other classes because of their adaptability and 'vague' spell lines.  Our specialization is our bane and weakness.<P>-- That is until it comes to uber mobs.  Certain uber mobs, pre Velious, around the 32k HP mark, are prime targets for cliques with heavy Wizards.  I organize and successfully pull off raids on dragons, and every time I want the most specialized classes for these operations.  Warriors, Wizards, and Clerics.  In this situation our specialization becomes our strength (notice Clerics are on both the list of specialized and well rounded).  Now this is one are I know we excell in, so I think that a lot of people who complain about wizards being unbalanced do not realize.<P>-- Quad-kiding is something I loathe.  I think its a complete waste of time.  However, I do not think it should be nerfed in any way.  No changes should be made to the line of spells that it encompases (snare, jboots, targeted aoe).  The reason being is that through my experience Quad-kiting requires WAY too much time and precision to master.  I would just as soon group in The Hole with a full 6 man party farming experience off elementals, or kedge, or karnors.  Experience in these zones is phenominal, and often overlooked because it is so freaking hard for wizards to find groups at times (roll up a wis casting class and do a /shout for a group, then roll up a int casting class and do the same /shout and see how long it takes on average to find a group for both sides).  Nevertheless, I do not do it, but I see no reason why when people find ways to take advantage of the skills they are given and master them, that they should be punished for 'thinking outside the box'.  Remember 200,000 heads think better than 20.  For the most part if you make a mob or a zone, someone somewhere will find a way to break or beat it (unless it literally were invincible due to offensive melee or spells or sheer amount of hp).  There have already been too many instances of this happening (using PB AoE spells to clear out entire zones of greens, using disfunctional programmers to code pathing and collision detection and blaming it on server load to prevent mobs getting stuck and killed, putting a soft cap on the level of mob spells land on), let this one slide and let your personal judgement remain that, personal.<P>Over all I think the Wizard class is pretty balanced.  I think when it comes to a class-to-class comparison, we come out in the better half.  I think the bell curve is gradually shifting towards an area that makes sense for a game with such a pathetic lack of customization (where is my warrior-wizard hybrid, or customizable graphics on my armor - and engine technology is no excuse, although lack of insight at the time can be).  On a group-desire comparison, Wizards and a handful of other classes fall way behind in terms of "who tho choose first for the kick-ball team", so to speak.  And I'm sorry to say to the wizards out there who have slaved almost two years like I have, unless the mob is uber, we suck.<P>Peace,<BR>Kryogen Katspaw<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some new Ideas and some "bumps" of old issues.<P>Pet spell sucks VERY much mana vise 700 mana x 3.5 (Highlvl wizard dam/mana on dd) = 2450<BR>Pet seem to hit for 50 ...2450/50= 49 which means that for it to be as effective as a dd pet should hit for about max damage min 49 times probably 30 times if you do the math with lure spells. Now the pet has 100 hp or so might be a little of so the chances that it beat itself to dead on a dam shield before is very big, or the chances that a mob AE spell kill it before or that a mob reposte or that the mob just aggro on it for one blow and kill it. now you can say "it is just an alternative damage source" but since the "pet" dies after first target dies we cant really use it is only really worth using on high HP targets, but these targets have often AEs or damshields, or just reposte. Bottom line is I think that we should be rewarded mana vise for taking a big chance that pet will get killed before doing any real damage. Possible solotions include more hp to pet I dont say alot just maybe about 500 hp, make pet stay after first target dies, reduce mana cost.<P>Disintegrate is a lvl 60 spell and all you can is kill "Green mobs" without getting to loot or get exp and with great money cost, why are you affraid we would get exp this way??? its lvl 60 you dont need exp at 60!. Solution Increase lvl cap alot, or make it as a regular kill (corpse stay and we can loot), I actualy dont care if we get exp. BTW I dont really want a pet that is for Magicians I JUST WANT TO NUKE EVEN BETTER =)<P>I think there is a problem for all casting classes and most of all for Wizards we can only do so much dam per/mana and with a finite mana gain we can in effect only do so much dam per/time (taken over longer time). To me this is bound to give problems since all tank classes get much better weapons every time there is an expansion (EG those incredibel Ykeskas isnt as increadibel anymore) but I still see lvl 59 Wizards using lvl 49 Ice Commet when forced to root nuke strategy. Solution for me this points in the direction that all classes will have to get some kind of equipment that can increase their dam/time as defined above, some classes get it automaticaly Cleric for example get better Heal ratios when Tanks get more HPs assuming the use of Complete Heal of course. Solution what about some Focus items for more dam or less resist or maybe Focus skill that can only be trained by special npcs that ask us to do a quest so to get more you need to do a quest (this will enable you to control our gain in dam....just have to ad a new quest when we are falling behind). Qell just an Idea. But think about it we dont get more dam/time sooner or later it will be obvious that we will need it I think as the problem is ever growing (if you continue to put in better melee stuff) and I belive there is a good chance of that =)<BR>Another solution I think could be really cool looking in game is Items that can summon Familars NOT pet in the sense of fighting for you but a Familar to help you focus your powers, easy to upgrade when needed just put in items that summons better Familars, I think it could be cool to summon some litte guy dancing around me to help me focus my powers NOT fight for me. (I want to be the one Nuking thats what wizards do) <P>Another problem I find is that I feel I get interrupted very easy could we get an increase in Channeling? this is for all casters, I think there is and problem since Hybrids for example get very high Channeling maybe as high as casters I dont really know but I know that in effect and SK regains consentration alot more than I due to the higher AC, lesser hits and there by easier test. I feel that regaining consentration should be something pure casters was best at.<P>Make Eye of Zoom not aggro mobs on caster (cant really use this spell as it is which is a same because it is a nice spell).<BR>Pet spell sucks die to fast and why even give us a pet<BR>AE spells on PVP servers HIT group members<BR>Cazic skin drop<BR>Kunark evac restrictions removed<BR>Magic based high dam dd at 60 or near<BR>Higher Meditation cap<BR>Make lures much more unresistable (after all we pay alot mana for them, I resisted 3 of them in one fight in Wizard BoB)<BR>Some kind of extra damage disipline/skill when used next 30 sec dds will do xx % more damage.<BR>Some kind of less resist disipline/skill when used next 30 sec dds will get less resisted.(read above text for full idea)<BR>Less pvp penalty on spells (SK HT, Necro drains have less %penalty why?)<BR>New self resist buffs at near 60 resist buffs are very low lvl.<P>Just my two copper Faikus Salian 59 Wizard MtS on RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Everytime i can ever think of a necro life tap<BR>spell works as good or better than my Lure spells. The difference is that while a necro has to pay a higher cost for his spell b/c he is getting Hps by casting it , I have to pay more mana for it b/c it will be hard to resist. So the necro gets his nearly unresistalbe spell basically at no extra cost to him at all. For some unknown reason you people decided that it would just be understood that a necro life tap should almsot never ever<BR>be resisted. I cannot understand why. Thus, in reality necros end up beging better nukers in a raid. Please either make life taps easier to resist, or cost more mana. Or make my lure spells have a lower casting time or lower casting cost. You could also just make them much harder to resist than a life tap. Please dont tell me that I am just confused and that lure spells are much harder to resist than life taps. Do some tests, you will see that its simply not true at all. I suggest trying it on some of those higer level cubes in skyshrine.

It's very discouraging to see "XXX's skin freezes over" for every cold dd we have (almost).  Same goes for "XXX combusts."  The enchanter's spell damage message changes every time they get a new dd, and wizards do one thing: DD!  Please change the text descriptions and make them good for each spell level.  It would make us wizards very happy and make us look real cool.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have a level 51 wizard that I quit playing and have set her aside as nothing more than a taxi.  I doubt Absor will read this far down but I will post what I've been experiencing over the past year and a half that prompted me to quit the wizard class.  I would have deleted her at level 20 when she became a weak useless character taking up space but I just wanted it to get better.  I thought it would.  I was wrong.  I've had so many disappointments with the character I cannot begin to name them all.<P>Armor - lack of hps.  Wizards cannot wear heavy or plate armor, this is true.  Particular types of metals are a problem with casting particular types of spells whereas the chemical imbalance could be deadly to the caster.  However, a wizard does not have the ability to escape an aggressor should it become needed because of several factors and I will list as I go.  Hit points are one of the factors.<P>Root spells - Root does not hold the aggressor in it's place for a wizard.  It does not matter her level, the root spell for that level is weaker than the casts she has to use to kill the aggressor.  One cast and the root spell is broken.  The wizard cannot escape except perhaps by luck because you cannot cast through the beating you get from the aggressor.  Other classes can.  I have several characters and none have the problem of casting that the wizard has.  <P>Gate - The cast time for gate is too long.  It is shorter than evac which is also too long.  If a wizard cannot cast to either root, or kill because of being beat on the cannot get away because gate takes too long to cast.  Armor will not hold the wizard due to it's lack of hps.  Unless a wizard has spent a fortune on SOW potions or has managed to buy the jboot quest from the Norrath Mafia, they have no way to escape a beating or even try to escape.  Just get a /loc and die so you can at least find your corpse.<P>Pets - Wizard is the only casting class without a pet.  Even druids can have a pet at level 55.  Wizards get something at level 59 but it is not a pet.  And what good does it do to get a spell pet at level 59 when 60 is the game cap?  It's worthless.  A pet, even a weak one, could buy time for a wizard to escape if needed, just like the other casting classes.<P>Enchanters and Bards -  I loves these classes and have no interest in knocking them down or seeing them nerfed.  I do want to make a point here though.  When searching for a group, group leaders will take an enchanter and a bard into their group with lots of mana to go around long before they will take a wizard.  Wizards run out of mana much to fast and have no way to recoup unless they beg for clarity from an enchanter.  Harvest spell was nothing more than a cruel joke.  Enchanters can do more damage than a wizard solely by the fact they can have a nice flow of mana.  Wizards spend most of their time sitting on their butts.  Why have a wizard in your group when you can have the others?<P>Mana - There just isn't enough of it for the spells a wizard needs to cast whether grouped or solo.  It takes my wizard up to 15 minutes to be at full mana from out of mana status, without clarity or a bard.  At the very most a wizard can kill 4 aggressors an hour.  How much xp is that?  If in a group they may get more kills but the xp is not much better even with the new changes.  They are great changes but is not a lot of help for wizards who rarely can find a group anyway.  You figure a couple minutes to kill the aggressor, if you can, 15 minutes to med and go find and kill another.  4 in an hour if you are lucky.  And I repeat, Harvest was a cruel joke.<P>Journeymans Boots - This is a great asset to the wizard.  It is a way to escape when all else fails.  My level 51 wizard still does not have any.  The quest mob must be camped by you 24/7 or you lose your spot.  I don't have that kind of time.  The one who is camping it is usually someone who does not need the boots but will "sell" the quest to you by means of multiquesting.  You cannot Quest in EverQuest because it has a mafia in existance that makes you buy the quest.  This has been known by Verant for as long as the Jboots quest was switched to the Ancient Cyclops from the dungeon it was in.  It has been and still as a major problem for those who are here to quest and not have to pay a high premium for an item they should be able to quest for.  Also note, at level 46 my wizard still could not kill the AC alone because of the already mentioned problems.<P>Social Skills -  Wizards can teleport.  Wizards have nothing to offer in exchange for a SOW or a Clarity.  Wizards have to pay if the others are not casting out of the kindness of their heart.  Wizards have no social skills to share in groups either, no shields to share, not even ultravision is a shareable spell.  Why would anyone want to group with a wizard when all the other classes have something to offer the group?<P>Grouping -  What's that?  I'm a wizard.<P>Monopolizing the Planes - I read this earlier here, someone suggested this.  I disagree for one reason.  Wizards have the monopoly on Plane of Hate.  Wizards cannot be invisible which has a small chance of helping, not a lot but a chance.  I have NEVER teleported to Hate Plane without being killed.  NEVER.  What's up with that?  My group is invised, most of them make it to Safe Spot but it is a given that the wizard will die and have to be drug and rezzed.  What fool thought up that one?  So, I will not teleport to Plane of Hate unless I am guaranteed someone is there to drag my sorry corpse to the Safe Spot and a high level cleric is there to rez me and get as much precious xp back as possible.  And then they want you to beam back down and get another group lol.  No, if that's how a monopoly will work, I'm not interested.  Let the druids have it, they have everything else.<P>So, whatever made you think wizards might be unbalanced?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizard runes & research (only) spells...<P>Can the drop-rate of runes, and the mobs that drop them, be re-examined? I've used level 34 as an example here, but the same argument applies to any level with research-only spells:<P>Why does a rune required for a level 34 spell have to drop off a similar level mob? If wizards are grouping in areas appropriate to their level pre-34, they will usually not see a single rune required for the level 34 spells. This means they probably won't actually get the required runes until, say, level 36 or 37... which is why I believe this is a balance issue (shouldn't wizards at least have a reasonable chance of getting their spells at the due level, much like other classes expect a discipline to just 'appear'?).<P>And of course, once these apparently rare runes are obtained, there's a good chance of destroying them unless one's research skill is high enough. And how do we do this? By creating practise runes? Well we would, if all the components for practise runes actually dropped... which of course they don't (surely you haven't forgotten this, Verant?)... Yes, we can (and do) buy skill points from our trainer, which is great if you have the money, and enough spare points to keep the research skill maxed.<P>Remember... I'm talking about *research-only* spells, that are essential to a wizard at the appropriate level from a balance point of view. At least give us a fair chance of getting them!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>*A bazillion hit points: <BR>*There is a third idea that I have, but I can't *tell you about because it is based on things *that you folks don't get to know (sorry). But it *is not too far from the percentage damage idea *anyhow.<P>If something is done at all its always the "secret" fix. And as no one know what it is its too late when we discover it did not fix the problem at all.<BR>I hope you take into your calculations that wizards are a 100% manadependant class. We have no form of secondary/passive damage output like pet classes have, and tank classes are as their damage is free. And still their spells are nearly as effective as ours, and the differance in damage is silly. If i do 40 more damage agasint 1million hitpoint mob it dont matter when petcasters pet have already done half of the tanks damage in addition. We need more effective spells to be of use at all, drasticaly more effective, or invent a way for us to do passive damage like other classes can do to help them during downtime. And not a solution that will make us step on other classes toes by getting damageshields pets or such.<P>*Regardless, this is the main concern that I have *about balancing the wizard class. And it will *probably remain at the top of the wizard list.<P>I hope you can solve it because its getting all my wizard friends to either quit game or create a tank.<P><BR>*Specific Spells:<P>*+ Al'Kabor line of spells: The consensus is that *this spell line is far less useful than the *parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells. It seems *that the benefit if a larger area of affect and *a single extra target is not worthy of the *increased mana cost. Frankly, it seems that *there are no wizards casting this spell in *Norrath. Heck if I know how to fix these. I'm *against any call to simply remove the spell, *that does little to actually help anything. *Increasing its radius could be very messy. *Adding more targets might be the best solution.<P>Alkabor wont be helped by more targets. Nor with a larger radius. A large radius means we are at risk of killing ourselves with it and due to the INSANE manacost towards damage done it will need reduced manacost in addition to more targets. And if its not a significant increase in targets or significant decrease in manacost it will still not be usefull.<P>*+ Flaming Sword of Xuzl: Again, I'm against just *eliminating what is already there (keep in mind *that ideas like 'take away this spell and give *us this one instead' don't really work well). *Though I also agree with many of you that *wizards shouldn't have pets. I do like the idea *of allowing this thing to work sort of more like *a DoT (as with the clerical hammer spell). *Making it immune to spells and riposte might *work to make this spell more useful. In any *case, it should be looked at.<P>Non-flaming sword of sux0r more looks like a bone throwed to wizards with the release of kunark. It totaly misses its mark though. The fact that it suicies after a mob is dead, and that it dies first riposte or area spell that hits it, makes more like a crappy DOT. But it costs a HUUUGE amount of mana, even more than the clerics version of this spell, its not worth it at all to cast this pet that will die almost instantly and if yer lucky and it dont die it will do 200 damage total over the course of a _long_ fight, which makes it much more usefull to cast a drought because the spell costs so much.<P>The spell needs a revamp towards manacost on the side of making it invuln to riposte and aoes. Atleast make it cost like the cleric variant wich wont still make it usefull.<P>*+ Harvest: The feeling is that this spell *doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50. *Some want to see this spell recast faster, and *I'll suggest it. But keep in mind that this is, *essentially, increasing the wizards mana pool, *which is an idea that I am against in general.<P>We have to sacrifice a spellslot permanently for this spell. After level 50 it gives a meager at best mana back as it seems capped. about half a bub every 10 minutes. While chanters draw over a full bub from mobs at will. So how is it unbalancing to give wizards a more potent version of harvest at higher levels where our manadependency are getting us excluded from groups and raids? Even upping harvest a great lot would not increase our efficiency noticiably. <P>Our manaskin costs a peridot and gives us 1 point mana regen. Druids wolf form gives them 2 respectively 3 points of manaregen for free post 50. Our EPIC item is hell to get and gives us 3 points manaregen and druids get protection of the grove as nomral spell which gives 6 poitns of manaregen! Thats double our epic! and overwrites the epic spell also. How is this balanced?<P>*+ Rain Spells: I agree that we should think *about taking pets out of the equation. I'm not *convinced that more needs to be done than that. *We also might need to look at the resist rates *on these spells (in conjunction with everything *else). But I was thinking that we should *consider increasing the over-all number of waves *a bit (I mean, really, like by 1) but leaving *pets in the formula. This would increase the *relative power of wizards. But that also may not *be the best thing to do (since there are people *that play magicians too). In general, this *series should be looked at.<P>Read grimstaffs posts on rainspells he has it all written down perfectly.<P><BR>*- Okiels Radiation and the other one: Sure, not *the greatest spells. But I can't imagine *suggesting that they be made better. So let's *just leave them as they are.<P>They gave us a VELIOUS spell thats an upgrade to okiels and costs MORE mana than any other damage shield. The manacost makes it useless even as fire resist spell.<P>*+ Atol's Apectral Shackles: As a level 51 spell, *it fizzles too much, reportedly more than Fetter *a level 58 spell. I agree that we should review *the whole thing with high fizzle rate spells.<P>Yes fizzle reates need to be looked at. Seems to be the alteration lines in perticular.<P>*? Snare/Enstill: It sure does seem odd to *suddenly get a group snare Tell me, would you *rather have a group or a single target snare in *that spell slot?<P>We get first snare spell at lvl 29, bonds of force and its area effect. It was inserted as a compensation for on of the wizard power nerfs around release of EQ along with sight spells. Then at level 51 we get second snare spell, atols shackles and it fizzles too much. Both have limited utility as they have only 2 minutes lasting and Costs all your mana. <P>*+ Invisibility to Undead: I, honestly, don't *know why wizards have this spell. I want to find *out why.<P>Yes this seems like one of those "ops im out of ideas lets just throw them a bone" spells. <P>*Teleport Spells:<P>*+ West Karana: Move this portal to the other *side of the zone. This has all of the technical *nightmares that I pointed out before (complete *rebuilding of the zone and time to download it). *But heck, it's on the list.<P>It is only a 30 secs run between north karana gate and west karana gate. That is a problem. West karana needs to be moved closer to qhills.<P>*+ Cazil Thule Gate: Mana of you think this is in *too dangerous of a location. I'm not sure that *there really should be any promise that the *place you end up in should be safe. Use this *spell when you know you're gonna die, and any *destination is better than where you are. But I *also see your point.<P>Death trap. Yes but how can you explain that all of druids gates and evac points are 100% safe, even the skyfire one? <P>*+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder: These spells have *problems going vertically. I'm not sure that *this can be fixed, but if it can, it should be.<P>They DID work vertically, and did it perfectly in late beta and around release. But people used them to teleport to locations they should not be at so the vertical check was removed, crippling the spell. The possiblility to get to the unallowed locations have been fixed now over the time that has passed. But spell still dont check verticaly.<BR>This spell is useless though even if it works vertically, because Mobs are fast and they will be beating at you again before you even get a chance to find out where the spell sent you. <P>Some suggestions to fix this: Make the spell directional only, that is it will teleport you a set amount of feet in the direction you face, and make it check vertically again. ALSO make it clear agro some to make it a personal escape spell not a personal suicide spell.<P>*+ Evacs: I agree that it would be nice if Evacs *would take link-dead characters. I have no idea *if this is possible, but I can certainly ask.<P>Would be nice but personaly i doubt this will be possible.<P>*+ Evacs and Abscond: I will check into the whole *thing about these spells clearing or not *clearing aggro lists.<P>I have made a lot of tests with evacuate in guild groups and came to a conclusion that it do not clear agro, but spell is trying to. Let me explain.<BR> <BR>As a normal exp group you slow dot snare root mez debuff ETC mobs in combat. If it gets too much and you evacuate the dots debufs snares rots slows etc will still be active on the mobs, so the evacuate spell clears agro at the time of gate but all mobs regain agro from the active spells at them and starts charging towards the new position of the party, spreading its hatelist to mobs during the way there bringing everything in a hellish train that kills everyone in the way including the evacuated party. Suicide.<BR> <BR>In some zones the evac spot might be out of range of the mobs but they still have the agro and they wont charge at the party untill we walk into range again where we get a train out of nowhere. So in some zones it seems that agro was cleared when infact it was not and will get people killed as soon as the agro list has spread in range of the party.<BR> <BR>During both theese scenarios mobs that can summon will keep summoning one after another of the party and kill them. Meaning we have a corpse retrival nightmare because we have half a party now and not power enough to fight to that spot again to get the corpses.<BR> <BR>So what is the conclution? The spell is useless for aything but travel because there is no group that dispells mobs before they dare evac. All groups WILL slow dot root snare debuff ETC as that is part of day to day fighting and especialy if tis starting to go bad than those spells will be cast to save lives. This is why mentioning having evacuate memmed will get you a /disband.<BR> <BR>Please fix evacuate. I dont know how to get past this latent agro active spells cause but its destroying the purpose of the evacuate/abscond/succor/egress line  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> Especialy when we pay a mana drain from caster and all group members  to get an agro wipe wich means we are defence less with no mana when we get trained at "safe spot".<BR> <P><BR>*+ Abscond: This is another spell that fizzles *too frequently.<P>It sure does.<P>*Items:<P>*- The Plane of Growth robe: Honestly, I'm fine *with longer casting times on free direct damage *spells. Even more so if it's a Lure.<P>No comment on this one. But personaly i think the VP staff one should be the better as it is now. PoG is candyland. So i dont have any issues with the casting time. Although it makes the robe useless as the caster is stuck in cast loop for 30 sec. make it 23 sec around instead.<P>*+ Epic Quest: I'll ask them to review the Cazic *skin and the whole difficulty of this quest. But *keep in mind that I am in favor of these quests *being very hard.<P>The quest is a huge lottery and an epic camp. I am one of the few lucky ones to have finished my Staff of Four and even that brings up some issues.<P>The staff of Four has less total resists than all other epics. All others have same number if you add all resists together but wiz epic got 10 less than that sum. What is up with the Dex on it also?<P>And finaly the effect.... It gives an upgraded version of our manaskin spell wich cost no reagent. That is nice. But the manaregen on it is 3 points, and was said to be that to not be unbalancing. Then tell me how can a mega hard to get item with 3 points regen be unbalancing when druids get a spell called protection of the grove that gives 6 points manaregen and overwrites our epic spell? Thats sad. Please atleast double the manaregen on the epic and fix th stacking problem. 3 a tic is sad. a tic is 6 seconds so at lvl 60 when you get this item its not even noticed.<P>*+ Concussion spell scroll: This is believed to *be too hard to obtain. But, consider that this *is a great spell, and having to earn it is a *good thing to me. The question is, is it too *hard to get.<P>The spell is less potent than ranger jolt, so to say its exeptionaly powerfull is not correct.<P>*New Spell Ideas:<P>*"BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <BR>*Ok, wizards know stuff and we travel. How about *a defensive self-only "Blink" spell that *predicts the future (of the combat we're in) and *procs a shadowstep when the wizard's about to *get hit? I'm not sayin it should work *flawlessly, but that kind of spell seems to hit *2 of our supposed class-specific strengths<BR>*knowledge of the attack coming, and *transportation away from the attack) and helps *us be a bit less of a liability in groups. Maybe *at high levels it could even have mild hate *reduction a-la Concussion. Hell, gimme a whole *blink line of defensive spells of varying proc *frequency and effectiveness. <BR>*This might also address the fact that we got no *hp/ac and no pet to help with our defense."<P>This idea is great if only it cleared agro and made us not teleport into a pile of other mobs. Also will interupt our casting. but a nice idea if implemented right.<P>Well more to come from me also.<P>Take care Alan and my fellow wizards!<P>Sorasil Lorewind<BR>60 Sorcerer of Paradigm<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>   I have to say that I think that the soloing abilities of wizards are not what they should be compared to other pet bearing intelingence casters.<P>   I have watched enchanters and mages and necro's <BR>at lower levels than myself all take down MoBs that I would not even dare to touch.  For example in Everfrost I watched a lvl 8 necro easily taking down orcs and snow leopards that would still kill me at least 50% of the time at lvl 12.  <P>   Ok sure I am not the best wizard in Norrath and my charcter stats are not the best they could be, but I would think that 4 lvls would at least make up for that on the same MoB.  I think that some small changes need to be made with our casting times and DD output.  Nothing that would make us superior to other classes but at least let us be able to solo the same lvl MoBs as others.<P>    I keep talking about solo because the others are right: no one seems to want a wizard in their group because we can't buff, heal, or melee.  We can turn out a darn respectable amount of damage but only for a very short period of time.  <P>    After we are Oom, assuming we lived long enough to get to that point, all we can do is sit on the ground medding, which is useless to the group.  As for our pet bearing counterparts they can med while their pet is at least doing melee damage to the MoB.  This I believe actually makes the encounters end faster due to more constant damage being done to the MoB which in the end saves everyone Hp.  <P>    There needs to be changes made to make our spells close the gap between pet and no pet, or maybe better melee ability, or more hp, or something.<P>     All I know for sure is that I am dissapointed with the way the game has gone for me because I have been playing since August of 2000 and I am only lvl 15.  Since I started I have gotten many of my friends into the game and they have all passed me up.  Some of them within a month or two.<P>     I feel that at least some of this is due to the shortcomings of the wizard class.  Don't get me wrong though.  I love the game and I do actually like playing a wiz, quite a bit actually.<P>     I am just exited that something is being done about the wizard class and had to put my two cents worth in. <P>     Also in afterthought the O'Kiels line of spells is ok with me exept for the duration. Like the fact that O'Kiels radiation should last longer than precisely 26 seconds.  With that kind of duration it is not even worth casting on anyone.  As for the AoE spells I don't even use them; I die enough without committing suicide.<P>15 wiz<BR>Sonaldor<BR>Morel-Thule<P><BR>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> BTW, thanks for group-friendly Translocate.  Just got this spell yesterday and now -- for the first time in my 52 levels of being a wizard -- I felt what it was like to *really* be wanted in a group for my class alone.  Tanks were just giddy about being able to be sent back to their bind point in some comfy town from deep in some perilous dungeon.  This is a truly nice grouping spell.  It is to wizards what CoH is to Mages or Summon Corpse is to Necros.  A spell that provides a valuable and unique service for their fellow adventurers. Cheers!<P>Now please don't nerf the ability to quad kite.  And please fix the al'khabor line into something useful.

</FONT><HR>Bottom Line for Class Balance:<P>I have a lvl 57 wizard.  No other class casts such mana hogging spells at a more frequent pace.  Consider: cast 2-3 of your best spells per pull in a group.  At lvl 57, mana cost is about 215 mana per cast or 645 mana per pull.  Consider a rapidly paced group and perhaps a mana pool of around 2600.  It won't last very long, 4 pulls and that wizard has a down time of approx 13 min.<P>We need BIGGER MANA POOLS (different mana formula) and FASTER MANA RECOVERY.<P>Just tonight I was in a group with 2 lvl 60 wizards, myself (lvl 57), 2 druids, and a bard.  Another group was comprised of all melee types and a cleric.  We wanted the kill and tried very hard.  We'd med to full mana and as soon as the mob was pulled we blasted as fast as we could nonstop until the mob was dead.  Guess how many kills we got (about 30 pulls).  None.  Not a single kill.  I was the lowest level guy in the group at level 57.  That is deplorable for a class that is supposed to be masters of damage.<P>Melee types are getting better and better weapons and gear where wizards are getting bones thrown at them.  Prior to some dragon raids, after getting fully buffed up we compared resistances.  Guess what?  With some of the best resistance gear available to me in the game, and after receiving equal resistance buffs as the melees, I had the lowest BY FAR resistance totals across the board.   Is this correct?  Are the Melee classes allocated such far superior resistance gear by design?  This seems so off balance it's not funny.  I'd think that magical damage dealers would have some of the best magical resistance gear avaliable in the game.<P>And lastly, melee types are becomming sooo powerful in comparison to us wizards it's so laughable.  I've seen melees do quad damage per round hitting at over 130 dmg per hit (that's over 520 dmg PER ROUND).   How do we compare?  Where is our damage?  <P>Bottom line:<P>1. Bigger Mana pool<BR>2. Faster mana regen<BR>3. Better resistance gear<BR>4. Better overall gear<P>Given the first two our damage output will increase and begin to move us along the lines of being balanced.  1 without 2 would be senseless; downtime would simply increase.  +mana gear is nice but without the faster regen it really does nothing but increase our downtime.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please read this post carefuly.  <P>It is not long as I only have one point but it is important to me.<P>The spell Enstill is not an upgrade to the spell root.  It is a useful spell, but it does not replace root.  I usually have root memorized most of the time, not enstill.  The benefits to enstill are that is lasts longer and initially is harder to resist.  However it seems that the secondary resists are still high.  High to the point that they tend to negate the positive effect of holding longer should this spell be used in a combat situation.  The biggest problem with enstill is that it takes longer to cast.  This is a typical patern with most spell upgrades.  But it perticuarily negates the effectiveness of enstill.  It is important that the spell is castable during the closeing time of a monster and you.  That is, when you enstill breaks you must be close enough to be in range for the spell, but far enough so that the monster cannot reach you before the spell is finished casting.  For this reason I use root.  To solve this problem and make enstill a true uprgade (that which i believe it was intended) you must either reduce the casting time equal to root or increase the range of the spell.  Reducing the resist chance would be nice, but would still not make it a true upgrade.<P>thank you <P>Sir Venture</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heya, <BR>well I can appreciate how painful it is reading all these replies so I will keep it as simple and short as possible.<P>Unlike many wizzies I am overall quite happy with out class, sure we have some problem spells (things like the uselessness of the alkabor line come to mind) but I wont go through them all in detail here. I will write them up in a separate post at a later date. The reason for this is I want to focus on the key problem that faces the high level wizard, a problem that is so severe that it is hindering many top level wizards already. This problem is that of damage dealing.<P>As stated on a number of occasions the wizards primary role is to deal damage. Well up until SoV this was definately the case, in fact prior to SoV I have few complaints about wizards in general but with SoV has come a new hit point cap for Uber mobs and it is THAT which has destroyed the role wizards used to play. Let me give you some specific examples.<P>Lets create an *IDEAL* wizard. He is level 60 with the best items for a wizard in game, assuming the VP robe (manaless rend) and the VP staff's (manaless lure) as part of his equipment.<BR>Now lets take a reasonable to good rogue or monk. Assume they have their epic (any decent 55+ rogue or monk does on my server which is MM). Now lets take a few example SoV uber mobs. I can speak from experience with Velketor, King Tormax, Dain IV and yelinak. Each of these mobs has WELL in excess of 100k hit points, my personal guess is more in the vicinity of 230k. On a NUMBER of raids we have had the rogues and the monks parsing themselves and we find that they can EASILY be doing around 30k+ or more. The problem is this.<P>In the identical situation the wizard (who lets remember is limited to one role and one role only on a raid like this ... damage) can deal out at BEST about 15k. Thats assuming no resists all the lures working and using constant manaless lure / nuke items and clarity and mana rods. Does that sound like its balanced? I think not. This problem is not just the comparison to rogues, wizards will lose this comparison to monks and to warriors. Put simply the uber mobs in SoV have too many hits for a wizard to be effective. Sure we can contribute *SOME* damage to the mob, but at what cost? We cant take any damage, and we are unable to offer anything else to the raid. All in all the primary role of a wizard has vanished in SoV. <BR>You may well argue that this is fine as wizards are otherwise a generally good class (something that I am sure many of my fellow wizzies will dispute) so whats the difference if they are useless in SoV epic encounters? Well I can assure you at the 60 level, the game is ALL about epic encounters and so called uber mobs. There is little other reason to play except for the friendship and fun ... and there is little fun to be had as it currently stands for a wizard in an epic encounter.<P>I would like to offer some kind of a way to balance this but I dont see a simple solution. In my opinion it would either require a class wide nerf to the melee's, or a reduction of the hits on the SoV uber mobs, neither of which I see as likely to happen. Perhaps the best possible solution I have heard suggested to date is where we get a line of spells that do a percentage of the mobs damage for SoV only mobs or something. In any case thats the one MAJOR area I see wizzies as needing to be balanced.<P>Mordo<BR>58 Wizard - Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are a good class, but have some problems.<P>  You already mentioned the Yonder height problems, but you should add bonds of force to that as it has the same restriction.<P>  Mana regeneration.  This needs to be looked at.  At the moment the wizards only really have harvest to help them and this, especially post 50, is not enough.  I would suggest a harvest II.  The upgrade to harvest would give more mana back for the same governing rules as the original but it would also be group, this would help make wizards much more attractive in groups.<P>  Spells.  At the moment spell drops are crazy for wizards.  I know level 60 wizards that are part of excellent guilds that still do not have all of the Kunark spells, never mind the Velious ones.  Since all pure casters are defined by the spells they have the spells should be easier to come by.<P>  Dragon Form Spells.  These spells would shapechange the wizard to a drake form.  Ideally a wizard that was shapechanged could either cast their spells of a matching type, i.e. red form and fire spells, much more efficiently, or else they would gain a free DD every ten minutes or so.  Of the two ideas, the more efficient casting would probably be the most balanced option.  Wizards would also gain a near immunity to attack from magic that is related to the form they are in, again, if in red form, fire would not harm you.  Personally, i would like a mana regeneration bonus added to the spell line, but that would be secondary as far as i was concernred.  The spells would be something that would help bring back glamour to the wizard class.<P>  Resists And Master/Quester Of Knowledge.  At the moment wizards have lots of problems with resists.  What with the difficulty in landing spells on high "red" cons to having ice comets "resisted" almost totally, thus doing 20 points of damage instead of 1120.  My idea of dealing with this issue and also giving wizards a better chance of doing "appreciable" damage against the new "epic" mobs.  The spells are:<P>Minor Know Opponent.<BR>-Level 39.  Costs 100 mana to cast.  Casting time 5 seconds.  This spell gives the wizard knowledge of the target they are fighting.  Every spell after this one has been cast will land for at least 50% damage since the wizard now understands some of the strengths and weaknesses of what he is fighting.<P>Lesser Know Opponent.<BR>-Level 49.  Costs 200 mana to cast.  Casting time 10 seconds.  This spell gives the wizard knowledge of the target they are fighting.  Every spell after this one has been cast will land for at least 75% damage since the wizard now understands most of the strengths and weaknesses of what he is fighting.<P>Know Opponent.<BR>-Level 60.  Costs 300 mana to cast.  Casting time 15 seconds.  This spell gives the wizard knowledge of the target they are fighting.  Every spell after this one has been cast will land for at least 95% damage since the wizard know understands almost all of the strengths and weaknesses of what he is fighting.<P>  These spells would allow wizards to spend the early part of difficult fights "learning" about their opponents before casting to greater effect.  It would, i think, be something we in line with the class and no way imbalancing.<P>  Equipment.  There should be more equipment tailored for the casting classes.  Wizards in particular.  Why are wizard items so poor?  We haven't any major mana regeneration items apart from the manarobe but that is for a very limited number of people.  There are no "big" attack spells on items for us and yet our spells have found their way onto other classes equipment, why?  Why is it on theirs and not our own?  Yes, we can cast the spell ourselves, but having it as a right-clickable item would be very helpful and even life-saving at times.  In general we need more caster items and wizard specific ones in particular.<P>  Gates/Portals.  Why are wizards always given dangerous or near suicide portals?  We have three.  Cazic, Sky Fire and the one in Velious, who's name escapes me at the moment.  Casic, not very nice, but you can live with it.  Sky Fire, this is an evac, yet it drops you in a location that is most like going to be more dangerous than the one you just left.  Sorry, but an evac should be to a safe area, not to a near death trap.  Velious portal, with it's own dragon.  What?  What is the reasoning behind that?  If wizards had a dragon form line of spells and they became amiable to the dragon when in dragon form, that would be different, but we don't, so at the moment it is, in its own way, worse than sky fire, something i didn't think i would ever say.<P>  My last suggestion involves the mage class as well, maybe.  At the moment everyone monster and it's auntie can summon you in the high end game.  Not only is this a bit strange, being summoned by a rat!  But there are also monsters that gate and then summon the players to them to be killed one by one.  My idea is twofold.  One.  A mage can now summon an opponent to them if they have them targetted.  That way they can summon the monster back to the party if it gates away from them in mid fight.  Two.  To stop the monster gating in the first place, wizards are given a spell that can stop a monster for gating for several minutes.  Monsters have had their fun summoning players to their deaths, it is time to give them a taste of their own medicine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Are you willing to only make these changes to the NPC's and not consider making balancing changes to players? Did you not consider what adding 300,000 HP to a mob might do to certian classes?

</FONT><HR>I feel sorry for the wizzies too.  A class totally based on magical damage gets screwed in two ways by velious:<P>-High resist mobs<BR>-Insane HP mobs<P>A wizard left to lure during high level encounters does 1/5th the damage of even a lowly hybrid.  A % damage spell is incredibly vital to all nuke-oriented classes (mages and druids to some extent considered too), although wizards should be specialists of it.  Give them lure-esque percent-damage spells 55+ (maybe one of each of fire, cold, and magic) with better mana efficiency.<P>Otherwise the game will continue to be melee/healer vs. mobs, with wizzies just tagging along because they have to port the important people out there.<P>-Semi useless 57 shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Re the question mark on enstil/snare.<P>Enstill at level 20 is a non-upgrade to root which it is supposed to upgrade. Everyone still uses root. It is in a perfect position, both because it`s at the right kind of level, and its a useless spell, to replace with snare.<P>The reason to do this is to provide an interim spell to the group snare we get out of the blue at 29 (bonds of force).<P>Also snare would be a very useful addition to what a wizard has at 20, complementing both root and the stun line. In addition its a great defensive measure to allow us to run away, and contribute nicely in a group so the monster can`t run away so fast.<P>Before you holler that root stops em running, it also makes them turn around and fight again.<P>Hope you read this far, as replacing enstill with snare is perhaps the only and best significant thing you can feasably do to balance the pre-50 wiz. It`s certainly in character for the wizard, and we may even be able to cast the odd alkabor if we can snare the odd survivor <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>couple of points.<P><BR>there is a HUGE problem with evacuate and abscond. They don't clear agro!!!!  The purpose of the spell is to escape bad situations (evac) without having the downside of traveling back to your zone (this balanced by the fact its a lvl 58 spell). The problem is that if you use this spell all you end up doing is either creating huge trains or getting summoned back to your fighting spot. Since this spell doesn't clear agro it is completely unusable for its intended purpose. It already caries significant drawbacks which keep it in check, it can leave ppl behind like every evac, and it sucks LOTS of mana from each caster (over 400). It really needs to clear agro!<P>I can think of several reasons that wizards should get itu, weather any of them are what verant designers where thinking of i'm not sure. <P>First of all is our minor in divination spells. We get more spells dealing with sight then any other class (most of them useless due to the) and since itu is a spell dealing with sight (or restricting sight) it fits with the class. Personally i think wizards should get blind as well thats another thread.<P>Secondly wizards are the "master seakers of knowledge" and yet this abilty is not really reflected in the class. Wizards are certainly not the best equiped class to seak out knowledge. I know if i was a wizard and frequently seeking knowledge in far away and dangerous places (some undead places) i would develope an itu spell that would help me with it. Personally i think wizards should have a spell version of sneak/hide but once again thats a topic for another thread.<P>Lastly lets compare the casters for a second. We've got the mag on one end who is totally focused on offence and damage and oposite them are the enchanters who are totally focused on defence and utility. In between we have the necromancer and the wizard. Now these two classes are very similar, they both are focused on damage with a good chunk of utility and defence thrown in. They even have many similar abilites (snare, dd, shiedskin, very minor debuff). However they are also oposites in many ways, wizards are best fast damage while necromancers best slow damage (dots, pet), wizards with group defence (evac) necro with more personal defence (FD). <P>Now the necro gets self invis and regular itu so it would follow that wizards get self itu and regular invis; which they do. Really makes it very nice and symetrical.<P>Mysthyl<P>P.S. Druids are jacks of all trades masters of none with good but not the best: dds, dots, healing, buffing, and GATES. Wizards are the masters of Portals!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>--- POG Robe ---<P>SUMMARY:<P>Standing in melee range of a mob that requires Lure for 30 seconds is pretty suicidal.<P>DETAIL:<P>The PoG robe really is useless I'm afraid. A 30 second cast time means standing there taking a mobs aoe for too long and frankly the lure only does 300 odd damage so no one 52+ is really going to want to use it when the 52+ ones do over 600.<P>If you look at the necro robe (casts summon corpse) and the cleric one (cast a heal) they are both infinitely more useful even if the necro one is situational (summon corpse uses a whole heap of mana). I wouldn't mind it being situational, but right now no sane wizard would use it.<P>The enchanter one isn't much cop either. It is a rune spell that uses a peridot. However by the time they get this robe, they will have the higher level rune that also uses a peridot and also gives 200hp more protection. The mana free cast doesn't make it worth it...<P>Not sure what I'd want on the robe instead, but if its a dd it really does need to cast faster. Especially if its a lure. Is there anyway to put recycle time on an item? If so you could drop the cast time on the lure, but make it slow recycle. That should solve balancing?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
