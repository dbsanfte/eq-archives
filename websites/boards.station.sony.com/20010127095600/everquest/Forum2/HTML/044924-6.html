&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Let me preface this by saying that my family and I have been playing EQ for almost two years now.  My son, two daughters, and myself all play on a regular basis.  We have two accounts with characters ranging from level 54 down. All on the Tallon Zek server. Never before has any game held our attentions as long as this one, and I want to commend Verant for creating a truly historical game. (and yes, there is a wife. But if we let her play it cuts into our time and all she does is take screenshots of the sunsets anyway!)<BR>I admit I don't read the boards very often and I may have missed a very obvious point.<BR>But, in regards to downtime being used as a penalty:<BR>Recently there seems to be a very interesting conversation going on, on this subject.  This has prompted me to make my first post.  Now comes the dumb question.<BR>Why does my body have to stay where it is, when I die, with all my equipment on it?<BR>This creates the infamous corpse recovery.  Which, in my opinion, creates a major amount of downtime in the game.  And does not make much logical sense.  Granted we play in a world where no one ever really dies, which is magical in itself.  Not that this should seem anything but normal to the citizens of Norrath.  So perhaps we can ponder this truly naive question.<P>Why can't my body spawn at its bind point with all my equipment still on?  This idea seems so incredibly simple that I realize it must be basically flawed.  One of the major objections would be the lack of a corpse available for resurrection.  In that case, I propose, leave a naked corpse where I died that will decay in three hours.  Since this is the length of time I have available for a resurrection anyway.  If something must be left on its so it does not vanish. Perhaps a stylish toe tag. :-)<BR>I realize the risk of losing your equipment was an intended factor.  But let's be honest.  99.9 percent of the time that won't happen.  I've never felt that this was a risk. The only time that this actually becomes a factor, is on a plane raid.  In which a player, thru no-fault of his own, can not back to his corpse. These are the only times i have seen this happen.<P>This simple idea would eliminate a major amount to downtime.  And, eliminate a lot of problems.<P>Let's look at it this way.  Getting prepared and grouped to go adventuring is like paying your dues for the reward you hope to gain at the end of your journey.  There's plenty of downtime just in that.  Although the anticipation and socializing involved makes that pleasant.  As to Risk vs. Reward.  I still have the possibility of dying and losing experience and gaining no reward.  That's plenty of risk.  I then have the option of taking the penalty of experience loss, or seeking the aid of a cleric to gain back some of my loss.<BR>On a corpse recovery.  I have the possibility of dying and losing experience on the way to my body.  That is a very unbalanced risk vs. reward.  And has happened to me too many times.  :-(<P>Being that I play on the Tallon Zek server, this would also address a lot of the issues we have in PVP.  Again. dieng on a corpse recovery in PVP, I don't believe, was an intended penalty.  But it happens.  And the issue of major raids, where the corpses of the vanquished enemy, create a state of paranoia in anticipation of their return.<BR>Imagine the satisfaction of invading an area and defeating an enemy, and watching their bodys vanish after looting their cash, or after three minutes, whichever comes first. Never again what I hear the shout of "CR" and listen to a poor soul suffer the humiliation and beratement sure to follow.<P>Loot and Scoot would vanish..!  thank the Gods!<P>So I ask, why is the corpse recovery necessary?  EQ has afforded me and my family thousands of hours of enjoyment.  None of which, were on corpse recovery!  This is downtime I can do without.<P>Thanks for listening...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow 400 posts on how EQ sucks. This completely backs up my point about how subscription numbers do not equal game success. Of course Brad refuted that in his reply because everything goes in one ear and out the other. <P>Brad EQ is not successfull, EQ is a tremendous dissapointment. It is only successfull on a financial level. THAT IS ALL. EQ's engine and UI is great but you have COMPLETELY DESTROYED it by throwing the game COMPLETELY OUT OF BALANCE all while claiming that it is perfectly balanced. Brad if you will take of your sunglasses you will see that it is nighttime outside and not daytime. I have great revolutionary ideas on how to make this game better (as do we all) but I know that they are not within the scope of what will be allowed by Verant due to their fictional and everchanging "vision" EXCUSE. Ive played this game for so long now, since day 1, and my realization of how bad this game is is increasing exponentially every day. <P>These boards are just like EQ, you camp the threads hoping for the rare pop of a blue name and then you are dissapointed by the loot (err response) you get. EQ is the biggest scam that has ever been perpetrated against me. Verants stonewalling ability is on par with the government. EQ's biggest failure is it's total lack of an ongoing and immersive story. They say there is one there BUT THERE ISN'T. EQ's second biggest problem is that Verant views its customers as simple numbers and not people. <P>My RL personal time is very very important and I have played this game for nearly 70 days played, NOT NOT NOT because it is such a successfull game but because I hoped my chartacter and the game would evolve (err be tuned) and become better but instead I have become exponentially weaker vs environment and EQ has been tuned to only be potentially good if you have the perfect group, if not then too bad for you. That's right I kept playing because I hoped it would get better but instead it got worse. Face that fact Brad.<P>Verant cannot let go of their fun-destroying ideas in this game and we all suffer for it. Think about it, the rewards in this game are so INSANELY out of tune with what they should be that it isn't even funny. I will not give an example because everyone can think of a lot of examples on their own. It is this MASSIVE SEPERATION between how Verant thinks we should actually LIVE in EQ ALL OUR REAL LIFE, versus the fact that EQ is really just a game, that makes this entire situation ludicrous. I am really really tired of stonewalling from Verant. There is no need for me to give them my ideas for free. The problems have been BLATENTLY obvious from the begining. In fact the very idea that Brad would create this thread asking what we think 2 years into this is insulting because IT'S ALL BEEN POSTED 10000 times before but was ignored.<P>I feel sorry for Verant because IMO they are a total disgrace. Thanks for purposefully ruining how great EQ could have been and refusing to imrove it. I hope you get lots of bad press.<P>/rude Verant</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have spent the time to read most of this and the other thread and I commend Brad for sticking with it and getting this feedback. Now I want to put in my 2cp's worth.<P>I was hunting cougars one the first island in Velious. If I hunt the cougars alone I get good experience but a lot of downtime. I spend the down time re-reading maps, player guides, etc. all game and related material. However, while I hunt alone, I can get a bubble of experience in about 3 cats. <P>Now I like to group and if someone approaches me to group I do. In this case, in a few minutes we became a group of 4, and of course the experience for 4 on all blue cats meant that no one was happy. <P>We moved to the Eastern Wastes. There the rinos and walrus can con up to red, so we kill the appropiate stuff. In short order I level and so do a couple of others. Through misforture or otherwise (we may have been trained), we are overwhelmed and killed by a red conned rino. <P>Here I percieved the risk as small was killed in admittedly an unusual circumstance, but the result was I lost 3 days time with the one death.<P>So I go back to soloing cougars, spend another 2 days and gain back my lost level. All with a HUGE amount of downtime. <P>All in all, I consider the extent of the death penalty as too high right now. <P>With other MMORPG's comming out in the near future, I believe I will be moving on to other games. However, today, EQ is better than TV.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, now something constructive to follow that:<P>Why are gate potions so ludicrously expensive? Make them reasonably priced (maybe 50 platt), but make them lore and only available in a few places. Also give it a long cast time so its not helpful for buggin out. This would allow melee types the ability to get out of one way dungeons, or when they are simply too tired to spend another two hours running home (or their parent or spouse is hollaring for them to get of the computer for awhile).<P>Binding... Before level 30 this was an issue to me. Since level 30 I have stayed bound at Gfay wiz spires. Both druid and wiz port are close if I can't find a Rez. And its such a highly populized zone I can generally find a port from some nice soul if none of my freinds are on (bank is also convenient from there if I have to pay for a port or rez). It would be nice if I could buy a bind potion and bind in all outdoor zones, but I don't think it will ever happen.<P>The first suggestion would not unbalance the game, and would give melee types more incentive to get out and explore some more. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>   The time left is short -- real competition for EQ will be on the market soon.  Many ideas posted here could help salvage or even save EQ.  ( Decreasing repeat-travel time via, say one charge of a transport spell on an item you find at a specific spot in a zone ("dragon tooth?"); eliminating the spellbook.  Melee binding.  Reducing the death penalty.  And many more.).<BR>From your replies to the posters here, you seem to be completely against changing these flaws in EQ, and are relying on the subscriber numbers to tell you that it's "all great now!".<P>Well, once a viable alternative comes out, your subscriber numbers are going to reflect what people are saying here, if things arent changed soon.  And then it will be too late.  If the game remains how it is now, I bet you'll lose upwards of 30 percent of your user base.  I will be among them.<P>( I have no new ideas to bring to the table here.  So many great ones have already been suggested.  But, they wont be implemented until the sub. numbers drop drastically AFTER people have left. )<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I cancelled my account(again).  I temporarily reactivated it this winter since one of my idiot friends didn't listen and bought this game. I cancelled it again once he learned the basics. I suspect he won't play once his inital period is done. I have many friends who played this game at one point or another...they all quit playing this game...almost to a person it is because of the uberguild/downtime/item farmer bs that infests this game. <P>Downtime is a reason. Catering to Ubergamers is a reason. <BR>Verant is not going to address the issues of casual gamers or non power gamers. Anyone who thinks otherwise is on crack. This game was long on promises and short on execution.<P>The game Verant seems to think it has and what it actually has are two different things.<P>I can find better things to do than watch a spellbook. Wait for boats. Or spend umpteen hours killing critters to get a tiny chunk of exp and nothing to speak of for loot.<P>Guilds are the worst thing that verant could have implemented. Where do you think all these jackass item farmers are from?<P>Camping is stupid. Verant makes people camp. <P>Roleplaying??? There isn't any. Character developement??? There isn't any. Story??? There isn't any. Dynamic enviroment?? Nope. Interesting events??? Nope.<BR>So what is left...Kill critters...get levels..get junk to kill other junk.  Could be entertaining at that level if most of your time wasn't spent reading a book during your downtime.<P>Too bad verant only caters to people who play 24/7 and join uberguilds. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One of the things that always gets me about downtime is that when you start out with a caster it only takes you about 2 minutes to recover.  Then you get up to about 4 and all of the sudden you have meditate.  Its good until level 6 at which point it gets increasingly sucky until around level 8 when you wish you could go back to sitting to regen mana, but that is too slow.<P>I have only gotten one character high enough to enjoy it, but I find it ruins all of my casters are that.  I absolutely cannot stress how much more I would like this game if the meditation "enhancement" 35 and on was given to everyone.<P>Also, why don't you guys make meditation worth having?  If downtime was half as much and monsters gave half the exp the game would still take forever but it would be twice as fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really think Verant is terrify that once a player reaches level 50 (or 60) that he/she will quit immediately. These excessive massive un-necessary ludicrous downtime proves it. I know you said yourself it's not about the money and all that but the direction you've been heading seem to point in that awful road of greed. It's bad enough we have to avoid death, but also downtime? We get punish for living and dying. Hell, we get punish for doing anything constructive. I'm not expecting Diablo style pace, but EQ is just way too slow. The so call "enhancements" you've made to reduce downtime is nice, but you have to realize that in solo and in groups there aren't always an enchanters who will give you clarity 24/7. There aren't any clerics who'll heal or res you 24/7. There aren't any druids/wizards who'll teleport you 24/7. The problem is you're relying too much on something that is uncertain.<P>Brad, you *must* realize that there's a difference between fun and frustration. Hell level is a good example. Sure we want challenges, but don't go overboard. We get to a new level (Hell) and suffer. We past the hell level and we suffer AGAIN. We suffer for getting to the next level? Where is the logic in this? Where's the fun factor? Do YOU think it's fun? I don't. Name a person on any server who thinks hell levels are "challenging." And I'm not even going to discuss level 51-60. To me I think that's the core of EQ's problem and the designers. Check this out: You sit in a room staring at a wall (or book) for, say, 10 minutes and do absolutely NOTHING. Get up and fight for 10 seconds and sit for 10 minutes and the whole cycle continues. Someone on this message board said somewhere along the lines of "75% doing nothing and 25% doing something" No sane man could see this as reasonable.<P>UO has PKs, EQ has downtimes.

But I don't recall ever seeing a reason that melee types can't be bound, by casters, in non-city zones? How about a quest, on a zone by zone basis that would allow a melee type to be bound there in much the same way the new dragon circles require you to get there (aka quest) and obtain an item to port there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Definition of Downtime: Time where I am not having fun playing.<P>Travels:<BR>Being a Melee travels can be long. But if I travel to meet a friend or for a quest, etc... I don't mind much. While on the Boat I chat around with my guild or friends. But: Traveling to get a group in a particular place only to find it empty and then running somewhere else and see that there is only a group with a huge list is not fun. Really, it is not.<P>What can I currently do to avoid this? Only fight where I know a lot of people are and pick-up groups are easy to find. But why make a huge world if only a handful of zones are used? (The reason some zone are not used will be developed later in this post)<P>What can Verant implement to avoid this? /who (name of a zone) comes to mind. I believe this proposition was refused because of Bandwith issue. So what about /howmany (name of a zone) which would tell you the number of people in a zone?<P>Risk and Death:<BR>Currently you will never, never, never, find a pick-up group who is willing to take some risks. The huge majority of players does not want to risk their precious xp and time and seem to prefer being bored to death in real life than dying in the world of Norrath.<BR>I have been in full groups hunting blue stuff at the zone of Dungeons and scared to even try to go further in.<BR>I have seen a Mage insulting me when I pulled a creature when she was out of mana. The fact the Healer was almost full of mana and that I was able to solo this creature doesn't seem to calm her down.<BR>These show there is really a problem in the way the death penalty works.<P>The current policy leads: Camping at well known safe spots instead of exploration, Underused zone because the risk to hunt there at the appropriate level is too high for the reward you can get. (For instance: scan the activity in the Temple of Droga and tell me if you find something else than 1 50+ character camping Chief RokGus).<BR>Tell me if I am wrong, but I think it is far from the Vision. Then there is something to do about it.<P>When I pull to the wall of Karnor Castle in the Dreadlands for more than 30min, the rest is Downtime in my definition (Well... maybe a bit more than this if I am the puller).<P>What can I currently do against this? I can gather some friends who like me like to explore and have fun and group with them. Well... at least I can try. I am in a guild where there is a low number of member above 30 so I don't have much opportunity to group with them. And, even though I have made some friends in the world of Norrath, setting up an expedition like this is not very convenient (most of my friends were made at my early levels and now some are much higher, some are much lower and some does not even play anymore :P).<P>What can Verant do about this? Modify the game in order to actively reward Dungeon crawling, to actively reward Adventuring. How can this be achieved? Here are several propositions:<P>1) Instead of having an xp modifier on the whole zone, why not make an XP modifier Map for all zones? The deeper you get in the dungeon the higher the modifier gets, or something like this.<P>2) Why not adding an xp modifier for the Mobility? Store the loc at which the last kills (5? 10? 20?) have been made and reward variation in these numbers (You can do some math and or use the sub-zones in the XP map of my 1) proposition)<P>3) Why not adding some "limits" in dungeons where you gain xp only for crossing it. As for now you only gain xp when you kill stuff. I think it would be pretty neat to gain xp when discovering a place you have never been before (Balancing this in order to avoid Power Leveling might be tough and store data server-side about the "limits" the char never crossed might use too much hard-drive space)<P>I am sure you can found more ideas like these ones if you gather around a table to talk about it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Quests:<BR>I like questing. I am aware than I am a strange creature in the world of Norath, but I like questing. But many quest are made of Downtime because you just wait for something to spawn. Often you are not in a condition that allows you to do something else than wait. So quest are more about the downtime you agree to go through or the luck you have than your ability to find things out and to act. That said I understand you want to have control on the rate at which items enter the world. It is still very annoying to wait for a spawn. (Btw: I have recently spent a lot - a LOT - of time to find a NPC and I noticed 2 days ago that this NPC has been looked into and changed. Knowing what is currently being looked into or what will be looked into by the Development team would be a GREAT addition to avoid many players many hours of time lost - on that subject you can go check my post in the Quality Insurance Board  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>On a side note, if it is most of the time easy to figure out what question to ask to which NPC and to discover what items they want, the other way around is almost impossible. If you find a item that is obviously for a quest and get it Identified, it is most of the time not possible to use this info to discover in what quest the item might be needed. That is a bit lame I think, but that’s a bit off Topic too :P<P>What can I do about it? Have more luck :P Try to gather a group of people to fight instead of waiting alone. Or, the more common answer that comes out of this board when someone dare to whine a bit about the quests: Stop doing quests.<P>What can Verant do about this? Add a time factor in some quests. You can have a NPC that have to craft something for you or to gather information. You can meet him once in a while and ask him about the item or info, and once it is ready you can have it. This might add some code and definitely add some Server-side Data (who asked for the item or for info and when). You control the rate AND you avoid boredom in the player base.<P>That’s about all I can think of for now. This post is already over long and I hope you will accept my apologies for that.<P>I have the feeling I came up with some pretty interesting ideas…. What do you think?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for the time you took to read<P>Szlia Southpaw<BR>Swifttail of the Third Rung<BR>Nearly out of her Fortieth Winter<BR>Officer of “Le Conseil Draconique”<BR>Lanys T’Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I imagine this thread is way too unwieldy for posts bureid this deep to have an impact, howerever, I do have a general theory on the usages of downtime. <P>1. Downtime, as it is currently implemented in the game, is limited by the downtime that is imposed upon the melee type characters.  With no meditate ability for health and the additional difficulties of not being able to bind, melee characters are the measure by which a group can progress.  This imbalance becomes most evident when you observe small group or solo dynamics. A magician and necro, for example are going to be much more efficient that a monk and a warrior, even though both classes have a limited healing ability and are capable of dealing an immense amount of damage.  This problem is further magnified if the monk or warrior dies and is forced to accept a long downtime for a naked corpse recovery and accept the xp loss from a rez not being available.<P>   To reduce this imbalance, which favors caster classes so heavily, I suggest that a system be looked at that would allow a melee bound character to summon his corpse. This summon would result in an xp restoring rez to be impossible.  However, the double penalty, for time loss and xp loss, is currently much more damaging to a non-caster. However allowing a bound player to summon his corpse and items cheaply, will not upset class balance for anyone except possibly at the highest levels of the game.  I could understand if there are certain zones where a body cannot be summoned. (planes VP etc) But I do not feel that a human warrior, bound in the Arena, hunting in Cazic Thule, should have to pay a 30 minute or more longer downtime penalty, that the rest of his caster group, who are bound just outside the zone.<P>    As it is currently implemented, the game of EQ is balanced as far as gameplay and player power. It is far from balanced though in player convience and enjoyment.  Bards are one of the most underplayed classes.  They are, argueably, one of the best classes in the game.  The reason they are played so rarely is based upon out of game reasons far more than in game. To be a good bard requires more work and manual dexterity, upon the part of the player in real life, than any other class.  Additionaly, the bard requires more xp to gain the same level of rewards as a non hybird.  So, in effect, the game balance of EQ says that to be a bard you must kill more to earn the same levels, you must work harder sitting behind the keyboard, you must accept that you have low hps and will die alot but cant bind anywhere near where you will die and you must accept this system because...your group could be too powerful if we didnt restrict you.  A large amount of the downtime penalties are imposed upon a small percantage of the classes.  Lets make this fair for all involved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune... I think I remember that name from Sojourn mud.  I remember grouping with an Aradune several times (mid 30 - low 40 lvl char if I remember).  I quit that mud after the gods became lunatics and spent their time exclusively doing things for the one uber guild that had not been destroyed... and as a result I now play Everquest.<BR>I saw one posting here I agree with.  If you remember text Sojourn mud, the way to get into a group (for any higher level area) was to gather in the main city (Waterdeep) and form there, then walk or more generally teleport out to the destination.  <BR>As I gain levels in Everquest, it is increasingly harder to find a "pickup" group (I am not in a guild as of yet) and there in no place I can go with the hope of joining any high level dungeon/plane group.  If I were to form a group for such a purpose, there is no good way for me to gather players and this is true everywhere.  If, let's say I am in Splitpaw leading a group and I need another group member, there is no good way of finding one (I can only search the zone and my friend list).  Would it be possible to have an option similar to ANON that would be global and provide a list of people who want to join groups?  Perhaps something that would be searchable by level, class, and even location (eg Give me all monks above level 40 within 2 adjacent zones that wish to join a group).  Joining a group or being anonymous would automatically turn the option off.<BR>I have seen many reflections of the Sojourn style mud in EQ (when my friend bought the game he commented that it was simply Sojourn with graphics and he was waiting for lawsuits to be filed!), but I hope that EQ is not being modeled too closely because I consider Sojourn to be a failure.  I played for about 2 years, then quit cold turkey when I became too disgusted with the way it was being run.  I have played EQ for over 1 year now and I hope that I will find it a better experience than Sojourn at the 2 year mark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>of all the aspects of Downtime in EQ the one that is most damaging and most discouraging to players is the one that keeps them from playing at all. That is the Downtime from assembling a group and getting to a destination. At higher levels it usually takes in excess of an HOUR to get into a group and get the group assembled for combat at a dungeon. Efficiency only goes so far here since you are dealing with 5 other people at least one of which may be remote or slow, or delayed etc. The group MUST wait for all members to be present before venturing into the dungeon. If anyone leaves from the group then the odds are very high that the rest of the group members must also leave at the same time. The group usually must evac out and try to find another member to replace the lost one and reassemble at the dungeon to enter it again from the start. This situation exacerbates the up front grouping Downtime because of those players that have only 2-3 hours at  stretch to play. By the time they are in a group and ready to enter the dungeon they may only have an hour and a half to 2 hours left to play. Other group members are VERY reluctant to take group members who only have a limited time to play and then force the group to evac and find a replacement and start all over again.<BR>If you only have say 3 hours to play and you cannot get in a group and into a dungeon within an  hour you may not be able to get a group at all that playtime and are essentially forced to camp out having achieved nothing but frustration. I cannot tell you how often this has happened to me. This does not make me enjoy the game it only contributes to a growing frustration at not being able to play a game I enjoy.<BR>This situation also greatly restricts which dungeons I am able to adventure in because to get a group in a timely manner I must camp at a highly populated dungeon so my chances of getting a group  are reasonable within the time limits. If I would like to adventure in other places my chances are low that I can convince 5 other people to waste time going elsewhere when they have already gathered at this dungeon.<BR>This Grouping overhead has a direct impact on why some dungeons are underutilized and others overpopulated. Don't underestimate the impact of travel times on popularity of dungeons because of this grouping time aspect.<BR>I have no major objections to other aspects of downtime as a penalty in the game, however upfront downtime when one is trying to get grouped and assembled so that one can start playing has nothing but negative aspects to it. If you can only play 2 hours at a stretch then you can easily spend play session after play session trying to get a group and then being forced to camp out because you have run out of time to effectively do anything even if you did manage to get a group. Does this make for an entertaining game or an enjoyable experience in anyway?<P>I don't know what the solution is given your game vision restrictions etc. Maybe being able to group with people out of zone via /text commands and a spell you can cast that will summon everybody to the caster. Make the spell only castable every RT hour or so, or use some component that's lore etc. but there must be something you can do to minimize the upfront time overhead for that start up phase of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I am also prepared to dodge any rocks thrown in my direction  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Why is it that reward is only given for killing?  I get a lot of fun out of "roleplaying" my characters, and i HATE having to camp for experience or "phat lewt."  But, if i am not camping with a group (or solo) there is no advancement for me!  I want to be able to explore all of Norrath and go ADVENTURING, isn't that essentially what all of the PCs are......adventurers?  People out looking for an exciting challenge, some dangerous foe, or vast riches?  But it boils down to sitting on your arse and waiting for Mob X to spawn to get item Y.<P>My point, and how this relates to downtime: I play a Dark Elf Enchanter (since the EXP penalties for my iksar SK were  too INSANE, but that's another thread)  I roleplay.....flinging insults at the colnbluth, and avoiding them when at all possible.  I like to venture out and "see the sights"  interact with others, try to erradicate the threats to the Underdark, running the many quests in EQ and help out the misguided Ilythiiri who i see hanging out with surfacers.............But, what does this get me?  I get personal satisfaction from this, sure, but i am faced with another form of "downtime" in that there is no advancement as far as the tangible experience that EQ is based around.  Not to mention that almost ALL the PCs i meet have a "so what" attitude about my in character ramblings, not to mention how impossible it is for me to find ANYONE who want to just set forth and FIND adventure......NOT sit on our butts and camp EXP/phatLeWt.   So......in relation to "DOWNTIME" there is considerable downtime in that i'm not concerned with "camping"  i spend MOST of my time sitting on my butt or wandering around trying to find someone to group or adventure with, which is hard since most people won't group with someone who "found mom's liquor cabinet and had a bit too much"(which i have been called for playing in character  and not shouting '16ENC LFG! snd /t'). SO, since i'm mostly questing  (WOW! Questing in EverQUEST!!) or adventuring, when i die, it hurts.  there is no 1/2hour camp to raise my exp back, not if i am going to try and avoid camping.  <P>I guess this reply kind of rambled about and the meaning was lost...there should be alternate form of experience advancement(almost ALL the exp from quests is a joke!), not just killing stuff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Downtime is part of EQ 1, it will not change.<BR>But for a new MMOG like say EQ 2 or SW:Galaxies<BR>perhaps something new could be attempted.<P><BR>=================<BR>On Solving the problem of Downtime: <P>                      Here is the problem, the downtime is forced into the <BR>                      game to moderate the advancement of players and balance <BR>                      the magic and melee against the environment. Without <BR>                      any downtime the players become god-like quake players <BR>                      that have continuous combat without any reason for <BR>                      any other players or classes. <P>                      So usually Mana and Health and perhaps Stamina are used to <BR>                      pace the game a certain way and balance things out. <P>                      Here is my solution, considering an EQ-like model as a baseline. <BR>                      (UO2 seems to have magic as a time based recharge/spell system, <BR>                      with some spells taking a week to recharge) Others have talked <BR>                      about how to do it. Basically taking all that combat downtime and <BR>                      combining it into a single pool of downtime later or before <BR>                      normal combat. <P>                      Have another pool of "energy" that the player can decide <BR>                      to use up. Call it their daily endurance, rather than their <BR>                      instantaneous endurance. This daily endurance regenerates when <BR>                      logged out or in taverns. <P>                      So the scenario in EQ is that a person casts all their mana <BR>                      or uses up all their stamina in combat and they have to <BR>                      sit down and wait for it to regen in the middle of the <BR>                      dungeon. Their instantaneous mana and stamina have been <BR>                      expended. In the new scenario, that same player would be <BR>                      able to decide to either sit and wait for the mana to <BR>                      regen, or use some of their daily endurance energy to refill <BR>                      themselves immediately. Now they would have to be careful <BR>                      because that energy is limited and the smart player would <BR>                      use that only when they have to for emergencies. Also the <BR>                      mage could convert it to mana, the warrior to stamina or <BR>                      health, the hybrids could convert it to both. The player <BR>                      decides how they want to spend that daily energy. <P>                      This allows many possibilities, some casual players may <BR>                      only have an hour to play. So they set their energy regen <BR>                      to automatic and play for one hour with excellent <BR>                      mana/health/stamina regen. Then they fall back to normal. <BR>                      So they log or go to a tavern or inn to regen back that daily <BR>                      energy. The players that want to stay online longer would <BR>                      carefully use up that daily energy pool for emergencies or <BR>                      here and there when they weren't in a group and if they <BR>                      wanted to regen they would go to a city tavern and check <BR>                      the bulletin boards or auction/employment/mission/quest boards <BR>                      while regenerating their daily endurance. <P>                      So you have effectively transfered the downtime control to <BR>                      the players hands. They can decide if they want to spend their <BR>                      daily allowance at immediate constant combat, or for emergencies <BR>                      or not at all. They control their own downtime. <BR>                      You have given casual players something for their play style. <BR>                      And you have given hard core players the ability to have <BR>                      bursts of mana/stamina or health when they need to for hard fights. <BR>                      Once they use up their daily endurance, then they go back to the <BR>                      normal downtime rates. This may help get those players off your <BR>                      busy server and free up bandwidth when they log off to regenerate. <BR>                      Instead of staying online overnight for long periods of regenerating. <BR>                      The downtime regeneration occurs offline just like a person's <BR>                      downtime. When they sleep, their character sleeps. Now you tell <BR>                      me, well what stops them from Pleveling one char logging off <BR>                      and Pleveling another char, well that daily endurance could work <BR>                      by account instead of by character. Or not, depending on the <BR>                      balancing. <P>                      Now the rates of exchange, and speed of regeneration would have <BR>                      to be balanced, but the model could still work. For example it would <BR>                      take alot of daily endurance energy to convert that pool to health. <BR>                      It wouldn't cost much to convert to stamina, and it would cost a <BR>                      fair bit to transfer it to mana. <P>                      Dekker <P><BR>                      P.S. <BR>                      A similar system could be used for experience and death... <BR>                      (Like when you die, you lose experience and the xp debt regenerates <BR>                      back slowly when offline or in taverns.)

</FONT><HR>Brad...it seems downtime only really becomes excessive in two circumstances...soloing and waiting for a boat. The game is designed around grouping so the soloing arguement holds no weight. <P>The 'flaw' that I see is that the game discourages exploration and risk taking. If you are a melee class then you don't want to wander too far from where you are bound otherwise you could end up on a nasty corpse run. Kunark, for example, is very limited in where you can be bound. For all intents and purposes unless you are iksar you aren't getting bound in Cabilis. That leaves 2 spots..Firiona and the Outpost. People die..resurrects, sow, and teleports aren't always available. That combined with the size of the Kunark zones can make for some long corpse runs. Not only is a player not inclined to wander too far but they aren't inclined to try something very dangerous either. Camping an easy spawn may be boring but people prefer that over the corpse run because they're actually playing. <P>If you are a caster you find something you can isolate and kill...the less mana it takes the better. Anything else usually ends up in a dead caster. The more mana spent the longer you're sitting on your butt. If you're under level 35 even worse as you will have to stare at the hated book.<P>A group won't usually go 'do' a dungeon from top to bottom because the net reward is less even though it's more exciting. Unless you get lucky you aren't likely to bag any good loot. Why 'do' a dungeon when camping will increase the odds of getting the item tenfold. It's safer too. Less chance of runners and trains occuring if you aren't wandering. Pets don't work too well for a mobile group in a dungeon either. Then you have the problem of right of way. The chances of disputes go up quite a bit if players are wandering. If players are camped they at least get a clear idea of who is doing what and can stay out of each other's way. <P>Then of course you have exp and item loss. As hard as it is to come by items in this game players *will not* risk losing their items. Sure players aren't taking chances. Because if they do they'll die 2-3 times more often. Because there's only so much of that a person can take before they get discouraged and don't want to play anymore. I did level 45...twice...on the same character. Mistmoore and I don't get along. <P>As Yzona stated "Conclusion: You need to encourage risk taking instead of actively discouraging it, and one way to do this is to reduce the penalty for it, which in most cases can be summed up as downtime."<P>Who wants to explore with mobs like Woushi running around? Who wants to do guk all the way to the bottom and come away with nothing? Who wants to end the night with a net exp loss? <P><BR>Excessive exp loss and travel time are an anathma to players. It's to be expected there will be some but there comes a point where it's just too much. When it reaches that point it's past fun, past challenging, past annoying...it's frustrating in the extreme and well on the way to making the player not want to play anymore.  <P><BR>The other item no one enjoys are the boats. The changes you've implemented to them make the boat situation tolerable...barely. When players reach the docks they don't want to stand around for 10-20 minutes waiting. They want to get a boat in a minute or two and get going. What stops this? There's only one boat that crosses zonelines. You have to use the boat to cross ocean zonelines. There are no non-magical alternatives to this. The other item is that you can't cast while on the boat. Not only does this leave you with little to do but you can't defend yourself if say, a Seafury boards the boat. Like that doesn't happen at least once a week. God forbid you go linkdead while zoning on the boat and miss your destination. Now you have to take the round trip(and hope you don't go LD again).<P>My proposal? Add another type of boat..something larger than the canoes but smaller than the ships. Something players can pilot and use to cross ocean zonelines. Make it slower. Add sea monsters that might attack such boats(and allow players to defend themselves with spells, etc). Whatever..I'd just like to see another alternative. <P>While we're talking about ocean zones...any chance of adding some underwater nasties to ocean zones? More sharks, sea serpents, whales, fish, a kraken, and other beasties...populate them underwater areas! Maybe add some underwater ruins too..similar to lake of ill omen but more extensive and populate it like you would any dungeon. Add a couple zone points in said ruins allowing players to go to dungeons deeper under the ocean floor. Those underwater areas are pretty barren but they don't have to be. It would be less work than designing a whole new zone(maybe not much but..). <P>Thanks if you read this far.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I understand that this discussion is mainly about player imput to help Verant in its further games, but here is a suggestion to help in THIS eq game.<P>With all this talk of downtime, why not throw your dedicated players a bone, reducing camping, ksing, downtime, while increasing fun, exitement, and possibly making everyone happier. <P>To compensate for the added downtime, the added two continents of zones, the larger newer zones, newer high lvl mobs with sow, the added dangers of the new lands, higher server populations, etc.... add 2 more Ancient Cyclops spawns. <P>One in the Dreadlands, spawning somewhere south of Karnor's where noone ever really goes.<P>Add another in Eastern Wastes, somewhere around the Southeast corner area perhaps where there is a nice dearth of content. <P>Now, considering the expanding populations per server, and the ever expanding lands and travel time, WHY not do this for your playerbase?<P>Is there any real reason?<P>All this would do is make everyone happier and add some excitement to the game. <P>Also, while yes the Yoda quest NPC was cute and all, he presents a very very rude problem in that farmers steal the AC  just to sell its ring in a tag team questing offer. This, because they either have SOW already, or they have JBoots already.<P>Kill off the YODA and just make JBoots drop off the AC. This would alleviate ALL problems with AC farming. Powerful people wouldnt rush at the chance to Kill the AC just cuz they want to outfit their twink with Jboots. Farmers couldnt tag team the quest and sell the AC ring... etc. etc.<P>All aspects would be improved for everyone except twinkers, farmers, and Yodagnome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, im not gonna say "VI made up downtime to make themselves more money", but the least VI could do is think of a better thing to tell the customers. Saying "downtime is a fun and challenging part of the game" is a CROCK. Just say what you mean, players of EQ arent gonna have fun and get nice items all of the time,its not going to happen. But some classes deal with downtime much easier than others. Warriors, Clerics and Enchanters will just have to use the guaranteed spot in the group they have more often. I agree that there should be a penalty for dying, but losing 3+ hours of work on 1 bad pull is pretty lame. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a warrior, downtime is a serious issue that usually effects me whenever I have to get my corpse. To this day I haven't been able to understand why a spellcaster with the ability to bind couldn't bind a melee class anywhere. I'd like to think that my warrior has the mental capacity to have his affinity bound to a location other then a city zone.<P>Even if melee classes were able to be bound anywhere, it wouldn't be terribly overpowering considering that the classes would still have to have a nearby binding class to do it anyway. I know for a fact that a lot of people won't play melee classes because they can't be bound except in city zones. I also know of people who think this and still think they shouldn't get bind .  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>You said something along the lines of downtime being a penalty, intentionally not fun (think the exact phrasing was "it's not supposed to be fun").  Forgive me if I have misquoted.. my intent is not to crucify you based on a quote taken out of context.  I do think that some poor design decisions were made with respect to downtime in EQ.<P>I accept downtime as being a basic component in the design of EQ.  I whole-heartedly reject the idea that downtime should not fun.<P>First and foremost is combat downtime.  On my favorite mud we used to chant "Ho Hum, Regen is Dumb" because the downtime was mind-numbingly boring.  In EQ you have not improved on this.  Specifically, you have designed it so that optimally regenning hp/mana requires you to sit and do almost nothing.  I can only assume this is a hold-over from text muds and an area you chose not to think much about or innovate.  Why do I have to sit?  Why put the limitation there?  Assuming I have to sit why do I have to stare at my spellbook pre lvl35 to med?  If you are going to make me stare at this thing then why isn't it more interesting?  Why doesn't it host a web browser?  Why doesn't it include interesting text about the plot of the game and/or other dynamic content?  I don't know what the game within a game stuff is called.. I'll call it meta-game (I think Abashi referred to it as that once).  Why is there no meta-game stuff in EQ?  Another post mentioned being able to play a card game with your group during med.. this is what I am talking about.  Have you ever played System Shock 2 and played the games for the game player within that game?  This was the best example I could think of meta-game stuff.<P>What can you do in EQ about this at this point?  I don't think very much.  Get rid of staring at the spellbook for pre35.  Your (Abashi's) arguements against this are all silly.  You should recognize that the punishment with downtime is inherant.. you don't get to kill/loot/get exp during downtime.  It is not necessary to design further punishment and in fact the challenge is to design ways of making downtime fun.<P>Oh, and if you don't think this is a serious issue then you should watch how people play.  If you VI folks play at work do you have another machine with email or a browser up?  Play at home and have the TV on?  Why?  Because staring at a spellbook is such a mind-curdling insipid thing to do.<P>As for travel downtime I accept what you say about the boats being necessary to make the world feel large.  But there is no excuse for the pathetic implementation of the boats.  Not only are they feature poor (no schedule you can check etc. already covered in this thread) they are and have been buggy since day 1.  These bugs are easily reproable and often severe (sometimes resulting in death).  Rather than fix the bugs here you have punted them as low priority because there are other means of travel; this is the wrong call IMnotsoHO. Yes, fix these before creating new content.. do something for the low lvl &lt; 50+ non uber guildmember for a change.<P>Let us know if you need more ideas on ways to make downtime fun.  You are smart people though.. I'm sure you can come up with them if you choose to innovate in this area rather than repackage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hm, Brad, maybe you don't have a good idea of what the risk/rewards are for an average, non-uber guild, melee player.  For example, if you're level 30 melee player (lets say dwarven and therfore have to bind in Freeport), and you want to go hunt in Cazic-Thule, the risk reward is such that on average, you will LOSE experience, gain hardly any loot, and spend the majority of time in "<BR>downtime" - i.e., running to CT, looking for a group, running back to CT after dying, corpse retrieval, etc.<P>Let me repeat:<P>On average, you WILL LOSE EXPERIENCE if you choos e hunt unwisely, e.g., go far from where you can bind or to unpopulr places.<P>Your players are rational.  The reason they don't use some of the zones is quite rational as well.   Risk reward just isn't very good if you can't bind near where you fight.  And other people have done the same calculus, so undesirable locations become even more undesirable (can't find groups).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Figured this post has been around enough that i ought to put my two cents in on downtime.<P>Having the free time to play video games at this stage of my life is a luxory.  I work usually from 7-4 as a Telecom Technician, and as anyone in the field knows, it never works out that way.  I tend to work about 50-60 hours a week on odd schedules...  we are on call 24-7.  You guys complain when EQ goes down, imagine your whole communication systems going down (telephone, cell phone, long distance, some cable systems).  <P>In any case, i play when i can, and i cherish those moments.<P>Downtime to me, is wasting time inside the game.  Playing a game is also sometimes a waste of time.  There are many other things that i should be doing, yet i take that time and play a game that i enjoy.  I understand that there needs to be some sort of balance on how quickly we level and become more powerful and aquire k3wl it3mz and all, but there is too much downtime.  It gets to a point where you can spend an entire gaming session in one spot waiting for the warrior to run back to his corpse... you can spend the whole time medding and re-memming after a bad pull, and i know that socializing is not doing nothing, but tell me how many of you want to socialize with the warrior who just trained 8 reds on you in a bad pull.  To me, there is too much wasted time in EQ, and that presents another problem...<P>Wasting time while wasting time is completely unacceptable.<P>If i am going to spend my valuable time playing a game, i want to maximize every minute of the time i have to play.  I do not want to be reduced to 15 minutes out of an hour because of a bad pull and i was bound 2 zones away in Firiona Vie.  I dont want to join a pickup group knowing full well that we will go into a dungeon to fight and i have to leave them high and dry in a few hours... that is just not fair.<P>There are many answers you give us for helping the downtime problem, but to each answer there is also a major problem.  Pickup groups, same as i jsut mentioned.  Binding close, could pose problems, and the non-casters still have to run.  Non dangerous spots?...  too much looking -&gt; more useless downtime.<P>I want to say now that i understand that there is a need for downtime, and that there are needs for such things as exp penalty and death penalty, but i think it is too much.  Heck, a hybrid not only cannot bind, but has to run the whole way back to the corpse, loses exp and has to re-mem all the spells.  That is a triple whammy, and on top of that they are penalized exp as they fight for it in the ~first~ place.<P>Without going on too much further and typing more that anyone would possibly want to read, i will state that I believe when downtime was thought out, it seems to have been thought of on a piece by piece basis... maybe when you figured the penalties for trolls and then shadowknights later, you had a troll warrior in mind, then a human shadowknight.  It is not balanced.  Melee binding... you had the idea of 'pick up a sword and go', but you forgot that they had to run for 30 minutes to get that sword, so not only do you penalize them for the time it took to gain back the experience they just lost, but then they have to spend time running back to their corpse to get a chance to ~do~ that, while in the mean time they are defenseless so they can die and lose it all again!<P>The big picture needs to be looked at.  For the final tuning, you need to take a step back, look at the ~whole~ picture, and then decide what you are going to do.  Look at the chain as a chain, not as seperate individual links... if you shake one link, they all rattle.  <P>I think this thread was the first step, but i hope that you will take what you see here and think about re-defining some of your views. <P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Downtime makes me feel the need to go to spoiler sites. I'm really serious. I didn't peek at the spoiler sites for my spell descriptions. I assumed the instructions in the tradeskill books were right. I didn't peek at what quest rewards were. I didn't peek for so many things because I wanted the excitement of discovering it.<P>After I got burned again and again and again, I turned around 180 degrees and now I surf the web like crazy because I'm so sick of getting burned.<P>But I wish, I really really wish, that risk and reward were balanced better so I could just play for the sake of playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This comment is out of left field, but I'd really like to see one significant change to EQ or in later versions of EQ... a significant reward for questing.  Both in items and xp.  Or even just xp.  I'd much rather travel the land for a week on some long quest and gain a level as my reward than sit in some lame camping place for 2 days killing the same 20 mobs every half hour.  It wouldn't be THAT hard.  Scale the xp so that someone doing the quest at a lower level will level immediately when they complete it.  If they are too high they may just get a bubble or two.  Make it so the quest can only be done by a given character once.  And make the quest involve travel and killing rare stuff... but not rare 8 hour spawns.  I'd rather kill 20 difficult but merely uncommon mobs than 1 8-12 hour spawn.  This would reduce camping and give the game more life.  A player may just hunt Garton Viswin for his head in Mistmoore if that was the last token he needed to get a huge xp reward from a quest.  That may be the only reason he'd ever go to Mistmoore.  I think this idea could really work... and I know that I would probably start playing this game again if there were a solid alternative to xp camping.  /shrug<P>formerly Astaroth, Pharos, Lazaarus, Kolo, Artaxis, Sirchade, etc. of Mith Marr, Vallon Zek, Test Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You want an alternative to constant killing to get exp? Here it is:<P>Each zone has a quest NPC.  This would be one huge quest.  The idea would be you start the quest in some newbie zone and the first NPC gives you a key to bring to a NPC in some other zone.  Each new NPC would give you another item to bring to a new zone.  Each subsequent quest would involve a harder zone and a harder to get to NPC.  To make it so people actually explore and take the time to walk if you got a port the item would dissappear from your inventory.  Gating would be ok.  Hows this sound?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This discussion has given me a really good appreciation of what the psychological mechanics are that make EQ the first game in years I wake up wanting to play -- that I can't get off my mind. Most of the complainers have actually made me realize what it is about the game that draws me in. And I suspect, despite what they say, is probably what draws them as well, even if they are unaware of it.<P>Some general comments:<P>The boats could be faster. This first affected me at lvl 4. I'm sure I'll be right bloody annoyed about it if I hit 40 or 50.<P>Binds could be more readily available, but the bind-o-rama that the power-levelers here want is NOT an answer. The big issue seems to be not being able to bind when you hit a new region (not a new zone, but you're on a different landmass etc.)<P>Karana is too large. Every single whine I see about the amount of time it takes to walk somewhere is about Karana. And they're right. It's large, it's dangerous and it's dangerous in the same ways from zone to zone.<P>Death is terribly fearful. People are afraid to die and this affects their actions. This is IMHO a VGT (very good thing). I'm tired of games where death is meaningless (AC) or frustratingly inevitable (UO during it's psychopath-PK days). I've found dying in the wrong place to be a monstrous irritation--I've been even more irritated that it has almost always been my fault for doing something stupid.<P>The issue of those of us who are adults with jobs and 4-6 hours of playtime a week vs. people with 4-12 hours of playtime a day is a VERY real one. I think it would be an excellent idea to put a realtime limited server up for casual gamers. This would eliminate some of the ubercamping and the economic distortions caused by uber-gamers vs. normal people. Just set up a server marked -20 and at 19 hours of gametime within the last 7 days, it lets you know you have an hour and when you hit 20, you log. You can add to the number of irritations that we casual gamers have, that it's harder to make long term friends because we meet a young character, help them, and the next time we see them they are 14 levels higher because they don't have other obligations. <P>What really makes me fearful about a lot of the suggestions to nerf things for low-time gamers is that they would be a HUGE invite for k0olios to use the shortened time to become ultimate power-levelers. It takes too long for Spawn X. If you make the time 1/2 as long, will it mean you wait half as long or the a do0D camps it twice?<P>Frankly, I wouldn't mind an adults only server. I find it disturbing when I feel I have to limit my in game comments because I don't know who I'm gaming with. I'm seldom obscene or even off color and generally roleplay, but a mildly off color comment is a slightly different thing when I discover the ranger who's g-stringed butt I just commented on with a double entendre after staring at it for 5 minutes on auto-follow turns out to be a 13 year old girl. If you created an adults only server, this would eliminate this problem as forbidden fruit being what it is, it would concentrate non-adults on the "adults only" server :-)<P>The problems with requiring mixed parties is one of the blessings of EQ. If you want to solo, I think maybe you gotta go buy an AC account--it's easy there. This probably accounts for my one good friend after a year of AC vs. my dozen or so good friends after a week in EQ. It can be irritating and require time to assemble a party, but it is a sacrifice that adds an INCREDIBLE amount to the game.<P>While we're on AC, a great many of the changes people here want are available in AC--instant gates, painless death, unlimited solo ability. And frankly, they have negative affects on roleplaying and the amount of socialization people have. It's a tradeoff and IMHO I very much like the EQ equation.<P>On socialization and downtime in cities. There is absolutely nothing to do in cities other than sell and train and hail looking for quests. There's no focal point. SELL SOME CLOTHES! Not armor, not class based, but simply clothing meant for going out on the town. In AC, there were already a large variety of colored clothes, but they just added dresses to AC rather than men's only styles and it has added an incredible amount to roleplaying within towns. Getting interesting clothing creates an atmosphere for non-combat time which promotes socializing and a constructive use of city downtime. Imagine a group of sharply dressed folks sitting in the local tavern looking to put together a party vs "OOC: Druid 14 LFG" And it gives you something to do before all the members of your dream party arrive. You would be simply amazed at what putting pretty clothes in front of people does.<P>And those most angry of the complainers: I hate to say it, but it's your playstyle. You are obsessed with leveling and items and getting ahead. Don't you just enjoy the game? I don't worry about how I'm getting ahead or anything else. I group with people because I enjoy their company. The game mechanics promote this and I welcome it.<P>Like the general comment to PKers in UO, "aren't you looking for Quake?" I have to say, for the "I wanna solo and get my items and XP" types, aren't you looking for Diablo II?<P>By the way, I don't buy the "customer is always right" arguments. These things have implications which in some cases it's obvious have not been fully thought out by people. <P>And accusing VI of having a "vision" thing similar to Origin destroying UO with it's PK vision is simply insane. I don't care how much downtime you have, it's simply not as bad nor is it as obviously without merit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
