</FONT><HR>Very typical board response. Aradune posts a very interesting read from Ralph Koster on the monthly fee for MMORPG, which I personally found very enlightining, and then some of the typical whining playerbase comes on and complains about Everquest and Verant. You'd think one day some of them might get tired of it, but then, what would they post?...  I for one have two questions about the article. <P>One being the Australian MUD banning comment, could anyone show me some recent news, as in the last year, about this?  One thing I can think of is maybe all the schools have banned them. Another opinion, MUD and MMORPG are two different games in a way. MUD can be used to refer to just the text based online games. So maybe it was just those kind of MUDs Ralph's comment was referring to.<P>Two, what MMORPG is offering free expansions? I'm assuming this is a future one coming out like Dawn or Horizons? I haven't been keeping up and I'm suprised one is going to.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Actually many years ago I played games online for free they were called Warcraft and Diablo and you could play with or against other people for free. However these games lack the imersiveness and security that surrounds Everquest. What does your $10 really pay for? Stability. If EQ ran under the lax security of the original Diablo ...well let's just say it would be a horrible mess. Could Verant run this game without the monthly charge? Probably but why should they?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If EQ ran on Battlenet for free how many people would still be playing, not me for one.<P>I'm a RAID engineer IRL and one thing I can assure them of is that the cost of their storage is falling fast so maybe they will be able to push funds around elsewhere, CS springs to mind.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't mind paying $10 a month,I'd pay A LOT more if necessary, and here's why:<P>Most players don't even realize - that we pay indirect opportunity costs..<P>Let's say you value an activity, for example going out with friends $10/hour. Then you'll lose 10$/hour if you can't go out with friends.Or let's assume you can't work because you're doing something else, then you'll lose 20$/hour.<P>So for EQ:<P>5*4hours/day +2*8 hours on weekend <BR>= 36 hours * 4 <BR>=144 hours a month * 10$/hour <BR>= $1440/month.<P>These are very reasonable numbers..<P>Now if you compare the direct cost of $10 to the indirect cost of $1440 you'll see that the direct cost is less than a percent of your investment.<P>Even if the fee was $30 a month this would NOT triple the actual cost you spend on a game, but only increase it by about 1.5 percent.<P>That's why I don't mind paying $10 at all, and by the way that's also why downtime (lost time, time that have no or even negative value to me) bothers me greatly.<P>By the way I did NOT make this theory up myself, this is totally standard biz 101, and it's widely used..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sigh...<P>Price fixing?  Are you seriously saying that he's trying to do an illegal activity through a public forum?<P>Cocaine for sale!  Email me at ....<P>Seriously - remember this was NOT written for the EQ audience.  It's for the SW game.  If you head to the BBS any of the new up-and-coming MMORPG's, you'll find posts similar to this:<P>"I don't understand why we have to pay $10 a month for this game!  I play Diablo 2, Counter Strike, and Quake 3 and don't pay for them!  This company is just trying to screw us consumers!"<P>This point of Raph's message was NOT to induce price fixing, or raise our fees.  It was to explain to people who have never played an MMORPG before why a $10/month (or very similar) fee is required for this type of game.  It's not so they can 'screw the consumer and make more phat $$$'.  It's so they don't have to file for bankruptcy.<P>Really - if at least one game company could afford to charge only $5/month, don't you think they would?  If AC was $5/month, don't you think more people would play?  They fact that they all charge similar fees only goes to show that they all have similar costs that must be met - which only goes to prove Raph's point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh - and to pick apart your response to Beta_Jester (I'd be remiss if I didn't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">)<P>"And we've certainly never stopped calling the game an RPG -- EQ is a game that continues to appeal to all sorts of players, hard core and casual, RPers and power gamers, and everybody else inbetween."<P>You may have never stopped calling EQ an RPG... but most of the rest of us have.  VI has never really seemed to have a good grasp of what an RPG entails.  Now on some rudimentary level EQ is a very very base RPG... much the same as Quake.  However to be an RPG the equivelant of what MOST people define as the genre you need a LOT more.<P>Your current setup is supposed to be "player driven" which forces anyone who wants to RP to be not only Player, but to also fulfill the role of GM and frequently NPC.  Couple this with the fact that there is no back structure in place to keep the non-RP'ers in their role and it becomes readily apparent why almost no one actually RP's in EQ.<P>If EQ were truely an RPG you, the controllers of the game world, would be the GM's.  The world would change and evolve *influenced* by player actions but not solely as a result of them.  This would likely involve hiring a content designer to be the GM for each zone and having them all sit down in weekly meetings to discuss what's going on in their zone, what changes will occur resulting from those events, what other events they'd like to impliment and how it might affect other zones.. this would also include things that happen across zones.  Over all of them you would have a lead GM (and when I say GM I don't mean your customer support guys) who makes sure all the stories and events mesh.  This would keep the world alive and fresh and the "story" rolling... like in an actual RPG.  To keep the non-RPers from destroying the integrity of the world you'd also have to impliment safe-guards.  I'm not talking making sure everyon stays in character when in conversttion.. that's impossible.  But by limiting their actions to what the characters would do would be quite easy.  Druids and Paladins should not be camping "good"  NPC's and likewise SK's and Necro's should not be camping "evil" NPC's (actually they don't much).. you did try to limit this with faction hits... but the faction hits are negligable compared to the gathered xp.. and worse than that are frequently easily repaired if needed at all.  Instead you should either outright dis-allow players from attacking certain NPC's or attacking the wrong NPC's should "anger" the god of the player resulting in a loss of power (if you can figure a way to do that) or a loss of experience.<P>All these changes would likely be a bit much for EQ - but it might be soemthing to think about for SWG...<P><BR>As to the comment:<P>"And of course we continue to make changes to the game in an attempt to keep it current, interesting, and better."<P>You do NOT make changes to "keep it current".  I've been playing since Kunark was released and  not a single thing has chanegd in existing zones.  ADDING more zones is NOT changing content.. it's adding content.  I can promise you that if you went through each zone and made some changes in line with existing stories, fixed/implimented a bunch of quests, and added a bunch more we would all be happier than if you add more zones.<P>Don't believe me?  Try try these poll questions:<P>1: As a player would you prefer:<P>A) New Zones<BR>B) Updated content for the current zones<P>2: How much of an RPG do you feel EQ is?<P>A) As much as the Pencil and Paper games<BR>B) Kind of like Pencil and Paper games<BR>C) Nothing like a Pencil and Paper game, but still and RPG of a sort<BR>D) Nothing like an RPG<BR>E) What's "role-playing"?<P>3: How much do you role-play in EQ<P>A) Never<BR>B) Rarely<BR>C) About half the time<BR>D) Frequently<BR>E) Always<P>4: How often do you see other peopel role-playing?<P>A) Never<BR>B) Rarely<BR>C) About half the time<BR>D) Frequently<BR>E) Always<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can't do it.  The first thing that happens is lousy packet sniffers, that tear everything up finding server holes and rewriting their characters to be '133t'.  Everything has to go through a secure central server.<P>By the way, my biggest hesitation in playing a game like EQ was the monthly fee.  Thanks, all, for giving me a different perspective.  The economy 101 guy especially.  He's right, we waste way too much time in-game sitting on our butts, waiting, etc.  I think it would be cool for eq, though, if you could take your character into a sleep mode that used a tiny fraction of normal bandwidth while medding, etc, bringing the cost of such things way down.  Wait, we're staring at our spellbooks half the time.  Could this already be implemented?  Hmm...<P>I've always doubted the EQ staff programmers' ability.  If this were true, my estimation of them would go up half a notch.<P><BR>Wouldn't that be clever?  to set up the entire casting community to basically put themselves in a spellbook most of the time, just to reduce server load?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Glower,<P>Lexli- you misunderstood my statement and I guess others could so let me explain.<P>Current Setup:<BR>Unlimited server<BR>Unlimited server<BR>...<BR>Unlimited server<P>My proposed setup:<BR>Unlimited server<BR>Limited server (100 hours)<BR>...<BR>Unlimited server<P>---<P>Off the top of my head, I know of three players who would still be playing today if they had a server which would limit their play hours.  It's just an oddity of human nature.  It wouldn't work for everyone.  Some folks would play 100 hours, then get on an unlimited server and keep playing (and failing school, getting divorces, getting fired, etc.) but a fair number would play their 100 hours a month and stop at that.  They (and Verant) would benefit.<P><BR>RunDmc: Rodcet Nife is not known as an official RP server.  I roleplay and run into other roleplayers at least 20% of my total play time.  Just a couple weeks ago, a group of us sat at WC and RP'd for a good 2 hours.  It was a blast.<P>But- WHAT is roleplaying?  Is it speaking and acting in a manner consistent with your character?<P>Is it having a storymaster have an official storyline that you follow (kinda like those murder mystery party games?)<P>Is it having "live" NPC's to act in character against?<P>Or do ALL those things have to be present before you consider it "roleplaying"?  Because if so- it is NOT going to happen.  Neverwinter Nights will be the first game that does this and guess what?  It WILL NOT BE AS ADDICTIVE.  <P>Why?  Because by definition it will be too easy to cheat or find a monty haul referee.  Even if you don't, others will.  This means, level and achievements will be meaningless and as a result, you really have a series of "pickup" games with no continuity unless you put yourself in a closed campaign.  Part of what makes EQ so fierce is that it is for the most part, cheatproof.  <P>You see a L50 character and you know it took a lot of work by either one person (500-700 hours) or a guild pushing them ("only" 200-300 hours but of TWO to THREE people's time).<P>As for comparing EQ to Quake, that's ludicrous.  There is more RP in High Keep hold on an average night than in a YEAR of Quake.<P>The biggest problem is the loss of those High Keep like areas.  The game turns very "corporate" at the high level, favoring military style play to get any of the "big" encounters.<P>My guild on Rodcet Nife has chosen not to follow that style- heck- we are even having a Keg party in the Maestro's room next week.  We had a drunken christmas party down in Paw (only two fatalities.  heh hard to cast when you are drunk).<P>  The fun and the wonder IS there.  But it is not the easiest path.   The problem is- folks think moving the yellow bar is the game and that is not where the fun is.  <P>The fun is ignoring that yellow bar for an hour, or a day, and just "BEING" a barbarian, or a gnome, or a cleric.  Telking en a swerthy Berb eccent tew yer bud's, commenting on the weather, using the /emote tools liberally.  It is all there Rundmc and there are a large number of people who roleplay to varying degrees.  <P>But Storymaster, it's not.  It is a rich RPG environment plus a classic "hack n' slash' DnD style environment.  Occasionally, a referee shows to roleplay and that's magic but you know what?  As a L50 type, YOU can GM a lot of adventures.<P>I regularly run dynamic quests with loot from my adventuring.  Sure- it costs me a couple thousand plat a month to do this.  But- what is the money for if not to have fun?<P>It can be as simple as last week when I gave a Savant Cap as reward to a L1 caster for finding and bringing me a particular brew or as complex as a multi-stage quest scattered through four of my characters ending with a mithril two hand sword.  And that is a key- you have 8 slots.  You can dynamically create characters for dynamic quests.  Send the players to Qeynos to find "Reynos" and then create Reynos while they Journey there.  Reynos can send them on to Halas where you have other NPC's YOU create waiting.<P>The fun is there just waiting to be realized and some people are so darn focused on the yellow bar they don't see it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not to make new monsters to fight but just to reflect that the world is changing.<P>I've often wished there were server wide quests that you could do that would set a server flag.<P>As a result- that server would be different.<P>On one server, the Dark Elves might do their quest and so a spawn table loaded with dark elves would pop for EC.<P>On another server, it would be winter and snowing a lot.<P>Say for example- you set up some kind of a quest and had terrible storms until that quest was finished.  It would be finished at different rates on different servers.  One server would figure it out first.  <P>Here, the players make a difference to world behavior.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

One thing I can think of <BR>&gt; is maybe all the schools have banned them. <P>We'd love to show you.  But we can't. There isn't any, or very very few out there on the issue.  That alone to me says something.  If NOBODY is talking about the "ban" within the last 2-3 years, why? You'd think that if this was an issue, even over something that was "passe" in some circles, there would be wide-spread player publicity on-going over the issue.<P>I'm more inclined to believe individual institutions have enacted the policy, and that was YEARS ago.  Some of those institutions probably don't even know they still have the rule that muds are banned.  Even in North America, there were schools, isps, bbs's that banned the playing of muds, just to name one bandwidth intensive activity. Others were as well banned at one point or another.<P>Now, could the policy be real in Australia. Sure, I'm not an expert, however the lack of mentions on the web about it, makes the issue suspect.  Which in turn, belittles Raph's argument.  If that point is wrong, how many other points in his argument are?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another NWN Veteran here.<BR>I know folks that ran up monthly phone bills of one thousand dollars (not consecutively, mind you) with the old AOL plan (pre-flat rate).  Yes, when I found out that EQ would only be 10 bucks a month for all of the beustiful graphics (this was back in EQ Beta, not long after AOL closed NWN in order to open a new game area that *WASN'T* covered by the flat rate... but that's another rant, the bastages) I was stunned, and still am, that they could afford to run the game on such a small fee.<P>For those folks that are whining about having to pay anything, you just don't know how good you have it (gosh, I feel like one of my grandparents talking about life in the Great Depression.  Sheesh!), and unless the internet as a whole shifts back to a pay-by-the-minute/hour/etc. scheme (which I can't see happening) you'll never really appreciate how much you are actually getting for your 10 bucks a month.<P>-=B=-<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Airtreader,<P>Given your obviously fragile psyche, why do you bother to post here?<P>You realize that being told you're wrong and being called a liar are different things?  Obviously not.  You realize that just because VI's initial testing could not duplicate the bugs you brought forth, and they said so, it does not follow that they consider you foolish for posting them?  Obviously not.  You realize that simple disagreement with you ideas and your methods are not personal attacks?  Obviously not.  You understand that your vitriol, hyperbole, and penchant for insulting people rather than ideas destroys any chance someone might pay attention to you?  Obviously not.<P>Dude, if you feel so oppressed, then leave.  Nothing is stopping you.  Or, if you just _have_ to stick around, perhaps you should try an actual discussion some time, rather than simply hurling accusations back and forth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You’re comparing apples and oranges.<BR>I remember GEnie costing, long distance 12 cents a minute, local node $2.00 per hour and the GEnie service its’ self costing $6.00 an hour in 1991.  That’s $15.20 an hour.  Technology has come a long way since then.  <P>While I’m glad the costs have come down, one reality remains, all of the current MMOG are profitable, very much so in fact.  I find it hard to feel sorry for Sony, Microsoft or Electronic Arts, especially, when it comes to profits from online game.  Raph want’s the big three to raise rates uniformly and he’ll probably get it.  These aren’t little start up companies anymore, these are conglomerates, and they act like it too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They could provide discounts for those subscribing to more than one game. They would have to only allow logging into one game at a time but it would work.<P>So If I subscribed to 3 of Sony MMOGs I might only have to pay 20 bucks instead of 30. I could only log into one game at a time. I'm not using any more bandwidth than if I was only playing one game all the time. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope Verant thinks of EverQuest as a training ground for Star Wars OLRPG.  It will bring a LOT of people to online gaming that never even knew what it was.  I have to suspect a future in which we have Luke Skywalker on the cover of Newsweek with an arrow pointing to his Lightsaber with the caption "Nerfed!".  Verant, I really hope you get the lightsaber right.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm totally happy with monthly subscriptions and paying for expansions. Personally I would pay a lot more (a rough estimate of my British Telecom pay-per-minute phone charges is around $1500 for under 2 years of solely EQ-playing time).<P>I've played a lot of games in my life but probably all combined don't even match the time I've spent in EQ. Sure I've had bad times but I'm not so retarded I'd keep returning to a game I didn't enjoy.<P>What I think Verant need to realise though is, I for one (and I suspect many others) see ourselves as far more than just customers. We are pretty much THE game, you guys just give us an arena to play in so to speak. The disappointing thing is, certainly until recently, how little you guys have acknowledged us.<P>Obviously you can't have a game run by player democracy. If that were true we'd all be level 100 with deathtouch and GM equipment by now but at the expense of enjoyment. The great thing about EQ is we're all on a more or less equal footing, playing by the same rules. The bad thing is there are still many flaws in the game that don't prevent mud-flation but do directly detract from player enjoyment. Things may be close to being balanced but that's not the same as things are close to working properly - they aren't.<P>No one should have a single useless spell for instance, highly situational maybe but useless no. Yet many classes have them and worse still they continue to be put in the game. Verant isn't learning from it's mistakes - that's the biggest worry I have.<P>I see Absor starting a thread for every class. This is great, it's what we've been waiting a long time for. Finally we can clearly see our ideas being taken note of. But it's fine starting something but you have to conclude it also. Personally, as a necromancer, I'm left wondering why I bothered spending hours reading and responding to 'our' thread when there is little evidence to suggest our ideas are being examined. Sorry Absor but saying 'you're collecting ideas' isn't good enough. We want answers, of course we don't expect all the ideas to be implemented (not least because many are conflicting) but I want to see evidence you've taken those ideas to tuning meetings and I want to see feedback on those ideas. How can we possibly expect a 'fair hearing' given that you intend starting a dozen more class threads in the next couple of weeks? It's in none of the classes best interests as we all risk getting drowned out by each other.<P>Back, sort of on topic, what is Verant doing to address the increasingly sizaeable lvl 50+ playerbase? Kunark was a great start but Velious is an utter joke. The weird thing is Velious IS something that has long been missing from EQ, a continent almost entirely set up for large scale, high level, guild raiding. Only it came too soon. There should have been another Kunark-class expansion first, more places where single 'pick up' groups of lvl 50+ players can hang out. I'm sick of Karnors and growing tired of Sebilis. Not many like Chardok and Charassis tends to be done by guilds. Velious, despite it's vast size, adds NOTHING to the part of the game I spend a lot of my time in - single groups of lvl 50+ players. Who tuned/designed Velious? I sure hope they aren't involved in Star Wars: Galaxies.<P>What as a player do I have to look forward to in EQ? The Warrens sounds like a mid level joke (judging by your last few attempts at 'old world' zones/re-tuning). There has to be new content to look forward to for pick-up groups of 50+ players, currently the game is getting stale and getting there at an alarming rate. If EQ's future is all about massive raids taking multiple hours then I'm afraid it will have to continue without me as I don't have 8 hours a day to dedicate to it.<P>Maybe being a ewok won't be so time-consuming...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
