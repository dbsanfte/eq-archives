</FONT><HR>Thank you for making my main charcter useless. I would say that I would stick to dungeon hunting which is all I do anyways, but I cant even do that all drum songs are broken. Wait till next patch yeah right. All the posts on the negative effect this has on Bards has already been mentioned in early posts, so I won't reset them. The one thing I will mention is that I will not ever play my Bard again until the patch. Also thanks for letting us know that you knew that this problem exsisted and you went ahead with the patch anyways. Shows us Bards that you could careless about this class and the people that pay every month because they enjoy there character choice. Just keep making casters more dominant and rid the game of all Melee classes while your at it since that is the direction the game it taking anyways. After all who needs Melee when a Mag pet has 2900hps at 51. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If this bug really bothers you, do as I am.  Don't play your bard.  Its your choice to live with the bug or to not play.<P>To Verant.

</FONT><HR>As someone who does not play a bard, I cannot understand what you're going through.  As someone who plays Everquest, I can only say, it happens to all of us.<P>As someone who works in the software industry myself, couple of things:<P>1)  Give these guys some slack.  Yes, we're all addicted to this game.  We pay $10 /mo for the right to play it on their servers over Bill & Ted's Excellent ISPs with code that can and sometimes does fall through the cracks.. This is software friends and neighbors.  Give VI at least the benefit of them actually servicing their software much more often than others.  Imagine if they only published patches monthly or even quarterly !  I'm sure it'll be remedied soon.  You are important too!<P>2)  Venting is cool.  Being demanding is not.  You can point fingers and blame and shout, but in the end, you only look more immature and your threads get easily looked over.  The addage of getting more "flies with honey" applies. No one is saying you need to brownnose.. but demanding this or that and laying down ultimatiums will only lead to delays that will inevitably cause more friction.  Allow things to go smoothly, provide *constructive criticism* and allow progress to take shape.  <P>3)  All classes go through "adjustments" that cause unruly effects.  Some more than others.. Nature of the beast.  I do feel for you though and hope it's resolved soon.<P>Smile folks.. it's a game.. very addicting one.. but a game nonetheless.<P>Hope to see you zippy bards running by soon..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As far as snare breaking, the only time it broke for me was when the mob was snared and rooted, and a DD broke the root.  At that point the snare is broken also.

</FONT><HR>Well folks,<P>First to the bard issue, TO clarify, it is only affecting Movement songs augmentation due to drums, NOT all drum songs.<P>Having said that I do agree that it is a big issue and deserves fixing ASAP.<P>On the snare/root issue, Last night I teamed up with a L40 ranger, (L39 ranger myself) and we took an even con Ry'Gorr legionaire. Under normal cercumstances this would be either a long kite, or a quick deah if share didnt hit, Lots of running around, and a good chance of agroing surronding mobs.<P>The difference, <P>Once the mob was snared and rooted I would shoot the crap out of it, maintaining Root and Stinging Swarm, Whialse my partner hit it with Flame Lick (lowers ac by a little) maintained snare and dropped in the DD's<P>Little or no running around, much quicker death for the mob, and the situation under controll.<P>Some people have noted that snare and root drop with a DD, well this did happen a few times, however not every time, sometimes only snare would drop and other times only root It looks like the %chance for a DD to break root has been passed on to snare.<P>What is the effect of this?<P>Well in a well controlled group not realy that much. both druids and rangers can snare/root so as long as you qagree beforehand who holds wich responsibility, Usually Ranger to snare Druid to root, all should be kewl.<P>Whare it would have an effect is with the Snare/Fear tactic. you see when using this tactic you are more often than not in a group with a number of casters, and usualy only yourself as the tank, sometimes a Full tank class also. This means that if a caster drops a 500point DD on the mob, the mob resists the DD and breaks snare, the caster may well be toast.<P>Also consider that rangers of L39 and above now have Call of Sky which gives there weapons a 35 point DD now if this proc gives snare/root a chance to break they will be asked not to use it, especialy in large encounters.<P>Finally Druid SOLO kiting is made harder with this, consider, Snare, Root, DOT, Nook, Mob breaks snare and root, Druid backs up, Fizzle, resist, snared, Root, DOT, nook, Rince and repeat.<P>The safest way to deal with this would be to remove the "break" chance from snare, that way the unanounced part of the change is removed.<P>On the whole I like this change, snare is a bit more variable now but the additional safety of being able to root and know the snare will probably still be there is good.<P>Best regards<P>Darg<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Even stating that it wasn't really that important implies your total lack of understanding of the bard class (not flaming YOU, Absor).

I have worked for 3 different games developers, and producers will waive bugs they really dont care about no matter how important, and then blame testers when complaints come in.<P>2. Whoever is to blame about the drums being broken, just fix it NOW, or I urge every bard death to go to petition.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry bards have been disadvantaged, but to bring all the servers down again and deprive the other 90% plus of the playerbase of play for x hours because you all insist on only playing one character or class is hardly a rational response.<P>You can have 8 characters per server, guys. Yes, I'd be annoyed if teleports or snare were broken for a week, but I'd just not play my druid until it was fixed. Yes I'd be annoyed if pets were broken, but I'd play my druid or my rogue until they were fixed.<P>It's just a game - it's not your job. Your mortgage payments don't depend on whether you play your bard or not. It's not like you can't play EQ, even - just one class is (significantly) disadvantaged for maybe a wek.<P>Don't, as they ay, put all your eggs in one basket. Don't have a "main" characters - have a family of characters all of which you have equal affection for and interest in. Then you only have to scream when they break the whole game, which is often enough, Brell knows.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Folks, the Drums were NOT broke.  This is smoke.  Mem Guardian or another resist enhancer.  Play it.  Note the increase, equip drum, note the improvement.  Drums are not broke.  This is a smoke screen and follows along with the line that while fixing Root and Snare to stack, this "allowed" them to fix the Root/Selos anomaly.  What really happened?<P>They went into Selos Accelerando and Selos Song of Travel and dinkered with the code so Root would work the way they wanted it too.  GZ had said in the past Root and Selos anomaly was as intended, but now it isn't for some reason (i.e. they don't like it).  So, while dinking with the code they screwed up the drum bonus for these songs.  Its that simple.  But, they aren't admitting to that, so they smoke screen it by saying they broke the "drum" code.  Unless they have code for each instrument and went into each "drum"file, this did not happen.  They dinkered with the song code and it is obvious.<P>Egg on face.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But think what would happen if SoW stopped working.  The outcry would be deafening.<P>Please don't downplay the importance of that song as it is one of two pretty much class defining songs of the bard, the other being mana song.  This is important enough to patch immediately.  Without the song, many a bard is not capable of soloing and will passed over for groups by someone who can cast SoW until this is fixed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

In a party of 4, Shaman, Wizard, Mage and Druid(Me)..snare broke abnormally about 7 times that night out of about 60 snares.  <P>This is strange, the wizard was nuking like crazy so I do not think it is raw DD that did it.  It didn't happen often enough to be a random duration.  I think the other poster that said stun effects are causing the problem may be accurate.
