</FONT><HR>Okay, I've followed this whole thread.  I've avoided feeding the troll because it's obviously not gettting anyone anywhere and I've pretty much agreed with FoH on this one.  But damn, Furor's last post is the most arrogant thing I've ever seen in this board.  So someone's saying it's sarcasm?  Well, the first part was kind of humorous, but the 2nd part just sounded like pure arrogance.  What gives?  Furor, if that was intended as sarcasm i guess you'll have to be more clear because most people didn't take it that way.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>(This post is off-topic for the most part, and I appologize for that.)<P>The sad part about this whole thing is...<P>In a couple of ways, I agree with Eduin's latest post... well, parts of it anyway.<P>Specifically...<P>"Most people who play the game do not want it to be an occupation but they want the content to be available to them. As things stand the top end content and *far* too much of it, is tuned to far too small a portion of the player base."<P>And...<P>"Verant's desire to keep these very few players occupied with masses of content detract from *my* game. There is nowhere near enough content between the Single Group Encounters and the "Epic" (to use FoH terminology) encounters."<P>I agree completely.<P>What good does it do to create an incredibly complex and puzzling zone like the Plane of Mischief... if 90% of the player base will NEVER see it?<BR>What good does it do to make "one of the best designed zones in the game" (Dragon Necropolis), if only 10% of the player base can even get there, much less utilize it?<BR>Why can't more effort be put into zones that ARE designed for the "other 90%"? (Crystal Caverns is wonderful, a shining example of what dungeons should be like.  I just wish you could actually get GOOD FACTION with the dwarves there.)<P><BR>On the other hand...<P>I know EXACTLY where people like Furor are coming from.<P>I created my first character as a Paladin, because I wanted to play a heroine.  I wanted to play a protector of the weak and slayer of evil.  I did not want to play "seventh tank on the left."<P>I created my second character as a Cleric, because I wanted to help people.  Because I had learned more about the game, and I wanted to be the person that the others relied upon to keep them strong and healthy enough to fight.<P><BR>I don't mind at all the idea of sharing the glory with a small group of friends... that's what fantasy literature is all about.<P>But "tertiary tank in wave three" who's job is to "root-park adds and use your Lay Hands if the Clerics are busy." is NOT the kind of job that anyone really wants, is it?<BR>Yeah, it's kind of important... but is it fun?<P><BR>When I read Furor's post about him stepping up to hold off the second mob while the others took down the first one, I thought "That's what playing a hero should be.  Everyone should have the chance to do stuff like that."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all VI states they look at the over all picture and take in all the infor from everyone.  How is that right?  on a typical server there is 20% 50+ 30% 40-50 and 50% 40-.  Then out of the 20% 50+ there is about 10% that are in a guild that will ever be able to do the EPIC mobs (read: big bad mobs) So how in the world would 90% of the server population even know about these encounters?  You take there info and base that on the whole game.  <P>I will make anyone a bet.  If once the reach the upper echelon (sp?) and get into a spot where they are fighting these mobs, they will start singing a different tune.<P>It is plain and simple.  Untill you actually are in one of the encoujnters you have no bearing on what has been done nor a say in what should be done.<P>Verant:<BR>Why not send a rep to each server.  Get guilded by the top 3 guilds on each server and ask in /gu how those players feel about the changes.  This way you will know without a doubt that the info you recieve is from the level of player that this has effected.  Can it be done?  Yes!  Would it take a small portion of time out of VI time schedule?  YES!  But it would make our true feelings heard without all the other people putting in their 2 cents when they are flat broke.<P>Thanks<BR>Kellan McCleod Tarew Marr<BR>Clan of Shadows<BR>Banjo playing bard of 57 songs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of us knew SOME change would have to be made with the healing aggro.  So they're testing out a "minor" reduction?  oh boy...<BR>The strategy is to decide that a change in aggro is wanted.  Then make a huge change.  when the players go nuts about it, reduce the change slightly so they're more likely to swallow it and shut up.  End result:  aggro is much higher than it use to be and clerics are still nerfed bad.  Well, we'll see how the change works out once it goes Live.  I hope it's more than minor.<P>I never saw a response to someone claiming that the original spell designer at Verant INTENTIIONALLY made the taunt effect for higher end heals only slightly higher than greater heal.  That would throw out the window Verant's claim that healing taunt was bugged.  Of course, bugged or not they designed the whole high end game around how it WAS working.<P>Hey, should I stop leveling my warrior when I hit 50?  Because at 51 the cap gets higher on the heal taunt, so I think a L50 would be better.  How dumb...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;These players don't like this anymore than you. No one wants encounters balanced to the best players in the game. <P>Amen to that.<P>We don't want to see zone after zone, mob after mob designed to be killed only by those that have the massive amounts of time to put in.<P>Sure, there should be a zone or two like that... and a few mobs spread out to challenge the best of the best.<P>But do we need to have so many?<P>Likewise... the whole idea of tactics... if we come up with something, it is invariably nerfed because the encounter isn't meant to work that way.  The end result, a focus on the basics.  And it doesn't get any more basic than warriors and clerics.  Every single time Verant nerfs something because of some nifty trick we discovered they eliminate a tactic.  Pretty much any tactic is dubbed an exploit and then made impossible.  We aren't meant to use tactics.  We aren't supposed to think.  We're supposed to use only the 1 method with which the Verant coders envisioned the mob being killed.  This is why if someone discovers that a bard song neutralizes the silence spells in PoG, that song is changed so that it doesn't.  Why?  That's tactics.  Learn the weakness of the enemy and exploit it.  But Verant doesn't want us using tactics.  Every fight must be like any other.  This is wrong.<P>By god, bards should be able to end silence.  And against some other mob, make the ranger hp/ac buff help in a similiar fashion, for yet another, some paladin spell...  Throw out some mobs that do multiple of these types of things, so that you'll need bards, rangers, and paladins...  And then we'll be talking tactics, then we'll be using other classes.  Instead of send in your best geared tanks.  Weee!<P>The best will always do what it takes to be most effecient.  If rangers became the most effecient class in the next patch, the best would suddenly all have 50+ rangers.  The rest of us would struggle on with the same main characters we've been playing forever.<P>Verant needs to quit gearing mobs to guilds of FoH caliber.  Who cares if they leave?  I like reading their exploits, especially Tigole's news reports.  I respect their ability to do things earlier with fewer people then I'll be able to.  I wouldn't want to put in the time they do though.  But oh well, they have fun.  But on the opposite side, I want to do most of what they've done.  I want to see VP, Sleepers Tomb, etc.  What's more important, 500 people or the remaining 299,500?  Your average player should be able to look at almost any zone in the game and say "when I'm level X, I'm going to go there."  But go run a poll... ask how many people honestly think they'll ever see in the inside of VP, of Sleepers... how many will explore ToV?  How many expect to kill Tunare?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think Axterix is on the right track here.  You want to make an uber-mob(s) more challenging?  Don't just pile on more hit points, make them immune to everything, and up their damage to obscene levels.  Get creative!  Give one uber-mob a certain set of nasty abilities.  Be sure that the players have ways to counter some of those abilities by making use of powers given to various classes such as the bard counter that Axterix mentioned.  That way raiders are encouraged to bring along members of some of classes that are so typically ignored on uber-raids.  Different mobs have very different abilities that must be countered successfully if the party is to have much chance of success.  Right now they have different abilities to some extent, but people seem to be saying that the toughest mobs all come down to piling on enough tanks/clerics to beat them down.  You don't have to nerf heals to find ways of keeping the same strategy from working every time on every mob.  I'm sure with a little creativity, a mob could have the right set of abilities to cripple such a one dimensional approach.<P>Additionally, for the biggest challenges, the mob takes this set of abilities he's been given and uses them in different ways from battle to battle.  Simple AI is like an old nintendo game boss.  Once you fight him a couple times and figure out his pattern, you whoop him.  Put in some mobs that are more complicated than that for a real challenge.  Sure, LAST time you took out uber-velious-mob with a pile of tanks and clerics, but this time he looses a different attack that you're totally unprepared for.  There are ways to combat it, but not the same way you did last time.  Hope you brought a variety of classes and equipment along to help.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Ok, this all may sound like stating the obvious, but it just doesn't seem like it's been implemented in the game.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well since the pacth i mainly took my group to trak lair and HS with the odd lets clear all the guardian wurm before we go into HS.<P>I had zero problem maintaining agro on me and my cleric NEVER died once. Yes it is a bit more harder to retain agro than before but it is still managable in ROK. <P>However in SOV where mob hit for insame amount (800+) and have ungodly amount of hp i have no difficulty seeing the problem that the few ppl that fight these mob are describing. <P>That is the key here, most of us dont see anything wrong because we are not fighting those bad ass mob. Untill i do i will trust the judgment of those players that do. <P>And i am amazed to see all these other ppl who never seen let alone fight these encounter described as broken telling those who actually ARE fighting them that they are wrong.<P>I wish everyone would limit their comment on this new change to their actual playing experience. For my part it goes, in ROK on mob lvl 60 and under the game is more of a challenge but still within reasonable limit.<P>- Gallaorn<P>P.S Saying that agro on all lvl 55+ mob is broken is also wrong. i Have killed Jugger (lvl57), seb protector(lvl 60), jumpalot(lvl 60), guardian wurm (lvl 60) with no problem using CH on the main tank and rarely having my cleric agro let alone die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
