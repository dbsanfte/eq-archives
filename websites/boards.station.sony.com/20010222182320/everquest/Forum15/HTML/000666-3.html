</FONT><HR>Ok..here's my additions..please read them?<P> I whole heartedly agree with the folks saying we need a small offense upgrade at least. Last night I was on a Velks lab raid and we took down Doljonijiarnimorinar(or whatever) and although the fight lasted over a minute and a half..I hit him all of 15 times!!! Most of these hits were minimum dmg..I'm lvl 57, had over 1K atk(with major str buffs) and using a halcyon broadsword and CoF! I was SO disheartened by this.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>We need a fix there.<P>My other BIG complaint..and I don't see this anywhere on these posts is OUR SELECTION OF GOOD BP's IS HORRIBLE!!!!<P>Has anyone else noticed that we defensive tanks have all of a treeweave, enameled black BP, or Ro BP to use until we can get lucky enough to get a Valo or DW BP? The giants in Kael don't drop corroded armor now matter how much I beg them to(I've never seen a piece) so we can't get the velious quest BP either. Not a single one on Bertox yet.<P>Yet I see SK's get to use all these warrior plate items that we can't..like the stuff in Velks lab or the one that really gets me steamed is the Incarnadine BP from Chardok..reasonably attainable and 35!!!! AC with stats from heaven! Pallies cannot use this btw. Oh and SKs get the PoG armor too..which is easy access but pallies look to have to get into the uber hard to enter Plane o Mischief to get ours? Not funny at all. :/<P>Please please please look into these two problems as well Verant. The AC disparity on armor for SK/War vs. paladins in grossly out of proportion. I used to say "well SKs don't get our clerical buffs so I guess I can understand them getting that armor" but now they get a nice new AC/HP buff from the necros line and velious just tossed out a ton of new armor for them. That arguement went out the window fast.<P>Thanks for reading.<P>Xav</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm just going to repost the only point I've made so far, because I think it really needs reviewing:<P>from my post at<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-3.html<P>****<P>Something I haven't yet seen covered is mid level armor options for paladins. With the recent introduction of craftable plate, it has become easier for paladins to obtain decent armor for the levels 25-46 (at which point planar armor replaces the class specific armor, in our case, Armor of Ro). While those with lots of money may find more viable options earlier on, you will find that (and I don't mean to generalize, but I think this is true) people who play paladins tend to want to earn their equipment more than people that play other classes (again, this is a generalization; it just turns out that people with this mentality are more likely to initially choose a paladin as their first class when first starting the game). Anyway, back to the point: Ro armor is, especially in comparison with most other class armors, too hard to obtain. Warrior crafted armor is by far the simplist (maybe too simple, but that isn't the point here... nor do I wish to see any other classes get nerfed). I would say that the Ranger armor quests should set the standard of difficulty for the rest of the class armor quests (with the exception of the ridiculously long camping time involved in obtaining Ivy greaves; God forbid you should not attack him within the first 10 seconds of his spawning, either! ... I think I'm going to the ranger board when I'm done here). EACH piece of Ro armor requires that a piece of Ronium be created, requires the following ingredients:<P>1. 2 bars of enchanted platinum  <BR>-this is alright, since most other armors require a gem of some sort, and this costs rougly the same<BR>2. 1 bar of melatite <BR>-this is ridiculous: not only do the clockworks range in level from 25-40, but they're GNOMES! Gnomes have done NOTHING wrong, and there is no reason that paladins should have to hunt down their creations<BR>3. 1 sands of Ro<BR>-I suppose this is alright given the volume of Sand Giant hunters that this can be gotten from, but I don't think a component required for EVERY piece of armor should be on this high level a creature<BR>4. 1 soil of Underfoot<BR>-again, ridiculous: WHY should we have to kill fairies? They have done nothing wrong! What would possess any holy warrior to tell his disciple, "Go out and slaughter some fairies, then return with their remains"???? I suggest this be changed to some other component... I would suggest brownies, but then we again have the problem of a high level creature carrying a component meant for EVERY piece of armor. Maybe something from goblins would be more appropriate (or that could replace melatite, since you'd still have to go to Sol. A to get it)<BR>5. 1 mistmoore granite<BR>-this wouldn't be so bad if mistmoore weren't so nasty. The other problem is how deep into mistmoore one must go in order to obtain these. I would suggest either removing the No Drop tag on these (I don't like this, because then people will be attempting to make a profit on paladins, and we'll be back to the problem of not having "earned" your armor), or making all gargoyles in Mistmoore drop this (currently only the level 30+ gargoyles deep in the castle drop it; the ones in the courtyard should as well, but maybe more rarely)<P>Aside from Ronium creation, we ALSO need to obtain through other quests the molds needed for this armor, and then smith it ourselves. Since the smithing skill check was removed, I don't mind this part, but some of the armor molds are ridiculous:<P>Bracer of Ro: requires 2 deepwater goblin nets<BR>-these nets drop off a 2 hour spawn in Lake Rathe. 2 nets per bracer means 8 hours spent getting the molds, plus the added time of getting the ronium. On top of that, if the goblin is on land, and he is rooted or snared, when he is near death (less than 25% health remaining), he will suicide and this results in NO nets. This is obviously a bug and requires fixing, but the point is, one should not have to invest a minimum of 6 hours in getting a piece of armor.<P>Vambraces of Ro - requires 2 rotten shark meat<BR>-again, a couple things make this a poor quest, especially in comparison to some other class quest armors. Firstly, there is another despawning problem with the shark, this time with its corpse: when the shark dies, if it is not looted IMMEDIATELY (by this I mean the corpse is checked and the meat is grabbed within 2 seconds of death), the corpse sometimes disappears. Also, the shark is again level 30+ (last I checked I believe it was 34-36). It is my belief that these armors should be attainable in the late 20s (not necessarily on your own, especially not for more crucial pieces such as greaves and breastplates), and the creatures that drop components should reflect this range; I would knock 3-5 levels from the shark if I were to alter this quest in any way. I don't mind the 2 hour spawn time so much, but I would also like it if he dropped the meat every time; current drop rates tend to be 50%. It's a big shark, how hard can some meat be to find? There isn't much reason to make a paladin who wants his armor kill the same shark 4 times over 8 hours.<P>If paladins are to learn their role of the tank, good armor is needed early on. While the fine plate that has been added helps in achieving this goal, it is my opinion that Armor of Ro (why is it called that, anyway? Ro is a wizard deity... just because we go to his temple to obtain it (why, too, is that?) doesn't mean it should be named after him) should not be as difficult as it is to obtain. Ronium is far too hard for the level this equipment is geared at, and at least 2 of the quests for molds have bugs and long camp times which make them either very difficult or very frustrating. I ask that this be examined in detail and reviewed so that the quests do not become oversimplified, either. Thank you for your time and patience, and I hope to hear something concerning this topic soon.<P>****<P>Lanceor posted shortly after I did on the same issue, and I think he put it much better than I did when he said:<P>****<P>Warrior crafted armor is, and should be, better than paladin Ro armor. It is part of them being a better tank. However, warriors can and do get crafted quite easily by the time they reach mid 20's in level. Paladins are still finding it difficult to get Ro even into their late 30's.<P>Ro armor quests are simply so difficult and time consuming that Ro armor is amazingly rare when compared to crafted. End result? Ro armor sells for twice the price, or worse, paladins buy something else. With more and more post 50 characters being developed, Deepwater Armor (which drops) is becoming as common as Ro. As such it is almost as cheap as Ro.<P>****<P>I would encourage that his post be read in its entirety on the same page as mine, which you can find using the URL at the beginning of this post.<P>Thank you again for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing the status on this issue, be it what I was hoping to hear or not.<P>Also, my personal thanks and congratulations go to you for reviewing, considering, and compiling all these for all the classes. Keep up the good work, it is appreciated by all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grr, okay.<P>It's not a question of greed.  It's a matter of trying to send a message to the developers that we feel there is an imbalance.  Ultimately the developers will decide, but Absor needs to know to pass our feelings along before that can happen.<P>To be honest, no one has a clue how the parts (skill caps, hit/miss tables, etc.) add up to the sum of our offensive abilities.  But we are very aware of what the final sum is, and many of us feel it is less than it should be.<P>Sure, some of it is pride.  It's hard to feel like you're making any kind of difference for your group when the warrior is tearing through a mob that you miss half the time, for double the damage you're doing.<P>But look at it this way:  you can have a warrior, who tanks just as well (or probably better) than a paladin, but also does good damage.  Or, you can have a paladin who can tank well, but spends half his time taunting with spells, taking away even more from his already low damage output.<P>The warrior keeps the support classes safe, and helps kill the mobs.  The paladin keeps the support classes safe (although not any better than the warrior can), and the fights will last longer, costing more mana (meaning more downtime).  Which are you going to choose?<P>Maybe this is how it's supposed to be, but if that's true paladins should have *better* defense than warriors, not the same.  If the mob lives longer because less damage is being done to it, we need to take less damage in return, since we'll be taking damage over a longer period of time.<P>I think the reason people (myself included) are jumping on the offense bandwagon is because Verant seems to be quite adamant about not making us better damage sponges than warriors, or giving us unique spells that stack with everything -- so offense is the only remaining way we can improve our efficiency.  But as long as warriors continue to be _significantly_ more efficient for their groups, paladins will continue to have the problems they do now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Congratulations Absor,<P>You have reached Abashi status!!!<P>You read (probably didnt) two forums amounting to 9 pages in total and looked at 101 good ideas to BALANCE them. Not overpower them.<P>And once again in true Abashi style you took the 8 ideas that YOU personally think might balance us, reduced their efficency by 75% and posted them, discarding the other 93 good ideas.<P>Do you honestly believe that this is going to balance us? Do you think the rants for more will stop? Do you think the mass exodus of Paladins will cease after this?<P>Congratulations...implement this and you will succesfully make all those paladins over level 55 slightly more powered which is funny because most Paladins give up at around level 52-53.<P>And if you think that my post is offensive please remember that due to the lack of any weapon skill the only thing I can be offensive with it with my posts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, for the most part you appear to NOT understand the issues present to you by the paladin community. The list you give is hardly indicative of the problems, all of which you claim to have read.<P>Beldukil, turn on your misses for a night and then come back and tell us paladin offense is fine at 225 against even to red NPCs. You feel balanced with a 55 percent MISS rate and most hits for minimum damage? That's your lack of skill talking.<P>Paladins need more offensive skills. Look at the vision Absor of a knight wielding a two handed sword. A slow hard hitting weapon that when used skillfully does reasonable damage. You've put those weapons int he game Verant, but then what do you do to UNBALANCE the class? You cap the skills so that paladins (and shadowknights) MISS alot and hit for MIN damage when they do hit. DO you see what this does? It FORCES knights to use fast one hand weapons to mitigate the lost damage over time, relying on level damage bonus almost entirely.<P>Can you say "moss covered twig syndrome"? and we all know that was BROKEN!<P>If Verant insists on knights wielding two hand weapons to do the most damage they can then they MUST have enough effensive skills to be able to HIT those level 55+ NPCs more than half the time and hit them for MODAL and MAX damage.<P>At the VERY LEAST Absor, give knights around 240 skill in 2h slash, 2h blunt and 2h piercing to ENCOURAGE and BALANCE this vision of yours.<P>As it stands, Verant triple and quadruple penalizes knights for some disturbing reason.<P>Spell ideas that hit home for me are these<P>o Change Enstill to Immobilize. We loose the ability to root park as NPC magic resistance goes up and up. The true upgrade to Root is Immobilzie, not Enstill which has a different role). Don't give us the first in a new line of root spells, give us the needed upgrade to Root.<P>o Wave of Healing needs to heal more. 200 health at the level given is half a bubble of health and less on a buffed 5k hp warrior. Keep the 1 minute recast delay but let it heal as much as the level 49 cleric spell Word of Healing (393 hp for 600 mana).<P>o Divine Strength needs be desired as a level 60! spell. Adding 200 health is far too weak considering that you have given rangers more desireable party buffs starting at level 51. Just which hybrid is supposed to be buffing the group anyways? The ranger who can deal damage like a warrior or the paladin who cant? Just move this spell to level 53 and change Divine Glory to be the upgrade to this spell. How about a 300 to 400 hp buff that stacks at level 60?<P>o Yaulp IV is a easy and obvious good idea. A spell well suited to paladins and it gives them a mana intensive ATK buff to help their pitiful offense. This has stacking problems though which need fixing.<P>o replacing Revive with Resuscitate might see some paladins helping with rez before level 59. Now that's group friendly.<P>o stun spells not working past level 55 is a gameplay problem for everyone. It hits hardest against paladins who primarily cast stuns and bash. Absor this one issue makes paladins unwanted as much as any other thing at the highest levels of the game. With a series of stuns, a paladin could mitigate thousands of points in damage dealt by NPCs. At level 56 upward they LOOSE this ability. Where is the mana efficient 1000 point heal to replace this LOSS? You know, Divine Light at 59 or 60?<P>o defense skill equal to warrior helps paladins crawl out of a deep hole. Not like they can tank an epic NPC yet. Getting killed in 3 rounds instead of 2 by dragons doesn't equal defensive hybrid in my book. Rangers and bards get a parry/dodge discipline? Ahem! Absor the defensive knights as you say don't have ANY defensive discipline. Give paladins evasive or a parry discipline thank you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Balance every class in the game will leave us "unbalanced" again no matter what, remember Paladin is the only one who REALLY need to be upgraded!!<P>I got news for ya.  My lvl 50 Pally misses as many as my 13 Cleric when he tries to melee.<P>I mean whats the role of being a Paladin? Group value? Self def? or what?  We dont have a group aura nor a high def.  Really low HP compare to a War. and our damage output is just a joke.<P>We really need a new damage table. For those Pally only items. PLEASE make them easier to drop.  Otherwise lets make a big pally guild, raid those dragons everyday and take over freeport for God's sake...<P>Can we get something unique and usefull so that people really want to group with a Paladin?  I mean because right now paladin is very useless(Even to his God).<P>For a Knight's image, shield and 1H weapon are the most important than anyting else. We use shield as a weapon since we dont get DW as a war and other melee classes.  Sadly, none of our skill is better than a war, not Def, not even bash...<P>I started my cleric because I am tried of use most of my time shouting LFG. and God knows when we will be really balanced.  Let's just wait and see how many items out of the list will go live ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok. Heres my 2cp.  Pallys just plain suck.  After a bout a year of playing a pally, I find myself starting a new char. with another class every now and then.  But I always come back to my pally.  Why you may ask?  Because I hope Vi would open their eyes and just see that pallys are in the pits and need to be dug out.  Here's a couple of changes that would, in fact, not really make them all powerful but at least make them more fun to play.<P>1).  Class-related spells<BR>     Have a line of pally only spells.  We are in desperate need to be able to call our very own.  And dont even go into LOH.  Lets see... I use loh to cure myself, and 70 mins. after that, I DIE.  Dont that suck to be just 2 min. away from something that could actually save my life?<P>2).  Class Quests<BR>     Have a fun time trying to complete Ro and Epic Quests.  Ro quests are so long and stretched out, and in the end not really worth it anyway, not unless u wanna con a newbie who thinks Ro is just the BOMB and get him to actually pay 1k or so for it. <P>Vi.  heres when u made the mistake and killed us completely.  We actually had something no other race had,  the FIERY AVENGER.  Yes, it was a very LONG and stretched out quest, but being the best sword pretty much in the game, it was worth it.  Then u went and did the same for all other classes and tried to make us feel bettter by giving us ANOTHER HUGE quest that went with the LONG FA quest to give us yet antother 2hs. (Which in my opinion the FD is alright, but really not so great now with all the awesome new godly weapons for other classes)<P>Well, i could go on forever with more topics, but just writting this makes me wanna retire my pally.  &lt;Sigh&gt; Well, i guess i will just hope Vi will actually help us soon instead of giving us something that makes us feel better for ohhh about...... a week.  Not asking for something better than all the other classes.  Just some changes that would actually let playing a pally be fun.  <P>Teil SpiritBlade<BR>Karana Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good Job overall but briefly:<P>1.   OFFENSE just a bit of a tweak please.  Right now we are the MISSMASTERS.  With our melee damage caps at level 40 I am doing 1/4 or 1/5 the warrior/monk/rogue damage and 1/3 the ranger damage, and cant get them to notice me even with stun/blind/root (see taunt increase) and run out of mana taunting.  Without a slight offensive increase or super taunt increase any defensive adjustment is useless.<P>2. Better 1hnd weapons.  YES!!!  It would be nice to have other weapons besides the GB which nobody uses past Wurmslayer (which warr and rang can use too).  Even on undead the DPS ratio with GB very slow proc rate levels out to about even damage rate. (tested on 8 hour period on proc rate to mob and proc rate to minutes fighting with a 137 dex).  The weapons like dark metal are soooo rare they are relics almost.<P>3.  Moral code/Quest thing.  GIVE US A CHOICE!  Give us comparable items for a bit more difficulty with equal or at least similar rewards for those who want to be real Paladins in game.  As it is now, there is no way to RP and you are killing our game by the quests you make.  Make Good quest/pretty hard for item 1, naughty pally quest/slightly less hard for item 2.  Then make item 1 = item 2.<P>4.  BASH.  Increase damage or give us critical hits AND increase skill cap over warriors.  Make more creatures bashable too in terms of the stun factor.<P>5.  RESURRECTION 39 no xp res, 49 50% xp res.  Easy and doesnt take away from cleric.  Many times the poor cleric is asked by half the dungeon to res a party when they fall.  Folks will have a person drag a corpse through the entire dungeon using invis and invis back after res through 60,000 mobs just for a 50 cleric res over a 46 cleric res.  These spells will not endanger the cleric turf.<P>** Disclaimer:  I think the warrior jealousy issue is fostered from our first 40 levels of having a chance in hell to solo.  We can root/park and heal ourselves and solo things pre40 no warrior could.  Post 40 and esp post 50 nothing is soloed if you are getting xp so it is grouping where we need to shine.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;clip&gt;<BR>A Ranger at 60 is a MUCH better class than a paladin. A Ranger's defensive deficiencies only manifest themselves when they and their group let the ranger hold aggro.<P>A paladin's glaring weakness is ALWAYS a detriment.<BR>&lt;clip&gt;<P>I love this hehe.  It is soo true.  Someone tried to refute the pal/monk and pal/pal scenario.  I think the pal/pal would do better because of the taunt issue.  But, nobody would want the paladin if a warrior or ranger was around because defense is so unimportant.  Here is how it would really happen.<BR>pal/pal<BR>The lack of offense situation is not that important as both are doing roughly close to same minimal damage and taking the damage reasonably well.  No taunt required because there is no war/mnk/rog/rng or caster pet doing WAY more damage.  <BR>mnk/pal, war/pal, rng/pal, rog/pal, caster(pet)/pal<BR>The lack of offense is critical in undermining this group.  The damage dealer is tearing up the mob and the pal is tickling his backside.  The defensive skills of paladin are USELESS because taunt is near worthless post 40 where the damage/hate relationship of a REAL damage dealer greatly exceed the poor damage even accented by a taunt/root/stun/blind.  The paladin is watching the damage dealers hp drop like a rock and cant get the mob to notice him even with the big flaming sword because he cant hit the creature.  He is stunning, rooting, and blinding away and so has not much mana left to heal, and his heals arent that great anyway.  His offensive input is minimal and defensive skills useless because he never got the creature to notice him.... at least until the mnk/war/rng/rog dies because they had inferior group support.  Then the paladin gets plenty of defensive exercise, but whats the point since his partner is dead.<BR>Questions to ask yourself<BR>1 Why would you have the paladin if you could have a cleric/druid/shaman if the paladin should back off attacking and become healer??<BR>2.  Why would you have a paladin if you could have a or another warrior/rogue/monk/ranger (or any caster class), if you think the paladin should continue to try and play tank??<P>** What other options do we have?  <BR>offense - no good, other classes better<BR>defense - no good, who cares if you never get to use it.<P>In short abashi, defense on a scale of 1 to 10 in a group is 2 importance and on a solo basis prob 10.  Offense in group is an 8 or 9 importance if not 10, and solo basis also 10.  <BR>Offense is shoreline property, defense is ghetto sewer.  In a group, who cares about defense if you dont have some way to use it???<P>We NEED more OFFENSE, or a super taunt and warrior level defense so we can practice our defense.<P>We NEED bash increase in damage and AC to offset the non duel wielding super penalty we take.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The simple fact is, with the price that people playing EQ are forced  to pay for failure (corpse runs, lost XP etc), they are always going to  choose the option with the least possibility of failure. They are going to choose the classes who perform certain roles better than any other, they are not going to choose a defensive tank with useless spells and a laughable damage output. As has been stated earlier -  Defense. Does. Not. Stack. <BR> <BR> When given the choice between a class with a high damage output who can also take a lot of damage, and a class that can't take as much, and outputs vastly less, what normal person is going to take the latter? Don't try to tell me that our spells make up for the vast gap between the two classes, because the people here who actually play the class know that they do not. <BR>              <BR> That is our problem. We are not useful within the dynamics of a game where our two parent classes dominate. <BR>              <BR> No one wants to be useful only when there is no other option. No one want to be obselete, but this is where we find ourselves as high level paladins.   <BR> What is our role?  <BR>              <BR> Are we defensive tanks? <BR>              <BR> The concept of the defensive tank, without a higher defensive skill than all others, is a vision that is doomed to failure. How can a class be defined by their defensive abilities, when those abilities are superceeded by classes who also have other advantages above and beyond defense? What are paladins the best at?  <BR>              <BR> What is the thing that makes people say "hey, let's get that paladin for our group"? <BR>              <BR> When you hear someone shout "group looking for war/pal/shd" you will know that the classes are balanced. <BR> <BR> "Mad hatter"'s vision still says it best: <BR>               <BR>   Monk - 70%O 30%D <BR>   Ranger - 60%O 40%D (spells included) <BR>   Warrior - 50%O 50%D <BR>   Pally - 30%O 70%D (spells included) <BR>   SK - 40%O 60%D (spells included) <BR>              <BR>              </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great ideas, though some serious issues not addressed Absor.<P>Without getting into the nitty-gritty of your list, take a step back and look at what you want to have happen overall.<P>Warriors need to be 'the best' (baseline) at both taking damage and dealing damage when compared to hybrids (ranger/sk/pally).<P>Pallys then need several things to happen to cement them in a 'shield-bearer' role.<P>1) MANY of the pally problems revolve around their equipment.  Ro is insanely difficult mid level quest armor.  Valo? heh, been to PoF many times.  I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to take Fetid Fiends (a minority already in PoF) and then only make the MALE ones drop pally armor?!  Way out of line.  But putting that aside, pally's NEED access to armor that is in line with warrior AC.  Warriors get worried about hybrids replacing them but lets all have an honest look.  If verant FOCUSES attention on one area (i.e. offense vs defense) instead of trying to make hybrids (pallys or whatever) significantly better at both I think all will come out happier.<P>Pally's NEED better shields and 1h weapons (both blunt and slashing) at ALL level ranges.  That theologian claymore you have on your list?  Have you actually looked at that piece of crap?  It's like 7 delay better than an AXE OF THE IRON BACK.  Which is pathetic.  Sure it has + to a few lame stats (int and sta I believe?).<P>All in all, make paladins a warriors equal on defensive terms.  Change around the one handed weapons a little so they don't suck real hard in dmg out put while they are tanking.  And give them some decent discs (that one about taking damage in place of someone else is the best idea I've heard for the pally class as a whole in a long time).  Pally's will never get dual wield, and I doubt their weapons will ever get near uber enough to be able to touch a warrior in dmg output (not even mentioning skill caps here).<P>Make pallys a warriors equal defensively.<BR>Make sure rangers are a warrior equal offensively.<P>SKs? eh...hehe well figure out something for them to be.<P>DO NOT try and toss pallys a bone or two.  Please make some meaningful and large changes to this class as a whole.  Out of all the high level people I adventure with I would say the paladin class deserves these kinds of changes the most.  Find someone that plays a pally at verant, Absor.  Just sit down and talk with him/her for 10 minutes, I'm confident they will tell you something along these very same lines.<P>Thanks for listening =)<P>--Cadsuane, Cleric of Innoruuk<P>P.S. have a look at Afterlife's recruitment requirements.  Specifically this line:<P>"The level requirement for Paladins is not a typo.  Please do not harass the Afterlife guildleaders about Paladin usefulness. "<P>Notice what the level requirement for all of the hybrids is?  Druids and wizards are wanted in about the same amounts.  Since druids make up 1/4 of any given server population (ok that's an exageration but there are alot of them and they are all high level because they level so easily) that's understandable.  And wizards...heh well.<P>Food for thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's a pretty accurate summary.

</FONT><HR>My friends have been asking why I haven't been logging in recently.  I'd taken a break from EQ for a bit, having become burned out on the options available to my Paladin.  Finding groups is becoming rather difficult; it's *extremely* disencouraging to throw out shouts and /OOCs every few minutes for a period of twenty and get *zippo* responses to your requests for a group.<P>I would raid, but unless I know the people handling the raid, they have little interest in inviting a Paladin along to roll for stuff when (s)he won't return enough usefulness to recomp what (s)he might win on the raid.<P>I was holding out for the posting of the Paladin list, and the rapid adjustments following said posting I am/was hoping would appear in game.<P>The list, however, disappoints me severely.  The changes listed are minor, and seem to fail to address the main concerns I have as a high level Paladin.  I need to be useful and valuable to my fellow EQ players; bottom line.  I shouldn't have to 'make my case' when looking for a spot to fill.  Enchanters and Clerics don't have to 'make a case'.  Warriors, Monks and Rogues don't have to 'make a case' for theirs.  Why should I be reduced to begging just for the right to play?  I guess chosing a Paladin is supposed to be a humbling experience, designed to teach me the limits of my ego.  So far, it's working.  I have such little ego left I fear even a personality transfer with The Fonz might not save me.<P>The omission of the Resurrection line is extremely disappointing.  Rez would give Paladins a needed skill and make us valuable.  It has been noted only one class can offer rez (specifically, XP rez, which is what people want when they need a rez), while other market spells are avaiable from multiple sources.  Absor left it off the list, which I assume means it's not under consideration for balance additions; I find that to be a very bad omen.<P>Looking over the things that are listed, I don't see enough to bring up one of the least balanced classes in the game.  Unless some better news comes along, I'll give it another few weeks, then I'll probably be canceling my account again.  This time for good, to wait for DAoC or something else that gives me the chance to *play* the game I pay for.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>This is not a 'I told you so', but rather a regret.  I'd like to LIKE Everquest, but with the current state and future-look of things ... don't see that happening.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Dave's World<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok,<BR> I have watched this thread for a long time and kept quiet until I saw this list of Final items. For the most part, the Action items are ok. But I have to agree with the people posting here on the problem with Paladin Offense.<BR> As I see it, Paladin's should not be massive Damage dealers, but we need to be able to hit things for god's sake. I pretty much gave up on my 52 Paladin because of the fact that I am useless except for Chain stunning. <BR> I think Paladin's should have a 1h Slash attack cap increase. Comparitively, the Rangers and Warriors have Dual weild and will always do Double to Triple the Damage output of a Paladin with comparable weapons, as it is now, with the Low Offensive Skill cap on 1h Slash and the fact that we only swing about half the time of dual weilders and add the fact that our Attack Skill caps are lower... We are just whiff-o-matic's in platemail.<BR> Please do an honest assessment of the Paladin Offensive mechanism, if this is fixed, and I cn actually hit something for respectable damage with a 1h weapon and Shield or even a 2h weapon for that matter, I may actually go back to playing my paladin again as opposed to my Necro or Warrior. Because the Paladin is still my favorite class to be, just no longer very enjoyable to play.

</FONT><HR>Problem:<BR>The biggest problem for paladins now is that defense doesn't stack. You can have one warrior sucking up and doing all the damage while the paladin is doing a poor impersonation of a rogue. <P>Proposal:<BR>What I propose is make it so it does. Give paladins a gaurd ability which would allow a paladin to use his shield to block npc's attacks kinda like a bash technique that interrupts melee damage but doesn't return it. And this ability wouldn't have to just work when the paladin is standing toe to toe with the npc it would be used to lower the npc's attacks overall protecting the whole group. It would kinda be like the paladin following the npc around gaurding all the group members.<P>What it accomplishes:<BR>Having an ability like this would allow paladins to aid warriors and not have to compete as much with them, also it would save the cleric mana. The ability would allow the paladin to act as a medium without really tredding on anyones turf, and would give paladins something unique to bring to the table. This could also allow for the possiblity for new disciplines to open up too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a level 50 paladin. My paladin is my ONLY character (not counting my level 3 mule :P). I have 50 days, 20 hours and some odd minutes played on my paladin. I know my class backwards and forwards. I know where we fail, I know where we excel (and yes, up until a certain point, we do excel in some areas not immediately visible just by looking at a paladin's spell and skill list). After all, I have spent a heck of a lot of time playing a paladin. I posted numerous times in the talk threads about what our class needed to be wanted and balanced; not overpowered, just wanted and useful in the post 50 game.<P>Absor, frankly, your talk list is pathetic. <P>You have totally ignored, for whatever reasons, many great suggestions. I am not saying this to be insulting. I had very high hopes that the paladin's concerns might at least be discussed. I spent a LOT of time researching the ideas I posted. I spoke to a good 75% of the other post-50 paladins on my server. To my surprise and delight, when I came to these boards to post my ideas, I discovered that nearly everything I had discovered, collected, and created was in sync with the concerns of the rest of the paladins from the rest of the servers. Sadly, a great deal of those concerns were just simply ignored here.<P>I am not at my home computer with all my files right now, so I cannot post a better list at this time. Rest assured that, once I get home this evening, I will post a list much better than the laughable assortment of items Absor currently has up.<P>Until then, I urge my fellow paladins to let Absor know that he totally dropped the ball on this one....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few quick observations from a level 55 Pally that has played since Beta.<P>1. The most accurate statement made.  "Defense does not stack".  Only one person gets hit at a time.  You want the warrior to be taking ALL the hits as he has a) the most hit points thus making the best use of Complete Heal and b) he has the most AC, thus taking the least damage and making the Cleric's mana last longer.<P>2.  Corollary. Offense does stack.  Everyone beats on the mob the whole fight except for the Cleric who meds and maybe the Enchanter who does crowd control.  Hell with the MR of some of the Velious mobs our druids and shaman frequently get in there and swing when they are FM.   Therefore, the Paladin need more offensive skill since the warrior is doing the tanking.<P>3.  The Paladin class below level 50 is FINE. Don't waste any effort on it there.<P>4.  One really good buff that would stack with all other spells would be better than all the buffs we have now put together.<P>5.  Make all of our melee skills be 10 below those of a warrior of the same level.  At level 60 let us have the same melee skill levels as those of a warrior to make up for not getting tripple attack.  Or, at least let us max out Double Attack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yandros you make the statement that the Paladin is fine below level 50.  That is your opinion, but since you have no current experience playing a Paladin below 50 in the current game, your opinion has absolutely no basis in fact.  You have been playing since beta.  Hoorah for you.  You probably were above 30 before the Kunark changes came out and most certainly before the Velious changes, so keep your comments at the level you know something about, and let those of us who play at the lower levels concern ourselves with that game.<P>I went into Crushbone last night with my 32 Pally,  I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop in and help out the newbies and their trains.  So, I fought Dvinn several times.  He conned even to my son, who plays a level 20 Chanter.  I have average armor that I earned myself (AC 638).  No Uber guild twinks.  I carry a Blade of Xalgoz (2hs).  My skills for offense are all at 165 (max for my level).  Buffed, I had 1028 hp.  I hit Dvinn 44 percent of the time, for a mode of 51 damage, average was 48.  Parsing the melee, I took 5.36 damage per second, I dished out 6.25 damage per second.  I lost 80 percent of my health soloing a mob that was 12 levels below me.  If I were using a lesser weapon, I would have died to that mob.<P>Yet you think this is "fine".  I wholeheartedly disagree.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm glad to see the initial list posted here (and remember guys, it's an initial list, post your concerns in an organized, coherent fashion and they stand a better chance of getting addressed!)<P>What I see (from a broader perspective) are a couple of things.  First, you have the desire for Paladins to be useful near the end game.  Why take my Level 57 char to a Dain raid, or Zlandicar, Sleepers, etc, when a warrior (yes, or Ranger or Bard) will do betteer?  They all at least bring something unique and useful to the party whereas a Paladin (and probably the SK too) do not.<P>Secondly, there are the requests to make Paladin's more desirable in the "small" camps.  I suspect every Paladin out there has had to suffer through the "can't find a group no matter what nights".  <P>Both requests mean we need something unique, something not currently in the game, to add to the show.  I fully understand that Lay Hands in a unique ability, but it, like an SK's Death Touch, is not sufficient unto itself.  It doesn't get us invited into pickup groups, nor does it want the guild motivated to make sure we're at the "big raid" of the week.<P>All the talk of increasing both the offense and defense are fine, and healthy discussion about it's merits are probably welcomed.  Everyone seems to agree about the defense, but perhaps that is just the fact that we've been conditioned by VI to accept that kind of role for a Paladin.  The offense caps have already produced some spirited debate, and opinion is divided.  Fair enough, that should leave VI free to do what they will (not saying they couldn't anyway, hehe.)<P>The question becomes, how do you (esp. in the light of trying to balance all the classes) get people to "want" to play a Paladin?  How do you get other classes to say, damn, lets find a Paladin to round out this group, or help us kill this dragon, etc.?  I think there are a number of good ideas already out there, in this thread and others.  Some people have asked for a better discipline than HolyForge (admittedly I use it, um, in the Crypt or Howling Stones, and that's about it.  And yes, it was pretty fun to get that 304 point crippling blow...hehe.)  In my mind Fearless is fairly useless too.  If Verant goes the discipline route, lets modify both of those, or replace them entirely, for something that sets us apart from everyone else.  If I were into comparing classes, I'd say compare Trueshot to Holyforge and ask yourself if there is ANY balance there at all.  /grin<P>Others have suggested we modify our spell line, and this has merit as well.  While we'll never be clerics, certainly we could increase our cleric type buffs and heals to make us more effective secondary healers.  Naltron's Mark at 60 is an interesting idea...  I'd also like to suggest that we get a spell (or line) that is unique to the Paladin.  I've been thinking about this for a couple of weeks actually, admittedly from a big guild raid perspective.  How about a spell, or line of spells (FOR THE GROUP) that lets all 6 of us resist Poison for 60 seconds and has a recast time of 5 minutes?  And add one for disease, heat, cold, and even magic near the level 60 mark.  If you make them non-stackable (only one can be cast at a time) then you don't unbalance anything and you provide a "VERY" good reason to drag a Paladin on your dragon slaying raid.  ( I envisioned this spell line as something like "Glaive of Karana, Glaive of Prexus, Glaive of Marr", etc etc....<P>Anyway, that's just one idea, and I'm sure other people have better ones.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But let's not forget that balance doesn't mean we can't be unique too.  I like playing a Paladin, and have no issue being part warrior and part cleric.  I just think it would benefit the class greatly if playing a Paladin had a little bit more to offer than 30% warrior, 30% cleric, and 40% ineffectiveness. ;p<P>Oh, and Absor, thank you very much for the effort, the posts, and the times.  I know much of your job is thankless based on some of the responses you get, but I for one appreciate the concern and effort.  That as much as anything else will keep my $10 a month rolling into your company's bank account.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For crying out loud stop asking for the darn horse, they've already said NO.  Nothing like that in the global build and the remaining space in the global build should be used for enchanters, not us.  <P>We need a defensive improvement and maybe an offensive bump.  (Make a 60 paladin as good as a 55 warrior, rather than a 50 or something like that.  When both are at 50 the paly offensive skills are 10 (count em) 10 points behind warriors.  Warriors weren't offended then, why not get us a little closer to what we were at 50?  Warriors jumped a great deal from 50 to 60, paladins jumped very little.<P>Oh and another thing.  Paladins really should have crits/crips versus undead.  Yes, the exact same code that warriors use.  The fact that we weren't more offensive versus undead from the beginning has always bothered me a great deal.  I really like the paladin personna and tend to play it in most roleplaying games.  The paladin of EQ is by far the weakest paladin personna I've played.  I really like it because I like the image, but some beefing up is definately in order.<P>Jaread Warforge<BR>Paladin of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please stop clouding these posts with nonsense. We are supposed to be thinking about things the Paladins need, not dream of having. These little dreams include<P>- insane quests: Quests are fine<BR>- The dropping of books for FA quest: Drop rate is fine<BR>- Binding: Not Needed<BR>- Summon or illusion to a horse: ???? are u serious??<P>Please try and post something rational that you honestly believe that we can't possibly continue as a class unless we get it, or don't post at all. There are valid posts that get ignored because of this stupidity.<P><BR>Sir Zaph<BR>Lvl 56 Paladin<BR>Saryrn<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From what I understand giving us the same Skill level as a Warrior of the same level will not do anything for out Hit-Miss ratio, nor our Damage output. We use a different "ToHit" table than warriors do, (Abor please correct me if I am wrong) so it would not have the effect you think it would. But this is easily tested, get a Warrior and Paladin of the same skill level and log their hit-mis results,. You would see that with equal skill levels the Warrior still hits more and harder. What we need is the "ToHit" chart to be reviewed, and a minimum damage per weapon set. This would give us the effect you are looking for, and not upset all the Warriors out there.<P>And for all those out there who think the proposed list would do nothing for Paladins your way off, you need to read the whole list and the list I posted from the ShadowKnights list. If we could get all of these changes, we would be a lot better off than we have ever been. <P>Lets just review both lists of proposed changes:<P>Better shields and some form of extra shield use skill (and 1handed weapons we can hope)<BR>Our Spell list reviewed<BR>Our Casting times reviewed<BR>Increased Skill levels for Defensive skills<BR>Increased ability to Stun                             <BR>Increased Bash skill level and Damage<BR>Yaulp 4 added to our spell list<BR>Increased Taunt skill level<BR>New minimum damage on 2H weapons (hopefully this would apply to 1H weapons as well)<BR>Deepwater armour effects reviewed (and changed  to Clerical spells we dont get))<BR>Spell Fizzles<BR>An increased ability to cover SKs Archery increase<BR>More HPs<BR>A new discipline to replace Holy Forge<BR>Crits against undead always<BR>Fix and upgrade LoH<P>And my favorite WHITE ARMOUR!! (Finely after almost 2 years, I could look like the Paladin on the box cover.) <P>I think that most Paladins deep down would be very happy with theses proposed changes, and the ones on the Test Server.<P>We will cover the super low drop rates of our quest items when Absor does his quest list : )<P>Until then may Tunare smile on your questing..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
