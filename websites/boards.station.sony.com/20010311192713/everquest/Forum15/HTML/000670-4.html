From DoTs to Debuffs, everything about us is offense. <BR>VI says we're 3/4 warrior, but we're plainly not. <BR>The higher you go in level, the farther that gap widens, especially post 50.<BR>VI says we're 1/4 necromancer, and we're not even that.

I can't dish out massive amounts of damage to the mobs I face, BLUE mobs. <BR>Or, if the reason my tanking ability stinks so bad is because of my spells, then somebody damn well better take a look at our spell line, because as it stands this pathetic second hand crap we're recieving several *several* levels after  our parent class is NO reason for a melee deficit.<P>Dravyn <BR>Retired 51 SK<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to add this:<P>If we are supposed to be a more defensive class, then our hp should be raised.  If we are supposed to be a more offensive class, then please look into rasing our offensive capabilities.  I thought that we were the yang to the paladin yin, but perhaps I merely misread the intentions of the classes.<P>Props for taking into account the possible name change on the epic weapon.  I like the idea of a non-deity specific weapon.<P>Pets.  The main coincern with pets is that they do not hit enough, and this is due to the fact that they are such a comparatively lower level than the opponents we are fighting.  I'm not saying that we should get pets equal to necros, but they need to be more useful. As it is, I rarely use my pet, whether soloing or in a group, because it is generaly not worth the mana that is used to create it.  Just make them hit more often, even if the levels and/or total damage is not increased.<P>Good job overall!!<P>Kircane<BR>The lesser of two evils is still me</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>  Hmm.<P>  PoG armour: Get used to it being gold, it's gold for every class. (why argue it's not going to change).<P>  Missing: Why do de sk's miss so much? By 'much' I mean about half the time on a blue mob.<P>  SK Pets: Get rid of all of them and give us our PP back, they are mostly useless and a complete waste of time. By the time the pet becomes able to help kill the mob without dying from three hits, the mob is green. Why use a pet.<P>Ok, now the big point.. sorta long because I wanted reasoning in it.<P>  (1/4th necro) SK/Necro spells. When necro spells get changed so do the according sk spells (both plusses and minuses, please remind someone of that). Besides there being a greater difference in spell level as SK's go up levels compared to necros (spells become weaker comparitivly). Besides having the our mana based on half what the necro's was (per it) **and has been removed, so they are the same now**. We still have the mana penalty (costs more mana for us to cast than necro's), and we have the time penalty (our spells take longer to cast than the necro ones), plus the spells are of a lower level (that part is expected). <P>  (3/4th warrior) fighting ability: Ok so sk's are envisioned to be a specific amount less than warriors in offence and defense (and do not use percentages when figuring this out, it will increase the difference as war/sk get higher in levels). So the vision says sk's should be 20 points below warriors on defense *made up number*, and 35 points below warriors on offense. Ok, we can't tank, and we don't do much melee dmg. we can deal with that but with one exception. <P>**absor if your reading this is the important part**<BR>**********<BR> I have the feeling that it was envisioned originally, or the designers felt it but may have not wrote it in black and white that: If you break each class into their abilities and assign values for such abilities ie: melee offense, caster offense, healing, buffing, melee defense, caster defense (pets, root, fear), special abilities (ie: feign death/pulling). That when you add all these together and compare them among race/classes that each should have a equal number (or close to). The point of this is, ok, give sk's lower offense and defense than warriors, but then spells should make up for it to make us equal. (do they? and I'm not being sarcastic either.) <BR>Compare the following to warriors (warriors being the wonderful base class)<BR>-Clerics are assigned points under healing which compared to warrior offense/defense points make them equal. <BR>-Rogues have alot more offense points but much less defense points plus the special of evade.<BR>-Rangers have comparable if not more offense points, have marginally less defense and have buffing points as well as the special of tracking.<P>Making sure each class/race combination is close to equal and that each has a useable use isn't easy (and the class talks are a great start), but needs to be done and with a fair end result.<BR>**********<P>  Thanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seems like alot of you don't really analyze things. You accept what is told to you. How do you figure a class that is supposed to be the combination of (hybrid) a warrior the most offensive oriented melee class in the game then cross it with a necromancer which has a reputation of being the king of solo which would make him offense and get a defensive hybrid? When in groups I ask warriors what there AC is and get back consistantly, numbers 50 plus higher and my shadow knight is a twink! Think about the word defense. Things that you run across usually mean heavy fortification, shadow knights don't display that quality. If you are a defensive class why can you not take punishment or maybe even avoid it. My agility is not higher then a warriors upon creation look it up. You get more defense from an offensive warrior. Ever played a caster? I have and I feel much safer standing behind a warrior that is inflicting high damage which is taunting the mob to defend itself as I cast spells that inflict 500dd in an instant. I have been in groups with only a shadow knights to do the tanking. What does that do for a group? Well lets see. I stand behind a shadow knight casting that same 500dd spell and aggro the mob. I am not getting beat on by the mob. The healer in the group most now expend mana to heal the heavy damage taking caster type (me) and repair the damage inflicted on the (defensive?) shadow knight with the lower then warrior AC. Fact is most casters would have a warrior defend them any day of the week if given the chose warrior or shadow knight. I see alot of OOC SK LFG or Pali LFG hehe. The class needs to be revamped. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok.. Pets are a solo'ing tool??<P>The point is that pets are not even a tool at all.. They only thing i find them useful for is to go around and whack a few REALLY green mobs (like spiderlings, spiders, lions etc when i need silk, pelts etc). They make the job a little faster.. They are also handy to bring out for practicing spells on while i'm sitting around fishing and/or chatting.<P>Really, the pets are useless. They're currently a toy. Have any of you actually looked at the amount of dmg the pets do total? When i solo my pet does around 50dmg to a mob (with about 1500hp) over the course of a fight, whilst i am double attacking for upto 73dmg x 2 (146dmg). It's a joke, i lost interest in my pet and only bring him out for the reasons i stated before. He just gets in the way (seriously he gets in my way and i get "You are too far away to attack" sometimes or whatever that msg is, because my pet is getting in the way of me catching up to a feared mob - i have a hard enough time catching up due to lag without my pet getting in the damn way), pulls a whole bunch of mobs onto me (from green all the way to red), does little dmg, wastes a whole wad of mana, and chews up bone chips that i could sell for a nice profit to some impatient necro on his way to a raid or something.<P>So if you think the pet is a solo'ing tool and you don't want to increase it from the state of utterly useless - just delete the pet line of spells and give us something we can use then, because i dont use my pet much at all. How about some unique shadowknight spells that nobody else has? (something that should've been done from day 1, *nudge* *nudge*)<P>Forget pet buffs too.. What was it i saw you were going to do, a 5% haste mini-buff? +5ac +5atk was it? Sheesh... What good will that do for a lvl 20 pet up against lvl 35-45 mobs? None! Huzzah! With 5% haste my pet now does 52dmg in a fight instead of 50dmg. Ooo +5atk! My GOD he's now doing.. 53dmg in fight! And +ac? Well i won't even go there.. Ever let your pet tank? Heh.. Bye bye Gonabob. My spells and dmg are so mean that my pet can't taunt the mob off anyway. Besides my channeling skill is great so i don't get interrupted enough to need a pet to take the hits.<P>Bump the pet spells up a few. At level 39 i should've got a hmm.. 29 necro pet, not the 20 pet (i see 24 is research only).. At level 30 i should've got the level 20 necro pet, not the 16 pet..<P>I read those parses people did of fights. So lets say a warrior does 5000dmg, an sk 2500dmg, and the sks pet, 50dmg lol! So what if that sk pet started to do 1000dmg.. We're still only doing 3500dmg, way under the warrior's dmg, and they still get their hp and their extra parries and dodges and ripostes and dual wields and extra ac and kicks and criticals and this and that.. Don't even think about spells either because they add very very little to a fight and i rarely use dots because the fight either doesn't go for long enough, the spells are too hard to stick, they use up FAR too much mana to do a pathetic amount of dmg, or they're being overwritten by another necro or whoever.. I only cast them (debuffs only, 98% of the time) to look good really, to trick the group into thinking i'm actually doing something useful, and it makes me feel better knowing here's those few little extra (yet perhaps pointless) debuff/steal boxes in my buff window.. Not to mention lag's always a bit of fun. I'm so powerful i can CRASH PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS AND/OR CONNECTION! Bwahaha! Oh yeah and i make wizards jealous with my "ice storm" (shadow vortex & shroud of hate).<P><BR>Oh and remember, pets aren't just a solo'ing tool. Have you ever seen a necro NOT use his pet in a group? That's all they do sometimes, just sit there and /pet attack. It's a group thing too.<P>What ISN'T a solo'ing tool anyway?! Nothing!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Warriors armor is multiplied by 1.6 to figure out total armor class. Pal/SK is multiplied by 1.5. That's 1 extra AC for every 10 AC your armor gives. <P>#2. Warrior armor is typically 4-9 AC higher than the equavelent Pal/SK armor post Kunark. Bracers are 20 vs 16. BP is 45 vs 40. Non-legs are 25 vs 21 (except for gloves which are 25 vs 16??).  Legs are 26 vs 35???. That's a free 43 AC, plus the added 1 AC for every 10 means with just RoK/PoG armors, warriors run 352 AC while Pal/SKs run 265 AC. That's a difference of 87 on visible armor pieces alone. <P>#3. Warriors have a higher defensive cap than Pal/SK. Warrior defense caps at 250, Pal/SK caps at 230. The extra 20 defense adds 60 AC. This on top of superior armor gives warriors a 147 AC advantage. <P>#4. Warriors have higher dodge, parry, and reposit skill caps. These are intangable, but definatly effect total damage intake. <P>#5. Warriors have higher hitpoints than Pals/SKs. Especially considering warriors get additional hitpoint bumps at certain levels that hybrids don't, and the fact that only shadowknights can be large races with huge stamina stats. Dwarves are the only hybrid that start with 100 sta. This makes CHs more effecient on warriors. <P>#6. Warriors have the Defensive Discipline. This gives them the ability to tank an ubermob while allowing a cleric or a battery of clerics a prayer in hell of keeping them alive. Zretch (my SK) has died as quickly as one combat round to Trakanon. Defensive and huge hitpoint pools give warriors a fighting chance. <P>In my opinion, Verant should be adjusting #2 and #6 and leaving all else alone. #2 would keep our relationship to warriors about the same as a ranger's relationship to warriors on the offensive side. Same quality of equipment, lacking the skills to use it as effecitvly. (We are knights in shining armor, after all)  #6 would give us a fighting chance to actually receive a cleric heal against mobs that hit over 600. I would probably give them the level 52 Defensive Disc. It helps, but it isn't nearly as good as the 55 one. Also double the timer on it so it only refreshes once every half hour. <P>Anyway, if hybrids are going to get a defensive upgrade, I would give it to them in the armor/disc area.  Warriors should be more skilled but in no way should a Knight have inferior equipment.  This would still allow warriors to keep their skill superiority, their ubermob tanking superiority (we have a defensive skill, just not the best one), and their hitpoint superiority, making them a more effecient and effective tank in all ways, but allowing hybrids to use their spells to greater effect when versatility is called for.  ie, balanced.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seeing as though I've leveled to 60 as a TSK, I will put my $0.02 in.<P>If I'm not on a raid where a warrior is a must to even do the raid, I am usually one of the tanks, of some sort, be it dwarfs, giants, frogs, and various other **** that doesn't need defensive to tank. I've come to cope with the fact that hybrid melee, specifically Paladin/SK melee is going to be less efficient as pure melee counterparts. Do I believe we should have our melee skills increased? That would be nice, don't see it happening though, because rangers are the offensive class that use chain based armor and spells, SK/Paladin are plate based classes with spells.<P>Therefore, I contest that plate wearing classes should have the ability to defend themselves via a /disc. Now, some would want to say "leechcurse lets you defend yourself, because it heals you." Well thats nice for the 15 seconds that its up. Depending on the mob, I might not hit him for 20 seconds. Alot of good a disc will do me when to heal myself I have to hope that I'm good with the rolls and actually connect in the time the disc is running.<P>The type disc I propose we get would be the Evasive discipline that warriors recieve at 52, this includes Paladins as well if they want it. In no way would that make a warrior less desireable. Yet it would increase our ability to help on raids, even if its just to tank an add for just a bit longer. <P>Gumug Da`Basher<BR>Da`Kor<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SPELL FIZZLE NOTE: DISMISS UNDEAD<P>Absor, I am one of the few SKs (it seems) who has actually put my Evocation spells to use. The trouble with most SK's regarding this spell line (as you noted in your list) is that we receive NO evocation spells before level 22. Which means many SKs never train up the skill once they do get their first evocation, primarily because the spell *ward undead* is pretty weak. Thus many SKs do not use the line as they don't want to waste time trying to raise the skill from "0". Laziness if you ask me.<P>BUT, here is what I want to point out. I personally have put alot of work into my evocation. My skill in Evoc is now at 203 and the level 39 spell "expulse undead" works great, fairly fast and even while being beat on, I can channel through and usually get the spell off.<P>But once I received the 49 evoc spell "Dismiss Undead" suddenly my fizzles went through the proverbial roof. I can cast "expulse" all day long and maybe fizzle 1 out of 5 times. But I cast "dismiss" and I fizzle 5 out of 6 times. No lie, it is that bad.<P>With a 200+ skill in evocation, why is the fizzle rate on Dismiss Undead so high? Seriously, the spell is useless with fizzles like that. I go through a third of my mana just fizzling this spell. <P>I spent alot of time developing this skill. I was pleased to see the work paying off with the proficiency I was achieveing with these spells. Then at 49, it's like I suddenly am back to an evocation skill of about 70. Instead of 200+<P>Is this right? Can you ask about this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Short and sweet, my thoughts:<P>1. Defense Skill Cap - Good change, possibly too much (on test).  Consider balanced offense/defense instead of all defense upgrade as I think we're between rangers and paladins.<BR>2.  Parry - ok<BR>3.  Hit Points - not a prime concern<BR>4.  Bash skill Cap - raising this makes sense<BR>5.  Better shield use - unnecessary and would be too much trouble for little gain<BR>6.  Better shield stuns - I like this idea, but not sure under which conditions it would be justified (i.e. discipline, level based like warrior kick-stuns, etc.)<BR>8.  Better 2-hander - Personally I feel that 2 handers need their minimum damage raised.  Fast one handers are still superior even after the damage bonus adjustments.  But for SKs specifically I don't feel we need an "incentive" to use them.<BR>9.  Taunt - we can already taunt just fine.  It would border on being perverse to add to this<BR>10.  Archery - This is unnecessary.  Archery is for pulling, and teh damage it does is minimal anyway.<BR>11.  Pets - The pets between levels 15 and 49 aren't useful.  The pet buff on the test server might address this.<BR>12.  Spell Review - The new spells on test are nice, but I'm not sure if the post-50 spell changes were necessary.<BR>13.  Casting Times - this is a great idea that would let us actually use teh higher level spells, and I think the changes being tested would work nicely.<BR>14.  Lifeleech - this quest is comparable in difficulty and price to the other hybrid spells, and is very powerful for it's level.  Nothing needs to be changed here.<BR>16.  Lifetap DOT's - these should probably stack with the cleric versions<BR>17.  Lifetaps - On test high level SKs now have more powerful lifetaps from the necro line.  These aren't very useful because of the long cast times (possibly ties in to #13).  This change is kind of pointless, especially since large encounter npc's can't be lifetapped anyway.  If Verant feels that they definately should add more lifetaps to our spell list, consider making an upgrade to Life Leech (high mana cost/recast in exchange for lowered casting time)<BR>18.  Gather Shadows - Acceptable at the level we get it.<BR>19.  Voice Graft - available via an item, not a real issue, but not exactly a balance issue either<BR>20.  Vamp Embrace - this spell is fine as is.  Upgrading it to necro levels would invalidate Shroud of Death and be unbalancing.  Proc rate is pretty random but acceptable.<BR>21.  Grim Aura - I don't see the point in this being added (it's on test server now), but others seem to like it<BR>22.  Low level evoc's - Not an issue since you can practice this by casting on skeleton pets.<BR>24.  Blood Ember - Weight is in line with other class armors since the few pieces that were out of whack have been fixed.  Perhaps you meant Darkforge armor?<BR>25.  Unholy Aura - This discipline already adds enough damage to make it useful, and lifetapping 5% of the damage it does wouldn't change anything. (That's 75 points at level 60 btw)<BR>26.  Leechcurse - This does need to be improved.  I support the changes being tested on the test server as a way to balance this.<BR>27.  Ashenbone - I always agreed with this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It would be cool, and you could justify it by saying the rangers get wolf form (which actually has positive effects).<P>The reason I want it so badly is because I'm a fatty.  All troll/ogre classes have some form of shrink (cobalt bracer for warriors, shrink spell for shammys).  The SK's can only use shrink potions (expensive and annoying) and Amulet of Necropotence (always goes to casters).  This would add to our self-reliant nature, would be little trouble to add it seems, wouldn't be argued as being over-powering, and it certainly would be cool.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A note on Leechcurse...<P>This idea of healing the dmg that you deal is pretty useless on uber mobs.  Think of how pathetic SK dmg is.  I'd say that against a Kunark dragon the whole discipline would heal you enough to make up for 1 round of dmg from the mob when it was all said and done.<P>Consider this: Bards get a dodge disc at 55.  SKs and Paladins don't get any dodge/parry/riposte disc even at 60.  Fair?  I don't think so.  When bards are "tanks", then they can have their disc.  This is totally imbalanced.  All tanks should be able to tank an uber mob for their 15 seconds or whatever.  Warriors, rogues, and monks are all better tanks than SKs on uber mobs now.  Paladins at bear minimum have LoH and Divine Aura to help them out.<P>2 possible fixes:<P>1) The obvious dodge/parry/riposte disc to replace leechcurse<P>2) HARMSHIELD!  The Paladins get Divine Aura.  Seems only fair that we would get Harmshield to reciprocate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That way we can at least contribute.<P>I think we need this in addition to upped offenive and defensive caps, along with even brining leech curse to 60% of the effectivness of warior defensive, and reudcued cast times for post 50 spells, upped bash cap, making HT lure based so it at least does partil dmage, not fully reissted, better spells (add posion/desiset dots,<BR>replace boil blood with ignite,replace 57 vamp curse with bond of death and upgrade banshee aura to 20 or so per hit and or make it stack with ALL other damage shiled forms, or give it an ac component or let it be a lifetap dmage shiled (best imo)<P>To me all the above changes along with the stuff on test now would make sks an excellent raiding and grouping class and actaull desired almost as much as a wariior on a riad or for exp grouping  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Here are my thoughts on the list.<P>The ability for a SK/Pally bash to interrupt currently uninterruptable casters is the most important change on the list.  I think it would create the need for SKs/Pallies on the major raids.<P>Summon Corpse.  I think the reason SKs pointed at Summon Corpse is because they think SC is considered a part of the balance.<P>SC is useful but only to us SKs.  If I die while exploring, it's a good way to get my own corpse back.<P>SC will never get us an invite to a raid because necros can do much better with the level 57 corpse summon.<P>If you want us to have a summon corpse spell that is actually useful, make a SK only version of it that uses stackable coffins that are heavier and more expensive than level 57 necro coffins and raise the level of the spell to 57 or higher.<P>Archery.  There is no reason to cap archery at skill 75.  Raise it.  However, this will not balance SK either way.  Do not consider it a balancing change.<P>Disarm.  This skill should have a high cap for SKs.  It is a defensive skill, you disarm a dual wielding NPC and the NPC's damage output goes down.  Definitely defensive and helpful but only if the cap is high.  Currently it's capped at 70 which is usefull for disarming level 5 skeletons in Nektulos forest... after about three attempts.  Raise it to 252.<P>Leechcurse.  Our level 60 discipline is unused currently.  Needs improvements.<P>Defense/dodge/riposte/parry.  As defensive class we should have all of these skills capped higher than currently.  You already raised defense on Test, the other three need raises as well.  If you have to choose, riposte would be the SKish skill to raise.<P>Shield disciplines/skills.  Make this BASH disciplines/skills.  Remember, our epic weapon is two handed and BASH enabled.  Either that or allow us to trade our two handed epic weapon for a one handed epic weapon and shield.<P>Spells.  Lowering casting times on high level offensive spells is a good step.  One more thing to do would be to actually make MOBs that are not immune to these spells.  Boss-type MOBs.  Not one of my offensive spells lands on boss-type MOBs (with very few exceptions.)  Our spells is what balances us with pure melee classes, yet we cannot utilize them on a lot of MOBs therefore making us inferior to pure melee classes.<P>One possible solution is to replace our high level spells with SK only spells that do exact same thing but have normal resistances against all MOBs, including boss-type MOBs.<P>That's about all I can think of now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(2)<BR>Heh, any SK that can't taunt a normal mob off anyone else is asleep.  Best give this to warriors.<P>---<P>ITEM: Archery. (1)<BR>This is a waste, we only use this to pull *sometimes*.  We're not doing it for damage, so it doesn't matter if we miss.<P>---<P>ITEM: Pets. (3)<BR>Our pets are pretty worthless, and rightfully so.  We use them so infrequently, an upgrade probably wouldn't change much.  Lots of Sks pull, and you can't pull with a pet very easily.<P>---<P>ITEM: Spell Review. (7)<BR>Don't through us a few bones.  Give us something that will do some good in the endgame.  Lower resists of taps on ubermobs. See next issue.<P>---<P>ITEM: Casting Times.

Even if its more expensive, no one can carry more than one, at best.  Not sure why we got this though.<P>---<P>ITEM: Vampiric Curse and Soul Consumption.

(2)<BR>We can cast our ward dead spell on our own pets all day long if we want already.<P>---<P>ITEM: Disease/poison spells. (5)<BR>Not something I'm gunning for, but would be nice. Be sure to include the taunt factor that the original has.<P>---<P>ITEM: BloodEmber Armor. (3)<BR>Not really a concern.  Might be a 'feel-good' change for my smaller brethren.<P>---<P>ITEM: Unholy Aura. (7)<BR>This could be quite useful in raids if it healed enough.  But then it'd have to do at least as much as LoH to be useful, and I'm not sure I see that happening.<P>---<P>ITEM: Leechcurse. (8)<BR>Something needs to be done.  Lets say you use it just as a dragon starts beating on you.  You maybe heal 300 at most before you're dead.  Not nearly enough to give your healer time to save you. Lower resuse time and multiply the effect.<P>---<P>ITEM: Ashenbone Shield and Shield of the Stalwart. (3)<BR>Been wanting to see this for a while, but it's not going to effect much.<P>---<P>ITEM: Innoruuk's Curse. (-5)<BR>Who the heck cares?

My benefit for sacrificing the ability to cast like a necro of my level should be the ability to cast where I'm needed-while meleeing without serious fear of disruption. And those spells need to stop being resisted by uber_mob_012.<BR> <BR>Normal HT's are little more than an ubertaunt and a method for me to stop runners at 30th. They're not even noticed at 50th,owing to large resist chances. Is it so much to ask that HT's hit reliably without the disc,and are un-resistable with Unholy Aura? <BR> <BR>Yes,we'd all like to see techniques that let us all contribute,via any or better yet all of these methods.<BR> <BR>Scrapping "raid" mob design and starting over with more than the "Get a warrior and a cleric,or many to kill this mob" method of construction would help,too. Warriors are essential because all mobs at that level seem to need them to be defeated.

</FONT><HR>Archery:<BR>Since day one I have never found archery to be worthwhile. Its a pointless/useless skill that SKs do not need. Archery is fine for rangers and rouges but to SKs its just another useless skill.<BR>For all those who want archery raised, go play a ranger or a rouge. <BR>Archery should be removed form the SK skill list.<P>Shield skin spell:<BR>This spell is useless for a melee class. A single 55 hit damage absorption shield is laughable. It may seem like a good idea for a money sink since it requires regents in the form of cats eyes agate, but no SK in his right mind will use it just to deflect a single blow! It belongs in the pure casters spell book but not in ours.<P>Pets:<BR>Our pets are too weak, period. They dont do any damage worthwhile but they aggro all the green trash in the area. Loose our pets and give us more defensive and offensive skills. That would also take care of the dumb idea of Voice Graft. Seriously, how many people have you seen role-playing in EQ?<P>Spells in general:<BR>We seem to be the only class that has nerfed spells. Give us full damage on Vampiric embrace, lifetaps, etc.<BR>Reduce the casting times. Youre forgetting that unlike necromancers we are in the middle melee, we dont have time to cast those spells. <BR>Why not mixing in a few shaman spells? (Like poison line etc.)<P>Summon corpse:<BR>How should I put this. You gave it to us to be more group friendly. Now you want to take it away. <BR>You do that youll be looking at a lot of less SKs running around. <P>Blood ember.<BR>Not all SKs are Ogres or Trolls! Average medium/small race SK starts with 90 or 95 STR!<BR>This armor is too heavy.<P>Skeleton form.<BR>Last thing I want to see is another Necromancer spell.<BR>Why is it so hard to understand? Were not necromancer/warrior class. Were the evil knights fighting for the honor of our evil gods. Instead of giving us another necromancer spell, give us GHOST form. A spell that would turn us transparent (like all the ghosts in the game). It would be a step away from the usual nerfed necro spells in our spell books.<P>Combat<BR>Lower our miss ratio! 6 misses out of 10 is a joke at higher levels.<BR>This is reason #1 why no one wants us in their groups. The damage output of SKs is pathetic.<BR>Can any one explain to me why a monk with bare fists and feet can outdamage a SK with a weapon?<BR>Let me remind you that I know that monks attacks are magical, but so are SKs!<P>New spell idea<BR>Since were the defenders of our gods beliefs why not give us a self only Plane port spell.<BR>This spell would take us to the appropriate plane of our gods (for example: Plane of Hate  for Innoruuk followers) and would make us con Warmly to all the creatures there. You could implement new quests given to SKs by their gods. While there, and under the influence of the spell, the SK wouldnt be able to attack any of the inhabitants, and would regenerate health at very fast rate.<BR>The SKs would also be responsible for defending their masters domain. Any adventurers in the plane would be subject to the ARENA PVP rules (without loss of exp.) no matter what server they play on. The SK or SKs could then participate in the defense of the plane with all the other NPCs.<P>Disarm:<BR>A mob hits for exactly the same damage with or without a weapon. Loose it completely.<BR>Raise our offense instead.<P>Dodge, riposte, parry:<BR>Capped too low. Since they are part of defense they should be raised<P><BR>Since we are hybrids, shouldnt we posses of both classes instead of the worst? There is a reason why someone would want to create a hybrid class, and that is getting the best of both worlds. There are and should be limitations on what a hybrid can do but right now SKs get the worst of both classes.  Being the weakest tank and the weakest caster in the group alienates us form other groups. <BR>I do mind soloing but even then my spells have very limited effect on mobs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to point out that pepople who ask for skill removals do not make any sense.<P>What will you achieve by removing a skill from us?  Nothing.  You think if Verant removed disarm and archery and summon corpse that you will suddenly get extra, more useful things?<P>Archery is useful.  Any SK should know this being a "pulling" class.  The skill cap is not that important but why should it be capped at 75 and not at 100 or 150 or 200?<P>Disarm is a usefull skill.  Anyone who does not know how disarm can be usefull, does not know the game mechanics well enough.  High disarm skill can help.  Disarm at skill 70 can barely be used on level 5 skeletons.<P>In addition to my above post, I wanted to add that two handed minimum damage should be the DMG of the weapon.  For example a 40 damage weapon should not be hitting for 28 minimum with 193 strength at level 60.  The minimum should be 40.

</FONT><HR>Been reading the posts here and pondering ideas for sk's to do more damage and inflict more PAIN.  Since it seems granting the class critical hits is pretty much out of the question, I have another  idea.<P>How about a spell, disc or even better, innate ability of a 51+ sk to inflict a mortal wound.  This wouldnt do any additional damage initially, but would rather act as a dot, tics of BLEEDING damage to the opponent, increasing in damage per tic with each level gain of the sk.  Our dots pretty much suck overall, but giving us a special attack like this would be in-line with the charactor profile...inflicting pain and fear into the hearts of our enemies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I disagree with some of the proposed changes on the final list. Here is a list of the issues I feel are inapropriate for change and why.<P>#1 Better Shield Use/ Better Shield Stuns/ Better Shield Discipline/ Better 2H Use: I clumped all 4 of these together because they are all related IMHO. The choice between using 2H or 1H + shield is a difficult one, as it should be. That is because it is well balanced currently. Within the SK community the 1H + shield vs. 2H choice often falls along large race (can bash without shield) and small race (must use shield to bash) divisions. I believe that these changes would be better brought up as part of more of an overall combat tweak among all non-dual wielding classes than as a class specific isssue. A large percentage of SKs are larger races which do not even use shields and would not benefit at all from any proposed changes to shield use. Likewise many small race SKs use 1H weapons and shields and would not benefit from better 2H use. I would prefer that proposed SK changes and issues be limited to skills/items/features that would have an impact on ALL SKs, not just a few, especially if the changes may impact current play balance. <P>#2 Taunt: We are already the best taunters in the game. We don't need any increase to this skill. To give us one will only upset those that would see such a change as fluff. Give us changes we can use.<P>#3 Archery: I have only seen a handful of SKs ever use archery. We have spells that are more useful for pulling creatures and causing damage. Any changes to this skill cap would remain largely unnoticed by the vast majority of SKs within the game.<P>#4 Summon Corpse: This is one of the few spells that an SK gets that makes us an real asset to a large group on uber raids. PLEASE do not take this spell away. We have enough trouble already contributing to uber raids and post 50 groups, taking away Summon Corpse would only enhance what is one of our classes major problems past level 50.<P>#5 Gather Shadows: There is no reason that I can see to change this spell to level 22. We are SKs. We are meant to be hated and loathed by most people. Travel for us was meant to be difficult. <P>#6 Low level evocation: I don't see the logic behind putting in spells at lower level just so that you can practice the evocation skill. Whats the point in raising it the skill at an earlier level if you can't yet even use the spell that you are raising it for?<P>#7 Shield procs: I probably should have included this one with the rest of the shield issues, but it is just such a neat idea that I felt it deserved seperate treatment. I want to stress that I don't feel that it is necessarily an SK only issue, even though the clever person whose idea this originally was posted it in the SK thread. This is an issue that would benefit any shield bashing class, and deserves an A+ for creativity. Certainly would be neat to see implemented.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, here is the scoop. Those SK's that want the ability to mana transfer with the necro spell line. PLAY A NECRO. Give me a break. I am an SK. I leap into battle with my weapon and beat my enemies senseless. I don't fight and wait for a cleric to /ooc OOM and then stop fighting to do a mana transfer. That is the most rediculous idea I have ever heard. Not only is it not how I envisioned an SK, but I doubt few people would. Give it up. I am so sick and tired of hearing this whining about the summon corpse spell should be this that or the other spell that the necro gets. news flash- we are not necros. It was given to us as a way to balance with the pallies getting rez. Now I am sure you don't hear a lot of people shouting for a pally to rez them. But, in a raid situation it can be downright a raid saver. If you don't like the spell then don't use it. But for pete's sake quit whining about it and possibly have it removed for those of us who see the potential in the spell. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
