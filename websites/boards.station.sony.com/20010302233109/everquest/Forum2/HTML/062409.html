</FONT><HR>Xelene<P>Look at the date of the ORIGINAL POST.  <P>It was made the day BEFORE THE SERVER SPLITS were<BR>announced.<P>Also  one covers a time period of 1 month and one is 3 months.  SPlit servers are not the same as<BR>new servers.  Maybe they had plans for a split in 2 months. So one answer would be yes and one would be no.<P>As far as taking the questions seriously you quickly discount the first 4 when a post was made the DAY AFTER the original post was made.  What about the other 25 or so?<P>Instead of flaming please do the research you suggest I do.<P>Thank you<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Are there plans to split any servers in the next 3 months? <BR>4. Are there plans to add any new servers in the next 3 months?"&lt; <P>Not that I know of.  But that doesn't mean that there won't be new servers some time in the near future, just that there aren't any plans that I know of for one.  As I've said several times before, as soon as we make such plans, we let you know.<P>&gt;"5. Are there plans to increase lvl 55+ spell drops in the next 2 months? <BR>6. Are there plans to sell lvl 55+ spells (that are currently dropped) from vendors in the next 2 months? <BR>6a. Are there plans to make lvl 55+ spells (that are currently dropped) questable in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>We're still looking at all that stuff from the class talk threads.  Again, as soon as we have solid plans about these things, we'll let you know.  I'm not prepared to predict the unknown…<P>&gt;"7. Will there be an adjustment made to the Cleric/Hate issue on the next patch?"&lt;<P>Seems likely.  There are changes on Test now.  They might go live, they might not.  Until we're done testing them we don't know.  But it seems likely that at least some of the changes on Test currently will go live.<P>&gt;"8. When the servers drop as they did today can we PLEASE get something posted on the system status/scheduled downtime page to inform us of what is going on?"&lt;<P>That often depends on why they went down.  Often the servers seem to go down because of ISP problems at one end or the other.  We do our best to get a notice up.  But for very short-term outages it's not always practical or useful to put up a notice.<P>&gt;"9. Will changes to the epic quests be made in the next month?"&lt;<P>I don't know.  We're working on some changes.  Because these changes are complicated and important, we're not going to make them until we're ready.<P>&gt;"10. Are there plans to make the Pegasus cloak tradeable?"&lt;<P>Not that I know of.<P>&gt;"11. Are there plans to change the faydedar spawn so that at least a handful of druids can get their epic?<BR>12. Are there plans to move ranger/druid drops off VS or at least split them up so you don't have 2 classes competing for the same drops?"&lt;<P>See answer to #9.<P>&gt;"13. Will more boats be added within the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>Not that I know of.<P>&gt;"14. Are there plans to change the SLeeper's tomb key to soulbound item?"&lt;<P>Not that I am aware of.<P>&gt;"15. Are there plans to fix the Monk Mend issue in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>We're working on locating the problem.<P>&gt;"16. Are there plans to release the zone THE WARRENS in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>That is planned.  We'll announce it's release when we nail it down.<P>&gt;"17. Is POM Itemized at this time?"&lt;<P>As far as I know it is.<P>&gt;"18. Has anyone from a LIVE server gotten any items out of POM other than the cards we are hearing about?"&lt;<P>I don't know.<P>&gt;"19. Are there plans within the next 6 months to release diety specific quests (such as POG)?"&lt;<P>Deity specific?  I don't understand the question.<P>&gt;"20. Are there plans to reduce the UBER MOBS HP or offensive power in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>We are looking at some of the creatures of Velious for potential change.<P>&gt;"21. Would you consider setting up special chat room sessions with people who post on this board to discuss customer communication issues in a small group format?"&lt;<P>We have developer chats just about every month, hosted by fan sites.  We are considering hosting some ourselves.  But it doesn't seem likely that we would restrict attendance to any sub-group of players.<P>&gt;"22. Are there plans to upgrade ranger defense in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>Again, we're looking at all the class balance stuff.  We'll certainly let you all know when we've made decisions.<P>&gt;"23. Are there plans to implement better written polls on the log in board (the last one on customer service gave many of us no choice to really voice our opinion on the quality of customer service)?"&lt;<P>No.  We plan to start writing polls in thieves cant so that nobody can understand them…   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I find it amusing that you would ask a question that leaves me no way to answer it under your rules (yes or no) that is so skewed that just by answering I must also agree with your assumption that the poll in question was poorly written.  Perhaps you should reword that and ask again.<P>&gt;"24. Do you play on a live server?"&lt;<P>Sure do.<P>&gt;"25. If the answer to 24 is Yes is your character above lvl 50?"&lt;<P>I don't talk about my characters.  I will not reveal level, class, race… none of that.  Doing so, unless I could claim to have played all classes and all races to 60th level, would do nothing to improve my credibility.  It would only serve to focus people on the facts of my class preferences and be a hindrance to conversation on nearly any topic.<P>&gt;"26. Are there plans to give the clerics a JOLT type spell in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>Not that I know of.<P>&gt;"27. Are there plans to implement more portal type spells in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>Not that I know of.<P>&gt;"28. Are there plans to revamp POA in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>I don't know.  I haven't heard any such rumors.<P>&gt;"29. Are there plans to implement more bind points in the next 2 months?"&lt;<P>We've already announced such plans.  The exact date of implementation is not set.  Again, we'll announce them when we know them.<P>&gt;"30. Are there plans to change the Succor type spells so they will become more effective in cuttong down on travel time (ie DL and WK place group near a current portal rather than the opposite end of zone which would be MUCH more helpful in cutting down travel time)?"&lt;<P>I have no idea.  It seems unlikely to me, though.<P>&gt;" Are there plans to reduce the Spellbook med from lvl 35 to lvl 20 within the next 3 months?"&lt;<P>Not that I know of.<P>Sorry, I don't follow restrictions like only yes or no.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  They certainly don't make your questions easier to answer.  Some of your questions just can't be answered with only a yes or no.  My general answer is that we'll announce changes as we decide them.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062409&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062409&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
