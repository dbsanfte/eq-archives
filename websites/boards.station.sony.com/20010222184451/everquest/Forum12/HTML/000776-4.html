</FONT><HR>Mages,<P>This list is sent just to placate you. This list is not new. The ideas are not new, and the status of each item will not change.<P>For example, Mages scream for Shard of the Core to either be NO Drop, or equipable in Ammo slot. Absor write that we want it to go into the RANGE SLOT, WHERE IT ALREADY GOES. /boggle<P>Like he pays attention.<P>Plus, hmm, I see very little of the Mages and summoning stuff here. VERY LITTLE. Again, it was just another thread to placate us, to make us think something was happeneing, to dangle that carrot.<P>The thrill of EQ is starting to go, the fun, no longer there. Little by Little verant *****s away at my last vestiges of desire to play this game until soon me, and my money, will go elsewhere.<P>The don't care now, but they will soon.<P>/rude<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Answer the hard questions.  <P>Melee vs Caster damage.  If we aren't going to meet this need as a damage dealer anymore in any worthy capacity, then how are we being migrated over to a tank support role?<P>Summons that serve no useful purpose in the current game economy.  Like many items in the game these need to change to some degree to fit with the current game.  They were trash before Kunark and SoV and now they are worse than trash.<P>If as I've stated in an earlier post we are only good in raid situations.  How do you propose nukers get up in level if we're not as desirable as a tank in the 1 party sitiation?<P>And what is to become of magicians in the end game?   Ooo scary monsters, a caster that can do melee damage.  Pet damage was scaled back so severly in the end game that even with our nuking added in daily play we cannot keep up with tank damage.<P>Single tests vs one mob don't show why this happens.  It's over 30 mobs in quick succession every 2-3 minutes where the nuker will run out of mana and have to start medding or start nuking only once or twice a fight and then the tank lead becomes unsurmontable as far as playing catch up is concered.<P>"Shut up, and be happy that you have a melee damage componet."  <P>Well from a balance stand point sorry that is not good enough.  If the caster is going to give up AC and HP and take on the added burden of a mana bar then casters specializing in damage like wizards and magicians should indeed be much better than their tank counterparts in sustained damage. <P>Why besides those reasons? A wizard or magician add nothing to the defense rating of your party.  We add no damage absorption or midigation abilities unlike another tank.<P>As it stands now you severly lower your party effciency by bringing on nukers into a party of 6.  Because clarity 2 in no way is suffcient for a nuker to keep up sustained damage.  It's great for the healer but from a nuker perspective it's a drop in the bucket.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The true concerns on Rage of Zomm are not that it looks like an earth elemental but that it has a 2 min recast time.<P>The Rage of Zomm does not last long enough with it's 100 hp's to do as much damage as putting 200 mana into a DD spell.  Adding the 2 minute recast time is just pointless.  Especially considering that the nearest equivlant spells across other classes have only 5 or 6 second recast times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well,<BR>In my most humble opinion, the DoT's should be changed in such a way so that they do 2 rounds of damage with another effect.  As i understand it to be, physical reality is made up of two different organizations, energy and matter. Wizards control the energy and we control the raw matter itself.  I think it would be in theme to give a water dd that lowers strength or something because we are litterally commanding the water coursing through the targets veins to revolt against that creature.  The same could be seen that we control the air they breath and the earth they stand on.  We, more than any other class, gather our power from outside ourselves in the environment around us.  I think we could benefit from some buffs to augment the power of our pets, some different and more unique(not just another spell that does xx amount of damage but actually has a little flavor to it)direct damage, more proc'ing weaponry for our pets or even players that could tailor our pets for certain situations, some more spells to help us out in groups and raids, and please don't "balance" the classes by giving warriors SoW or giving us poison DoT's or giving monks summon abilities(no comment) but simply even it out so that we are even in power to the other classes but still can help in groups and contribute to the overall effectiveness of the afore mentioned group.  (Please don't give away any more of our class defining abilites)<BR>On a final note, magicians are a wonderful class and i would hate for them to sink into a state of ruin by underpowering or neglecting them.<BR>Thank you for your time.<BR>Rersef, Magician of Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nice list, but it's lacking in a lot of Magician Issues.<P>- Add in Cold Based spells into our arsenal of Damage spells. Make them approximately 5 levels higher than the previous Fire Based Spell but keep them at the same damage level. Hell you could even start them off at the same damage as the previous spell, and then incriment the damage per level at the same rate as the previous one did. Just give us a bit more variety. This would make Mages a bit more useful on Nagafen and Talendor Raids. As it is we can't do anything at all (pets get feared).<P>- Power of Pets post 50 is rediculous. After the patch to make Pets Duel Wield and making them Pets instead of NPCs, I have noticed a substantial decrease in their power. Add that to the fact that the 49 pet costs 200 mana, maxes for 56 (earth pet), and has ~2500 HPs, and then the next upgrade (for earth) costs 300 mana, maxes for 58, and has ~2600 HPs. Umm, we get an additional 2 damage and ~100 HPs for 100 more mana? How is this "balanced"? At the very least lower the mana cost back to 200. Or increase the Max damage by 4 and add 500 HPs. If a Mages pet is his focus of Power, then as it stands we have less power at 60 when compared to others at 60, while when the cap was 50 we were among the more powerful classes available.<P>- Malo-line spells. The main idea behind this series of spells is to lower overall resists. Well being Magic Based it is useless against things that are of High MR. We get an Unresistable one of these at level 60, but by then it's too late to be overly useful. Please add in another version of this spell at or around level 53 that is Lure-Based. Make it Double the Mana cost of the level 51 version, and take off 20 points of Resists, making it -40 instead of -60. Upgrade the Mala spell (level 60) to take off -40 instead of -35 but leave it as is in the case of Casting Time and mana cost.<P>- Magician Spells being given out like Candy to other classes.<P>You yourself said the following: "DESCRIPTION: Perhaps there is a story reason for giving bards the ability to turn into werewolves. But we should be very careful when we give the more class defining abilities to other classes. The ability to look like a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters. Even if we don’t remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving such abilities to classes in the future."<P>Here is a list of some Magician Abilities given to other classes:<BR>Summon Arrows (Level 29 summon) - Tolan's Darkwood Bacer<BR>Pouch of Quellious (Level 55 summon) - Silver Moon Wrist Wraps<BR>Eye of Zomm (Level 8 summon) - Singing Steel Helm<BR>Shield of Flame (Level 20 Damage Shield) - Singing Steel Bracer<BR>Summon Throwing Dagger (Level 16 Summon) - Mrylokar's Bracer<P>And this is but a few. The big one there is the level 55 spell being on a mildly common drop from Plane of Growth (not to mention the ability to be quested for via Velious Armor quests). If you are going to go ahead and do that to us, then give us that spell on a vendor. As it is, I have not seen in yet, and this is from about 5 eight hour Jugg Raids, and countless hours in Skyfire. If you worried about Enchanter Illusion Spells being given out then at the same time worry about Magician Summon Spells being given out. It's only the right thing to do.<P>- Resist Rates on Rain Spells. <P>A scenario: Single pull Sea Fury. I sic my pet on him and let him build up a little aggro. I decide to use a rain spell so I Malosi. I then cast the Rain spell. Wave 1: RESIST. Wave 2: FULL DAMAGE. Wave 3: PARTIAL DAMAGE. I nuke twice, FULL DAMAGE on both. I cast Rain spell again. Wave 1: RESIST. Wave 2: RESIST. Wave 3: PARTIAL RESIST.<P>You see a pattern? I could spend a day in OOT hunting Seafuries for you and log all my Rain Spell Damage if you want. And let's not forget that the Seafury could move out of the way, virtually negating 1 or even 2 waves. Whereas if I decided to use just straight DDs then I would almost never get resisted after casting Malosi (95% of the hits are Full damage. 4% are partial. 1% is Full Resist).<P>- Call of the Hero. I think an upgrade should exist, and that the current version should be scaled to level 52. The Upgrade should be level 56. For the Upgrade it should have the ability to summon group members across Zonelines. Make the component cost 4-5X the cost of the first. Double the Mana cost. Make it so that Mages would only use this spell on things like Complete Group Wipeouts. Make the Recast time like 5 mins or so. Adding all that into it would offset it's power. Moving the first one to level 52 would insure that many more mages would be able to get groups. If your focus here is to increase the viabilty of classes in a group, doing this would be enough for plenty of mages.<P>- Elemental Armor Series. We get the first spell at level 20. It gives +20 to Fire and Cold resist. The upgrade is 24 levels later. It gives +30 to Fire and Cold resist. No other Upgrade exists. This seems a little but much for a good series of spells. Magicians command the Elements so they should get protection of sorts from them, but ony 2 spells in the series, 24 levels apart and only a measly +10 to both resists is a joke. Move the Elemental Armor (level 44) spell to level 34. Make an Upgrade at level 49 that gives +40 to both resists. Make another upgrade at level 55-57 that adds +50 to both resists. Make it so other Resist spells that offer less of a resistance rate do not overwrite it.<P>Add in a counter line that gives us the ability to bestow this type of spell on others, at a higher mana cost and reduced resist. Like +20 FR and CR for 100 mana at level 29. +30 FR and CR for 200 mana at level 44. +40 FR and CR for 400 mana at level 54.<P>This is not an unreasonable request given that Druids and Clerics get a similar line of Resist Specific spells, both that are targettable and, in the case of Druids post 50, which adds it to the entire Group.<P>- Modulation Rod. Good spell. I have my own version of crack (clarity) to give people. Too bad it's useless to me. Make an upgrade that adds in an additional Charge at level 57 or so.<P>- Mana Regen. If anything add in a quest at around the level 49 level (make part of it Planar specific so only 46+ can complete) that would get us a Magician Specific Robe that had virtually no stats (About the same as an Oracle Robe) and Effect: Summon Modulation Rod. Make the cast time like 20 seconds. This in itself would be a form of Mana regen, and it would be specific to Mages above level 46 so it wouldn't be as overpowered as people would think it is, especially given such a long cast time.<P>- Magician Epic. I know you said no Epic item discussion on here but I have to add this. At 500 mana this thing is a pain to summon. What increases the frustration is the fact that even after summoning it we have to wait 20 seconds for our Pet to arrive. This is obviously an oversight. If we have to spend the time to cast it, that should be enough. All the other Right-Click Epics take less overall time to summon and in some cases can be done twice in the time it takes a mage to Summon, Equip, and Right Click, then wait for the pet to arrive. Make the Right-Click instant cast.<P>That is it. Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'd be happy enough with any sort of addition to help control our pets hatelist. <P>Actually, the ability to give our pets commands while casting would help a lot, if no other ideas are accepted.  Often currently if a magician begins to cast a spell and he or his pet gets even grazed by a mob the pet may becomed agroed on that mob.<P>Truthfully, pets can be controlled if the group cooperates, at least in common pre-50 scenarios.  Most of the serious complaints I see, however, is that pets are way too dangerous and unreliable in situations where one broken mez means the death of a party.  <P>Additionally, one current method of pet control is simply destroying the pet and creating a new one.  While I admit there are times this is appropriate, I think it is a bit unnartural for a magician to be required to kill his pet (and only personal means of defense) because there is no other good way to back a pet off a mob.<P>The fact is, if a mob is agroed on you or your pet, /pet back off will not work.  The pet will IMMEDIATELY begin to attack again after the mob strikes the pet.  Yes, there is some chance that your /pet back off will be timed correctly with the enchanters mez or a tank's taunt.  However, it appears in the high level game that many would rather not even deal with this risk, since so little is gained by taking it.<P>What I propose, if a /pet no aggro is too powerful, is that /pet back off simply have a stronger effect.  Say, the pet will attack nothing for 10 seconds after the command.  This would give the magician time to cast a spell without worrying about the pet running off.  This would give the magician something else to do in problem situations rather than devote 100% of his effort in a futile effort to back his pet off a mob.<P>This change would not turn pets into tanks.  Abashi believes pet's are too powerful, yet pets were always balanced by being far inferior to tanks in AI situations.  This change would not turn pets into uber tanks.  Pet's sheer power relative to other classes is scaled down post 50.  <P>Is it possible that additional pet commands could be added to the post 50 players arsenal to compensate for the lesser relative strength of pets?<P>Again I ask is it possible that additional pet commands could be added to the post 50 players arsenal to compensate for the lesser relative strength of pets?<P>Goladus<BR>44 Magician <BR>Solusek Ro<P>PS We get ice attacks from the water pet.  I'm glad for that much versatility I care not that we don't have ice nukes.<P>We have both magic based and fire based nukes.  Nukes with decent damage/mana ratio, casting time, and recast.<P>I think there are issues with post 50 spells, especially compared to druids who do not have to worry about line of sight, but that we do not have ice magic is not one of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It would seem to me that Absor has NO clue about Magicians.  I haven't played a magician past 50 yet, but if the mobs are resisting THAT much, I don't think I will be playing past 50.  I'm suprised that no one has noticed that we have a higher AC than our pets.  My pet gets hit for max damage from a mob most of the time while I rarely get hit for max damage.  There are times when I tank for my pet because my pet WON'T survive where I will.  It's pretty sad when a wimpy caster has to tank for something that is suppost to be the tank.  I gave up on tanking all together with regards to my pet unless I'm in a group.  Now I just blast the mob as much as possible and as fast as possible and hope the pet keeps the mob distracted.  I'll come out of the fight with my skin BARELY intact but at least my pet lives to defend me . . . why am I using my pet again?  I forget that magician pets can't distract mobs.  My necromancer friend turns the Taunt off on his pet in hopes that the mob will hit my pet sometimes.  We do this to try and even the damage out a little instead of his pet taking ALL of it.<P>By the way Absor, I did mention Najena has having a problem.  My pet completely vanishes and comes out one of the tunnels after about a minute.<P>Also, the control that Magicians want over the pet is about WHO it attacks.  Sometimes we, or the group, want to fight a specific mob and kill it first.  We want to be able to tell our pet to back off the mob it's fighting and fight a different mob.  At the moment though, we can't do that.  We say back off and the pet stops for a fraction of a second only to attack it some more because it hit the pet again.  It's things like this that make us unwanted in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Goladus,<P>You can send commands to your pets while casting.  You have to type them out manually however; you cannot use social hotkeys while you are casting (nobody can).<P>But there have been several times where I started nuking before I told my pet to attack a mob, so while the nuke was going off, I just type /pet attack, and it goes after the mob.  Yeah, it's annoying that you can't use social hotkeys when you're casting, but it's probably to avoid making things too easy.  Or some excuse.  Who knows.<P>The upshot is, you CAN issue commands to your pet when you're casting.<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They both do the same amount of dmg but the druid doesn't require a line of sight and it has a quicker casting time. I think we should do more dmg and erase the line of sight.

</FONT><HR>PET HEALTH FOR ALL TO SEE:  How about this...<P>Make a little green line in the Magician's health bar which appears on all group player's screens, and that's the pet's health.  Kinda like the blue line in the experience bar.  If you're in my group and you click on my health bar once you target me, click again and target my pet...this just toggles.<P>Make it work for ALL classes with a pet.<P>NO RENT SUMMONED ITEMS & LINK DEATH:  Thank you for taking this issue under consideration.  Solving this problem will really make the game less frustrating and more fun.  People will finally value a few of our utility spells.  Please do your best to use something like the 30 minute grace period, where the bags and items still function normally if you log back on within 30 mins, because other suggestions either make the summoned items too durable, or make them as useless to non-mages as they are now.<P>50% EXP LOSS WITH A PET: This penalty is just wrong.  Think about how the Magician class is centered around the pet, and is totally dependent on it.  The pet is NOT an escape spell either, so don't compare it to a Necro's snare effect, his Feign Death, his fear, or his short range teleport.  What defense does a Mage have vs a SECOND mob?  The pet is a weapon, and if he breaks, or I pull 2 mobs, then I have no escape. Suppose my style is to heal my pet and make him do the fighting?  He's my WEAPON for pete's sake, not another party member.  They aren't even that tough anymore - most high greens can kill my pet with ease unless I heal or nuke.  There is no logical way they should get exp at all.  It's a penalty for using our essential (and well-nerfed) weapon and it's just crazy.  Sure, I can "work around" the problem...it's the principle of it that bothers me A LOT, and the casual attitude that seems to be taken about it: "hey you Mages got a pet that roots."  Good grief, my pet couldn't root a flower in soft soil...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Group buffs:<P>&gt;&gt;1) Let Bard Songs/group spells affect our pets... <P>&gt;Nope. There is a reason that these spells don’t <BR>&gt;affect pets. It would restrict the power of <BR>&gt;those spells if they had to be balanced to deal <BR>&gt;with pets. <P>   So, a group that's four melees, a bard, and a cleric has an acceptable balance of bard power when he sings, say, haste, but a group that's three melees, one mage plus pet, and a cleric is unbalanced?  There's still only four toons benefiting from the spell.  Four close-combat types are hasted and doing increased damage.  (And, as we know, the pet does less damage than the high-level melee damagers anyway; the four-melee scenario gets more of a boost than does the second.)  The mage is cowering in the background, whatever his buffs.  There's no additional power added here because the mage is "buffed" with a buff that is orthogonal to his role.<P>&gt;Pets are balanced internally with each class that gets them.<P>  So mage + pet = ranger (say), but it's balanced to allow rangers to be boosted by group spells, but not (mage + pet)?  That just makes no sense.  If the classes are balanced without the buff, then allowing only one of two classes to be buffed would have to be unbalanced.<P>   I can see people thinking "oh, no, a druid could be in a group with five mages, and he'd be buffing ten people at once!  That's way too powerful!".  But that argument neglects the fact that the buffs in question help only melees (which is to say just the pets) or casters (which is to say just the mage).  A mage-n-pet counts as one character, not two.  <P>   Group buff power doesn't really scale as the number of figures, but rather only as the number of figures that _effectively use the buff_.  For instance, group damage shields are generally not all that effective, because you've only got one or two tanks that will be getting hit.  They don't rate a mana cost for all six people, but at best about the two that you'd put individual shields on.  Similarly, group regen, or HP buffs, really only help the melee classes.  The int casters get little benefit from the HP anyway.  For the group buffs that spring to mind, only half the mage-pet duo will be gaining any real benefit, and thus group-buffing a mage-pet doesn't add twice the power to the buff, but only the usual linear increase.<P>CotH:<P>&gt;There is a reason that Call of the Hero doesn’t <BR>&gt;summon people across zone lines already. As the <BR>&gt;spell exists right now it allows people to <BR>&gt;bypass content that they were never intended to <BR>&gt;bypass, making some encounters far easier than <BR>&gt;intended.<P>   In what way?  You can't Call anyone to a place the mage hasn't already reached, "encountering" all the "content" on the way there.  And you know the mage isn't getting there by himself; he's got a whole group or two fighting him down there.<BR> <BR>   CotH is used for exactly two things as far as I know.  <P>   First, it's occasionally used for "decoy" pulling, where a sacrificial tank takes a lot of critters out of the way, and then a second puller pulls the real target.  Hopefully you snatch the decoy back before he dies.  CotH is basically just a substitute here for several other pulling methods that accomplish exactly the same thing (including the original sacrifice decoy where the puller _intends_ to die, counting on a easy xp res later.  We are talking about level 55 here, after all, and serious raids, not pickup groups).  CotH adds no power that wasn't already present.  It just allows mages to partake of one aspect of usefulness to a group.<P>   Second, CotH is used as a pure utility spell.  Rather than having everyone sit around at a dungeon entrance, bored to tears, while the last party members shows up, the first five can fight their way in, and Call the latecomer afterward.  Similarly, if a group member has to leave (for RL reasons), you can pick up another waiting person in the zone and add them to the group without much pointless tromping back and forth.  All CotH does here is save people a little time.  If they fought their way past the yard trash to the X Room, they can fight their way out and back again.  CotH here is just a downtime reducer, not a power increase or content bypasser.<P>   So what does Verant fear so much about this spell?  I really don't see it.<P>Pathing:<P>   There are lots of individual places that weren't mentioned.  In fact, it'd be almost fair to say that there are _no_ zones where you can't find a pathing problem somewhere.  Relying on us to list them all will be bound to miss something.  Fixing pathing will be an ongoing task, assuming the whole NPC navigation system isn't overhauled (which of course it won't be).<P>Escape:<P>   It's nice to see that at least half the population understands the real problem with pets and escaping.  If it were actually a big deal, I could understand the resistance to the notion, but since it isn't, I don't get it.  Oh well.  Some people will argue with anything.<P>shar-hl:  <P>   Thanks for the compliment.  There's a lot of knowledgable and well-spoken mage posters out there that you didn't mention, though, and I can't claim to be preferred above them all.  They've covered most of the issues quite well already.  While I appreciate the confidence expressed in me, I'm a bit burned out on arguing issues, and don't expect to keep it up.  Luckily, you've got plenty of others to keep you company.<P>And the rest:<P>   It's highly ironic that wizards were supposed to be the narrow, mega-damage class.  Yet mages are always told that damage is the reason why they have no other abilities of note.  It would be nice if that purported power weren't a myth above level 50.  Below 50, mages can certainly do the kill-one-low-blue-solo drill.  But then, so can any number of classes.  I don't see a lot of power that deserved punishment there.  &lt;shrug&gt;  Not my game, so my opinion doesn't really matter.<P>   I was playing the druid again over the weekend.  It's a nice change.  You can have a little variety in tactics other than the extremely narrow "kill one blue" niche of the mage.   You can stick with a group all night long, shifting roles as people come and go, rather than become redundant.  You've got a great number of services people will be quite pleased to receive; even one half-hour shot from some of those spells will be considered more valuable than keeping any summoned item all evening.<P>   Of course, I have to abrogate my most recent goal -- getting to see the dragons, planes, etc., because the druid is just too far behind the mage in levels, and I expect some other distraction will come along (game, RL, what have you) before another 25 levels land on the druid.  But if "bypassing content" is a crime, I've just had a huge amount of content, including almost all of Velious, bypassed for me, and against my desire.  Ah well; c'est le EQ.  It's all wasted time in the end anyway, eh?  Give another class a try; you might like it.<P>   If not, and you want to stick to the mage,   may your bolts run true, and may your pets always be of maximum level.  Have fun.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, a few points in no particular order to argue your response:<P>&lt;&gt;...it would also make them (pets)totally and completely reliable. There would be no danger to using them, and no skill either. Remember, the only real limitation to your pets is that they are not as smart as characters played by people. There is no way that I’ll suggest this in this format.<P>No other class is as dependant on pets as is the magician.  Even the necro, who has pets largely as powerful as ours, can get by rather well without one, or at least isn't dependant on them for his very survival.  Pets are a huge part of our offense and defense.  We need controll that is far superior to all other pet classes, because the pet plays a much more important role to us.  Deny other pet classes better controll and they will deal with it.  We need better.  This is not to make up for lack of skill, this is to make up for limitations to the game.<P>&lt;&gt;”The most important thing I want that isnt on that list is a means of escape in outdoor zones, such as an item with charges of blind or 1 charge of root or ANYTHING. “&lt;<P>Dude, that is the drawback of the class. Besides, your pets work pretty well as a method of escape.<P>Ok, you are giving us a pretty big drawback to our class.  We could accept this if our pets really were capable of holding of more than one attacker.  I won't even mention what happens when we don't have a pet up, because if pets were as good as everyone believes there wouldn't be a reason to not have a pet up. However, in reality they often fail to taunt one thing off us, let alone more, and there are plenty of reasons to not have a pet up in many situations. They are not an escape spell. As magicians we are denied many things due to our pets, that many many other classes enjoy.  The truth is pets cannot be held out as offense, defense, escape, clarity (I've heard our medding during pets tanking is the reason why we do not get any form of mana regen), etc.  For class balance we cannot be denied so much without having an equally strong benefit to them.  They are nice I'll agree, but not at that cost.<P>&lt;&gt; Let Bard Songs/group spells affect our pets... <P>Nope. There is a reason that these spells don’t affect pets. It would restrict the power of those spells if they had to be balanced to deal with pets. Pets are balanced internally with each class that gets them.<P>I'm sorry I don't understand that answer. Pets are balanced internally with each class that gets them? How is that relevant to this? Each class is (or will be) balanced against each other, but some classes are not left out of group buffs. Why single out pets?  Requiring additional mana and time buffing pets makes pet classes not very welcome to groups as we increase downtime.  I again want to mention that the magician is a great deal his pet. <BR>There is a reason that these spells don’t affect pets. It would restrict the power of those spells if they had to be balanced to deal with pets. If you are worried about a group made up of pet classes and us getting 12 buffs on a spell designed for 6 people, put in a limit on the max targets hit (like a rain spell has a max limit of targets).<P>&lt;&gt;NOTHING on the Pet EXP issue?<P>Again, no. I guess I’ll add it, but I certainly wouldn’t expect it to change.<P>Why?  What is the reason?  With pets as they are, they cannot solo anything that will give xp, so it's not like we'll clean up by having our pets do all the work.  In the situations where I don't need to nuke something to death, I'd like to save some mana to reduce downtime.  Often I'll need to nuke something for over half it's health anyways to save my pet(and myself) from death. When hybrids lost thier penalty because they were balanced, we should have lost ours.  Look at it another way.  We are punished either way.  Either we lose half xp and save downtime (letting us hunt again sooner), or we lose xp by medding when we could have hunted again. Even if we don't nuke for over half damage we incur downtime for pet healing. If we have to have a penalty to our main weapon, how about if we don't do 25% damage, or maybe have us lose only 20% xp.<P>&lt;&gt;New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION: With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of Sword of Runes) it should now be possible to add new proc’ing summoned weapons for Magicians.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>This is perhaps the most bitter for me. Pet issues are a matter of mage viability.  These however, are where we should have excelled at something interesting.  When I first started EQ, a friend described the magician as a class that summoned lots of useful items, some with situational usefulness, but a class with tricks up it's sleeves.  This turned out to not really be true.  Besides many weapons that aren't useful, we get spells like coldstone, that could be useful but are useless by the time we get them (everyone will have at least one light shedding piece of equipment, and only humans are really inconvenienced in the dark).  This was an area that I thought would make the class interesting outside of combat, and make us useful to others.  Wizards get great damage dealing powers and the truelly useful ability to teleport.  What is wrong with giving us some useful UNIQUE abilities on summons?  We're not talking wands that shoot fireballs here.  Just something we have that no one gets, or not until much later.  Ring of flight is cool, and I don't mind that we get it later than druids (who get levi at 14), but 39? I had to wait that long for the first summon I found useful?  When I hear that summons are "an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item," that is what makes me want to put away my magician and play a druid.<P>Please, listen to us.  No other board I have read has so many unhappy players.  Please do something to show you are listening, or you will be taking actions that limit the variety in the landscape of EQ, as it seems magicians are a dwindling breed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, while u certainly made a good point about our pet's being pretty decent at rooting, the main reason for the request of snare/root was for situations when we have not had time to summon a pet (ie, gate into cazic). when we have our pet, i agree we DO NOT NEED A ROOT. I have normally had enought tmie to run/gate etc.., but problem arises when we cannot summon a pet to BE our root. for instance running thru FM, i cannot summon a pet as everything will aggro it, meaning i must invis, but if a giant (who sees thru invis) aggros me im totally dead. <P>Is there any possible way u could add some form of summoned snare stone, which will disappear when a pet is summoned? Or maybe allow us to be invis with a pet.<P>Also the /pet no attack thing. i would seriously like to speak to those mages saying they don't need it, every single one i have spoken to wants it in. IMO this would not give us complete control of the pet. we just seriously NEED some form of command to allow more leeway with getting a pet to back off. <P>maybe /pet back down - 5 second command, no more are issueable during that time, pet will not attack anything. even if we are getting beaten on, it will sit there. this would be a nice "balance" of vulnerability and safety.<P>on Mana regen. i see wizzies asking for more, we are only asking for some!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> anything will do! I think (might not be correct tho) you have stated because our pet is so good, we use less mana. why then do necro's get a fantastic mana regen, also when their attacking line is far more efficient than us? dot's, fear kiting, all adds up to efficient soloing.<BR>We sick pet onto mob and nuke, not as good.<P>Is it at all possible to make our Malaise line less resistable? You stated that this line, along with COTH makes up welcome in groups. how come ours is less efficient than the Shamans, and is resisted often? even if u increse the mana used, but decrease the resist rate it would make this spell more usefull. already at lev 30 i hardly bother, nothing like getting 5 resists in a row  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Lastly.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?<P>Also address our concerns if you are going to ask about them instead of reposting yourlist from last fall!<P>how about a summon field of protection, give the field so many HP itself, 2 second cast time so we can atleast get a gate off if we are in a ****load of trouble, it doesnt have to last for more than 15 or 20 seconds or even giving us a stun spell, something, a stun spell, hrmm isnt that air based yet we ourselves cant cast it?? and we have no air spells period other than summing the pet? same with water, what the heck. master of elements my arse, why dont you just call us masters of burnt dirt? if you are gonna give us fire and earth and nothing else?<P>summon rainstorm, summon tornado there are a couple of ideas for ya.<P>anyway i could go on for hours but i dont have the time.<P>JUST MAKE US NOT BE WORTHLESS ANYMORE AT HIGH LEVELS IF NOTHING ELSE OR GET RID OF THE CLASS ALTOGETHER!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[Cold Based DD]<BR>I think it is unfair that we ask for cold based DD, because that is clearly something a wizard should be able to, not magicians. This has been said from the beginning and although I would like it, it is not very reasonable. <P>[Pet XP issue]<BR>It puzzles me why it bothers people so much, maybe the person who mentioned that could eloborate on that? Magicians are not meant to solo, every instance I have tried I suffered huge down time due to the plain nuking and the inability to complete bypass the target's dmg (fear). I am teaming my entire life and it is much more fun, better loot and faster xp. But this is were the main issue lies, we need to excell at what we can do. And currently we can't. The DoT we got already proves that they agree we are underpowered and not so usefull for groups at higher level, yet it is hardly a fix.<P>[On Necro thing]<BR>Well the reason some of us might whine in your thread (although not nice either way) it might be due to the fact that the necro class is a wonderful nice rounded class to play. I have yet to find a necro that disagrees. No they are not overpowered, I play one too and its fun. The problem is that I would rather play a mage, simply because the idea of a mage itself appeals to me more. That should be #1 selection criteria and would be perfectly normal if classes were balanced towards the identity they were original given. Ours is being shred to pieces by giving other classes stuff we should have gotten, and added stuff to our class that is dubiously connected to the mage class.<P>[On 50+]<BR>These issues need fixin but I am sure VI will fix that in time. Just requires a whole lot of complaining before it happens (or it requires that the entire VI staff levels towards that point). But those probs are -bad-, just for the record.<P><BR>Just gear mages more towards their identity (boy I must have said this about a 100th times in all my posts heh) of master of elements/summoning. We all could make a list of things other classes excell at and what them makes stand out above the rest. What does the mage? Best pets and second best dd? <P>Haaahaaa.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>almost forgot we have no form of mana regeneration skill like the rest of the classes do other than clerics that is a big issue!<P>and what the hell do you make us share xp with a pet for if it out damages us?<P>do you give warriors 50% more experience if they fight without a weapon? NO so whats the point in doing it to us???<P>i also just read someones suggestion to give the robe the effect of Call of the Hero oh hell yes, that is the most logical option ive heard for it the whole time.<BR> <BR>AND TURN ON call of the heroe in the plain of air, it currently doesnt work</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My pet is no method of escape. For Example Im new to Iceclad, I just get into the zone, Im not sure iff stuff sees through invis so I summon a pet, Im level 37 so I am the right level to come to Velious. I wanna Get to Great Divide, Your saying I could walk from Druid Teleport ring, if i wasn't attacked while zoing in, to the EW zone safely because I have my pet summoned? Ok say I get attacked by a dervish I leave my Pet there cause I don't wanna kill it I just want to make it to the zone. Now another Devish attacks me but my pets not done with the other what do I do? I am lucky tho that nothing in Iceclad sees through invis well nothing I have encountered.<P>Ok Say that I am Invised and Invis is about to wear off any right neer a dervish, a couple of mobs are neer me lets say and my invis goes. I am attacked by a dervish, any other class could get away somehow but I can't.<P>If this is a drawback of the class then IT IS A BIG DRAWBACK.<P>In a role playing way this also does not make much sense. If it is hard for a Mage to Travel alone wouldn't find some way to give himself improved invis at a little ealier stage in his life, OR even give himself Improved invis all together. <P>You Give mages Invis to most creatures of norrath cept like Dragons and stuff at level 20 then I would be satisfied with my Mage Class. For RP cause Make it like my Air Pet comes and covers me from view<P><BR>Air of Disquise<BR>Summon Air Invis<BR>Regent:Malacite (or however its spelled)<BR>Level 20<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Self Only<P>Effect: You vanish from view from all living/dead creatures until you take it off or attack someone.<BR>(For PvP Servers so its not unbalacing to all PCs neerbye "You here Footsteps" pops up)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000776-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000776&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000776&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
