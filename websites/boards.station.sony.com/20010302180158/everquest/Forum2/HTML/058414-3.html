</FONT><HR>so what your saying is that we are good at hitting mobs but we shouldnt. we have great wep but shouldnt get them becouse they will bring the mob to us. and what happens when there isnt a war in group who is to tank. we dont want war hp we want to be able to not get killed every time we go any where from 50 on. we want to be able to lvl like we should with every one. i have gone into group with guild and at the end of 3 hours im lower then what i started with. and they have goten 1 bub exp. we have already taken a great big exp pentlty that now is gone but doesnt help me now might have when i was in my 30s but now it is about staying alive and not loseing exp more then gaining exp and if it is about not getting hit then why is it that on test sever you have lowered are spell that help use when we get hit the dam shields and that great now when it hits me it takes 25 from them but still 150 from me </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me splain this in plain english for you. Rangers are not better in offence than warriors or any other mele class. Capice? Rangers suck at offence when compared to warriors rogues and monks. getttin the picture? However due to the "vision"(tm) anything thats hits frequently against a NPC will be put to the top of the "hate list". Rangers dont hit for much but they do hit frequently. You gettin the enlightenment? Rangers by design suck at damage absorbtion and mitigation. <P>i.e. rangers get creamed early and often after inflicting negligible damage on any mob<P><BR>You dont play a ranger, you dont like rangers, you wouldnt have one in your group if you were paid to have him there.  Welcome to eq.<P>Wanna know why? <P>Are ya even vaguely interested A?<P>BECAUSE THE MAIN ASSUMPTION IN THE LOGIC OF THE AI IS ATTACK WHAT HITS YOU MOST OFTEN.<P><BR>Now that this little lesson in somthing that we all know,  is over what choice does verant have to fix this delima?<P>A)label it as working as intended and play ostrich<P>B)incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in programming costs reprograming the AI to take total mele hp damage into consideration when engaged with a PC<P>C)jolt<P><BR>Well A didnt work so lets feed em C without really adressing the basic flaw in our logic-cause that would mean we wopuld have to fix it  and that means money.<P>You see the fact of the matter is if a ranger hits for 5 times during a round for 4hp each and a warrior hits once for 200hp the ranger will get agro  not the warrior. why? ask your programmers.<P><BR>I gave up this fight long ago when i realized that  Rangers were completely broken beyond repair. I just hate to see the misinformed attempt a defense of the indefensible. <P>Its the A.I.<P>There is no fix.<P>jolt is a bad bandaid on an arterial cut.<P>Just step up to the plate and say it: Rangers are inherently flawed and will never be fixed in the status quo of the context of this game. Sorry for wasting your time.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Absor, I don't think you understand at all.<P>Here’s a point of view I don’t see anyone else arguing from. The message is the same (defense please) but the logic used to get there is a bit different. And now I’ve managed to confuse myself. <P>I am a 35 ranger. I group/pair with a warrior of the about same level (I have never been more than 3 levels above him). We have been grouping since about 25. Over this time with essentially the SAME offense (1hs, 2hs, etc.) and defense (defense, dodge, parry, riposte) caps he tanks MUCH better than I do due to his higher AC and HP. (BTW what I mean by the same caps is that on a level by level basis asuming level maxed caps we are the same until mine stops rising and his continues.) I am valuable to this pairing because I offer similar offense, good enough defense to stay alive to buff and heal him, snare and debuff the mobs, and then root if things go bad. My offense may actual lag a bit in terms of melee because of his greater strength, but my DD and DoT spells compensate somewhat, although I need to be very frugal because they cost a lot of mana (half-elf) that is better spent on buffing, snaring and de-buffing. <P>In a larger group, I may exceed him on offense because I can usually use my DD and DoTspells with more abandon. I don’t need to keep him buffed and healed (cleric, druid, or shammy does that). Be he still out tanks me by a mile. (Again, by tanking I mean absorbing hits, not overall fighting). <P>So here’s what I don’t get that is coming from Verant et al. After 39 levels of having the same per level caps as all the other melee classes and not being overpowered, all of a sudden we have to be frozen in terms of defensive type skills compared to the other melees or we are overpowered? (By the way the same argument can and should be made for the knight’s offensive skills and, *** our offense skills too). We aren’t (nor are the knights) pushing warriors out of groups pre-40 and our caps are for the most part identical to warriors, both offensive and defensive. Believe me even pre-40 no one says ‘oh, look a ranger and a paladin, lets kick out the two warriors and get them’. In fact the opposite is true in some cases. Or even given a choice in a forming a group, warriors will be picked over rangers and knights pre-40 even with the same caps. So why the radical shift in the end game. Why are we neutered in terms of defense post 40? <P>From what Verant has done with the caps it says one of two things, neither of which I believe. One, we have been overpowered the whole time from level 1 to 39. /em laughs hysterically and cannot pick himself up off the floor. We definitely DO NOT suck from 1 to 39, but we are by no means overpowered. Or two, post 40 we receive some massive god-like powers and need to be nerfed to compensate. Well reading all the old-timer ranger posts, I know that that is not true either. <P>Bottom Line: If having the same per level caps from 1 to 39 works, why doesn’t it work 40 to 60? <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, if you are going to respond to one post in this thread, please make it this one!  If I get a little upset, please understand that I've played 98 levels as a Ranger (have one that's level 47, another 51).<P>&gt; Rangers are complicated. Give them enough<BR>&gt;offensive power and not enough defense, and they<BR>&gt;die a lot. <P>Very true and exactly what my thoughts are on the issue (and why something needs to be done).<P>&gt; Up their defense and they start to be more<BR>&gt; valuable in any group than a warrior. Neither<BR>&gt; solution works. Therefore, Jolt.<P>Ok, I'll let this one slide because perhaps you were a bit sleepy or exhausted from all the class discussion posts.  I honestly can't believe you would say this and keep a straight face if you weren't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Are you saying that, at level 55 for example, a Ranger with a defence of 252 would be more valuable than a warrior with defence of?<P>That is just preposterous.<P>You are basically saying that the 50+ AC difference on their armor and 1000+ hp difference a warrior has is worthless.  If that's the case, please give us 1000+ hps and 40 more AC on our armor.<P>Without a doubt in my mind, a warrior is the ONLY person who can somewhat successufully tank any of the uber (for lack of a better word) mobs in velious or kunark.  Even if I had 252 defence, the AC on my armor is so low that the few hitpoints I as a ranger have would be gone in about 2 seconds flat.  Trust me, I've tried.  There is simply no argument against this fact.<BR>Look at Rogues!  Just because they have 252 defence and can outdamage warriors in certain circumstances, does that make a warrior "less valuable"?  Heck no.  I can guarantee that a raid on most of the uber mobs would not be successfull without a warrior, but could easily be possible if there were no rogues present.  I'm just putting your comment in perspective for you (and the dev team).<P>&gt; But if Jolt is too good, then the low defense<BR>&gt; of a ranger is no longer a drawback, and they<BR>&gt; again become overpowered...<P>This won't happen.  Again, look at rogues.  Evade is powerful (don't nerf it!) but they aren't seen as overpowererd are they?  At least not by the general public.  Again, they too have 252 defence, that of a warrior, but they are by no means taking the warriors position in a raid.  Plus Jolt is given at level 55, 40 levels after rogues get their damage avoidence skill.  Ours takes mana, theirs doesn't.  Ours is generally resisted a lot more often in comparison to how many times they need to evade to reduce agro.<P>&gt; It's very complicated. But I suspect that I<BR>&gt; understand it as much as almost anyone.<P>I think you do, but I felt a few points were misinterpretted by you or the team.  I had to correct them, at least to what I felt was acceptable.<P>&gt; What you need to understand is that just<BR>&gt; because you have great offensive power does not<BR>&gt; mean that you can just use it as if it was a <BR>&gt; fire hose.<P>If this is the case, then who are we overpowering?  Give us 252 defence and then tell us we should learn when to attack and when to do other things.  This immediatly puts us a notch below warriors when it comes to value in a group.  Warriors can do their job and they do it well, there are no ifs ands or buts about them, they are rock solid doing their job.  Why do you insist that giving us a defence increase would make us more valuable?<P>&gt; Rangers need to learn the lessons that Rogues<BR>&gt; and Wizards learn early in their careers. Just<BR>&gt; because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't<BR>&gt; mean you should.<P>The difference here is that rogues can remove agro in about 2 seconds.  Wizards can blast in spurts and still be oom by the time a mob is done, therefore being just as effective had me mana burned from the beginning.  Rangers on the other hand can stay out of a fight for 10 seconds, join it, and STILL get crushed!  Trust me, I have experience in this.  Besides that, Jolt costs mana and can be resisted, therefore upping our de-agro time to somewhere around 6 seconds.<P>Look at your classes and think of this: If the ranger removes him self from a fight 5 times at 6 seconds a piece, and also waits 10 seconds before initiating the mob, is he still even close to being the offensive powerhouse you all thing he is?<P>I look forward to a repsonse from Absor.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's funny really, but I'm starting to think these class balance threads are a hoax.  It's becoming quite obvious that Verrant already had their own ideas before the threads and planned on carrying them out, and in some cases only those ideas out.<P>Rangers came out in force and stated the problem and asked for simple raises in defense caps...just about every ranger in a 7 part split thread mentioned this....are we getting higher defense, nope probably not...not in the Vision(tm).  It doesn't even take a genious to figure out that we have a problem, all we need to do is look at the past...<P>PROBLEM:<BR>Rangers are getting the crap beat out of them so ask for higher defensive skill caps.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>Add jolt at level 55 to reduce agro on rangers...<P>Then....<BR>PROBLEM:<BR>Rangers are still getting the crap beat out of them in spite of jolt ask for defensive skill cap increases.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>Verrant calls rangers light, agile tanks that should be able to avoid damage by dodging and parrying so marginally raise these 2 defensive caps.<P>Then again still....<BR>PROBLEM:<BR>The cap changes were insiginificant even with jolt and rangers are still getting beat on, ask for defensive skill cap increases.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>NONE....They are stating they probably won't raise the defensive skill caps of rangers, however might be making Jolt a level 51 spell and making a fire based Jolt at 55.<P>FORESEEN PROBLEMS:<BR>Jolt was far from effective before even when not resisted.  Making it fire based might make it less resisted, but will be just as inefficient.  Rangers will get pounded on still and ask for defensive skill increases.<P>To make the picture even clearer...it was stated, as I mentioned, that we were light agile tanks that should be able to avoid taking damage as well as warriors.  This would make sense....plate classes shouldn't have the dodging or parrying abilities of someone in chainmail, but it hasn't happend and not scheduled to.  Instead Paladins and Shadow Knights are getting dodge and parry raised to the skill of a warrior with rangers still lagging behind.<P>From the point of view of a well seasoned ranger...jolt was introduced to fix an obvious problem.  It doesn't fix the problem a blind person can see that.  And as a ranger, I must say I feel kind of lame for having to cast jolt to save my butt.  What happend with this spell is simple, Verrant overlooked the obvious, and they continue to overlook the obvious even though about every ranger in norrath has posted it...<P>Let me pose this question:  How is it that Warriors, Paladins, Shadow Knights, and even Bards avoid taking damage?  Is it through the use of a spell?  The answer is simple...no, they do it by having higher defensive skill caps in defense, dodge, riposte, and parry.  No I didn't include rogues in that because people would say they use evade to avoid damage, which is true, the sad fact is that they also have higher dodge, parry, riposte, and defense skills then rangers as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have read through many posts on many websites regarding the ranger.  I find it overwhelming that the majority of us who play rangers have the same laments.  How does Abashi reply to these posts?  I've never met the man, nor would I care to, but he has clearly painted a very good picture of himself as the typical smartass, know-it-all.  I find him very condecending to many of the posts submitted.  Granted, when you have someone who is just trying to be nasty in their message, it only warrants that type of response.  Verant has been giving us customer survey's to make a choice on lately before we go into the game.  They all seem geared towards the level of customer service in and out of the game.  I enjoy everything about the game except the support that comes from within the game (GM's...not guides; more on them in a moment) and outside of the game (Message boards and character roles/powers supervised by the likes of Abashi).  In the game, I rarely petition unless it's absolutely necessary.  When I do, I am almost always happily greeted by a guide who is willing to solve my problem.  If they cannot, then the problem is sent to the GM.  What happens in the transition from the guide to the GM is anybody's guess.  It's almost as if these guys take it personally to have to do their job.  Guess what?  You are a customer service representative!!  We are your customers and I expect to be treated fairly; not shunned off like a pesty little gnat.  I realize that you're trying to service, at peak times, hundreds of petitions, big and small.  However, that is your job and it is only fair to do it with pleasure in the hopes of having another satisfied customer.  <BR>Anyhow, I know I'm jumping around here and I really want to get to the matter of this post.  Of course, Verant will stand behind Abashi's word and poo-poo on us.  That's to be expected.  I simply feel that the level of customer support in and out of the game is poor and I hope that Verant listens to what we're saying.  There's always going to be a level of frustration on both sides and we all have to live with that.  However, when you have a majority of the posts saying or complaining about the same things, I truly think that Abashi should get off his high horse and actually listen to our concerns.  In my opinion, Rangers could stand to gain a little more help than what you are planning.  I think you are ignoring a lot of the same issues/concerns that keep surfacing and that just plain sucks.  It's time to drop the god-like persona you have and come down to our level.<P>I know this is just my two cents worth, but it's certainly as valuable as the next guys.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a High Level Paladin and I might be able to agree that your Defense should be raised to 230, but 252 is way over the top.  (Might be able to agree if certain changes go through to the Paladin class).<P>Also, it does your case no good to cite how a Paladin is getting equivalent Defense to a Warrior, when you don't understand the non-stacking nature of the two sides (offense and defense).  Defense does not stack at high levels.  What this means is the most efficient person around that can take hits should not only take the *majority* of the hits, but should actually take *ALL* of the hits.  Many things contribute to this, Complete Heal among them, but by citing Paladin proposed skillcaps, you miss the most important part of the argument.<P>That important part is that increases to your Offensive Caps *STACK* very well, perfectly in fact, with all other offense in the group.<P>There is a distinct divide between the players that want the Ranger to be a viable High Level Class, and the Ranger that wants to be what he was at Level 50.  I'm not going to come here and tell you that you shouldn't want to be what you were at Level 50... I think the majority of the current problems are that Verant changed their minds with what they wanted certain classes to be Post 50, the Rangers majorly among them, but that is not going to change now.<P>Accept your position as the Warrior-Druid-Rogue Hybrid and fight on that kick.  Be careful when you bring Paladins into the picture tho.  A class that you outdamage by a full 2x, and a class that has advantages in the 'Non-Stackable' DEFENSIVE side of the equation.  Also be very wary attacking the Paladin when you have recently received 2 different High Level Buffs which are superior to anything your Paladin brethren can cast, at lower levels, often store-bought.<P>I think the current High level ranger is about as good as he has ever been, but that the road to balance is still not complete.  I would caution you to watch your comparisons with the Paladin class, however, as I think I could realistically and rationally argue that they currently have far greater High Level issues than the Ranger (With many of the recent additions to Rangers contributing highly to this opinion).  Again, I support some enhancements to Rangers, which I still think have a ways to go, but I think you've successfully passed the Paladin now in terms of your desirability and group usefulness, even though you haven't caught the rogue yet.  Hopefully, when all is said and done, We will all be on equal desirability footing in the High Level Game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"What you need to understand is that just because you have great offensive power does not mean that you can just use it as if it was a fire hose.

You're suggesting that the offense be turned off and on to the point where their damage is equal to or less than the "defensive" hybrids, who never have to worry about being "too defensive".  Therefore they get to do equal or less damage while being less defensive at the same time.<P>Why give a class an ability and then tell them they can't use it?

</FONT><HR>WHo says we exist at all? We are window dressing to bring more unsuspecting people into the game. The Ranger is a very popular class throughout fantasy/RPG history and many flock to that banner. Except when they get here, they learn the truth and turn their attentions to other more desirable classes. I know many ppl that quit playing a ranger in the early ages of their EQ careers (and yes, playing this game at times is more like a job, than a hobby) simply because it is a difficult class to play. I started this game as a ranger, and will end it thusly. Only instead of playing to lvl 60, I will stop at 50 and never look back as I hit the cancel account button. Im lvl 47 now Verant, you got 3 lvls to do something good and just to a very abused class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, <P>I say this as it is just my opinion but plain and simply...  With a ranger in the group as a druid who tries to play the role of the healer in a group I find that it is very VERY difficult to keep a ranger even remotely healed.  I personally think that the ranger is the most patheticly broken class in the game.  I've played many and even though I enjoy playing a ranger from time to time (more from the perception of what a ranger is in other rpg's which this character is apparently not really even derived) I do think that either their defense or armor choices should be upped slightly.  I do NOT think that it should be upped to on par with a warrior persay...  But I do think that even if you brought it closer to the warrior you'd still have the lower AC (even though it is getting a bit closer) of the chain armor only of the ranger holding them a bit back.  For that reason I don't think boosting defense up some would make a ranger more desireable...  But simply ***LESS UNDESIREABLE*** which is my current major concern with this class.  Rangers are simply not wanted as much as any other class and most groups I have been in would take a bard as the main tank over a ranger and the bard doesn't even have the ability to taunt!  <P>Simply put though...  That is my opinion on the status of the problem and although I do not agree with you on your standing on the subject...  I don't expect you to help have it changed simply because I have come to expect Verant to drop the ball.  They are getting moderately better at it.  But I personally wish that the people making these claims came out and played more in the groups of us who have to deal with this everyday as well.  I know you play and probably quite a bit with various people.  But getting around in my opinion would perhaps clarify some of our concerns.  I mean I know we're only the customer's and everything and a large majority of people seeming to agree that the ranger is horrid could just be a fluke but perhaps we could get a bit more attention in the matter?<P>Just my 2cp,<BR>S<P>As a side note I choose to play the druid class.  They have horrid AC and I do not play it as a soloing class which most people often say it was designed.  I expect things to be difficult to make the game challenging but it would be nice to see a bit more attention to make the groups a bit more friendly to each other rather than struggling to find groups.  (I can find them...  Just much more difficult than other classes because of my limitations.  And for these reasons I pity classes so horribly broken as the ranger who are far worse off and have loads more problems than me in a group.) <P>/em wonders if I just opened a whole new can of worms...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>Well I have a slight problem with the logic of just because you can use a power doesn't mean you should especially when it comes to melee types. A casters power is discretionary they have a variety of spells to turn to and<BR>as he has the ability to not cast that particular spell. Now what you ask of a melee class is to not melee or to fight ineffectively because when they are effective they die. Kind of think we have an apple/orange issue here with your analogy of the caster and the ranger. Melee dont have that many options.<P>Should the caster not cast any spells what so ever or even heaven forbid enter into melee? I really dont think so. A rangers bread and butter are his melee abilities. They have no other crutches like the Shadowknight and Paladin have. I apologize for calling them crutches but when it comes to these abilities in a combat situation thay can be used as such. Rangers have double attack and duel wield which allows them to put out damage rather quickly. The drawback is a lack of defence,inability to wear plate type armors <BR>makes real good recipe for mana sponge. Mana sponges are not a desired commodity at high levels thus Rangers have difficulty getting into groups. This in itself definately seems contrary to the social aspect of the game for this class...which means no end game for the ranger...(oh thats right there is no end game,,sorry for the poke but there should be and you know it)<P>Unfotunatel what this really boils down to is a min/max mentality that some of the high end players have developed. Rather than dealing with the player of the ranger and  his individual merits they seem to only see the numbers game.What I see however that in the end with less emphasis on role play..remember that this was once an MMORPG but has become just a MMOG...and more of a focus on the numbers game people<BR>are somewhat justified with this style of play.<P>Equity with hybrids is what the Rangers seek. The Warrior should be the king of the castle when it comes to melee. We're not asking to replace the Warrior but what we are asking is to use a little common sense and look outside of your vision.TM box and see that this situation makes little sense. Even by adjusting ranger hit points to put them on par with other hybrids then you have at least created some measure of equity and improved our situation quite a bit.<P>Well I have spoken my mind. Hopefully someone with a blue name will comment but till then I'd just love to hear the comments of my brother rangers.<P>Thicket<BR>39 ranger<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The concept of not using all the offense you have available to you at all times is very well known to me as a Wizard.  In theory I can dish around 5000 damage, assuming no resistances, but in practice if I attempt that I just die.  Wizards have always known they have to ration damage and control their output, that's part of the balance for the class (although its poorly implemented in terms of power for Wizards).<P>However, I think the sad problem here is that Verant is trying excuses and methods to avoid something like a kid doing everything he can to avoid having to clean his room.<P>Aggro is broken, it is in severe need of examination by Verant in many ways, and Rangers unfortunately are getting damaged most by this.

</FONT><HR>Keana-Rathe,<P>   I'm sorry but I think you have been misled a bit.  Ranger's weapons aren't a great deal faster than a comparably leveled warrior.  Therefore their damage output should be identical or at the very least similar.  The only damage difference of any real calculatable difference that a ranger would do is a DoT spell or a DD here and there.  Not to mention the mana pool of a ranger is a bit less than most casting based classes as they have to scrap the mana and wis increasing gear most of the time for the highest AC they can possibly get.  And simply put a lot of rangers are trying to focus on the points of the aggro list being part of the problem.  A ranger DOES NOT outdamage a rogue.  He also most likely DOES NOT outdamage a monk either.  He's on par with a warrior even though (with the exception of test) his attack skills are less than the warrior atm.  Yet amazingly even if they do not snare the mob can outtaunt pretty much consistently any class in the game with little to no effort and I see many instances (including a few of my own) where a ranger could do this outtaunting without even using their taunt button.  In fact I have been guilty of prohibiting a few rangers I played with when playing my healer from using their taunt buttons at all!<BR>   And if memory serves although I avoided D&D at times...  Rangers could outdodge a warrior by a pretty good comparison because of their lighter and more flexible armor (of the platemail clad warrior you describe).   It is something that I have had a hard time understanding since the game came out was understanding why a warrior wearing full platemail (ESPECIALLY the heavy varieties) could outdodge a ranger wearing very flexible armor.  It would seem the ranger could better dodge almost without effort for this very reason.  Rangers being a chain wearing class only should by default be able to outdodge a warrior by their very nature but Verant has made it clear that they do not intend it to be this way.<BR>   As far as not many people discussing the problems with rangers with you answering your questions...  I can only suspect that it was probably because you're seeing a large onslaught of rangers who are or have been at high levels who have come here to try and improve the very broken class since it seems they are looking into the possibility of doing anything at all.  (I doubt it but you never know.)  <BR>   Personally having played a ranger at high levels I would be quite satisfied with moving our defense skills up to the offense skills of the Pally/SK's since they are the defensive side of the warrior and we are the offensive side.  And also giving the rangers a reasonable class defining spell at 57 such as the Pally's new resurrection and the SK's summon corpse spell.  Personally I think at such a high level a single succor:lavastorm or Ro or something would not be unbalancing but I severely doubt something so obvious will be considered.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't usually speak my mind about issues pertaining to our class. However this is a very important issue that I personally deal with almost every day. My roommate plays a 35 pally and I am 33 ranger. Now we both have identical primary weapons and I have a pretty decent secondary. When we partner I have to NOT kick and NOT taunt and NOT cast and NOT have a damage shiled up. Meanwhile he is doing everything in his power to get the mob to attack him. The result is at the end of most fights he is down a bubble to 2 bubbles of health and I am at 1 bubble of health. If things every get dicy it is guanrtened that he has to use his LoH on me. Now this is supposed to be balanced. This is not just a problem at high lvls the problem can be seen even at mid range lvls. What else am I supposed to do? Stop attacking for a minute or two? I have done everything short of getting a weapon that is worse than my current one. Is that what I am supposed to do? Clearly rangers need a way to deal with the damage better. Like people have said let us have a better chance to dodge, parry, and deposite. We already suffer the penalty of no plate armor at least let us get something in return.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>  Absor there are a few problems with your statement . <P>  A) Rogues do ALOT more Damage than us . they are comparable up till you throw in Backstabs . 200+pts of damage every 30 seconds or so on top of their melee at my level(37) blows away what my Ranger can do . ANd THEN they can just evade and not worry about agro cause ANYONE else in the group just became number 1 . HArdly a fair comparison .<P>  B) Wizards hehe . WHne thay solo can rott Nuke back off and Nuke till it's dead . Hardly foolproof and notb efficiant but when done right works often and well . WE can't do that after all we gotta be NEXT to the mob to do our "massive" damage . In a group Wizards just space them and let the Tanks taunt . again NOT being near a MOB . Rangers still ahve to close and hence still have to hope someone else can taunt it away or choose to less damage and be less effective . I'm sorry comparing the 2-3 1500pt damage spells that Wizard throws to the damage we dish out in melee pales .<P><BR>   These are bad comparisons . You tell us look for a way to balance damage . when our only options are large scale Duel wield  or 2 handed in efficent or effective output (makin us undesirable suprise )<BR>   You are so worried about overpowering us that often the fixes are ineffectual stop gap measures that fix  a sympton but rarely cure the real problems . <BR>    Rogues were givin MASSIVE Damage output (backstab ) and when they were getting annihilated the problem was looked at and they put in a solution to fix it starting almost at the beginning levels . Ours are stop gap measure (JOLT) that is at the high end ONLY .<BR>     <BR>    You have an idea what is happening . But you neeed to come up with better solutions . Telling us to not use high-end gear is just wrong . And that is effectively what you are saying . No we don't use our damage as fire hoses . but it is the ONLY thing we bring to a group . Your telling us to do not use the only thing we do well renders the game something less . You are effectively telling us because we play this class we not allowed to aim for top of the line stuff because then we 'll die and it'll be our own fault . </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Axem,<P>I never put my 2cp in warrior threads because I stopped playing my warrior at 51.  It had it's advantages but I went back to playing my druid because it was simply the class I enjoy the most.  But simply put...  When I played a ranger to 50 I knew that he didn't have quite the offensive power of a warrior...  And I knew the only armor he could wear pretty much sucked...  I didn't know however that I was going to get a caster's defensive skill and have the ability to outtaunt every class in the game.  I've even seen ranger's outtaunt an enchanter chain casting tash as an experiment.  Rangers get lousy armor compared to the War/pal/sk...  Then they should be on par with a rogue because they are both chain wearing classes right?  Show me a rogue with slightly less AC'd armor than a ranger with less AC and I'll show you a rogue that was PL'd to fifty.  Why do rogues get to be the offensive damage dealer powerhouse...  Get to evade to avoid and reduce aggro...  Get better defensive skills...  And yet still be considered balanced?  I don't expect to have a warrior/pal/sk's armor potential and AC ability because these platemail's give a lot more AC than the measley chains of the ranger...  But I do expect reasonable defensive skills to use my armor rather than a robe wearer's limit.<P>And there is my 2cp...

</FONT><HR>Maxius under normal circumstances I would agree with you that 252defense wouldn't be too much, after all we had identical defense pre kunark didnt we?  And no warriors seemed to care. They still had more hp and ac from armor, critical hits, more MR etc.<P>The problem however is, that if they DID raise our defense to 252 and kept paladin offense at 230, then there would be no reason at all to play a paladin.<P>I don't really understand what verant has against paladins receiving more offense or weaponskills, but I assume they are afraid of paladins becoming some sort of uber class (a warrior that can heal).<P>I think verant would rather have pure melees be the uber class since they gain little to no extra toys, such as loh, ht, track, and spells.<P>But they realize they put hybrids way too far behind pure melees and are trying to find a way to improve them and make them more desired, but still keeping pure melees as the uber classes of EQ.<P>And sadly raising skills in their eyes seems to be invading their territory, which is why they refuse to raise ranger defense, and paladin offense.<P>Verant would probably give rangers an unresistable jolt, that takes no mana to cast and is instant cast, before giving them 252 defense, especially if they plan to follow thru with the changes on test.  I know how their evil little minds work.<P>They will never allow hybrids to come close to the effectiveness of a pure melee. They seem to want to keep the gap pretty darn big too.  i.e not just by natural higher hp, and ac, but by skills and damage/absoprtion tables aswell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know the problem that Rangers have with Offence against the Paly/SK Defence.<P>I really don't like to compare classes but since it is what ever seems to be doing I suppose I'll follow suit.<P>Defense is a skill which a player can never seem to have enough of. Give them more Defence and they become more useful. They last longer in a fight, so in the long run they can do more damage than before.<P>Give a player more offence and they can do more damage in a shorter time, but at the concequence of dieing more often. It is great we have spells which can lower aggro, but a spell? Why not an ability which can actually be used while being ferociously beat on by a mob?<P>In summary by giving a player more defence you are effectively leaving that player for longer in a fight meaning they do more damage, therefore a slightly better offence. A player with more offence is actually removed from combat more often because of the need to lower aggro (see with no effective increase in defence ability).<P>Also the lower defence has ramafications outside of camping that phat loot too.  Wandering across a zone to get from one side to another. A green mob decides to tag along. A Paly/Sk/Warrior finds it a minor annoyance, it mostly misses and what damage it does do will not affect him/her much, but as for the ranger, if he/she does solve the problem of the "too small to give me anything but could kill me anyway" mob they will die.<P>As for the comparison.<BR>For Defence you have :         <BR>Skills (Defence, Parry etc.)  Paly, SK, Warrior - High skill      Ranger - Medium Skill<BR>HP's                          Paly, SK, Warrior - High            Ranger - Average<BR>AC                            Paly, SK, Warrior - Very High       Ranger - Average<P>For Offence you have : <BR>Skills (Offence, 1HS etc.)  Ranger, Warrior - High skill      Paly, SK - Medium Skill<BR>Weapons                     Ranger, Warrior - Very High Dmg/Delay    Paly, Sk - High Damage/Delay<P>I think you notice something here, there are more areas in the defencive part than there are in offensive, and yet the differences in the offensive don't exactly weigh up with those in the defensive.<P>Also Absors statement about controlling how much damage we do, why give us more damage dealing capability.<P>Personally I haven't dealt with high level Ranger problems. I love the ranger how they are, but if you feel that to create balance you need to increase our offensive power to put us in line with you vision of the overall class balance then I'll look forward to that change, but please don't turn it into a death trap for us rangers.  I die often enough as it is for me not to have fun, if I die anymore than I do now, I'll stop, not because I don't like my Ranger (it was the first class I played and I chose it before I even had bought the game, not based on its abilities but because of the ideal I had about Rangers) but because it will become too unbearable to play a class which fills its time with corpse retrievals.<P>A spell and removal from combat, is that all you can think of to help solve the problem higher damage output will cause, I don't think they a very good solutions.<P>You mention Rogues high output, but they have evade a skill rangers could put to very good use. You also mention Wizards but you also hear complaints from them saying "why give us high damage and then tell us we shouldn't use it because thats why we die".  <P>Sorry this is running long, but all I can say is "Don't give something to someone to help 'balance' them and then tell them not to use it, when they notice that it causes more problems."  I think I'd rather have lower offence and stay in a fight doing something than have a higher offence and have to stand back from the group feeling guilty because I'm not contributing to the fight.  It sort of feels like we are saying "I've done my damage now I'm just waiting for you to do yours."<BR>As for someones suggestion of choosing weapons carefully, shouldn't a player use the best equiptment he has got, not settle for some third rate weapon he got 20 levels ago just so he wont die as often.<P>Well I haven't seen the change on test and how well the rangers there are handling it, but I hope it doesn't make a mess of our class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
