</FONT><HR>Something I haven't yet seen covered is mid level armor options for paladins. With the recent introduction of craftable plate, it has become easier for paladins to obtain decent armor for the levels 25-46 (at which point planar armor replaces the class specific armor, in our case, Armor of Ro). While those with lots of money may find more viable options earlier on, you will find that (and I don't mean to generalize, but I think this is true) people who play paladins tend to want to earn their equipment more than people that play other classes (again, this is a generalization; it just turns out that people with this mentality are more likely to initially choose a paladin as their first class when first starting the game). Anyway, back to the point: Ro armor is, especially in comparison with most other class armors, too hard to obtain. Warrior crafted armor is by far the simplist (maybe too simple, but that isn't the point here... nor do I wish to see any other classes get nerfed). I would say that the Ranger armor quests should set the standard of difficulty for the rest of the class armor quests (with the exception of the ridiculously long camping time involved in obtaining Ivy greaves; God forbid you should not attack him within the first 10 seconds of his spawning, either! ... I think I'm going to the ranger board when I'm done here). EACH piece of Ro armor requires that a piece of Ronium be created, requires the following ingredients:<P>1. 2 bars of enchanted platinum <BR>-this is alright, since most other armors require a gem of some sort, and this costs rougly the same<BR>2. 1 bar of melatite <BR>-this is ridiculous: not only do the clockworks range in level from 25-40, but they're GNOMES! Gnomes have done NOTHING wrong, and there is no reason that paladins should have to hunt down their creations<BR>3. 1 sands of Ro<BR>-I suppose this is alright given the volume of Sand Giant hunters that this can be gotten from, but I don't think a component required for EVERY piece of armor should be on this high level a creature<BR>4. 1 soil of Underfoot<BR>-again, ridiculous: WHY should we have to kill fairies? They have done nothing wrong! What would possess any holy warrior to tell his disciple, "Go out and slaughter some fairies, then return with their remains"???? I suggest this be changed to some other component... I would suggest brownies, but then we again have the problem of a high level creature carrying a component meant for EVERY piece of armor. Maybe something from goblins would be more appropriate (or that could replace melatite, since you'd still have to go to Sol. A to get it)<BR>5. 1 mistmoore granite<BR>-this wouldn't be so bad if mistmoore weren't so nasty. The other problem is how deep into mistmoore one must go in order to obtain these. I would suggest either removing the No Drop tag on these (I don't like this, because then people will be attempting to make a profit on paladins, and we'll be back to the problem of not having "earned" your armor), or making all gargoyles in Mistmoore drop this (currently only the level 30+ gargoyles deep in the castle drop it; the ones in the courtyard should as well, but maybe more rarely)<P>Aside from Ronium creation, we ALSO need to obtain through other quests the molds needed for this armor, and then smith it ourselves. Since the smithing skill check was removed, I don't mind this part, but some of the armor molds are ridiculous:<P>Bracer of Ro: requires 2 deepwater goblin nets<BR>-these nets drop off a 2 hour spawn in Lake Rathe. 2 nets per bracer means 8 hours spent getting the molds, plus the added time of getting the ronium. On top of that, if the goblin is on land, and he is rooted or snared, when he is near death (less than 25% health remaining), he will suicide and this results in NO nets. This is obviously a bug and requires fixing, but the point is, one should not have to invest a minimum of 6 hours in getting a piece of armor.<P>Vambraces of Ro - requires 2 rotten shark meat<BR>-again, a couple things make this a poor quest, especially in comparison to some other class quest armors. Firstly, there is another despawning problem with the shark, this time with its corpse: when the shark dies, if it is not looted IMMEDIATELY (by this I mean the corpse is checked and the meat is grabbed within 2 seconds of death), the corpse sometimes disappears. Also, the shark is again level 30+ (last I checked I believe it was 34-36). It is my belief that these armors should be attainable in the late 20s (not necessarily on your own, especially not for more crucial pieces such as greaves and breastplates), and the creatures that drop components should reflect this range; I would knock 3-5 levels from the shark if I were to alter this quest in any way. I don't mind the 2 hour spawn time so much, but I would also like it if he dropped the meat every time; current drop rates tend to be 50%. It's a big shark, how hard can some meat be to find? There isn't much reason to make a paladin who wants his armor kill the same shark 4 times over 8 hours.<P>If paladins are to learn their role of the tank, good armor is needed early on. While the fine plate that has been added helps in achieving this goal, it is my opinion that Armor of Ro (why is it called that, anyway? Ro is a wizard deity... just because we go to his temple to obtain it (why, too, is that?) doesn't mean it should be named after him) should not be as difficult as it is to obtain. Ronium is far too hard for the level this equipment is geared at, and at least 2 of the quests for molds have bugs and long camp times which make them either very difficult or very frustrating. I ask that this be examined in detail and reviewed so that the quests do not become oversimplified, either. Thank you for your time and patience, and I hope to hear something concerning this topic soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh I forgot... it may be argued by some that bracers aren't a big deal because the combination of a Minotaur Bracer and a Bracer of Scavenging is better anyway. While this may be true, it does not help us all: Dwarves and other small races cannot equip the minotaur bracer. As the Bracer of Scavenging is Lore, that also leaves a limited choice, even more so for those such as myself who prefer that their armor matches (chain bracer with plate armor... don't like it). Just thought I'd add this as further support for my post above.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Post 50 issues are certainly important.  Please do not forget many others aren't quite at that level yet and DO have issues as well.  I applaud them for bringing up issues I might deal with some day, but mid-levels should be examined as well.<P>Balance:  <P>Warrior crafted armor is, and should be, better than paladin Ro armor.  It is part of them being a better tank.  However, warriors can and do get crafted quite easily by the time they reach mid 20's in level.  Paladins are still finding it difficult to get Ro even into their late 30's.<P>Ro armor quests are simply so difficult and time consuming that Ro armor is amazingly rare when compared to crafted.  End result?  Ro armor sells for twice the price, or worse, paladins buy something else.  With more and more post 50 characters being developed, Deepwater Armor (which drops) is becoming as common as Ro.  As such it is almost as cheap as Ro.<P>Proposed Solution:<P>Increase the spawn rates of the 'key' monsters needed to complete the quest (e.g. Nightfall Giant, Goblin Netmasters, Undead Cyclops, etc.).  Drop rates on these guys should also be automatic.  The mistmoore granite should drop from those easier gargoyles in the front yard as well.  The melatite should be dropping from the various goblins.  <P>When all is said and done, paladins still have to cough up 2 bars of enchanted platinum for each piece and NONE of the key items would come any easier, just more frequently.<P>In a game called "Everquest" isn't the point to encourage the young paladins to actually perform some quests?  Instead, due to extreme difficulty, and a prize that is less protecting than crafted (which can be had 10 levels earlier and/or for half the price), the game has evolved into "Neverquest".<P>Lanceor d'Avignon<BR>Paladin of Mithanial Marr<BR>Acceptor of 34 truths<BR>Xegony Server<P>Perception is reality, but truth is virtuous.<BR>-Mithian proverb</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well i have some hard data on the offensive capabilities of paladins in regards to warriors, monks, and rogues.  These figures come from fighting Klandicar, one of your avg uber dragons.  Pretty much all the people involved have their epic or VP weapons and all have dragon haste. Using a parser to log damage totals i've seen some trends in damage.  These are some averages i've noted:<P>Rogues:   12k-14k<BR>Monks:    11k-12k<BR>Warriors: 10k-11k<BR>Paladins: 4k-6k<P>Now that is a pretty sad stat when i have a weapon(Fiery Defender) that is almost as good as the warrior weapon but i am doing basically half the damage. I also have 255 str during these fights and usually have a bard too, which makes my damage output even worse than the others who probably do not have a bard.<P>Dracon Battlehammer<BR>59th Paladin of Erollisi Marr<BR>Da'Kor<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I remembered something else I read a long time ago.<P>I remember these issues were brought up when Rubicite was first taken away and the class specific armors introduced. I remember that one of the responses was that the development team wanted to give paladins a "moral dilemma" with a lot of the things they do, which is why so many of the Ro armor components don't make sense (see my above posts), why getting the Ghoulbane requires killing a paladin (addition to my above post: Gauntlets of Ro require killing a paladin who turns into a werewolf; I think an alternative should be introduced where you are to cure this paladin of his affliction and in return he gives you the locket you need for the gauntlets). I honestly do not see why anyone would want to impose such a dilemma upon a class as a whole. There is a point where alternatives are not viable anymore, and it is at this point that our class specific armor comes through for us. Honestly, I don't mean this to sound the way that I think it will, but I don't see any reason for doing this except to impose a greater difficulty upon a class which is already difficult to play. I'm trying very hard not to say "you hate our class", and I hope you see that, but it's hard to word this in such a way that it doesn't give that impression. Please, any ideas you may have of giving us moral dilemmas, don't impose upon such things that are a staple of our class, such as armor. It would be appropriate to do this with something meant to merely entice us, to tempt us but not something necessary to our effectiveness. Review our class armor please... I'm sure you'll find you agree. Thanks again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

CHECK.<P>Paladins, lowest damage, but effective enough to contribute to raid.  BZZZZZZZZZ, WRONG!!!<P><BR>ANY decent raid will have WARRIORS tanking, NOT paladins.  So a paladin has to make up the melee shortfall with spells.  How?  Impossible with the current spell line.<P>What those numbers SHOULD BE:<P>Rogues:       12k-14k<BR>Monks:        11k-12k<BR>Warriors:     10k-11k<BR>Rangers:      10k-11k<BR>Paladins/Sks:  7k- 8k<P><BR>Without a decent improvement in offense paladins and SKs are crippled in high-end raids.  They are NOT WORTH THE LAG.  1 Warrior can replace 2 paladins with less lag, just as much damage, and BETTER TANKING.<P>A level 60 warrior is a better tank than a level 60 paladin EVEN IF NO CLERIC IS PRESENT.  The higher dodge/parry/riposte, the higher hps (a buffer between fights), and higher AC (use druid buffs, which are pretty darn goo).<P>Paladins should do 75% of a warriors damage (not because of some silly 75/25 war/clr notion) because AT MOST his spells can compensate for the lack of 25%.  In a TYPICAL environment at 60 they may actually account for only half of that difference.  But their is something to be said for the utility of a paladin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to talk about some ideas Ive read and suggested before.<P> One of the ideas someone posted about the "Group LoH".<P>I had talked to a couple gms about this some time ago. The idea was not to have a full heal cast on all members but a part of a heal.  This was the Idea I gave...<P>If Lay on hands is up for the paladin to use, but the paladin does not target anything(hits escape) the Lay Hands is then cast on the entire party but the heal is divided by the number of the party(that are in range ofcourse).<P>This has lots of uses to me cause many times when I save a comrad its because cleric was hit and interrupted. So I use the loh but the mean time cleric still casts and wastes a compltete heal on someone. This also serves as an insta taunt and gets all mobs off that chanter or cleric and on to you giving the cleric time to cast heal or chanter time to mez. <P>__________________________________________________<P>Undead crips and crits after lv50... <P>This should be a given as clerics are masters of killing undead with spells.. A paladin should be so with the blade.<P>Then change holyforge to insta crits and crips on undead<P>__________________________________________________<P>Saw alot of talk on epic not being 1 handed and a shield to go with it.<P>Someone said a nice range item too so lets make a quest for a ranged item that is a container that when Fiery Defender is placed in it, and combined it does indeed form a shield and a 1-h slash sword. the sword "sword of fiery defense" should have a proc of say a small rune or greater heal on the user. The "shield of fiery defense" should  have a mad ac to it to hence the defense name and nice resists as well. <BR>  Ideas for this quest would be use the old falchon and the silent watch shield(these were 2 great quests with a verry min reward) King Thex says "brave paldin you truly have proved yourself a knight of the silent watch I award you with this." "scabbard of the fiery defender" that ranged slot item we all wanted. Maybe give that the Haste that an epic weapon really should have.<P>Owning an Fiery defender I do feel that the proc should not be a 155pt lv 4 lure its resisted to offen. They really should have kept it unresisted after the 2nd change to it.  The fact is when you fight something and that proc goes off what your fighting still becomes just as mad at you. Fiery Defender weighs .1 and it takes me forever to swing the blade that no one sees.. It realy should have a haste attached to it.<P>thx for reading this far..<BR>Sevenkey Brightblade (MFH) 55 paladin of the Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The pet post was semi humor semi serious, I was mostly posting off of all the ideas about pallys getting a skill or ability to CH the entire group but in return for this sacrifice his own life.  This is a noble idea but it is NOT a paladin, pallys are not suicidal they are noble.  This ability would be forcing their death instead of them fighting off baddies defending the good and besides that clerics get CH and uber group heals so what would the use of this be unless the cleric is dead and you either don't have a chanter/evacer or both are dead. <P>Having a stinky pet that heals group members would be a better idea since we don't get a horse (or maybe make the pet a horse lol, JK).  Pallys will make sacrifices sure and they will die for honor as well, but insta killing themselves is not paladin like even though it would heal everyone.  I personally would never use this ability if it were implamented cause if I'm dead I can't use my spells for stunning and healing and I can't tank either.  If you play your role right you would never need something like this but since so many people are determined to get this it will prolly be implamented and then later on you will all think "hmm this really didn't improve our class balance at all and everytime I use this I just make more downtime for the group cause they have to res me and rebuff me".<P>With LoH and the right amount of healing power (hopefully we will get celestial healing or at least something like that which does more than 540hp and is more mana efficient) you should never see your group get that beat up.  If your group does get that beat up I suggest finding a new healer/chanter or you start helping with heals sooner, OR don't hunt in such dangerous areas without a larger number of people.<P>Give us something useful, at level 60 I can tell you that a group CH causing my death would never be used unless I was so terribly bored and wanted to grind again.  Improve my offensive abilities and weapons.  Duel weilders are getting weapons that have much better damage delay ratios than us and there is now a very good selection of 1 handers for them with stats like 14dmg 22dly (or 24dly), stats like that are tooooo close to the stats of sword of morning making our uber weapons start to look like noodles compared to theirs.  Give us a little increase in all defensive abilities (keep defense itself below warriors instead of even and just raise riposte dodge parry some instead) and give us some improved spells.  Make it so we can naturally get crits and crips vs undead post 50.  I have no idea why since there aren't even any undead zones or dungeons post 50 so this is really stupid.  Would be like finally getting the ability to gate but it would cost 3000mana (since I think our mana caps around 2500 with 200wisdom).  Hey we got gate though.<P>Sorry I can't help myself, I am a level 60 pally and so far NOTHING looks helpful that will ever make it.  The improvements we NEED Absor has specifically said that we will never get because it would bring down the warrior/cleric class.  The real problem is verant doesn't know HOW to balance us because they can't make the right improvements without putting us into warrior/cleric territory and if that were to ever happen every single warrior/cleric in game would start whining saying they got nerfed.<P>The reason I still play my pally is because I'm addicted to him like so many other players, the class sucks.  I only hope that some day we, like rangers, will get the enhancements we deserve and need.  Afterall if the enhancements go live from TS then rangers will be much better than pallys skill/ability wise.  Ok I feel better now, for the moment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all would like to say that "The classes in EQ will NEVER be balanced" , the day a Paladin can quad kite at the same levels as Druids then you proved me wrong. ( not saying anyone should be nerfed to take any abilities away, just merely an observation. )<BR>Balanced is in regard to how classes work with each other in groups ... not overall power of class. So other classes should whine so much when a class gets items or skills to make your groups better or a classes ability to be useless in one.<P>As a Paladin I"m glad to see the Class EXP penalty gone ( as a hybrid I'm penalized offensively and defensively for my spellcasting ability and my spellcasting ability is penalized for my ability to tank, so the Class penalty should have never existed for Paladins to say the least. ) <P>Since I see the Paladins are regarded as a "Defensive" class then shouldn't we have similiar defensive skill to a Warrior if not better in some cases?<BR>Skill caps on Defense ( W-210 P-200 ) , Dodge ( W-200 P-125 ) , Parry (W-200 P-175 ) , Riposte ( W-200 P-175 ) , Disarm ( W-200 P-70 ) and Bash ( W-200 P-175 )<BR>Think at least Defense and Bash should be brought up just higher than WAR levels and with Dodge, Parry and Riposte moving up to WAR levels ... Disarm almost useless but for the 1 or 2 times a week it works guess it's better to have than not. <P>My MAJOR concern is more on the lines of the lack of high damage 1HS weapons, recently Piercing ( heard was 2H Piercing but on trainer only said Piercing ) was added to the Paladins list of skills. Well I don't think Paladins should have Piercing ( unless we get a new skill -- ability to ride animals ..this way we can use Piercing weapons like lances and joust with them. ) these new piercing weapons would have served Paladins better as 1HS weapons instead. 1HB also not very "Knightly" weapons either.<BR>For some reason Paladins are forced into using 2 Handed weapons ( Soulfire, Fiery Avenger and Fiery Defender come to mind... these all should be 1HS weapons ) and have to abandon one of their few Offensive ( also defensive too ) skills in Bash. <BR>Paladins no matter what weapon they use is the same. example a Mith 2H , if this weapon were 1HS-2HS-1HB-2HB-1HP-2HP  it's damage done would be exactly the same, only skill in type of weapon and Double Attack affect it ... but if was a 1H weapon a shield could be equipped and Bash could be used to for an extra attack ( like Kick and Backstab on frontal attack are used. ) <BR>If a WAR/RNG is dual wielding there is is the potential for up to 8 attacks in a round add a kick that's 9 chances to damage as opposed to a Paladin that has the potential for up to 4 ( haven't experienced one yet ) with Bash a chance for 5 is possible. But the lack of high damage 1HS forces Paladins to give up a useful skill, an extra damage opportunity, a chance to Stun mob and that little extra AC they can use. <BR>The Paladin's epic weapons should be made to be 1HS weapons ( or least chooseable to taste -- 1HS or 2HS by items you turn in to get the weapon ) and other 1H weapons could be introduced  through questing if need be and made no drop also. <BR>As a Paladin I want to be able to use my shield and not be penalized offensively by not having good 1H weapons available to our class and my ability to Bash. I know other classes  ( SHD only class with real gripe on this point maybe, but they have their own thread  ) would cry about Paladins getting these types of 1H weapons but we are NOT the same by any means and need different weapons to compensate for our lack of offensive skill.( Level 13 characters running around dual weilding with a Wurmslayer in one hand is really annoying to see. ) <BR>Remember our damage output ( from weapon itself ) will still be the same ( slightly higher with Bash but no different than Kick ) but style of play will become a choice to us -- 1H and shield or 2H style.<P>Paladins MISS way too much ... when only double hitting at best ..very discouraging to see so many misses , make me feel as if I'm letting my group down all time.<P>Paladins besides the Warrior/Monk ( only cause they don't have spells ) are only classes without a true invisibility making getting through some zones near impossible ( those potions bought from the merchants leave much to be desired..almost 11pp for a 15 second invis most of the time just doesn't cut it. ) Sometimes end up not able to hunt in areas and lose groups because I can't reach the area to fight in. Realize this more my problem but think those Invisibility potions should be more reliable ( took 5 potions one night to go from enterance of Upper Guk to Lower Guk zone... 53pp... to get to Lower Guk and find out that there was no groups open for me, then had to train almost the whole Upper Guk zone to get back to the Swamp zone when my last potion failed immediately.. 64pp and some angry people for nothing. )<BR>Also speaking of Defensive spells ... would it be so unbalancing to have Gate? ... since we don't get defensive spells like Feign Death/Gather Shadows or Camoflauge/SoW or Invis song/Selo's as the other Hybrids do.<BR>Also with having to rely on casters to bind you ( spent 90 minutes one night trying to get bind in Firiona Vie ) it's just wrong because some caster doesn't feel like doing it, you have to suffer for it.<BR>Maybe we should get a melee type binding skill ( under abilities ) that would let us self bind even if  only in our normal bind locations. <P>One last thing The Armor of Ro for all the work the Ro Armor should be a little better statistically to all  Paladins... Bring our AC on armor to WAR level of Crafted. Most Paladins have a STR problem ( except Dwarf ) and most need WIS ( except High Elf ) but Ro Armor as disportionent STR to WIS ratio   +4 STR +14WIS   shouldn't there be more balance in those stats?  Like if Helm of Ro instead of +8 WIS was +4STR +4 WIS   the armor would have a +8 STR +10 WIS thus helping more Paladins overall. The Bracers are useless in this armor ( not really worth the cost of the platinum bars to make them. ) Maybe also +1 CHA on each piece for the prestige this armor is suppose to bring by wearing it. At level 45 only have the Boots so far ( guess having a casual guild not a power one as a PAL not a good choice ) <P>I realize these things stated may not be too high tech and even trivial for some but maybe someone can take something from here and " nerf " them into a better idea and help bring them to reality. I only related things to I know but like some other ideas I've seen here. <P><BR>NOTE:<BR>As pictured on all 3 software boxes and in any pictures leading into the world itself ( between server screen and world of EQ ) , a Paladin is dipicted in Plate type armor with a 1H sword and a shield plus where's our #$&^@*% Winged Helm ( I want one!!!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   )    That's the Paladin I want to be. <P>Mondsichel <BR>45 Seasons as Defender of Tunare<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(i.e. we need 1-4, clerics can have 1-3) (group yaulp was good idea too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>Vox lewt needs to be reviewed....risk vs. reward is NOT there.....I've been on 7 successful vox raids outta 15, only seen 2 books (i'm sure bards aren't happy they have to roll against int casters 1/2 the time for the scale either)<P>If we get our defenses up to where we can honestly be called THE defensive class, we need a way to get the mobs to hit us....several ideas have been mentioned.<P>HIT RATIO HAS TO BE UPPED!  I would like to at least be able to make dents in the mob.<P>More attainable weapons (1hs AND 2hs at appropriate lvls, rather than 10 lvls after they are worth while)<P>Some sort of Sacrifce ordeal where we can save another's life w/ our own.<P>I'm sure there are others, but a lot has been said.<P>My ideas....<P>Well, most of all my ideas have been stated and i'm drawing a blank on the ones that weren't =P.<P>Good ideas guys though, some with very SOLID explainations behind them, proud o ya  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"5) Mark of Karn style spell<BR>Give paladins a reversed Mark of Karn style spell, allowing it to turn a small percentage (10-25%) of the DMG inflicted onto the paladin into healing for the paladin.<BR>A monster hits YOU for 400 DMG!<BR>YOU feel a holy surge.<BR>YOU get back 100 HP!"<P>I love this idea, a lot.. (was posted earlier), eiter make a self only (a very nicely difficult quest like divine might) or make a group verson, not this extrem but a small ratio.. like you get 10% of the damage inflicted back into your life.. aka (something hits you for 100, you gain 10 back).. this would make an interesting defencive buff.<P>Also, a decipline that if you target a person and use it (have it a hotkey, like lay hands.. call it "holy sacrifice), and what you do is if the paladin is in melee range of the target (which is a PC, but still has to be within melee range), the paladin will recieve all melee damage in place of that PC for 30 secons.. with a like 5 min reuse...<P>aka.. target cleric, press "holy sacrifice".. each hit aimed at cleric is deflected to paladin (non-magical. melee only).. we may die quicker but it saves the cleric<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Two FLAVORFULL suggestions for high-level raids:<P>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>First, a very high level spell or discipline that allows the paladin to take some or all of the damage meant for the target.  Call it "Blaze of Glory", "Profound Empathy", "Stigmata", "I_Feel_Your_Pain" or whatever.  This would fit in well with the self-sacrificing theme for paladins.  It would be cool if the paladin was forced into the kneeling position (rooted and unable to melee or otherwise de-buffed) for the duration of the effect.<P>It could be just melee damage or just spell damage, or whatever.  Could be based off paladin's defense/magic resist or those of the target.  Total damage could be greater than 100% of actual (ie: paladin & target take 70% of what target would have taken without)  Be aware if possible to buff warriors to over 5K HPs then the 10K fall wouldn't be deadly if split was 50/50.  <P>Should be a buff/Dot on both players, to keep it from being chained.  Duration and recast time should be carefully considered.  If it is a spell mana cost should be carefully considered.  The paladin could be immune to healing or other beneficial spells while in effect.  Healing the target should NOT heal the paladin.  <P>A longer duration but weaker version could be used to heal necros in Lich form (mana battery)  but it might be best if it wasn't cast-able on SKs or Necros.  Longer duration with weaker ratio also probably not good considering small mana-less heals from DeepWater Helm.<P>It could really be cool if targets were restricted by religion.<P>Overall, this would be cool in so many ways but also presents a lot of little problems that could skew the balance.  Fortunately there are also lot of different angles to approach for limiting its impact.<P>Once the code is in place for a buff/DoT combo, that is a buff to target and DoT to caster, many more flavors present themselves.  Perhaps increase target's MAX HPs by 150 at the expense of lowering caster's MAX HPs by 300.  The same could be done with AC or ATK.  Such sacrificial spells might be good for other classes as well, specifically priests, necromancers, shadowknights and maybe enchanters.<P>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<P>Second suggestion:  This one is shorter but really fun.  It is also probably less likely to be implemented.  Paladins are religious nutcases that will fight and die for their cause.  Perhaps like a modern suicide bomber a paladin should be able to cast a spell with all his mana that causes him to EXPLODE and die an un-ressable death (essence emerald) but does 10K (or 5x target's MAX HPs) area effect damage to all NPCs.  Any NPCs killed in the blast may have their corpses incinerated as well.  For even more fun make the paladin's corpse go POOF also.  Also good for wizard Fantastic-4 super-nova...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok guys listen up, until you are level 60 and go on dragon raids and such deeper in velious take my advice.  QUIT asking for some sort of discipline or ability to take the damage for someone else.  That isn't going to help pallys at all it will only make things worse and screw with clerics minds as to who they need to heal. <P>When dragons are the common high level mob in velious and hit from high 300s to low 1000s plus cast AE spells the last thing you want to do is take twice that amount.  Try to think of something that will improve our class not get us killed even faster.  The biggest reason nobody wanted rangers for awhile is because they died to fast and created downtime.  Is that what you want for us?  Sure this would be a great idea pre 50 but post 50 the idea would worsen the class balance.<P>I think the problem is to many pallys are so desperate for improvement they are willing to ask for something that will result in an insta self kill.  Either that or most everyone posting is thinking pre 50s instead of post 50s.<P>What pallys need is better weapons and a bigger variety of them along with some improvement to our offensive abilities/skills.  I don't mean to sound so harsh but at level 60 pallys don't need some "I feel your pain" skill when they have a hard enough time tanking the mobs there to begin with and as I said before this is NOT the type of skill that is going to help pallys into an uber mob raid.<P>The biggest problem with pallys pre 50 was the experience penalty and now that it is gone there isn't all that much that needs to be improved.  However the post 50 pallys are at the bottom of the barrol not a choice pick in any situation whether group or raid.  Pallys need something to make them strong and powerful for raids.  If they will be wanted again for raids then they will be wanted for groups.<P>Offense is the key, in order to rightfully defend the innocent you have to be strong enough to take out strong enemies right?  How can you do that when you have no offense at all?  If indeed pallys are 75% warrior, 25% cleric then pallys should have both the warrior offense and defense abilities to match that not just the defensive.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well as many have said some changes would make the paladin more wanted on raids and stuff.<BR>What i would add would be the following :<P>A skill block usable when shield is equiped. Shield where meant to block and this should be a skill we paladins get.<P>Stunning yep yep once we start engaging some nice 55+ level mobs we are useless. Our taunts is weak compare to warrior and the we do not hit as hard so putting hate argo on mob is pretty much difficlt but when the stun works oh yeah the mobs stick to us like glue.<P>We also should have critical hits and cripling blows on undead as a basing insinct we are undead hunters and this would put more fun in the came for us for sure.<P>More 1hs and shields we are pretty much limited here most paladins just use SOM and WS as 1hs in upper 50's and iether a bladestopper or Sarnak shield no much choise there atm.<P>Our Kunar Deepwater armour could have some better effects too I find that the sleeves affect smoote is more than to say usless as 90% of the mobs resit is and will argo on us anyway. <P>Reserection at low level with be much better also for the comunity and us. Majority of the time you need a cleric in sebilies not due mostly for healing purpose but for ressing purpose. It would contribute more to us and to the commuity and aslo take a big pain off the clerics being asked to res here and there.<P>Increase our DD damage from our lvl 49 spell. The spell procs once to 4 times in a fight with 100 dex but the dmg on it is less than what we swing for sometimes. the quest and spell would be also more looked for if the damage was increaded to double what it does.<P>LOH i hate it in the a huge fight when i hit loh on the mob instead of our group member and go waisted on a mob and the best part off it it does not heal him iether that pretty much a compliet waist.<P>Raise our AC !! we are defencive classes but our AC is very low compared to that of warriors we dont do damage we jsut take it so why should we not have a good ac ??<P>we are as i siad a defencive class so i will not whiny on us not doing damage but over all from what i see about the spell we need shields and the skill to block with shield damm it would help more than spells.<P>Trex Goldenknight<BR>Omega<BR>Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few more ideas:<P>Undead Criticals: Instead of this being a near useless discipline, why not make this just apart of our melee starting at a certain level like Warriors with criticals?<P>Sacrifice: A skill that allows you to transfer all but 1hp to your targeted PC.<P>Resist Poison/Disease: As undead slayers, we should have both of these spells well before 50.<P>Deepwater Armor: The effects could be looked into. The helmet and bracer are the only useful pieces. I would still like to see the helm be upgraded with Valor from Daring.<P>More 1HS/Shields: Every image I see of a Paladin he is using a shield. There is a serious lack of 1H weapons which aren't meant to be dual wielded. The Wurmslayer is a great example of the type that would be great.<P>And finally..<P>FA Books: As you've read in nearly every post, the drop rates are horrible and most have stopped leveling until they get them due to the fact they know they won't have a chance with the Kunark dragons. Suggestions would be have the dragons drop the book everytime or the same rate of the dragon scales, or drop the completed Book of Scale. Dropping the complete book would also solve the role playing aspect of having to raise faction with Dark Elves. A alternate NPC for books would be logical.<P>Donovan Leonheart<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Take out Celestial Cleansing and replace it with Remedy.  Heals about the same ammount, also fast but without the huge recast delay or Heal over Time.  Celestial is really to slow to help much which makes the old superior healing better.<P>3. Divine Str- Needs to stack with the new ranger buffs. -or- be improved some.  No way should a dropped level 60 spell not be clearly superior to a store bought 50 one from another hybrid.<P>LESSER ISSUES<P>1 handed weapons.  They rain from the sky for everyone else.  SKs have some great ones but the high end Paladin swords such as Halcyons Rod of Faiths and Zephywinds may as well not exist.  There isnt a single one of these on Tunare.<P>Corollary to 1 handers, Bash should raise to 252.  Paladins and Sks are the only ones that use Shields, it would be a very modest offensive upgrade but let us get better at our strong point, interrupting.<P>Stuns- Just plain dont work on too many mobs in Velious.

</FONT><HR>Just my $.02 on the idea of a protective discipline for high level Paladins:  First off, i really like the idea, as it matches well with the persona of a noble knight, and matches the defensive/protective nature of a holy knight.<P>How I think it should work:  When activated on a target, the paladin takes 100% of the damage directed at the target for a period of time (I won't try to determine what that time should be), with the following limitations:<BR>1.  The paladin must remain within a certain proximity to the target to be effective (I can't very well step between you and an incoming sword/fireball/whatever if i am on the other side of the room.)<BR>2.  The paladin cannot protect the target from AOE effects and will not take damage from anything that occurred prior to the activation of the discipline (like dots).  Possibly this should only be effective against line-of-site type spells, as other spells may be able to just hit the target straight out, but then, maybe the paladin can intercept some of those.  This would be especially important in order to prevent abuse of cannibalize type spells.<BR>3.  The paladin cannot cast or attack while using the discipline - he/she is concentrating all effort on defending the target.  Possibly riposte should be allowed though, as it is a type of defensive skill.<BR>4.  The paladin cannot protect the target from damage caused by falling.<P>One other alternative that had occurred to me was that the paladin could target a mob and take all of the damage output from that mob for a time.  I suspect that this would be rather impracticle, since most uber mobs would kill a paladin rather quickly in that situation, and it may also be rather unbalancing (There is probably a potential for abuse that hasn't occurred to me in there somewhere), but there it is anyway.<P>Just some thoughts, and thanks for the hard work Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yet, we are supposed to be simalar to shadowknights. Shadowknights get simalar weapons yet they have a pet and we don't. We are not "supposed" to do as much damage as a warrior, yet a druid can kill 4 mobs at one time. We are "supposed" to be part cleric, yet the God like druids get better heals. I am afraid they will never balance these classes. A handfull will always be godlike, and the others will get these bones thrown to them. All of the proposed changes in spells are still useless at the 50+ level where we have been begging for an improvement. So I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think we will be getting anything unique that will make us wanted on a raid.

</FONT><HR>just a thought about defensive Disc like the one that is making itself apparent (Pally takes damage for the target) I see this as causing probs more than solving them. It's fairly simple to see that if a pally was to use this on a Warrior (as was suggested) then this could lead to deaths. <P>for example<P>Normal Scenario without the Disc....<P>---Pally Hit's mob, along with the odd healing support to aid Cleric.

And stunning. <BR>---Warrior tanks mob<P>---Pally Uses Defensive Disc<BR>---Pally is now getting the full brunt of the mobs attack. Yet the paladin only has about 1/2 - 3/4's of the HP that a warrior has. <BR>---Cleric now has to CH Pally FASTER because the paladin is getting lower on health more than the Warrior was. thus using more mana<P>This Defensive isn't going to be very Cleric friendly.

</FONT><HR>Many informed and well thought out ideas here.<P>My 2 cp - I agree with most of you.  Better defensive abilities such as increased shield bash skill, better shields (a must!), AoE root and stun at high level.  On the offensive side - better undead damaging spells, more procs on weapons for undead (face it, we should rock undead better than warriors), better 1hs SWORDS (should be a Paladin's mainstay weapon).<P>And one more thing - would is be possible to allow a modest (say 50%) exp return by the time we get our first res spell at 49?  I am 52 now and have yet to use my Revive...no one at high level wants to loose all the exp at death, and given the loss sustained at high level, I dont blame em.<P>Really, helping out Pal's is not very hard, the drawbacks and deficiencies are easily seen after playing all the hybrids as well as a warrior.  Pal's are a great class, but more so for their RP value at this point, which is why they could use some uppers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Consider this.   A group needs one main tank, and multiple dmg dealers.  A group with a warrior with a main tank, will look for additional dmg dealers, not a low dmg tank.  Offence stacks in a group, defense does not.   If a paladin can not be the main tank, he has no place in a group since rangers and warriors out damage paladins 2:1.<P>Increase our offencive skills.  The lack of duel wield will keep our damage output lower then a warrior.<P>The spells we have do not stack with cleric buffs.  95% of groups post 50 contain a cleric.  The casting side will not make up for the dmg deficency and make us wanted in groups when they have one warrior already.<P><BR>I just want to pull my own weight in a group.<P>Eiago 54 Paladin<BR>Xedoi 53 Mage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps someone can explain to me the value of being a "defensive hybrid". How is that useful in this game? With supercharged mobs having more HPs and doing more damage at high levels the only thing that matters to a group is killing them as quickly as possible.<P>When I hear "defensive hybrid" I immediately think of a guy going into a bar picking a fight with the toughest guy there, doing little damage to him but absorbing an incredible amount of damage in the course of being beaten to a pulp. Onlookers admire his ability to take a punch. This fellow isn't very smart so he repeats this every chance he gets. Bar patrons don't call him a Paladin though ,they call him a fool. I didn't choose to be a Paladin to be a target.<P>Paladins need to do more damage!!!<P>This could be accomplished by making bash have a better damage per second ratio as the Paladin(or Sk)rises in level(maybe as a separate skill), so that by 50 it was maybe a ten D.P.S. and a 12 at 60.<P>Raise the attack/defense skills to max for all hybrids.<P>Raise the min damage for all 2h weapons.<P>Raise taunt for Paladins/SK's.<P>Crits to undead at 20th level for Paladins/SK's<P>Make stuns effective on high level mobs.<P>Make lull calm line work. (Polled all the Paladins and Clerics I know to see if they use these spells and to a person they all replied the same, "No they never work.")<P>I am fine with spell changes implemented on test. I don't want to be a Cleric.<P>High level discipline:<P>Sacrifice: Paladins hit points go to 1. For 12 seconds Paladin and whole group are immune to damage. Paladin cannot heal or attack in this time.

</FONT><HR>Jehred,<P>I completely disagree with your premise that a self-sacrifice type spell, discipline or ability would not be useful.  <P>Frankly, your comment suggesting that those of us who favor the idea don't understand the dynamics of the high level game is disrespectful and inflammatory.  Rather than increasing the venom of your rhetoric, perhaps you should try offering solid arguments against the proposition.  <P>Potential confusion for clerics sounds like a straw-man argument.  Pointing out the fact that these proposed abilities would have downsides does not preclude them from finding a limited strategic use.<P>Consider the following: <BR>1) It is unlikely that there will be a major shift in class balance resulting from this final push by Verant and <BR>2)Potential changes are not binary, your position would make more sense if only ONE of the many good suggestions in this thread could be implemented.<P>Id like to remind everyone that, from the outset, Verant stated that /disciplines were primarily created to add some flavor to the game for melee classes at the higher end.  <P>I can only speculate as to the meaning of flavor in this context but, to me, it means  something to break the tedium of /assist &lt;Soandso&gt; followed by /autoattack.  As paladins, our taunting spells and emergency heals have always provided this flavor.    The interactive gameplay experience of paladins is quite a bit more engaging than for warriors and monks, especially if they are not playing the role of puller or main assist target.<P>It is true that neither sacrificing ones health to aid another nor suffering an un-ressable death to save a group of people, solve the issues that you, Jehred, believe are important.  However, these proposals would indeed add a lot of flavor to the game, especially from a role-playing perspective.<P>-vbCoder<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Our hit miss ratio is a joke we hit for minimum dmg more often than we hit for maximum.  Now I remember why I turned misses off a long long time ago.  Generally we probably connect on a hit 50 percent of the time.  With half of those hitting for below the actual damage of the weapon.  My best round of damage was for approximately 400 dmg and this included 2 procs and hasnt been repeated yet.<P>Using our discipline holyforge I managed to squeeze out a hit for 164 I was feeling good about myself until the rogue in the group backstabbed for 412.  <P>Pre level 50 all the classes were pretty much balanced now with all the newly discovered worlds, and the difficulty of the mobs raised considerably, it's time to make us a bit more offensive orientated.<P>What would be so wrong with a Knight being able to do some damage.  I don't want to do the most damage but it would be nice to be able to do enough damage to a green mob to kill it solo without having to root and run.<P>Sure maybe with the Fiery Defender I may be able to accomplish this but the quest wasn't designed to be done by someone who doesn't get to spend a great deal of time in Norrath.  I've spent 123 days total to get to level 55.  I enjoy helping others more than getting things for myself.  <P>No one else seems to want to bring up offense as a fix to our problem but to me thats part of the problem and needs to be addressed.  I'm tired of going up against a green mob that has better resists than I do better attack than I do and a helluva lot more hitpoints than I do.<P>One last thing if you could please post a summary of ideas your considering for our class.

</FONT><HR>People seem to have a problem to understand how the concept of protecting someone works. I saw already 3 or 4 posts from people afraid of getting killed faster. The idea is not about taking 100% of the damage either, it is to separate it between the target and yourself. That means you will take only a % of damage done on target.<P>While you are in the discipline and if you are smart, you DON'T go under AEs if there are any, why would you go if the discipline cuts down a lot or even totally your damage output ? You just stay away healing yourself with help of druids and shamans, or a cleric if you have enough.<P>A discipline is not meant to be used blindly, you have to find when to use and how to use. You think a warrior just hit defensive and jumps in the fight vs uber mobs ? If you think so you are dreaming, only one warrior do so, maybe 2 at most, others either wait for first 2 to lose their defensive or go for damage discipline at the RIGHT moment, generally at the end.<P>I can't believe people are trying to destroy an idea just because they fear not to be smart enough to avoid the downside of it.<P>Some wants a damage discipline, why would you like that, whatever you ask, a rogue or monk with damage discipline is going to be much better than you and thus be more desirable by all means.<P>You are not going to be taken on raids if you ask for something another class already has in a better form, i tell you. If you ask for something unique that makes others even better, then you have a chance, eventually.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, all you ppl who think the sacrifice thing is a good idea.  I have to agree with Jehred that having the ability to kill yourself and save others in order to be welcome in a grp isn't balancing a class.  I would say this is only an idea but will not fix the balance issue, a note to Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I noticed you didn't taken note of this problem Absor:<P>Yaulp spells (Short duration str and small AC boost) are not stacking with Shaman HP talisman buffs (Altuna, Kragg - purely HP buffs).  Yaulp will also not stack with any Shielding spell (AC,HP,MR), nor will it stack with Focus of Spirit (Shm lvl 60 combo buff - HP,STR,DEX).<P>I think this should be corrected don't you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not trying to put down the idea, just trying to clarify why we need it. hell I'm all for more disc's but i just don't want VI to turn around and say "well we gave you this new discipline so you should all be happy now" when it's just not going to cut it. If the Paladin is not allowed to cast or attack while using the Defensive Disc (as stated) and taking dmg instead of the warrior, then why not just keep in the battle and get the pally to add some heals to the warrior, along with the druid and shaman. While also getting the odd hit on the mob. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good point Abashail. I was looking forward to using for the first time Yaulp (after the attack timer reset fix), but unfortunately it doesn't stack with my major shielding spell :-( so no Yaulp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a Warrior here are the ideas I like for Pallys to beef them up, some of the melee skills are applicable to Warriors too, but I have no problem with making them Paladin/SK Only as they would be class defining:<P>Shield Block Skill - gained at lvl 14.  Must have a shield equipped.  Could also be given to Warriors should they feel the need to go defensive.<P>Bash skill same as Warrior - Spell interruption is important no matter who does it.<P>Quest to make certain Pally 2hs weapons 1hs - Sword and Shield is class defining for Pallys, make it effective.<P>More Pally 1hs/1hb options - Variety is the spice of life.<P>Paladin Spells - A paladin should be about as effective as a Cleric 9 levels below him in total ability.  Hurts clerics some, but not the ones you would be grouping with.  Clerics get some relief from "Anyone with an EXP Rez here?  PLEASE????" if pally's get the same spells 9 levels later.  <P>Divine Intervention Discipline - LOH for the whole group.  Talk about a way to keep the party alive when it all goes down into the dumper.  This alone could be a reason to have a paladin sign on to your party.<P>Forget talk about having paladins become an extra set of HPs for other characters.  It sounds good in the beginning, but will cause more frustration.<P>Squires - Don Quixote had Sancho. The Knights of the Round Table had them by the bushel. SKs have skeletons. Paladins have nada.  Nor do Paladins have anything that compensates them for this lack of assitance in their spell book.  Not really sure of a solution, but it is something to think about.<P>Just some points I see from the warrior side of things.<P>Wilor Baneslayer<BR>Officer of Iron Tower<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
