&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>To the best of my understanding, a monk's intended role was to be a medium tank with high damage output. At level 50, they fulfilled this role admirable: only a rogue could inflict more melee damage, and with decent equipment a monk's high AC compensated to some degree for their low hit points, enabling them to stand in as a tank to some degree.<P>Post-50, this changes dramatically due to a convergence of two factors. The first is the skill cap changes introduced with the Ruins of Kunark. Prior to RoK, one of the monks biggest advantages was the fact that while other melee classes capped their skills around 200, monks could reach 230 or even 252 in many of their combat skills. This allowed them to deal more damage and recieve less via passive defensive skills and the defense skill iteself: a 30 point advantage here compensated to a large degree for the shoddy equipment monks were given. After Kunark however, this advantage melted away: because of the 252 limitation imposed on skills via the use of an 8-bit integer to store the relevant value, monk skills simply could not rise to the degree that the skills of other classes did. <P>Secondly, with Kunark, marvellous new armor and weapons were introduced for every melee and hybrid class: except the monk. Sadly, while cobalt and mrylokar's armor sets were introduced to warriors and rogues, monk's got Crescent: armor that is even worse than the Shiverback which we already had rotting in the bank. To be sure, monks got some spiffy new weapons but so did everyone else. Sadly, a level 60 warrior is able to compete with a monk in terms of damage dealt. Why? Well, owing to the quirks in the EQ combat system, which the item design team does not seem to understand particularly well, the top monk-only weapons (Tranquil Staff, Runed Fighter's Staff, Imbued Fighter's Staff) are outperformed by a multi-class weapon combination like the Jade Mace/Stave of Shielding combo. Warriors have the even more effective Blade of the Sebilite Croaking Dirk/Blade of the Black Dragon Eye combo available. To top it off, Warriors get triple attack, Rogues get double backstab... and monks get their weight restriction eased by 10 stone. This disparity is compounded by the fact that the new weapons for monks all take up significant chunts of their 14 to 22 stone limit: from 5.3 stone for the Jade Mace/SoS to a whopping 10 stone for the tranquil staff. Exceeding their weight limit causes a monk to lose AC. The excuse given is that these weapons are so powerful that there MUST be some drawback. The flaw in this logic of course lies in the fact that other classes have comparable or better equipment available to them, as I demonstrated above, with NO such limitation. You'll note that a warrior does not have to sacrifice damage if he wants to maximize his AC, why should a monk have to sacrifice AC to do damage? <P>Where did this leave things? Well, warriors are now the preeminent defensive melee class, while rogues grasped the offensive title quite securely. Sadly, the monks are NOT a blend of the two. Rogues can have higher AC than a monk and warriors do comparable damage to a monk. Is there any intention to look into this, or do monks comprise a small enough segment of the population that it is acceptable to allow them to remain a subpar melee class?<P>The only tests I have come across which dispute my own findings of the damage equivalence between monks and warriors was the test that Gordon ran a while back. I have a few problems taking that test seriously however. The ONLY weapon comparison he actually identified was that of a level 60 monk's fists against dual Short Sword of the Ykesha. This is not a valid comparison: SSoYs were subpar weapons at level 50. If I equip a monk with Cracked Staves and give a warrior those same SSoYs, then the warrior will badly outdamage a monk, it's just not a valid comparison of damage output due to the equipment discrepancy. test out some of the combinations I've listed: a Tranquil Staff against a Sebilite Croaking Dirk/Blade of the Black Dragon Eye combo, a Jade mace/Stave of shielding combo against a Jade mace/High_Ratio_Weapon00. It is possible that my own tests have been executed incorrectly, but my results when high level warriors and high level monks equip comparable weapons indicate that they inflict comparable damage. <P>To summarize:<P>Offensive Rankings:<BR>1) Rogue<BR>2) Monk/Warrior<P>Defensive Rankings:<BR>1) Warrior<BR>2) Rogue/Monk<P>So, why choose a monk over one of their more powerful brethren?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monks, in exchange for Armor, Hit Points, Taunt, and weapons were told they would do more damage than a warrior.  We don't.  The best solution to this i've seen is to give the off hand a damage bonus akin to what the primary hand, this will allow monks to outdamage warriors even if they are using the same weapon, this is where we are suposed to be.<P>Defensively we give up armor (look at the stats of shiverback) so that we can be more agile, yet all my defensive skills are on par with a warrior, yet my armor is not.  Monks should have higher caps on dodge/block/riposite, in exchange for not wearing armor.  This won't improve our ac, but give us a bit more survivability.<P>Monks need some way to lower the position on the hate list so that we don't spend 1/2 the battle fd on the ground or waiting for a rez.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>xianqi<P>while offhand damage bonus is a GREAT idea for dual wielding monks... it does NOTHING to help those that chose to use 2hb weapons<P>a more appropriate solution would be to scale our damage tables (so when monks use 9dmg weapons it is equal to a warrior using 12dmg weapons), or increase our To-Hit percentages, or increase our double attack percentages, or give us more attacks per round, etc etc<P>you see my point ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>my above solution also helps to solve the problem of the COMMON weapons that have insane damage/delay numbers... i.e. Jade mace 9dmg 18dly, lamentation 9dmg 19dly<P>sure a monk can also use the Jade Mace... so can nearly all melee classes... but if you made monk damage tables scaled upwards... the jade mace would be like a 12dmg 18dly weapon in the hands of a monk... and still be a 9dmg 18dly weapon in the hands of any other melee class<P>its really the best solution possible... it covers all options from 1hb to 2hb to fists (you must increase fists hehe )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think if you read Bodi's post, you will have a good idea of what every monk wants/needs. If any one doesn't agree, either they want too much, or they aren't a monk. I can live without most of the changes requested (well I have been so far) but I would like to stress the issue that FD be fixed in order to be more effective.<BR>If you consider all of the advantages a warrior has over a monk it's hard to understand why anyone would choose to play one. Issues like FD are not to make us superior, or to give us an advantage. When the unique Monk skills no longer are an issue, we become useless. It is unreasonable for a mob to reagro a monk after a sucessfull FD if the mob is no longer in agro range.<BR>The other issue I would like to see addressed is that of our quests. of equal time I spetn in SK and gorge (several levels) I saw Quilamane 3 times and the alchemist none. Quilamane is part of the mage epic quest, and supposed to be a rare spawn because of it's loot and demand among players. The alchemist is a lower level monk quest mob for gloves that are actually of lower stats than the gem inlaid gaunts. The extra weight isn't an issue when compaired to 30+ hours camping the alchemist.<BR>The Robe of Lost Circles is another issue. I am high enough level to raid the plains and equip my monk with some nice items. However I camped Raster 27 straight hours plus over 60 hours in 8 hour peices and have yet to see him. If it wasn't part of the epic quest I wouldn't bother. However, i don't believe monks should have to do 2 extramly difficult quests on top of the other extramly difficult additions to the monk epic. And to lose our robe in order to receive the epic is a slap in the face. We have to do these two difficult quests twice if we want our robe in addition to the epic. Monk quests are just too hard and time consuming for the level they are intended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part, I support the post Authored by Bodi and propogated by others that visit monkly-business.com. <P>I'd like to add this to the mix though, What is the job of a melee class? Melee classes are supposed to deal large damage with weapons or fists and absorb damage.<P>As it stands, Warriors are meant to be the damage sponge. They have supperior hit points, armor class and disciplines compared to other classes. They also need to have a means of keeping a mobs attention throught a fight. This is done by having a substantial damage output and the skill taunt.<P>Next we come to the Hybrids, they are meant to deal good damage, absorb damage and hold a mobs attention. They are supposed to do this job a little less effectively than a Warrior. Hybrids can come close in tanking ability when compared to warriors, but are a bit behind.<P>Now look at rogues. They are designed to be stealthy and to stay low profile while dealing massive amounts of damage with thier ability to backstab. They are supposed to deal very large damage and absorb damage somewhat less well than a hybrid.<P>The last type of melee is the monk. It is my understanding that a monk is meant to deliver large amounts of damage while avoiding damage thru their damage avoidance skills and the Feign Death skill. Monks are supposed to deal the most toe to toe damage of any melee class. They are also meant to absorb damage somewhat well and avoid it very well. I belive a monks deffensive ability is intended to be somewhere around that of the best hybrid classes, but not exceed them.<P>Now take these deffinitions of the melee classes and see how the monk stacks up. <P>Deffensive Abilities<BR>=================================================<BR>Monk HP fall somewhere below most all other melee classes. In my experience monk HPs are pretty similar to that of a rogue. All hybrid classes outpace monks and warriors do by an even more substaintail margin.<P>Next, look at armor class. Monks do decent here and fall behind warriors, above some hybrids and are similar to a rogue. From my experience, monk AC falls somwhere in the middle of the melee pack.<P>Lastly, consider deffensive skills. Monks do standout here. We have the wonderful ability to block incoming attacks. This gives us the opportunity to avoid attacks better than any other class.<P>So, that being said. Where do monks stand in the deffense category? From my experience, monks are of midrange ability in absorbing enemy attacks. The ability to completely avoid some attacks, offsets a portion of the HP defficency. But, monks tend to take larger damage on each attack that lands and some efficency is lost. Add to this a mediocre AC and I believe you see monks falling somewhere in the lower end of deffensive ability. Adequate for some situations, but poor in many.<P>I consider monk AC to be close to where it should be, but I think all classes need at least some increase in AC. The ordering is just about right, but I think the gap between the high end warrior and those further down the totem poll should be closed slightly. <P>I believe a small upgrade to some of the lower end melee is warrented as well, monks included. Nothing overwheleming, but perhaps 3-5% more. Meaning a level 55 monk would gain roughly 45-75 hitpoints base.<P>Consider the monks ability to mend and we gain some ground relative to a warrior and rogue, but all hybrid classes can regain hit points thru varrious spells. Essentially Mend leaves monks with the same sequential power, but shifts them relative to the 2 other pure melee classes.<P>Damage Avoidance Skills - A supplement to Deffense<BR>==================================================<BR>Feign death was intended as a way to keep a monk from taking damage, but with the advent of FD pulling and verants disdane for the practice it no longer functions as intended. Mobs of lvl 32+ will most often not be memblurred and in group situations will commonly act as if the monk never feigned death.<P>Rogues also have a skill that is meant to lower themselves on the agro list of a given Mob. This skill is evade. In it's current form it drops a rogue to the bottom of the agro list allowing the rogue to deal more damage without worry of being attacked for some time. This is soon to be changed, however, and it will only drop the rogue a few notches on the hate list. <P>It is my understanding that these two skills were intended to have a similar effect in practice although going about it in different ways. As it stands, Feign Death does not achieve what it was intended to an overwhelming majority of the time.<P>My suggestion is this. Add to the Feign Death ability an agro lowering component. If a complete memblur does not occur on a given mob, the monk should be dropped on the agro list some fraction of what rogues are. This should not affect FD pulling in any way since when doing this, the monk is the only PC on the hate list thus dropping them 0 slots on this list.<P>Offensive Output<BR>==================================================<BR>Monks are a damage dealing class. We are meant to let the warrior or hybrid take the punishment while we anihilate our common opponent. With our positioning in the deffinsive arena, I believe it is clear that monks are meant to have the second highest damage potential for any melee. <P>Rogues are supposed to do the absolute maximum melee damage when allowed to backstab. This is justified by the fact that their lack of healing capacity, hit points, armor class and deffensive skills.<P>Warriors sit on the other end of the spectrum. They are the most deffensively orriented class in the game. They have more hit points, better damage mitigation and higher armor class than any other melee class. Add to this the effectiveness of certain disciplines and you have the best attack absorber in the game. This being said, they need to have some means of holding a mobs attention. They do this by dealing large amounts of melee damage and the taunt skill.<P>Now lets consider monks. Monks are supposed to deal large damage to make up for their short comings as damage absorbers. So, a monk should do a good deal more damage than a warrior but significantly less than a rogue. <P>As it currently stands, warriors have the ability to do a large percantage of the damage a monk can. Some of the new velious weapons have better ratios than the absolute best monk weapons currently known to exist. Because of these weapons, I believe monk damage should be upgraded to increase their advantage over a warrior and close the gap between monks and rogues.<P>Conclusion<BR>=================================================<BR>Monks are a great class and I love playing one. If the things I've outlined are addressed, I believe monks will be balanced. First, slighty upgrade all melee classes Armor Class and Hit points, but increase those on the low end slighly more than those on the top. Second, change Feign Death to work more closely to what it was intended to be, a damage avoidance mechanism. And last, increase monk damage output relative to the new weapons of other class weapons now available with the advent of Velious.<P>Axiss Glox<BR>54.9 Iksar Disciple - (must make master tonight <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Chickenlegs.<BR>You are right, I in fact seem to remember Abashi saying that monks have different damage tables than warrior currently.  However it seems that all the testing (not done by me) has shown this to be false.  <P>I just don't want anyone at Verant to get confused and think monks are asking for a 2-5% increase in damage.

</FONT><HR>I don't know what it's like above 40, so as far as I'm concerned, the damage output is fine.  I also don't think we should limit our "balancing" to post 50. a lot of the balancing changes are starting in the 30's.  What I have a problem with is defense and resists.<P>Quote:<BR>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor…<P>This is the Vision for monks, right?   Isn't the classic "honorable"  martial artist trained to only use his skills when needed?  Aren't they trained to be more passive and defensive, only going on the attack to end the situation if they can't get out of it?  Aren't they also trained how to treat their bodies like temples and be in tune with it?  To me this all sounds like the monk should be the best at defense and resists.<P>All these other people keep going on about damage and AC, but what about raising the Defense, Dodge, and Reposte skills to match Dual Weild?  Duel weild goes up by 7 each level.  I would think monks would be the best at defense which is why they don't need armor.  Shouldn't these skills go up like dual weild.  We can do a lot more damage if we can keep from being hit and stunned.<P>What about stuns?  I see a lot of people mention special attacks and stuns.  Why don't our flying kicks stun?  You hit someone in the head hard enough and you'll stun them for a sec or two.  I get stunned by the mobs all the time.<P>I'm not for sure, but seems like someone in tune with their bodies could mentally block out more of that poisen, fire, cold, and magic.  I know at higher levels, a lot more mobs have casting ability.  In Dalnir, where my cresent drops, the mobs are blue to me at 30, but I can't get very far before 3 casters all hit me at once and I drop dead in my tracks.  I know there are a lot of armors with high resists, but all to heavy for the monk.  Maybe Monks could get an additional point on all resists every 5 levels or something.<P>I can understand why some warriors are worried about the changes when I see that others skills are being brought up to par with warriors.  Monks aren't supposed to be your usual melee class and warriors have their place as damage givers and takers.  The best way I see to balance us with warriors is not to increase our damage output per hit, or our AC on the few armors we do wear.  Instead focus on raising the defensive skills and saves so we can last longer to do more damage over a period of time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would say chickenlegs has some good points.  I do think that while monks can have pathetic AC due to same skill cap as warriors and more pathetic armor, they should have better defensive skills such as dodge/riposite/block, since i think part of the deal in giving up armor should be we are better at avoiding attacks and right now we aren't.<P>Monks also need a way to either get rid of agro so we dont' take the hits, or have a stronger ability to tank, this would come from more hit points, and another skill simular to defense, defense2 for example that would build up to give us more AC.  I think the logical choice is to give us a way to shed agro, the best way would most likely revisit feign death and give it the level 1-60 full mem-blur that it once had.  Pre-kunark it might have been unbalancing (though i don't really believe that) but i think a review of feign death post kunark and velious needs to be done, and it might be found that the full mem-blur is no longer unbalancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmm, Absor, noted most of your remarks made in the Monk section is commenting and noting the individual posts. Most monks have been bumping the Zadkiel/Bodi/Monky Business post yet you added things like 'Best throwing class' to your list which was maybe asked by 1 or 2 monks.<P>Nearly every monk who has posted has asked for our advantage in damage dealing to be brought back (though a rogue in its optimum position behind a mob should always to the most damage). You said in your first post that you didn't know that monks should do more damage than a warrior. No offense but Verant have always stated that monks are the kings on melee damage, recently change to toe-to-toe damage, yet a monk in his best gear (i.e. Tranquil Staff, Celestial Fist etc...) are barely clocking 10% more damage than a warrior.<P>Now with our severe lack of hps, somewhere close to 50-60% that of warriors, doesn't quite add upto our marginal increase in damage. And on defensive skills warriors aren't that far behind us:<P>Defense: 252-Monk, 252-Warrior<BR>Dodge: 230-Monk, 175-Warrior<BR>Block: 225-Monk, n/a-Warrior<BR>Parry: n/a-Monk, 225-Warrior<BR>Reposte: 225-Monk, 225-Warrior<P>Wow, no differece but our advantage in Dodge and a slight (negligable) increase in damage makes up for a 40-50% decrease in hp?<P>How bout offense:<P>1HS: n/a-Monk, 250-Warrior<BR>2HS: n/a-Monk, 250-Warrior<BR>1HB: 252-Monk, 250-Warrior<BR>2HB: 252-Monk, 250-Warrior<BR>Offense: 252-Monk, 252-Warrior<BR>Dual Weild: 252-Monk, 240-Warrior<BR>Double Attack: 250-Monk, 245-Warrior<BR>Piercing: n/a-Monk, 240-Warrior<BR>Kick: 225-Monk (flying), 225-Warrior (stun)<P>We now have literally no advantage in our offensive either. And before you say that we have other skills (i.e. mend, feign death etc...) just remember warriors have their skills as well (i.e. taunt, bash etc...). You'll get some warriors saying they'd trade their skill for feign death anyday, but you have to remember that people choose warriors for their tanking ability (takes heavy damage, taunts off others) whereas we choose monks for our damage dealing ability (deals heavy damage, reduces aggro via feign if it works).<P>I don't want warriors nerfed at all, thats hopefully not how people perceive this. I think warriors are great, and are the way they should be, but monks have not had the same level of gains the other melee classes have had post Kunark. Now we have similar damage output, but severly limited tanking ability when measured against out base class the warrior.<P>Example: if a monk can take down a mob 10% faster that a warrior, but requires 2-3 times the healing in mana that the warrior does to keep alive, who would you have in your group?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have another solution for effects to include bodi's discussion. Either make it where all are armour pieces have effects that can go off in combat of course not at once (which would probably be a programming nightmare) or switch it to something along lines of boots. Make it where we have different effects on different boots like warrior's do weapons. Since our feet are weapons we change are boots out for desired effect. Make it where whatever boot is wore is now our weapon effect. I know if we asked to get it put on current weapons and used weapons to reduce dmg the desired result would be good but i know it would either require reworking all current weapons to add some and/or change a couple handfulls. Let alone i believe it should be something we use as weapons that we are primary in i.e. hands and feet.<P>Then again if you wanted to program it switch it to skill where you can change between a coulpe different effects that say is on cycle with flying kick to change out effects there by eliminating weapon changes or items. Simply add a few effects like slow, stun, and maybe add one that you see alot in martial arts called something like redamage. where when opponent goes to hit you you hit the weapon or their limb insuch a way that intended dmg hits them instead and you don't loose and attack for it(similiar to riposte).<P>Other question i had why is disciplines of kicks reversed from levels attained? Shouldn't the lesser kicks get disciplines first then higher level? I would prefer a stun and crit like bodi discussed and change disciplines around. Just don't make much sense last kick you master you use first for a discipline rather than first.<P>Thanks for asking for our suggestions and concerns.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I embrace Bodi's/Zad/Monley Business suggestions :-)<P>On another note/ideas I wish we could make the monk more than just something that sits between a Warrior and a rogue.<P>Open up out skills, we have heaps of skills and special attacks, make them all more different/useful.<P>Many examples have already been given, High mend skill possibly curing disease/poison. Some of the other attacks maybe stunning or something at a high skill level. FD completly clearing at 200. And so on. Maybe chance of comboes going off. Go on watch some martial arts movies :-)<P>Give us a reason to use our fists more rather then just the epic (e.g. combos), only a faction of monks will get that.<P>Make us less reliable on equipment. Instead of trying to balance through equipment choices, give us increases (resists/whatever stats/damage/defense etc) via higher levels and higher skill values.<P>Hell on an extreme note, give each monk a choice via a quest to choice a path "of body" or "gear?".<BR>Those that choose body get increased AC/hps and stats/resists via skill levels and xp levels but cannot equip magical items (also i nice choice for a casual gamer). Those that choose gear kind of stay as is.<P>The body is honed as a weapon, I believe I read in the manual.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hrm...<P>Actually at lvl 38 I have even consistantly talked to 38 rangers with:<P>Higher: AC<BR>Higher: ATK<BR>Higher: HPS<P>And ontop of that.. <P>Have you seen the list of spells and other skills they get?  Come on, I am begining to think the hybrid penalties were a good idea.  And I think Verant has forgotten why they were there in the first place.<P>Scroll to bottom if you already know what type of spells I've listed as an example of why monks are so underbalanced against other hybrid classes:<P>Rangers spell list:<BR>Level 9<BR>Endure Fire<P>This spell adds to a players resistance to fire.<P>Flame Lick<P>Flame lick is a direct damage spell. This is a low damage spell but is great for fetching monsters and also lowers their armor clas.<P>Glimpse<P>This spell lets you take a brief glimpse at objects far away. Basically it gives you a 15-20 second period where your sight is zoomed in to the distance.<P>Lull Animal<P>This spell will can cause animals that are normally agressive to not attack if succesful. <P>Minor Healing<P>Minor healing is the first in the line of healing spells. <P>Skin Like Wood<P>This is the first in the line of buffing spells. It adds to both the armor class and hit points of a player.<P>Snare<P>Snare is an interesting twist on the root line of spells. While it does not hold a monster perfectly still(and prevent it from fleeing) it does drastically lower it's movement rate and has a much longer duration.<P>Level 15<P>Burst Of Fire<P>This is a direct damage spell. <P>Camoflauge<P>This is an outdoor only invisibility spell.<P>Cure Poison<P>This spell will counteract poisons.<P>Feet Like Cat<P>This spell will raise a players agility score.<P>Grasping Roots<P>Grasping Roots is an upgrade to snare. This spell actually roots the monster in place(instead of slowing him down) and also does a small amount of damage for the duration.<P>Invoke Lightning<P>This is an area effect spell which centers around your target. Beware however it will also damage you if you are within range. This spell is outdoor only.<P>Thistle Coat<P>This spell creates a mild damage shield.<P>Level 22<P>Bind Sight<P>This very interesting spell allows you to bind your sight to your target and view from their perspective.<P>Enduring Breath<P>Enduring breath is a water breathing spell. This is important if you wish to go to some of the underwater locations in the game. It is also useful if you get rooted while underwater.<P>Harmony<P>Harmony is an area effect spell which reduces monsters aggressiveness.<P>Ignite<P>Ignite is a direct damage spell.<P>Light Healing<P>This is the second in the line of healing spells. It heals roughly 25 points of damage. <P>Skin Like Rock<P>This is the second in the skin series. It may not be stacked with others in the line(see skin like rock). It adds armor class and hit points.<P>Ward Summoned<P>This spell is a direct damage spell for use versus summmoned monsters(elements). It has a very good damage:mana efficiency compared to your other direct damage spells.<P>Level 30<P>Barb Coat<P>This spell adds armor class as well as a light damage shield.<P>Cancel Magic<P>This spell will cancel out a magic effect on you or another party member. It can be a life saver if someone in your group get's charmed or has one of those particularly nasty Damage over Time spells cast on them.<P>Eyes Of The Cat<P>This spell will grant a player infravision. It is really only useful for human rangers.<P>Invigore<P>Invigore will restore a characters stamina.<P>Shield Of Thistles<P>Shield of thistles is a damage shield.<P>Stinging Swarm<P>Stinging swarm is a damage over time spell. This is a great spell to use during combat as it will slowly eat away at your opponents hit points.<P>Strength Of Earth<P>This spell will add to a characters strength ability for a period of time.<P>Level 39<P>Calm Animal<P>This spell will prevent an animal from attacking your party by lowering it's agressiveness.<P>Careless Lightning<P>Careless lightning is a direct damage spell. It does roughly 99 points direct damage.<P>Dismiss Summoned<P>Dismiss summoned is an upgrade to the level 22 ward summoned spell. This spell does a good amount of damage to summoned monsters and also features the best damage:mana ratio of any ranger spell.<P>Heal<P>This is the last heal spell that rangers will ever receive. It heals roughly 80 points of damage.<P>Levitate<P>Levitate allows you to levitate above ground. This can be useful if you are on a thin ledge and the mobs are casting spells which knock you off balance(particularly useful in lower guk). It can also be useful in places where there is a lot of lava or for quickly travelling over bodies of water.<P>Skin Like Steel<P>Skin like steel is the third in the skin like series of spells which add armor class and hit points.<P>Spirit Of The Wolf<P>Spirit of the wolf is one of the most desired spells in the game. This spell allows you to travel quickly in outdoor zones. It also is used in conjunction with Damage over Time spells in a cheesy tactic known as kiting where you outrun your opponent while the DoT spells slowly eat away at his hit points.<P>Level 49<P>Bramblecoat<P>Bramblecoat is the last in the line of thistlecoat spells. It adds armor class and a small damage shield.<P>Ensnaring Roots<P>This spell is a root spell which also does some direct damage.<P>Immolate<P>Immolate is a damage over time spell which also lowers a monsters armor class.<P>Resist Fire<P>Resist fire is an upgrade to the level 9 endure fire. It grants greater resistance to fire based attacks.<P>Shield Of Barbs<P>This is an upgrade to the shield of thistles spell. It is a higher level damage shield.<P>Superior Camoflauge<P>Superior camoflauge is an upgrade to camoflauge. While they both render you invisible this one works indoors as well as outdoors.<P>Wolf Form<P>This spell allows you to take the form of a wolf also taking on some of it's characteristics(higher ATK and faster movement). Of mention is that NPC's and monsters will react to you as if you were a wolf possibly preventing you from being attacked by certain mobs.

</FONT><HR>I've been playing a monk for a while now, I'm not to sure about ratios, skill caps and all the other stuff. I do know that the reason I chose the monk over the fighter is because to me it seemed like monk was long term, like a science project, while the fighter was like a friday night plan... quick & easy. I know we were supposed to be able out damage fighters, but I never seen it happen, but I did always seem to piss what ever critter we were fighting off, and end up tanking... What I have is just a couple idea's from the Veiw of not a HARD CORE (POWER PLAYER) but from someone who plays when the can.<BR>    1) Our Fists are supposed to be our great weapon, so I ask that you create level ranges & take the 3 best weapons from each range... and you make our fist equal to a combination os the second & third.... and for those that are willing & able... do a Quest to learn the Technique to become that top rated weapon. I really don't care about the weapons we get... I knew ahead of time we didn't get hardly any & what we got was trash... then RoK came out & from there us Monks were screwed... Sure we got some nice stuff... but I think of it as the stuff children get on christmas in homeless shelters.... it's better then nothing but it farrrrrrrrrrrrr from the greatest stuff. <BR>    2) Armor- We weren't really supposed to get much in the way of Armor, but all I know is that I get hit more often & frequent then a warrior... So what did I scarfice Health Points for? I feel that what's needed isn't better armor just an improvement to our dodge, block, riposite skills... make it so we can do this more frequent & often... remember this is why we gave up HPs & AC... but it's not happening like it supposed to.<BR>   3)Give monks the Bind wounds up to 75% earlier or give us a Mend Other Ability or even the ability to mend others with our Mend... the would be nice.<BR>   4)Better quest times & ratios ... it took me a month for the treant fist, so far it's taken me almost 2 months for the robe of Lost Circles ... and this is camping as soon as I get off work til I have to go in the next morning 1/2 time... and that's not cool.... PS fix the Treant Fists so they do something better then the gloves I was GIVEN at level 24 do...<BR>  I have more to say but thinking about the Treant Fist camp has made me angry  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"> & I forgot what I was going to type... so let that tell you for real I am... They are people that spend alot of time playing EQ... and I'm just here til Star Wars  comes out ... but make it actually worth their time that they spend on here... if someone has been camping a spawn for more then a given time let the guide be able to pop the spawn or give them an alternate quest from a more common spawn so they can retrieve the Item the need .... 1 month for Treant Fist (And the SUCK, trust me... THEY DO SUCK) is not right .... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>I realize that you havent done any direct changes to monks yet, but i feel the need to point out several things that are really going to upset the monk community. Please keep this in mind while you are doing your balancing.<P>To everyone else, monks especially. DO NOT TURN THIS THREAD INTO A FLAME. I am here to point out what may have been missed, and if you can help by finding something i have missed without flaming then by all means go for it. But i do not want a flamefest here.<P>First order of Business.<P>From the Rogue Talk Thread:<BR>1)<BR>Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points. <P>Before this change, Monks were the only meele class that could do this. It was one of our few post 50 improvements that everyone liked and appriciated. It made monks more viable to be able to bind themselves up, and thus being a 'less downtime needed' class. We could even bind others in our group to 70%, thus making us group friendly. Now everyone has this. Thus our advantage is gone.<P>2)<BR>Instill Doubt/Backstab/Special Attacks. We are not going to change the functionality of this, but we are going to make Instill Doubt gray out backstab and vice versa until the timer has expired. This should make it easier to know when you can use the skill, and prevent a lot of dud Instill Doubt attempts. <P>This has already started an uproar on the monk boards. The problem here is that monks have had this same problem with Instill Doubt not working with our special attacks, thus we worked out that because Flying kick(or any other special) doesnt grey out we can time the Instill doubt and Flying kick to coincide with each other, that is, if flying kick has just been used, its greyed, but Instill Doubt can be pressed then, and by the time The instill doubt animation gets to the final 'kick' that preforms the action, the flying kick button has ungreyed, and thus ID can work. The final motion of Instill Doubt is when it checks to see if Backstab or Flying kick is greyed, if it is, then it always fails, if it isnt, then it has a chance of working. So Making flying kick grey out with ID, will remove it from many monks hotkeys because we have been doing it this way for months, and this is how it works. Thieves could time there backstabs much in the same way we time flying kicks. If you have to make this change to ID for backstab, then please do not change it for flying kick and other monk special attacks.<BR>3)<BR>Haste increase on throwing daggers at higher levels. Similar to the Monk haste on Shurikens. <P>Noted. <P>Um...what haste on Shurikens? Even if this exists, i really doubt monks consider this as a point to remember when balancing. We are not suppose to be rangers. We use shurikens or hammers or whatever to pull, not as a damage method. (i.e. we dont want critical hits on throwing, its pointless and silly).<BR>4)<BR>Please fix the bug with Assassinate, where if I use the discipline Duelist on a creature that can in fact be assassinated, I will see the "Has assassinated his victim" msg, but the creature will not recieve the damage. <P>Im assuming that this bug also exists for the Monks Ashen hand discipline. Monks rarely use this skill because for some mobs, it would make the corpse poof if it successfully hit. Just a reminder to look at ashen hand when looking at assassinate bugs.<P>Paladin Thread:<BR>1)I don’t agree at all. The only thing that the paladin has defensively that equals a warrior is the defense cap. Warriors have better armor, skills (like parry and riposte), and hit points. There is no doubt in my mind that a warrior will still be better defensively than a paladin after these changes. <P>Alright, this is the monks biggest problem post 50. Before kunark, monks were balanced, and all was good. We did a moderate amount of damage above a warrior, and less then a rogue conditionally, we were about at the middle of the road. Then kunark came along. the additional 10 levels forced you guys at Verant to give the meele classes slightly better caps on skills so that the levels would have meaning. But the problem was that your limited to the 252 high number. Many monk numbers were high before or at 50th level, around 240 for weapons, 225 for hand to hand, 200 for our specials, 230 for offense and defense. Warriors were lower in offense and defense because we were suppose to do a bit more damage, and needed the slightly higher defense to compensate only slightly for our lack of high ac armor. After kunark, the caps were raised on warriors to bring them up to nearly equal to a monks. Including our own slight raising of the cap. This brought warriors damage output within 5%-10% of monks, as opposed to the 20-25% of before. You added many monk weapons to the game probably because you had no way to raise our cap. But weapons are an artificial fix, and we found that we must use them to fall within that 5%-10% range. Not to mention that monk only weapons prompted hundreds of twinks, and left many primary monks out in the cold scrimping and saving there coin (which is hard because of a weight limit) to try and outbid the other classes for our better weapons. Did you know the Tranquil staff is worth upwards of 60k-100k in trade on the servers? By the way, its damage output is greater then our epic (not to complain really, i put its proc and the effect of our epic on equal footing in terms of use, and the output is in most cases negligible). The Stave of shielding, another great monk weapon goes for 35k-50k easy. Sure we can camp them but both are ultra rare, and half the time people make you roll against them even if there class cant use it. <P>The point im trying to make is that because you are making hybrid meeles equal to a warrior, then the monk is becoming less and less viable as a different class. Why play a monk when a warrior can do nearly as much damage and has a much higher AC potential, not to mention much higher hit points? Monks arent suppose to be tanks, but because we outdamage warriors(sometimes), we typically are. We are in the same boat that rangers were in before with aggro. <P>What advantages do we have? To be fair, lets list them.<P>Mend.(A once every 6 minutes self heal of 25% of total hps)<BR>Feign Death.<BR>Instill Doubt.<P>Mend is useful, and once it becomes reliable (pre 100 skill it can worsen your wounds) it is relied on nearly as much as our attack key. But once used, that 6 minutes can last a lifetime.<P>Feign Death. Im not going to go into great detail here, yes its a very useful skill and its saved me many times, but its something thats been handed out to other classes, and has dimineshed in value over time, mainly because of the nerfs to it, and other classes being able to use it more effectively. What do i mean? I will give a small example. Feign pulling in the hole. You thought this was prevented by making all the mobs head back at once. A monk can not Feign Pull in the hole. A necromancer, or shadowknight, can pull 2 or more mobs, get off a darkness spell, which slows one mob, then Feign Death, the monsters all go back to there starting point, but the darkness'ed one is slower to return, and can then be single pulled. The change to mob returning to start points, was directly related to monks use of FD to pull. Now all it is doing is making us less useful to a group.<P>My own opinion on this subject is simple. Feign pulling is part of the game. The only reason many zones are considered balanced, or were before the change, is because the mobs could be pulled in limited numbers, that would make it possible for them to be killed. Many dungeons have such bad aggro radius, or bad pathing that to do a dungeon without FD, or an enchanter is suicide, as dozens of mobs will attack at once, and i would like to see any single group in your test area take a dozen blues on at once and live. I know you guys dont like Feign pulling, but its part of the game, it has been since the beginning, and you have designed the difficulty of many zones based on the ability of a party to single pull or double pull mobs as opposed to a dozen of them. Please fix Feign Death to always clear aggro. This would definately help monks become more viable..probably would help necros and Sk's too, but if you make it selective it would make the monks FD more powerful then the others.<P>Instill Doubt. This rarely works, and the prior information suggests that it may be nerfed along with the changes for the rogues.<P>Summary:<P>The monk is deminishing in differentiation. Why play one? what are the advantages? Does he have any skills or abilites that make him stand out? In some cases the warrior can outdamage him, he has a lower AC, he has no particular skills unique to his class except mend. Now the warrior can bind wounds just as well, and the hybrids can reach levels of damage output similar to the monk, especially the ranger, whos weapons typically have ratio's similar to the monks.<P>Solutions? The monks need to be viable again. We need to be able to contribute to a group, and show a value of uniqueness. To make a monk more group friendly, you could either reduce his mend time, and allow him to mend others, or/and fix Feign death, so that pulling becomes more of an option no matter the zone. To give him uniqueness, and desireability, he needs higher damage output, an increase of 15-20%, as well as giving him enough defensive skills to continue to be the tank he is now and the better tank he will hopefully be after a damage upgrade. Increaseing dodge/riposte/block skills to max would give us the ability to tank much better then we can now, and would offset our low hit points. Ask yourselves what is the difference between a tank with double the hit points or a tank that dodges or blocks half the hits directed at him. <BR>Please keep these ideas in mind when balancing the monk. I also ask that you look at bodi's and Zadikel's post again, as it also points out many things we as a community have aggreed on that we need.<P>Thank you for reading.<P>Azith Evertoon<BR>53rd iksar monk of the nameless.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When i first started EQ, i looked at all the classes that were available to use.  I examined each and everyone of them and the monk class looked impressive to me.  <P>Monks were capable of using their bare hands to kill monsters.  They were masters of the silent fists.  They reminded me alot like a kungfu master because of their abilities like dodge, riposte, block, flykick, dragon punch, etc...<P>The reason i chose to play a monk was because monks did not have to rely on weapons, expensive armor, or items.  Their body itself was a weapon and an armor.  They relied on their skills and perfected them inorder to become a master.  They also could not take alot of damage, but can prevent most of it from using blocking and dodging techniques.  For this reason, that is why i chose to be monk.  I thought that was Verant's so called "vision" of a monk.  <P>Nowadays, i see monks with jade maces, tranquill staff's, plated boots, etc.  I've asked them why they wear all that stuff and they told me because it's the only way they can do their most potential damage and keep up with the rogues and warriors.  This saddened me...to think a brother/sister has to enfringe upon himself/herself with weapons, and non-monk armor just so he/she can do ALMOST as much damage as a warrior or rogue.<P>Monks are supposed to be masters of the fists, not masters of using weapons.  We suffer the HP/AC loss from not being a warrior so that we can be a better damage dealer when compared to a warrior.<P>Why should monks be forced to use weapons that are not their own?  Warriors and rogues have weapons that, when compared to our epic fists, they still out damage us.  Verant must have forgotten their so called "Vision" of monks, and geared their attention more towards warriors and rogues.<P>I feel distraught when i'm in a group with a warrior because they out damage me.  It ruins your confidence in your abilities, your hands, and yourself.  <P>Why should i play a monk when i can play a warrior or rogue?  What benefit other than FD will i get from being a monk?  Right now there is none.  Before kunark, monks were sought after in every group.  Nowadays, they are rarely in groups, unless in high lvl dungeons like Karnors Castle and Sebilis ONLY for the feign death pulling.  Us monks should be wanted in groups for our damage dealing and not because of feign death.<P>Please look at how us monks are being neglected and make us strong like we were in the beginning.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Very simply............Fix FD........<P>A caster's chance of getting a spell resisted depends upon the resistence that mob has to the spell being cast AND the level of the mob in relation to the caster's level.<P>Why not make FD similiar?  A lvl 55 monk should be able to fool a lvl 45 mob into believing he is "dead".  Make the FD aggro slate clear if the mob fails a save vs the monk's lvl.  That way monks can again use the FD ability with some amount of confidence.  It is sad to see 5 green mobs come waltzing back to a monk who has to FD 10 or 15 times to get them to leave.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gads, I see all these people asking that improvements be made for monks, but post 50+. What's up with that? What about the up and coming monks.<P>As for my two bits.<P>armour: monks should get a natural increase in AC as they progress in levels, and this should start about 12th, or 15th. Since the monk is so used to being hit, that his skin becomes more resistant to blows. <P>Weight Limit: monks should be able to carry more as they get higher in levels, since they have the ability of mind over body. They should be able to mentally compensate for higher min. weight limits.<P>Attacks: I agree with other posts, some attacks should have damage limits, to hear that I would get a special attack, gear up and use it in combat only to do 3 points, hmm... Might make me think not to use it. Plus why not have a chance for a monk to make a critial hit with this special attack. Thought monks were supposed to be the masters of melee, so they should be able to size up and mon and have a chance to strike it at it's weakest point. <P>Healing: Would be nice is monks could heal a little faster, mend works well, but a monk should have some sort of meditation skill that allows him to mentally heal faster, since again it is the mind over body idea. Plus being able to cure a decease or posion at a mend skill of maybe 140-160 would be better, I don't belieave that monks should have to wait till they are old and grey just to be able to use these abilities.<P>so.... 16th lvl monk...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope this doesn't get lsot in all the other posts... but here is another idea I had.<P>Monks really want to be unique.  That's why we chose the class to begin with.  We WANT to be able to fight barehanded.  We WANT things which distinguish us.<P>So in the high level game.. which players start entering around level 46 with the plains, please give us the ability to be something more than very weak rogues.<P>So... how about giving monks the ability to alter their fighting styles for an extended period? I'm not suggesting let them tank as well as a warrior, but how about the ability to start using a style that starts making us block and/or ripost most attacks, to the point that we are almsot as good as a warrior, but at the cost of not being able to initiate an attack against the mob. <P>This will allow us to provide some usefulness to the group, when needed,  if say a warrior falls or something, but will not allow us to become generally useful tanks. <BR>Since we can not taunt, if we are using our defensive style, we will not be doing much damage (except from riposting) so we will not be able to draw attacks away from casters classes, and it will not unbalancing.<BR>(note this will still leave us with the same extream weakness to casting mobs we've always had.)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the recommendations posted from the monkly-business compilation.  I just want to add one thing...<P>Feign death should work with the same reliability regardless of how many hp you have.  Generally, if I'm at two bubs of health or less it will fail (but never give the failure message) and you will most likely die.  If anything, it should be more reliable when you are low on health given that the skill is about pretending to be dead, no?  People who are near death should be more convincing appearing dead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   Well... One thing I wanted to add about the constant comments regarding Monks and weapons.  Anyone who has seen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or any number of such films, OR simply knows some history about fighting Monks, you would know that Monks use probably MORE weapons that most fighter classes.<P>   Between the many kinds of staff's they also (in the case of many types of samurai's) used several different types of swords or other bladed weapons plus a multitude of odd-ball weapons who's names i don't know.  Maybe this is asking too much but it seems to me that a monk in RL at higher levels of their training would be able to "choose a weapon" to specialize in that is obscure and quite rare.<BR>   Perhaps this weapon specializtion could be implemented into the game and be added at say 30th level... with several of that type of weapon available to loot or quest for in a range of qualities, so that the one you could quest at level 30 might be a 11/29 katana or something, and then another quest is available at 40th level for an upgraded version, and again at 50 and again near 60.  This would almost be like choosing a fighting style.  Likewise... for Monks players who prefer the weaponless style, their could be specializations that are non weapon.  i.e. they perform a quest to be trained by some hidden master they have to find somewhere.... and he "teaches them the basics in mantis aversion"...<BR>   Also, if the higher level versions were good it may be a way to get the monks doing more damage simply by making their quest staff or katana or sectional staff have a killer ratio at level 50+...<P>   I am not sure if these class discussions are a closed topic or not, but having read over them, this was my input.  Also, that really long post from the folks at that other monk site really had the clearest layout I have seen.  Many great considerations.<P>   Thanks - <BR>Ashremm Goldendawn<BR>Monk of Luclin<BR>&lt;Discordia Eternum&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
