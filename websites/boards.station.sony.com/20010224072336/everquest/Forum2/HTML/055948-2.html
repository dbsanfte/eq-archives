</FONT><HR>Oh btw, warriors receive DISCs. Any seeing as you say your level 60, then you would know that the XP group thing has changed to uber-mob hunts - specialy if your in an uber-guild. And DISC's count for alot so don't leave them out. As for our buffs? Groups post 50 always have clerics, so our so called useful buffs arent used incase you haven't noticed. I'm so sick of poeple saying that a self buffed paladin is very close to a warrior - well that isnt the case when your in a group and the warrior and you are both buffed from the clerics buffs. Paladins need to get a serious upgrade and warriors need to get educated.

</FONT><HR>Back when I was playing a druid.. before he retired, I partnered up with hybrids and warriors in the oasis.  I would use my nifty damage shield on the tank and let them do all the work for me, i just kept them healed.  I can tell you the first level i noticed the difference between warriors and hybrids.  Level 10.  With warriors i might heal them once in a fight and even at level 10 there was a noticable difference in hit points.  Hybrids i'd often heal more than once.  I grouped a bunch of people, none overly twinked but i can feel comfortable saying there _is_ a difference even at lower levels, even when max skill caps are not even close to coming into effect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You say keep saying that hybrids get spells and such. I guess you haven't played a hybrid at the higher levels or you would realize that these spells are not that useful and at most times useless. I shouldn't have to pay a large penalty in melee for my spells in which are useless when my parent class is with me 95% of the time. <P>  Sure even if a useful disc reuse time was 1 hour, LOH is 72mins. I would trade LOH for one of those useful DISC's, even one of the less useful DISC's of a warrior. LOH does nothing for a raid while a warriors DISCs are one of the attributes he contributes to the raid besides the being the best TANK is very good melee output.<BR> <BR> I have made shown through example and facts why a warriors is superior to a hybrid. All that you have said is: Hybrids can tank as well and get spells/LOH/HT. Again, we get spells to make up for the poor melee we can do. We get LOH/HT , but you get class abilities also - 9 DISC's. You can argue that having DISC's in general isn't as unique as LOH/HT but we are debating about our effectiveness not uniqueness.<P> If I have come off somewhat grumpy, its because of warriors who don't understand the differences and inefficiantcies that hybrids experience post 50. If you are going to argue that hybrids are going to tank just as well if not better, then provide some examples/facts. Otherwise your just stating your opinion and this is were your fallacy is.<P>  About the hybrid only weapons, paladins have crap to pick from when it comes to class only. The two you have provided are so rare that only a few have ever been found on half the servers. Although there aren't very much warrior only weapons, the ones that are war/pal/shd are GEARED for warriors. Warriors duel wield- plain and simple. Warriors use low delay with ok ratios becuase they want to hit that 1hs bonus as much as they can. The off hand provides the additional damage lost by using the above average ratio weapons in the primary hand. The reason the pally/sk weapons are class only is because they would make the warrior to powerful when added to the higher bonuse/offense/weapons skills they get.<P> These weapons still dont even allow the paladin/sk to come close to the warriors damage output. But atleast your stating facts and examples to back up your claims. But they won't prove that the pally/sk are better or the same. Lets keep the arguement focus'd. If your stating listing weapons, then state what relation they have to the debate, ie "here is why &lt;insert class here&gt; is just as good as &lt;insert class here&gt;."<P> As far as having something(warriors) that other classes don't have, warriors are about function not uniqueness in IMO and I think according to Verants Vision(tm). So lets stay within the arguement you originally posted.<P>PS: I'm not against you in any personal way, even if it comes off that way, I just love a good debate. Keep it coming.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I ask you this: If a paladin/sk were made to tank close to a warrior, then why would that hurt the game? Do you think you(warriors) should hold a monopoly on the tank slot? I think warriors and hybrids need to be balanced in a way that in some situations the hybrid would be the better choice for whatever reason and the other way around. There should be times when a hybrids can fill the roll better then a warrior. If our offense isn't increased to half way between what it is now and a warriors, then we should have better defense than a warrior - being were are supposed to be the defensive tank( according to Verant).<P> My arguement is that if a paladin(wont speak for SK's) is supposed to be a defensive class, then they should have the best AC/defense of any class with the same poor melee( currently the lowest in the game). Warriors should be in the middle with great AC/defense and great offense/damage, but not the best in both compared to a paladin/sk. Here is the logic reasoning for this: <P>- The monk/rogue should( and do) have the highest melee in the game with low AC but good avoidance skills, the warrior have the second highest melee of the of the above classes and and second highest defense of a paladin/sk. The paladin should have the highest AC/defense of the melee classes with the lowest melee. The sk should be halfway between the warrior's defense and a paladins with melee a little better than a paladin. Rangers should have the exact melee of a warrior but the lowest defense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Axem, you are so clueless, it's mindboggling.<P><BR>The recent upgrades to hybrids do not increase their effectiveness from 1-50. For Paladins and Shadowknights, the defensive increases will equate to an extra 2 points per level post 50. For Rangers, it's a one point offensive increase per level post 50.<P><BR>You claim that the best weapons are PAL/SHD.<BR>You cite the Zephyrwing and Halcyon Broadsword for Paladins. These two swords are more rare than the warrior epic.<BR>The weapons you mention are also meant for a class that can dual wield.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> Many of you are completely missing a fundamental point here.  A player's contribution to a group cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of defensive and offensive ability.  Hybrids, by their very definition, have a diverse range of other abilities.  <P>Paladin:  <BR>1. Root parking.  Pull 2 mobs?  Don't have an enchanter with you?  Paladin will root park one of them.  For those that can't grasp the importance of this, I'll explain: When 2 mobs are pulled, but the paladin root parks one of them, the damage taken by the group IS CUT IN HALF.  That alone is a pretty darn useful to a group.  <P>2. Lay on Hands.  An instantaneous heal that is somewhere between a SH and a CH?  WOW!  That's a pretty powerful ability.  Paladins can save lives in situations where even clerics cannot.  You must realize how powerful it is to have a major heal THAT HAS A ZERO CASTING TIME.  Because of this, the paladin is the single best class in the game for saving a party member who is a few seconds away from death.  Countless whole-party wipeouts have been avoided by LoH.  <P>3. Superior heal.  Paladin heals between fights help save clerics mana.  Superior heal is good enough to be used during battle even.  <P>4. Buffs.  Contrary to what many on these boards say, not every group post 50 has a cleric (and after the upcoming changes, clerics will be even less necessary than they are now).  When no cleric is present, paladin buffs are very useful.  <P>5.  90% exp res.   One of the most group-friendly spells in the entire game.  Some warriors would give up all of their disciplines for this spell alone.  I've seen people pay clerics 1000 pp for a 90% exp res.  That pretty much proves that cleric resses are not always easy to obtain.  You can't possibly tell me that this spell isn't useful. <P>6.  Taunting.  Paladins can taunt far better than warriors can, because of their spells.  All the defensive ability in the world does no good at all if the warrior can't get the mob to hit him and the paladin can.  'Nuff said.  <P>Shadowknights.<BR>1. Lifetaps.  The hp advantage of warriors can be easily made up for in most situations by SK lifetaps.  <P>2. Harm Touch.  This ability alone is better than <BR>any of the warrior's offensive disciplines because it does its damage INSTANTLY.   <P>3. DOTs.  The usefulness of these depends on the situation, and how long the mobs are surviving.  But you can't tell me that an 1152 damage darkness/dot isn't useful.  <P>4. Pets. Yes, I know SK pets suck and will cause trouble in some cases.  But under the right circumstances, a SK pet DOES increase the SK damage output.  <P>5. Darkness line.  Warriors have no way to stop runners.  Shadowknights do.  Runners can cause serious problems in most dungeons.  <P>6. Feign Death pulling.  Many areas are impossible to do without a FD puller to break the spawns.  This plus high defensive ability makes SK *MUCH* better pullers than warriors.  <P>7. Taunting.  As with paladins, SK can taunt *MUCH* better than warriors.  If the 3 heavy tank classes get equal defensive abilities, why would anyone want a warrior as a tank, when they are the worst taunters of the 3?  <P>The warrior disciplines are not all they are cracked up to be either.  Some of them are totally useless, one or two are useful only in rare situations, and most of them just do the same one or two things, just in different ways. <BR>Our only really good one was defensive, and that one is getting nerfed, possibly to uselessness (remember it doesn't matter how well the warrior tanks if he can't get a mob to hit him).  <P> Currently, warriors are doing ok because they can out-tank hybrids.  But after these upcoming changes, this advantage may disappear altogether.  And that would leave warriors seriously underpowered compared to paladins and shadowknights.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, here's my take on this: (flames ready to be recieved!)<P>As a 45th lvl halfling warrior i LOVE playing a warrior.  I have few complaints other than Taunt not working worth a crap and my critical hits rarely seem to hit for more than my max dmg lately.   <P>Hybrid changes:  GOOD, i'm glad to see other classes are getting upgrades again.<P>MY Major problem:  I have no problem with being outdamaged by monks and Rogues (and most Rangers now that are post-40), but I really hate the fact that a friggin Mage pet can quad-hit for high 40's dmg with little to no player interaction. Thats up to 200hp dmg per round for that pet (not adding elemetal attacks)I'm DW'ing a Vluudeen's Tail (7/22 25hps 10sv cold) and a cane of tranquil(11/25) and rarely do more than 100hps dmg/round IF i get a off-hand double attack.

</FONT><HR>Paladin: <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Root parking<P>Since every class except SK, Magician and pure melee have the spell 'root', this is hardly a unique ability. Having an enchnater 'mesmerise' a mob is much more efficient. Not to mention haste and enhanced mana regen they bring to a group.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Lay on Hands.<P>An instant 2000-2500 point heal once every 72 minutes is not as useful as it may seem at first. A level 55 warrior has a discipline called defensive which will mitigate in excess if 2000 points damage per 72 minutes if used properly.<BR>In epic encounters, a LOH on the primary tank usually means an instant frenzy on the paladin. Considering Paladins dont have a defensive discipline and (currently) have laughable defensive skills, the Paladin more than often ends up dead a few seconds after LOH.<P>3. Superior heal.<BR>Nobody will argue the merits of a ~600 point downtime heal. However, it's not efficient for a paladin to use in the heat of combat. The 4+ second cast means the paladin will lose a few attack rounds. Also consider the fizzle rate. SH is not efficient for regular use until level 58-59.<P><BR>4. Buffs.  Contrary to what many on these boards say, not every group post 50 has a cleric<P>Do you actually play the 50+ game?<BR>Paladins are not a viable healer or buffer in a 50+ XP group. Shaman and Druids can fill in a 50+ XP group as a healer in a pinch. Paladins have a fraction of the healing/buffing power of these classes making them an appropriate healer for farming green dungeons.<BR>I play the high level game, I play a high level Paladin and a high level warrior. 95% of my groups include a cleric. So in essence, you ARE correct. Not every group has a cleric. There is, infact a tiny minority that do not. A level 39 cleric is a more efficient healer/buffer than a level 60 Paladin.<P>5.  90% exp res.<BR>   <BR>How many level 60 Paladins do you see running around Norrath? Now compare that to the number of level 49+ Clerics. I know for a fact, the number of clerics will outnumber the Paladins about 200-1. The number of Cleric Epics on Veeshan optnumber the 60 Paladins about 30-1 on Veeshan.<BR>Ask any level 60 Paladin how often they have memorised the Resurrection spell.<P><BR>6.  Taunting.  Paladins can taunt far better than warriors can, because of their spells.<P>What group would want the Paladin taunting and tanking? Supbar damage avoidance and mitigation skills coupled with lower HP make the Paladin a poor choice for a primary tank. Rangers can also taunt better than Warriors..... would YOU want them tanking?<P><BR>Shadowknights:<BR>1. Lifetaps.  The hp advantage of warriors can be easily made up for in most situations by SK lifetaps. <P>Mana used for Lifetaps cannot be regenned at the rate of a warriors HP using CH. Mana is limited, in order for a SK to cast lifetaps, they requie meditation time. More downtime = less efficiency.<P><BR>2. Harm Touch.  This ability alone is better than<BR>any of the warrior's offensive disciplines<P>This ability can also be resisted and has a cycle time of 72 minutes that does not decrease with level.<P><BR>3. DOTs.  The usefulness of these depends on the situation, and how long the mobs are surviving.  But you can't tell me that an 1152 damage darkness/dot isn't useful. <P>Most mobs that wont resist will be dead before the duration of the DOT. SKs DOTs have VERY LONG cast times and cannot be realistically cast during combat. Shadowknights only really DOT when soloing.<P><BR>4. Pets. <P>In a dungeon situation, if the SK is the main tank, the pet is a liability with an enchanter. Mobs cannot be taunted by the SK (off the enchanter)for fear of the pet going ballistic on it after it is messed. Pets do very nice damage, but are only useful in an outdoor or a solo situation.<P><BR>5. Darkness line.  Warriors have no way to stop runners.<P>Silken whip of Ensnaring, that sword from COW that procs darkness..... etc.<BR>I won't argue the usefulness of darkness. There are 4 other classes that are just as effective at 'snaring' mobs.<P><BR>6. Feign Death pulling.  Many areas are impossible to do without a FD puller to break the spawns.<P>Monks are much better feign pullers than shadowknights. The number of areas that 'require' a feign pull are few and far between.<P><BR>7. Taunting.  As with paladins, SK can taunt *MUCH* better than warriors.  If the 3 heavy tank classes get equal defensive abilities, why would anyone want a warrior as a tank, when they are the worst taunters of the 3? <P><BR>See above in regards to Paladins. Giving Paladins and Shadowknights an extra 22 points in defensive does NOT bring them up to the level of Warriors. Warriors still have superior AC and damage avoidance skills.<BR>Are you forgetting that Rogues and Monks actually have BETTER defensive skills than warriors?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rainblade<BR>Station Member   posted 02-09-2001 12:46 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Many of you are completely missing a fundamental point here. A player's contribution to a group cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of defensive and offensive ability. Hybrids, by their very definition, have a diverse range of other abilities. <P>&gt;&gt; I agree with somewhat. Defense and Offense represent the major of the ability of being a tank but not all of it. Hybrids do have a diverse range of other abilities, but they don't make up for the penalty that they carry in melee/defense.<P>Paladin: <P><BR>1. Root parking. Pull 2 mobs? Don't have an enchanter with you? Paladin will root park one of them. For those that can't grasp the importance of this, I'll explain: When 2 mobs are pulled, but the paladin root parks one of them, the damage taken by the group IS CUT IN HALF. That alone is a pretty darn useful to a group. <P>&gt;&gt; Yes paladins can park mobs. I do it quite frequently when we have a pull with multiple mobs and adds. But: 1) enchanters are very common in groups post 50 which mez. 2) Clerics, Druids, Shamans?, and Wizards can and do park also.<P><BR>2. Lay on Hands. An instantaneous heal that is somewhere between a SH and a CH? WOW! That's a pretty powerful ability. Paladins can save lives in situations where even clerics cannot. You must realize how powerful it is to have a major heal THAT HAS A ZERO CASTING TIME. Because of this, the paladin is the single best class in the game for saving a party member who is a few seconds away from death. Countless whole-party wipeouts have been avoided by LoH. <P>&gt;&gt; Lay of hands is a great ability before you get into the levels were a cleric is regulary using Cheal. LOH at level 40 does 1200hp, 1600+ @ 50, and about 2500 @ level 60. This looks good on paper but at the higher levels doesn't work out quite as good. At the level 60 this will barely heal half a warrior. Its mostly used for healing the cleric/enchanter. So we are there incase every 72mins there was an emergancy(assuming we had to use it evey 72mins otherwise its longer)? I have saved casters eveytime when I have used it, but how many times does the group live still because I saved the caster? About 50/50 since the only time I use it on the caster is when we have a train of mobs and we can't kill them faster enough and there on the enchanter/cleric. And when I do save then there are usually OOM in a few minutes because we still can't handle all those mobs. Sure LOH has its places, but that far and inbetween. And the fact that is has this ungodly long recast time makes it even worse, but I guess that's what we pay for it being manaless. So what does a warrior pay for his DISC's? Time? So do we.<P>3. Superior heal. Paladin heals between fights help save clerics mana. Superior heal is good enough to be used during battle even. <P>&gt;&gt; Do you know what level a pally gets this? Do you know the ungodly fizzle rate we pay for getting this spell so late(57)? Did you know that it doesnt heal as much as the clerics version and it cost more mana because we have spell penalty? We also don't have a skill cap in that spell line like the cleric does. And when the spell fizzles, it still costs mana( which have no way near as much as a pure caster). The amount of mana it takes, fizzle rate, the level we get it are the main reasons that make this spell very useless. If it were moved to down to 51 or 53 then yeah you could say that it is a somewhat valuable spell. And no, this spell isn't good enough to be used during battle by paladins: 1) we dont have the mana to keep up with it and the fizzle rates( which hurt a lot). 2) the cast time is to long fit inbetween swings and if you tried it, you would be interrupted everytime be the mob. 3) If we stood back and casted this on another tank: a) see #1. b) then we would be tanks then now would we.<P>4. Buffs. Contrary to what many on these boards say, not every group post 50 has a cleric (and after the upcoming changes, clerics will be even less necessary than they are now). When no cleric is present, paladin buffs are very useful. <P>&gt;&gt; I agreet that if they fix the cleric/druid/shaman problem, then our buffs would be worth a lot more. But since that hasn't effect our game style yet, then I'll keep arguing that our buffs are totally useless with the cleric being in the group 95% of the time. There is another reason we pay a penalty for poor melee/low defense for useless buffs.<P>5. 90% exp res. One of the most group-friendly spells in the entire game. Some warriors would give up all of their disciplines for this spell alone. I've seen people pay clerics 1000 pp for a 90% exp res. That pretty much proves that cleric resses are not always easy to obtain. You can't possibly tell me that this spell isn't useful.<P>&gt;&gt; There is an easy answer to this one. 59. That is the level that we get it. At level 59, you would be crazy to pass on a clerics 98% rez for ours. It has its very limited use, but while it looks good in theory - in PRACTICE has proved how little this provides to a group because at the level of which we get it.<P>6. Taunting. Paladins can taunt far better than warriors can, because of their spells. All the defensive ability in the world does no good at all if the warrior can't get the mob to hit him and the paladin can. 'Nuff said. <P>&gt;&gt; Easy answer to this one. Yes we can taunt pretty good, BUT we don't have the defense to take the hits if we tuant the mob onto us. At level 60, even a monk has just as good AC with better damage avoidance skills, ie avoiding damage is better then taking it at a reduced rate. Warriors are up there with a monk and better AC. So inreality it makes no sense for a hybrids to have better taunting ability when he can take the hits  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Shadowknights.<BR>1. Lifetaps. The hp advantage of warriors can be easily made up for in most situations by SK lifetaps. <P>2. Harm Touch. This ability alone is better than <BR>any of the warrior's offensive disciplines because it does its damage INSTANTLY. <P>3. DOTs. The usefulness of these depends on the situation, and how long the mobs are surviving. But you can't tell me that an 1152 damage darkness/dot isn't useful. <P>4. Pets. Yes, I know SK pets suck and will cause trouble in some cases. But under the right circumstances, a SK pet DOES increase the SK damage output. <P>5. Darkness line. Warriors have no way to stop runners. Shadowknights do. Runners can cause serious problems in most dungeons. <P>6. Feign Death pulling. Many areas are impossible to do without a FD puller to break the spawns. This plus high defensive ability makes SK *MUCH* better pullers than warriors. <P>7. Taunting. As with paladins, SK can taunt *MUCH* better than warriors. If the 3 heavy tank classes get equal defensive abilities, why would anyone want a warrior as a tank, when they are the worst taunters of the 3? <P>The warrior disciplines are not all they are cracked up to be either. Some of them are totally useless, one or two are useful only in rare situations, and most of them just do the same one or two things, just in different ways. <BR>Our only really good one was defensive, and that one is getting nerfed, possibly to uselessness (remember it doesn't matter how well the warrior tanks if he can't get a mob to hit him). <P>&gt;&gt; A warriors DISC's are one of the main reason there are the only tanks who are allowed to TANK an uber-mob. The other reason is they have better defense and offense. If your DISC's are so like you say, then why do the work so good in practice and are in demand for those encounters. Post 55 game is more about uber-mobs/raids then xp grouping. Even more so at 60.<P>Currently, warriors are doing ok because they can out-tank hybrids. But after these upcoming changes, this advantage may disappear altogether. And that would leave warriors seriously underpowered compared to paladins and shadowknights. <BR>  <BR>&gt;&gt; I have given valid reasons why your arguements fail. What looks good in theory doens't always work out in practice. If your compare warriors and paladins pre 50, then I can agree they are pretty close in balance and being a tank, but post 50 the game isnt the same and even after 55 the game changes again - leaving paladins and hybrids in the travel behind wondering what happened to their beloved character's abilities and worthness to the game.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(and don't give me that BS about its because i'm a halfling, i've seen WE, DE, even ogre warriors get bested by greenies) When most definately a Hyrbid such as a SK could summon a skel pet, send it in while he sits back and Lifetaps/dots/etc till pet is dead then melee away at a mid-blue mob.<P>&gt;&gt; Well from my experience, if I can solo a blue without rooting and stepping back to heal, then a warrior can do this better. The only area a hybrid can solo better is like what I said above - root/heal up. But keep in mind that if we do this not only to we have to heal ourselfs but we have to regen mana back to full also. Warriors do have bind wound even though its not the greatest, it does help better then nothing when soloing. If I have to root/heal on a mob while soloing, then it really efficiant for me as I have to med up heal then med up again(after the fight this is). If you count a pallys deepwater helm, then you got me there for downtime  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> The deepwater is a manaless heal for 110hp at 8 second cast time. Great for downtime healing, but not even close to efficiant with root/heal method.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Those spells sure are useless. Wait no, they dont have to take them away just ask for verant to let hybrids use same spells as pure caster of same level that should balance it out.<P>    I find it funny people say hybrids spells are useless, when i see them useing them ALL the time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Has any 1 found a Warrior only weapon with better stats yet?"<P>Hey, I'll take a shot at this one.  The answer is "No" -- VI has balanced paladins and shadowknights to deal roughly 2/3 of the melee damage that warriors dish out.  With only one weapon, this means that better damage and delay naturally follow.<P>Rangers may actually deal more damage than warriors; however the innate AC, as well as their defense skill and HPs make them very inferior when it comes to damage mitigation.  Arguably, rangers are the hybrid class combatant version of rogues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Reply to Miir-FOH:<P>1. Root parking<P>Quote:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Since every class except SK, Magician and pure melee have the spell 'root', this is hardly a unique ability. Having an enchnater 'mesmerise' a mob is much more efficient. Not to mention haste and enhanced mana regen they bring to a group.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>  But paladins are better suited to the task of root parking than are the other classes that get root, because the paladin can taunt the mob onto himself, then PULL it to a spot away from the group, then root it there.  It's much harder for casters to do this, and much more dangerous since they cannot take the hits that doing this requires.  <P>2. Lay on Hands<BR>Quote:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An instant 2000-2500 point heal once every 72 minutes is not as useful as it may seem at first. A level 55 warrior has a discipline called defensive which will mitigate in excess if 2000 points damage per 72 minutes if used properly.<BR>In epic encounters, a LOH on the primary tank usually means an instant frenzy on the paladin. Considering Paladins dont have a defensive discipline and (currently) have laughable defensive skills, the Paladin more than often ends up dead a few seconds after LOH.<P> You are missing the point here.  This is not just about adding up "points of damage mitigation".  Defensive discipline does nothing to save a caster that is about to die.  In fact, it is counterproductive to that task, since the decrease in damage output will make it HARDER for the warrior to taunt.  The entire point here is that LoH CAN BE USED ON OTHER PEOPLE.  You can't possibly try to tell me that it isn't useful to be able to save a party member from death every 72 minutes.  LoH is almost instantaneous.  This fact allows the paladin to save group members' lives in situations where no one else could.  A paladin that uses this ability intelligently can save his entire group from a wipeout, and that's about the most useful thing you can do in EQ.  <P>3.  Superior heal.  <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody will argue the merits of a ~600 point downtime heal. <P> Well, I've seen a lot of paladins on these boards try to tell me that this is useless.  I'm glad to hear that you realize that this is a very useful ability.  So we both agree to add this one to the list of paladin abilities that balance out the advantages that warriors have.  One of my high level characters is a cleric, and I frequently ask the paladins in my group to give touch-up heals after fights.  It saves me a LOT of mana, and that, in turn, saves groups.  IMHO this ability alone is good enough to balance out the warrior advantage in HP over paladins.  <P>4. Buffs.  <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt; Do you actually play the level 50+ game? <BR>  Yes, I do with warrior, paladin, and cleric.  That's 3 seperate classes I play the 50+ game with, thank you very much.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Shamans and druids can fill in a 50+ EXP group as a healer in a pinch. <P> I agree completely, and this fact only strengthens my point.  Since (and we all see that you agree here) shamen and druids can play the role of primary healer, this means that it is very possible to form effective groups WITHOUT a cleric.  On those occasions, paladin buffs are quite good, since they stack with shaman/druid buffs.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 95% of my groups include a cleric <BR>This could easily be true, but only if you or the people you group with are too insistent on having a cleric with you at all times.  A skilled group doesn't need a cleric to do well (as you yourself said, above).  What do you do when you don't have a cleric readily available?  Sit around at the Sebilis zone refusing to fight anything until you get a cleric?  Sheesh.  <P>5. 90% experience res. <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many level 60 paladins do you see running around Norrath?  <BR>First of all, paladins get this spell at 59, not 60.  Secondly, as I have said before, OBVIOUSLY there are not enough level 49+ clerics running around to fill the need for resses.  If there were, then it wouldn't be so common for people to pay hundreds or THOUSANDS of pp for a res, now would it?  Case closed on this one.  This is one of the best spells in the game, and you know it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>6.  Taunting.  <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt; Subpar damage avoidance and mitigation skills coupled with lower hp make the paladin a poor choice for primary tank.  <P> Ok, no other way to reply to this one except to say... BS!  This one isn't true at all.  You don't have to be the best at something to be a good choice for the task.  Again, just zone into any major dungeon sometime and see what percentage of the players in the zone are warriors.   Warriors comprise NOWHERE NEAR 1/6 of the players in the zone.  Remember that some groups have fewer than 6 members, and some will have more than one warrior.   Thus, simple math proves that MANY, MANY groups will be moving along just fine without a warrior in the group.  <BR>Warriors are not a requirement for a successful group.  They are not now, never have been, and never will be.  <BR>   Secondly, you are ignoring my point.  The fact remains that paladins and SK are *MUCH* better at taunting than a warrior is, and taunting is one of the MAJOR parts of the job of being a tank.  This means that you must consider this when comparing the "Tanking" ability of warriors to that of paladins and SK.  "Tanking" is not just a matter of how well you take damage.  There is more to it than that.  <P>Shadowknights:<BR>1. Lifetaps. <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mana used for lifetaps cannot be regenned at the rate of a warriors HP using CH.  <P>It doesn't have to be.  We aren't comparing the number of HP a warrior regains from CH to the number of HP a SK regains from lifetaps.  The DIFFERENCE in the number of HP a warrior regains from a CH and the number a SK regains is the relevant comparison.  And when you consider that the level 60 SK lifetap does 226 for 189 mana, and damages the mob in the process, the warrior HP advantage isn't as great as it seems.  <P>2. Harm Touch<BR>Quote &gt;&gt;&gt; This ability can also be resisted, and has a recycle time of 72 minutes, which does not decrease with level.  <BR> <BR> The warrior offensive disciplines also sometimes do zero damage.  I can't tell you how many times I've clicked one of them, only to see a big caster nuke hit right at that moment, and the (very short) duration of my discipline is entirely wasted running around chasing the mob.  In addition, the "Leechcurse" discipline now causes harm touch to do 50% more damage and be nearly unresistable.  So, not only is HT INSTANT damage (as opposed to taking 10 seconds or so), but it does MORE damage than warrior disciplines, and can be made nearly UNRESISTABLE.  <P>3. DOTS<BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most mobs that don't resist will be dead long before the duration of the DOT.  SK DOTS have VERY LONG cast times and cannot be realistically cast during combat. <P> Funny, I see SK that I am grouped with casting dots frequently.  It isn't necessary for the DOT to do full damage to be useful.  SK dots last about a minute to a minute and a half.  Regardless of the duration of the fight, this increases SK damage output by nearly 800 damage per minute.  Even at level 60, that's huge.  That goes a LONG way towards making up for the advantage that warriors have over SK in melee damage output.  On top of that, some DOTS also debuff the mob, which increases the party's damage output as a whole.  <BR> <BR>4.  Pets. <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In a dungeon situation, if the SK is main tank, the pet is a liability with an enchanter.  <P>  So, you describe one highly specific situation in which the pet is not good.  Your point?  No one ever said the pet was good in every situation.  In your very next sentence, you acknowledge the the pet does "very nice damage".  Good, so we agree that SK have yet another skill that helps to make up for the difference in melee damage output between SK and warriors.  Since we agree on this, you can't just list "higher melee damage output" as a warrior advantage over SK without considering the *MANY* ways that SK can make up for this using their spells/skills.  <P>5. Darkness line.  Warriors have no way to stop runners.  <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Silken whip of ensnaring, that sword from COW that procs darkness...<P>...are both inferior weapons that a level 60 warrior would not use, because he has better weapons.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I won't argue the usefulness of darkness.  <P> Good, then we agree again.  So, here's ANOTHER skill that hybrids have to make up for warrior advantages.  (Anyone keeping count here?  These useful hybrid skills are really starting to add up here...) <P>7.  Feign death pulling.  <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Monks are much better feign pullers than shadowknights. <P> But, there are still only *TWO* classes in the game that can do this, and we aren't comparing shadowknights to monks now are we?  We are comparing shadowknight abilities to WARRIOR abilities.  The fact remains that shadowknights are much better pullers than warriors, and in fact very often are used as pullers since, (say it with me, kiddies!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  ) NOT EVERY GROUP WILL HAVE A MONK TO PULL.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The number of areas that 'require' a feign pull are few and far between.  <P> But, the areas in which it is **ADVANTAGOUS** to do a FD pull are many, many, many.  It isn't necessary that a skill be absolutely essential in order for it to be USEFUL.  <P>8. Taunting.  This point is covered well under paladins.  Basically, if SK and paladins get the ability to tank nearly as well as warriors, then why would anyone want a warrior when the hybrid can do 50% of the job of tanking (taunting) better than warriors, and have a long list of other useful abilities on top of that?  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Warriors still have superior AC and damage avoidance skills.  <P> Not if the hybrids in the class talk threads get their way.  First of all, at level 60, the warrior AC advantage means nothing because SK, warriors, and paladins can all be easily buffed up to the soft cap of 1100.  In any case, the *HUGE* increase in the defensive skill will mostly eliminate the AC advantage anyway, especially since warrior armor is harder to obtain at the highest levels than hybrid armor.  Secondly, the warrior 'damage avoidance skill' advantages will also disappear in the near future if many of the hybrids on these boards get their way.  That will leave nothing but an extra 600 hp for the warrior and what is that when you are fighting mobs that hit very fast for 500 - 600 damage IN EACH HIT?  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lets examine the original post<P>_Axem_: Wow when i hit 60 i will finnaly be a solid class geee thats great. <P>That is more than a majority of classes get right now.<P>_Axem_: People here are only concerned with the end game it seems, what about the low levels? Hybirds can solo at low levels while warriors cant(i dont call killing something and siting for 13-20 minutes soloing). <P>Low level warriors can solo with less downtime that this. Conclusion: _Axem_ does not know his own class that well.<P>_Axem_: Also to people saying hybirds cant tank as good as warriors yeah thats the price you pay for picking a class that can cast spells and solo fairlly well at the young age. <P>Hybrids are, for the most part, not concerned with the differential in their tanking ability until after level 50. We are all 100% okay with diminished warrior ability in exchange for spells. That trade-off still exists post level 50 with the changes on Test Server. Anyone that says that raising the defense skill cap to equal that of warriors makes them able to tank as well needs to do some more research. Also, as has been said, warriors can solo at the young age.<P>_Axem_: With these new changes why would any 1 choose to play a warrior? And please dont give me the <BR>"Well at uber mobs you will still be needed. No other class can take the sheer whupings you guys do" what about when im just trying to get XP i guess my LFG tag will be on much longer now. <P>People would choose a warrior for the same reason they have always chosen a warrior. Keep in mind, nothing has been taken away and hybrids were not made the equivalent of warriors. Yes, you will still be needed for Uber-MOBs. Yes, you can still take more of a sheer whuping. And yes, you may have to have your LFG tag on for longer. That is what balance is all about. Hybrids had their LFG tag on for far longer than warriors before now and this will hopefully balance that out a little bit. Conclusion: _Axem_ still wants to get into groups far more easily than Hybrids and believes that to be balanced.<P>_Axem_: Who would pick a warrior for a common camp now that hybirds can take damage almost as good and have same offense BUT can also heal them-selves, buff them-selves, and use spells to damage mobs. <P>Warriors will still be preferred. Hybrids cannot take damage almost as well with the same offense. They can either take damage reasonably well with nowhere near the same offense or do more damage with pitiful defense. The spells are not powerful enough to change the fact that warriors are still the best at both taking and dealing damage. People want at least one high quality tank in their group. For this position, the warrior will always be preferred.<P>_Axem_: I guess us warriors can all go to work on trade skills with LFG tag on until we get a tell<P>What do you think Hybrids do? Is what is left for them not good enough for you? Is that what you call balance?<P>_Axem_: " A we are going to try Trak, VS, Zland, Velketor, Yelnik, ..... we sure could use you to take the pounding. You dont need to bring weapons Verant put in a pacth that allows you to duel-weild sheilds that should keep you alive 1.7 times longer then the hybirds here." <BR>Yeah i love the new balance vison here. Any 1 know when Final Fantasy Online is comeing out?<P>How would you like to be a Hybrid? Hey, we are going to try to raid an Uber-MOB. Why dont you zone in and camp out so you can log back in if there is any loot for you. We dont want you on during the raid because all you can contribute is lag. Which is the preferable situation?<P><BR>So, I think I can sum it up to say:<P>#1 _Axem_ does not completely understand his own class all that well.<BR>#2 _Axem_ does not understand much about the Hybrid class but will post this kind of thing anyway<BR>#3 _Axem_ wants to be able to find a group faster than hybrids. If a change involves him having to look for longer, it must be unbalancing.<BR>#4 _Axem_ proves that you dont necessarily have to know much about your own class, or any other class in the game, to be in an UBER Guild. I hope they are aware of how they are being represented out here on the boards. All of us Quellious players should know what guild you are in and maybe they would like to see this.<BR>#5 _Axem_ does not type very well.<P>Thanks for this post, I'm sure we all learned a lot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe that in a point by point answer the hybrid players would say that because other casters are better at it then they are it nullifies the argument.  Other casters do not enter into it as this isn't a discussion about Pally vs Mage or SK vs Necro.<P>As for the dam/del difference on Pally/SK only 1hs and Warrior 1hs, no one has compared the two side by side.  Nor has anyone compared the difficulty in getting these weapons.  The question is if a dual wielded semi-uber warrior 1hs is doing SIGNIFICANTLY more damage than an SK or Pally using a good 1h weapon and tossing spells.  What is the ratio of damage done?   Is it 2x? 3x? 1.5x? .5x?  And with a self-buff and a shield in the left hand how much AC is the Pally/SK down from the warrior in actual terms?  <P>Go crunch some numbers folks, real data, not this hyperbole you are spouting now.  I think you'll find Pallys and SKs are already coming out very well against Warriors without these changes.  Apart from that, there seems to be a case of Mighty Strike envy when taking on bosses.  To fix that means different adjustments than what has been proposed.<P>Now Rangers are a different animal and have different problems but Rangers also get much better weapons that they can dual wield.  Rangers shouldn't be compared so much to Warriors as to Rogues and Monks.  A Ranger's problem isn't doing damage, but taking it. A Ranger with the same skill as a Warrior with Ranger Only 1hs in both hands will totally outstrip the Warrior's damage but will also get ripped a new one by the mob.  So Rangers need to look not at Warriors but Rogues for their answer - evade skill.  Give a Ranger a way to drop some of their taunt value and you have an alive Ranger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow how in the world does someone get to 55 and be so clueless about his own class. Warriors are the best tank class bar none. They get dual wield. The reason Paladins ans sk get better damage to dealy weapons is due to the fact the can only wield one weapon. A warrior with a css and a cane of tranquil can dish more damage then 99% of the paladins at his level and probably 95% of the paladins period. Assuming the warrior is at least 51. <P>How in the world can you even claim to be in an uber guild and not even understand the mechanics of the game. Have you ever even parsed a damamge log once in your life because if you had you'd see that warrior versus paladin damage isn't even close. Neither is sk versus warrior. Paladins need those skills to make up for those deficiencies in their offensive capabilities. The same is true for sks.<P>It's kinda of hard to answer questions about the game when the individual doesn't even understand the mechanics.<P>As for the poor loh argument made by Rainblade there are a few other classes that can save the group in your scenario. Necro, wiz, druid, shaman, cleric. If you are LoH'ing casters well then you shouldn't be in that spot int the first place.<P>Come on Axem learn the mechanics of the game before making absurd statements and challeging a the power of a warrior. <P>Guildon Goldenheart <BR>lvl 58 monk<BR>Erollsi Marr<BR>Da`kor - That other Uberguild</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;i dont call killing something and siting for 13-20 minutes soloing. <P>Wait this is what soloing with a druid is like...  <P>For a druid, soloing after level 20, without clarity, you fight for 2 minutes then sit for 12 minutes or more.  By your definition that is not soloing...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;2nd biggest problem: If our tanking ability <BR>&gt;and defensive/offensive skills are so great <BR>&gt;how is it that even now at lvl 45 I cannot <BR>&gt;solo a green lvl 30-33 mob? <P>My L51 druid cannot solo Sol A without lots of down time but necro or mage can go into Sol A with a pet and own the entire dungeon.  In addition my druid can easily get killed if I don't do everything just right.  In fact, even RunnyEye is a challenge.<P>Players talk about how powerful druids are.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Druids gets lots of different spells and that is cool but necro/mage are the ultimate farming classes.  They own low level dungeons and can farm items easily.<P>-Thadtank</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rainblade.. a few counterpoints:<P>"Reply to Miir-FOH:<BR>1. Root parking<P>But paladins are better suited to the task of root parking than are the other classes that get root, because the paladin can taunt the mob onto himself, then PULL it to a spot away from the group, then root it there. It's much harder for casters to do this, and much more dangerous since they cannot take the hits that doing this requires. "<P>Every other class with root can taunt better with their spells then we can, so the taunt factor is redundant and stupid to bring up.  The only possible advantage to root parking as a paladin is the ability to take some hits.  Since the most efficient and effective rootparking is done by any number of classes *without* ever taking a hit, the paladin does it *marginally* better than anyone else with the 'root' spell.  Also, root parking is orders of magnitude worse than just having an enchanter in the group to begin with at high levels.  Root Parking is about the same as getting two warriors in the group and tanking seperate mobs in the high level game, for the effect it has, and how much lower it is from *real* crowd control on the effectiveness ladder<BR>from Enchanter CC.  I consider it a minor ability, at best... somewhat akin to *maybe* the Warrior's current AC advatange, if you want to talk about balancing factors.<P>2. Lay on Hands<BR>Quote:<BR>You are missing the point here. This is not just about adding up "points of damage mitigation". Defensive discipline does nothing to save a caster that is about to die. In fact, it is counterproductive to that task, since the decrease in damage output will make it HARDER for the warrior to taunt. The entire point here is that LoH CAN BE USED ON OTHER PEOPLE. You can't possibly try to tell me that it isn't useful to be able to save a party member from death every 72 minutes. LoH is almost instantaneous. This fact allows the paladin to save group members' lives in situations where no one else could. A paladin that uses this ability intelligently can save his entire group from a wipeout, and that's about the most useful thing you can do in EQ."<P>  I would argue with you, however, that most groups at the high level game have a cleric in the group with near as fast heals which serve the same purpose.  An instant cast 2500hp heal is only good for the times when the cleric is either OOM, at which point the party is going to die soon anyway, or the cleric wasn't paying attention (because if the hitpoints drop that fast to begin with, there is a good chance you won't even hit the LoH button in time).  Furthermore, this ability gets gradually and comparitively *WORSE* with level than does your Warrior Disciplines.  LoH never benefits from improved refresh time, and is always 72 minutes.  For as little as it is used, it is hard to even say what would balance this off on the Warrior end of things... it is used so infrequently (for me, about once a real life week, for instance), so as to almost be inconsequential at high levels.<P>3. Superior heal. <BR>Well, I've seen a lot of paladins on these boards try to tell me that this is useless. I'm glad to hear that you realize that this is a very useful ability. So we both agree to add this one to the list of paladin abilities that balance out the advantages that warriors have. One of my high level characters is a cleric, and I frequently ask the paladins in my group to give touch-up heals after fights. It saves me a LOT of mana, and that, in turn, saves groups. IMHO this ability alone is good enough to balance out the warrior advantage in HP over paladins."<P>The fizzle rate approaches 40% however, and surely you know this from your vast knowledge of the high level game.  You also know that with a Paladin's mana pool, he can cast about 1 of these, possibly 2, after each battle, but more realistically 1, without going OOM after a few pulls.  (In other words, the Paladin can cast, on average, 1.5 of these heals after each battle, saving the Cleric about 750hp of healing downtime per battle in an exp group).  For this ability, the group gives up the 2x increase in damage that a Warrior in that group spot would deal out... the comparison is really easy to do, and it shouldn't surprise you who current high level groups take, based on this.<P>4. Buffs. <BR>Yes, I do with warrior, paladin, and cleric. That's 3 seperate classes I play the 50+ game with, thank you very much. <P>I agree completely, and this fact only strengthens my point. Since (and we all see that you agree here) shamen and druids can play the role of primary healer, this means that it is very possible to form effective groups WITHOUT a cleric. On those occasions, paladin buffs are quite good, since they stack with shaman/druid buffs. "<P>I disagree with you almost 100%.  Currently, less than 1-5% of all high level groups go clericless in the 51-60 game.  If you are fighting in clericless groups anymore than this percentage of the time, you are either at the very bottom end of this curve (low 50s), or you are playing a different game than me.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 95% of my groups include a cleric <BR>This could easily be true, but only if you or the people you group with are too insistent on having a cleric with you at all times. A skilled group doesn't need a cleric to do well (as you yourself said, above). What do you do when you don't have a cleric readily available? Sit around at the Sebilis zone refusing to fight anything until you get a cleric? Sheesh."<P>The point here is on efficiency.  I play several high level classes too, including a cleric, and the most efficent group has a cleric on heals, period, using CH.  A clericless group cannot approach the kill rate of the non-cleric group by anything even close.  The cleric group will kill almost twice the number of mobs as the aforementioned clericless one.  This doesn't even bring into the discussion the MANY areas in the high level game where what you suggest will NOT work, anyway, whatsoever, or the more 'challenging' areas.  The fact that I concede that certain areas allows a clericless group to 'sruvive' is exactly in the limited areas you outlined -&gt; Zoneline fighting, easy camps compared to the level of the players involved.  Coincidentally, these are the same camps that are camped nearly 24/7 because they are the few in the game that DON'T require a cleric.  This is not a wives' tale, nor is it some preconceived notion we carry with us... the majority of the content in the 51-60 game is not doable with a clericless group, period.<P>5. 90% experience res. <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many level 60 paladins do you see running around Norrath? <BR>First of all, paladins get this spell at 59, not 60. Secondly, as I have said before, OBVIOUSLY there are not enough level 49+ clerics running around to fill the need for resses. If there were, then it wouldn't be so common for people to pay hundreds or THOUSANDS of pp for a res, now would it? Case closed on this one. This is one of the best spells in the game, and you know it."<P>At level 59 this spell is window dressing.  I have used it exactly ONCE in a group situation where it helped my group.  The clerics in a Paladin's groups or raids at level 59 have a level 56 rez.  Worse yet, the fairly easily obtainable Clerical Epic Weapon casts their 56 rez for free and is wieldable at Level 50.  I cast this on people 10+ levels lower than me when I am running to a dungeon as an act of charity.  Noone my level wants this rez, and will wait hours for a 56+ rez, which any cleric withing 4 levels of me, and sometimes less, can cast.  You mentioned you'd give up all of your disciplines for this spell... well I'd give you it for Defensive in a Heartbeat... you just get to wait til Level 59, like Paladins, before you can reap its 'Amazing benefits' as you put it... *tries not to laugh out loud*  <P>6. Taunting. <BR>Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt; Subpar damage avoidance and mitigation skills coupled with lower hp make the paladin a poor choice for primary tank. <P>Ok, no other way to reply to this one except to say... BS! This one isn't true at all. You don't have to be the best at something to be a good choice for the task. Again, just zone into any major dungeon sometime and see what percentage of the players in the zone are warriors. Warriors comprise NOWHERE NEAR 1/6 of the players in the zone. Remember that some groups have fewer than 6 members, and some will have more than one warrior. Thus, simple math proves that MANY, MANY groups will be moving along just fine without a warrior in the group. <BR>Warriors are not a requirement for a successful group. They are not now, never have been, and never will be. <BR>Secondly, you are ignoring my point. The fact remains that paladins and SK are *MUCH* better at taunting than a warrior is, and taunting is one of the MAJOR parts of the job of being a tank. This means that you must consider this when comparing the "Tanking" ability of warriors to that of paladins and SK. "Tanking" is not just a matter of how well you take damage. There is more to it than that. "<P>First off, I will say that the Warrior is the more efficient and better tank choice, flat out now, and even after the proposed changes are made.  Warriors neglect the massive damage potential in relation to a Paladin that they have, and they and you, might be naive to it, but non-naive players understand the importance of getting both massive defense and massive offense in the same SINGLE group spot.  Taunting is the only point I agree with you on.  None of your other points amount to a hill of beans.  It is the same reason why Hybrids have never supported you in your moves to have taunt increased in the past because it would further make it so that Hybrids has ABSOLUTELY no place in a group if a Warrior was around (where it is currently somewhere around 95%).<P>I will submit to you that although 1/6 of all players are not warriors now in the 51-60 game, that if things continue the way they are, the natural movement will be for 1 out of every 6 people to be a Warrior.  It has everything to do with group and raid deisrability in the 51-60 game.  We know the game, we level alts to level 51 in 4 days... it isn't a secret that people are leveling clerics, warriors and rogues right now.  There is also a reason why, of course, some of you are too blind to see it.<P>In the end, there are more needed improvements than just an effective 50AC bump to Paladins and SKs, which is the brunt of the proposed additions.  To even contend that this is unbalancing to Warriors is the absolute, bar-none, funniest thing I've ever read.  Step out of your box and view the health of the whole game in general.  If you are anywhere near Level 60, you should be able to see what is going on... I, however, suspect that the majority of the whiners are either a.) nowhere near level 60, or b.) suffering from class envy where none is justified.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
