</FONT><HR>*You need to ask why this is unbalanced? I mean, isn't it patently obvious that no single item should make such a vast difference?*<P>I wont argue with you and say certain items DO indeed make or break a high level encounter.  The Donal's Bp was just one piece of the overall package necessary - not the ONLY piece.  An enchanter can haste all of the melee for no mana.  Without hasted melee any of these encounters will likely be a failure.  So by this logic the Shissar Snake needs to be nerfed?  Without HP buffs tanks cant last long enough to get a complete heal off in these encounters.  This makes HP buffs from clerics/shaman/druids/etc VITAL.  Without these buffs, the raid fails.  So we need to nerf all these spells as well now?  Hell, the ASSIST hotkey is crucial to all these raids.  Now THAT is overpowered.  Don't confuse 'useful' or 'preferred' to 'overpowered and 'unbalanced''.  There is nothing unbalancing with any of the above tactics being used.<P>Is the goal to make everyone the same?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn had an excellent point, and I think the deciding one.<BR>The Donals BP is THE required item for taking down these mobs. Other items are nice, because they conserve mana, but without the Donal's BP, you simply cannot take down these mobs. That is why it was unbalanced. You could combine items to work around all of the other requirements (for example, there are other manaless methods of haste, such as equipment on the individual warriors), and therefore those requirements weren't essential, but there is no "work-around" for the BP. It was so powerful that it made or broke the encounter. That is why it was unbalanced. Honestly, due to the fact that the same tactic will work once more BP's are found, I'm surprised that Verant didn't change the effect altogether.<P>I am sorry that it is less powerful, but I understand why it was made so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     For any of you who have actually fought some of the new Velius uber mobs with HPs in the 1,000,000 plus range you can see why everyone is upset with the Donals nerf.  It takes an ungodly ammount of people, time, and orginization to kill a mob like Yelinik.  Now its going to take even more.  All this nerf does is add hassle.<P>These uber encounters should be doable by guilds without 8 donals BPs . . and by all rights they are, you just need to get 100 people and do waves :P.  However,  these encounters should also be easier for those guilds that have gone to the effort to get 8 Donals BPs.  This is a privallege and a right earned by those who were the first to take on Trakanon.  Where is the balance here? where is the reward for the risk of obtaining Donals BPs now.<P>The whole situation is even more insulting because Donals BPs were allready "nerfed" by the addition of the much easier to obtain..  and arguably better PoG cleric BPs.  I really wish Verant would stop slapping their customers in the face, so often in the name of perserving the balance of the game.  Verant may balance the risk for everyone,  but they even further unbalance the reward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I didnt think so. <P>Absor when you respond why not respond to some of the excellent criticisms and arguments people who do not hold the same opinion you do have made.

</FONT><HR>Gallaorn said it EXACTLY right. Time and time again I see blue name posts that pickup irrelevant or minor points in a thread and comment on those whilst totally dodging the main issue. Hello can you not see why this angers and frustrates people that read these boards? Abashi was a master at it - please don't follow his example. If the reason you don't post direct answers to questions is because you don't understand the issue then get help (somebody in Verant must know!) if you still can't answer start writing up your CV. If you deliberately ignore the main point because of a hidden agenda then Verant needs to get a clue.<P>Sure the Donal's BP became an essential part of the SoV uber mob encounters (after this change it still is btw - only you need MORE of them!) but then isn't that the way it should be? Shouldn't the guilds that put the effort into doing Trakanon, Venril Sathir and VP be rewarded with items that help them later on? Anyone fool can get to 60, any fool can't do VP.<P>If the SoV uber mob encounters were tuned without thought to the clickable effect Kunark uber items then you at least have to admit a drastic failure during the tuning process. Trouble is the only people getting punished for it are players.<P>Until you give reasons why it was deemed unbalancing all of a sudden post-SoV and not during the 6 months pre-SoV then it's difficult to try and counter the arguement heh - I guess that's the reason why the question is being dodged. <P>If it's only in SoV that it's unbalancing then given two choices (nerf BP or retune uber mobs) you picked the easy way out that now, by definition, makes the item underpowered in Kunark.<P>I personally still can't see how Verant are missing the underlying issue of ubermob tuning. I think Gallaorn hit the nail though - they simply don;t understand the high level game from a player's perspective. Assuming this then how can you ever hope to possibly tune high level mobs/zones? You need to employ tuners that play a LOT more than they currently do. Aradune prancing around in strange armour with a cool looking weapon isn't going to help you learn the biggest aspect of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Let me start off by saying this.<P>I play on a server with FoH.  Our guilds are not what you would call "friends."  So far, 3 guilds on Veeshan have taken down Trakanon- FoH, us, and a multiguild effort.  All 3 of these groups have slain Trak before Velious.  I don't remember the exact date, but it was over a month before Velious was released.  What this means is that whoever claimed that Verant was favoring FoH and other power guilds, since they've killed every Trak since Kunark was wrong.  They haven't.<P>Nino is correct.  I'm sure FoH has killed Trakanon 35+ times, and has 5 BP's to show for it.  We've killed Trak 12+ times, and have 2 BP's to show for it.  Group 3 has killed Trak once, and does not have any BP's.<P>CONCLUSION (this is in all caps so the dense will understand):  THE BREASTPLATE IS RARE AS HELL.<P>Trakanon has more than likely been slain more on Veeshan than on any other server.  Well over 50 times, and most likely over 60 times.  And the server has 7 BP's to show for it.<P>Now that we have illustrated the rareness of the item, let's determine approximate drop rates on Veeshan for this item.  My handy calculator shows me that 7/60 is an approximate 11.6% drop rate.<P>Now, with 5 Donals BP's, FoH can drop mobs like Yelinak and Dain.  To compensate for this nerf, FoH will need 50% more Breastplates.  This means FoH will need 2.5 more BP's.  We are rounding to 3, because the 30 second time adds more than just time... it adds inconvenience, a longer time before a cleric can cast any other spells, to heal someone who's been riposte'd, rebuff, and so forth.  This means FoH now needs 8 Breastplates.  With a 12% drop rate, we can assume FoH will have their BP's in approximately 25 Trakanons.<P>Now, someone earlier in this post stated that, basically, those who are complaining are those who are not killing Trakanon.  Think of it this way.  If (insert server uber-guild here) has all the Donals BP's they need, it is likely that they will slow down on their hunting of Trakanon.  If they need 3 more BP's yet, do you honestly want them there for another 2 months finishing up getting what they need?<P>Let me tell you something.  Racing with (uberguild) is hell.  We had some bloody wars, which usually ended up in an arbitrary decision as to who got Trak, and cost that guild hours of arguing, and aggravation.  You do not want to compete with your servers uberguild.<P>In conclusion:  This nerf does nothing but promote farming.<P>A few days ago, I ran into Oceanus killing Tizmaks, low green creatures, hoping to complete a set of (bad) Tizmak Armor.  Is this what Verant wants our raids of the future to be?  Please un-nerf both Donals, and Stability.<P>Kaluian Moo<BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My pessimistic side says that the reason for nerfing the breastplate was because the breastplate effect reduced downtime too much. As always "the Vision" is to make the player sit around doing nothing as much as possible. Instead of 120 seconds to heal a six person party, it now takes 180 seconds.

</FONT><HR>Donals BP Casting time Nerf<P>I really don't see anything good that came from this nerf.  The new casting time on the bp is horrid.  It leaves the cleric unable to med and buff for 30 seconds.  So now the bp is utterly useless except for doing exactly what the nerf was intended to stop - Killing the uber mobs.  They will still die but now with just more bps.  So now there is no use for the bp but doing exactly what the nerf was meant to prevent.  I really think this nerf should be rethought out and change the casting time back to a reasonable amount of time.  Also it's not like this is an easily obtainable item.  With the risk reward factors in mind, i would say an item like this is totally reasonable.  Donals bp and the sort do not fall off trees.  They are a rare drop of a very high lvl mob so they are in no way too easy to obtain for their worth.

</FONT><HR>It doesnt take a genius to see that FoH's killing of the sov ubber mobs is what prompted this change. Why else would the item NOT have been changed for 6 months and the new bp have the cast time it did until NERF monday hit. <P>Now all this means is that in verants eyes "overpowered" = any item that lets u kill ubber mob X in a way they had not planned on it being killed. Is this game really going to turn into a linear game where u can only kill mobs in the clear way that verant designed for them to be killed? All this does is punish creativity and hard work (killing trak that many times is a lot of in game hours). <P>Maybe after this nerf verant will realize that the items that give free dmg are the tide turners in battle and they can nerf them as well unless that fits the "vision" of how these mobs were meant to be killed. =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If it was about class balance it would have been, at the very least, talked about before now. Not only has it not been talked about they even made another cleric bp with free healing (which they also just nerfed). <P>This is about guild X being able to kill mob Y in a manner not in line with verants "vision" of how mob Y should be able to be killed. <P>Why in the world do you think that nothing at all was said for over 6 months and even the expansion bp had free healing with decent cast time but now when ubber guild X kills an ubber mob they suddenly nerf the free healing in the name of balance?

</FONT><HR>Let me start by saying I love having a good cleric in my group.  I have nothing against people who play clerics, and I understand why clerics complain about anything that detracts from their class.  However, I'd be shocked if I heard anyone say they actually thought high level clerics were "balanced".  Uber mobs are nearly immune to magic, so they required well-equipped melee types to kill them.  These same uber mobs have tons of HP and hit really hard, so your well equipped melee types are probably going to die everyone once in a while.  A high level character loses hours (or days) worth of experience when they die, unless they have a cleric with them.  Ressurection makes clerics indispensable.  They fact that they have other abilities is nice, but not terribly important.  Until secondary healers are also secondary rezzers, the cleric class will never be balanced.<P>Regarding the Dolan's BP "nerf", the arguement that certain creatures require a source of mana-free healing would indicate to me that every caster class needs an item that casts their class defining spell mana-free.  Imagine a magician robe that cast Lesser Conjuration: Fire (same level spell, similar casting time, half the mana), or a necro robe that allowed them to cast Drain spirit at no mana cost.  To compare a spell with the same mana cost, it would be like giving wizards a free Ice Comet with a 30 second cast time.  Trak drops one caster robe, the manna robe (nice but nowhere near Donal's BP and four class to split it between rather than one).<P>Regarding the anything that benefits a cleric benefits everyone theory: by that same theory anything which benefits any class benefits us all. We aren't conforming to The Vision(tm), and until we do they will continue to nerf all of us.<P>Balance Up not Down.  Stop Nerfing.  Stop making changes and not explaining what you changed.  <P>I hope no one takes this as a flame on clerics, I dont mean it that way.  They are more importnat that other classes, intrinsic (sp?) on raids and always welcome in any group with a free slot.  I agree there are balance issues that need to be addressed, but why take away when you could add?  Put Donal's back, bump the power of the other Trak chest items, and give the mobs more hp/make them hit harder.  I waited 28 levels to get sword of ruins, and within 3 levels it was made nearly worthless: that's disappointing and it makes the game less fun to play. I'm sure every wizard 52+ and every cleric with a Donal's BP feels pretty much as I did the day the proc's ended for Jonar.<P>Please stop the nerfing. Please? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Gordon even defended the effect some months back as NOT being overpowered. - and now it's 'obviously overpowered'.<P>Doesn't that mean the item design and testing methods are 'obviously shoddy'?<P>This just doesn't seem right, to make such a change to an item that has been around for 6 months, and had the effect -defended- previously by Verants PR guy.

You've nerfed for no good reason.  If you have a reason, I'd like to hear it.  Even if the reason is 'Okay, we admit it, we can't test our way out of a paper bag'.<P>I for one hoped you'd come up with better item design and testing methods after the Manastone nerf.

I don't have one of these BPs, I don't expect I ever will.  Not Qwinn, he's on your side.  Try discussing it with the people you've actually angered, the ones that have the BPs in question and can explain the issue with understanding.<P>And maybe, just maybe, think about just how much time the players spent to get each one of those paltry few BPs.  Dozens of players, who had to spend literally months online to get to a level to try for them at all, at the very highest levels of the game - D'ya think you could maybe let them have a few things that actually allow them to be powerful and heroic for once?<P>Nahh, being a victim is more fun.<P>Woof<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kaluian:<P>By your arguments, then, the BP shouldn't just have it's casting time increased, it should be changed altogether.  Be careful what you wish for.  How's this for an experiment.  Look at every effect on every other BP.

</FONT><HR>Oh, and I have a question.<P>If a cleric has, say, Clarity 2 on, or a bard is singing mana song, and he starts this effect, will he have the additional mana that clarity and mana song confer during those 30 seconds even when standing up?  (I seem to get a good deal more mana from running around with clarity 2 than I do just medding without clarity).  Or does using the effect stop all mana regen altogether?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ingem,<P>Post-50 the defining ability of the necromancer class is NOT our lifetaps (they won't even get used on uber raids that this thread relates to). If anything the class defining ability of the necromancer post 50 is Summon Corpse. Check out a robe called the Robe of the Bonecaster - woah nerf it now!?!?!?! Your Ice Comet quip wasn;t actually too far from the truth either. The little brother of Ice Comet (pre-RoK) was Rend, guess what a VP Robe has clickable Rend on it.<P>The only advantage the Donal's BP has is it's useful on ubermob encounters (the only ubermobs it would be absolutely 100% required are those when the mobs cast AE complete mana drain - well duh what did Verant have in mind when they made this special attack? an army of mages with bandages at the ready!?!?!). The fact the Rend robe won't get nerfed into mothball status is that Rend is already so pointless (i.e. it does no damage) on uber mobs that it doesn't need nerfing.<P>If I had my way and ubermobs were tuned properly (whereby mobs aren't commonly magic immune) then yep the Rend robe would be on my nerf list, manaless damage is totally different to manaless healing. I've seen lvl 55+ tanks die in under 5 seconds let alone the 20 it takes to cast the BP.<P>Basically if Verant continues this trend the only factor that will determine success is how many people can you point at the mob without people going LD. Mobs will be killed only during off-peak times when server load and general Internet load is at it's lowest. Wow won't that be something to look forward to - not. Heck when that day comes I bet Verant ban DSL/Cable connections to their servers to further illegitimately reduce the effectiveness of the playerbase.<P>Before the 32k hp limit was lifted Verant had little choice but to reduce the effectiveness of the playerbase as the ceiling on how high they could raise mob difficutly was in ultimately hard capped. Post SoV however they continue to redcue the effectiveness of the playbase whilst largely ignoring the fact they no effectively don't have a ceiling on how hard they can make the mobs. I've said it before and I'll say it again MAGIC IMMUNITY SHOULD NO LONGER BE THE DEFINING MEASURE OF DIFFICUTLY ON A MOB ENCOUNTER! Until Verant realise that then tanks/clerics/wizards will be the only classes needed on uber mob raids and NOT coincidently those will be the classes targetted for future nerfs as Verant attempt to slow down the successes of the playerbase. It is far from a coincidence that wizards fgot a huge hit to lures closely followed by clerics getting a beating with the nerf stick. But your armour on tanks - the sticks headed your way (expect to see discipline refresh times increased, weapon ratio adjustments, hard AC caps at 1000 etc etc). They probably won't even think to give AE speed-debuff attacks, AE stamina drains, zones where disciplines don;t function etc (OK some of the AE spells may exist - but they shouldn;t be used in conjunction with mob magic-immunity apart from on possibly gods).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I definately do.   <BR>All epic fights are now is 36 melee types and 6 clerics fighting an epic mob (because of DP). Maybe people will have to rethink or preplan things now.<P>I think uberguilds have really effected how VI approaches the game. <BR>If the biggest guild on a server was 100 members strong and only had about 25-50% post 54, you wouldn't see mobs with hp past 32k. <BR>Maybe they should of came up with a sliding scale of how many people you can have in your guild based on their level. <BR>I don't know, its too late now.
