</FONT><HR>So what you're saying, Lazarian, is that you haven't put a tenth the effort into this game that the people who this thread is about have.<P>When you've invested a few hundred days worth of your time in something, it is extremely frustrating to see all that effort wasted. This is akin to become a master at pool through four years of hard work and then suddenly having the pool balls changed into egg shapes around the world on a whim. It's still the same game, right? Just put that ball in the pocket. What do you mean it doesn't spin like it used to?<P>The Clerics/Holocaust comparison is extreme, but I really don't care about it, I just kept reading past it to get to the point of the issue...<P>My post-50 cleric no longer plays the same way he used to, and really isn't fun anymore. And Laz, I've put a lot more work into this game than you have apparently, since I have two alts that are higher level than you and four more that are within 10 levels of you. Don't come preaching, or trying to preach. Preaching generally requires understanding of subject material, which in this case you have no experience with.<P>Review that pool metaphor. That's the life of any cleric above level 55 who isn't exp hunting. Even that of some who are.<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have beaten both Diablo's, if you havent im not condensending.  I know you have problems, and again i am not saying anything about you brining them forth.  its just when a bunch of people complain without much reason at verant i kinda get ancy over their misplaced anger.  Its almost sickening at times.<P><BR>i do not doubt that some concerns are valid, especialy this one.  However the 30th thread of the night is a little much, and the tone of the thread is downright unjustified.  Verant does know about this game, and while you may not like it this is how they have crafted said game.  Its a very easy route from here.. <P>  1) continue to play, graciously talk about things on reasonable threads.<BR>  2) be lumped in with the current situation where every anti vak evokes anger, and some the name of nazi's to show the 'malice' of verant<BR>  3) or quit<P>its simple<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Its about perspective. Its about it being a game. I have seen people redfaced mad on these boards over a game and that isnt right, thats a time to quit and learn a different thing."<P>If I had given up the first time I'd been frustrated I wouldn't have gotten nearly as far in EQ as I did. And mind you I did that with barely a month of summer time and then playing around the life of a college student taking a full honors courseload and committing to several student groups. <P>My time is valuable. I do not like seeing the time I spent on my character wasted because they decide to change a game mechanic that has been the standard for two years. Nor do I like my hope of getting a Donal's BP obliterated after they make a change to the game which has been standard for a year. Nor do I like seeing them patching like mad to reduce the effects of other items and spells they "fully" tested, then put into the game, then discovered weeks to months later that they didn't work. I'm sorry, most of real life doesn't work like that. I'm not in the "SOON A GAME WILL KILL EQ" crowd, but I do expect that the next decade will create a vastly different environment for MMOG's than we are working with.<P>"Its about perspective. Its about it being a game. I have seen people redfaced mad on these boards over a game and that isnt right, thats a time to quit and learn a different thing."<P>80% of success is stamina. That means going back after it even after you're frustrated, you're lost, you couldn't figure it out, you felt beaten. Because if you keep trying, you will win.<P>That said, Everquest no longer seems worth winning, which is the point many players are expressing.<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ugh, I hate to take sides with the higher levels, but those who have not at least been to a Velious Ubermob encounter have no right to comment on the fact that Verant's nerfs have had an effect in causing many clerics to either quit or play alternates.<P>In the past 2 weeks, this friendly bard has seen 8 clerics higher than level 58 leave the game. These clerics are not from my guild, in fact all have been from various other guilds. But they were my friends and in EVERY instance the reason given was that the BP nerf was the straw that broke the camel's back.<P>To those who are not level 55 and have NOT had the privilege of attending an ubermob raid - <P>Fact 1 : Some mobs are nearly 100% magic resistant.<BR>- ask all the chanters how happily they manage to mez green mobs in Dragon Necropolis .. NOT!<BR>- Ask the level 60 wizards/druids/mages how it feels to have their nukes hit for zero or 6 points of damage .. YAY!<BR>- and you want to Root .. go Right ahead and try<P>Fact 2 : These mobs hit for lots<BR>- try 450 quad flurries with the dain<BR>- or Zlandicar 750 each hit<P>Fact 3 : cheal is required<BR>- any other ideas on how to heal 3000 hps in 4 seconds? Be my guest and post!!!<P>Fact 4 : The Mobs were designed by Verant with cheal in mind<P>Fact 5 : Cheal has been broken by aggro such that a cheal cast = mob killing cleric<P>Fact 6 : The Mobs have NOT BEEN RE-TUNED DOWN, nor has Melee Taunt been fixed!<P>Fact 7 : Due to above 6 facts<P>(1) Healers (Clerics, Druids, Shamans) are dying 100x more than previously and feel useless<BR>(2) Melees (warriors, SKs, Pallys, Rangers) are sick of being unable to taunt of clerics<BR>(3) After Healers Die, Melees Die<BR>(4) 4-8 hour CR ensues depending on which zone the epic battle was at.<BR>(5) People get frustrated<P>(6) Clerics leave the game [see first post]<P>Suggested Tactics<BR>- Root (won't work due to resist and summon)<BR>- Atone (won't work due to resist)<BR>- Throw more bodies at the ubermob (won't work, zone will crash or 75% of people will go LD)<P>NEW TACTICS<P>A. Healer Chicken Zoning<BR>- Cleric or other healer cheals, zones and gates back inside. <BR>- Cheesy but no choice. <BR>- Only works when mob is near zone.<P>B. COTH for Healer<BR>- Cleric gets healed by secondary healer and both will get COTH'd back. <BR>- Even cheesier, but requires mage, success rate of aggro clear is 30% at best. <BR>- Plus COTH has long casting time, so in effect if it does work and cleric is COTH'd, the secondary healer is dead unless they have a mage in their group as well. Hmmm<P>C. Battle Rez with Click Stick<BR>- Buff to full. Melees Tank. No heals. Melees die. Melees get click rezed. Melees loot wait rez effects to wear off and continue tanking.<BR>- Problem is what if ubermob has killed all melees before one returns to tank? whole raid dies.<P>I fail to see the satisfaction in the above 3 tactics.<P>By Tuning to beat the "uberguilds" Verant has <BR>(1) Made uberguilders upset<BR>(2) Ruined 55+ healing for the rest of us non uberguilders<BR>(3) If the POH and POF changes come through, most casual players will be out of luck as well.<P>All to add downtime and increase frustration.<P>I swear, if I weren't addicted to the social interaction this game offers, I'd be quitting too.<P>P.P.S. I AM NOT A CLERIC, I used to think they were overpowered, but now I feel for them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There you 'win' and should be happy about that lone fact.  What will be a shock however is that unlike pool, chess or basketball this is a closed game.  Sony is the end all of Everquest, when they pack up shop, your chars go.  When the NBA leaves, i have a ball in the closet and a hoop on the garage.<P>I am rambling, i am sorry for that, but i do have a point here, and its pretty plain.  You know what your talking about, i just dont complelty agree with you because i HAVE talked with clerics in your league, and they DO say there is no problem.

</FONT><HR>If you really want to quibble at specifics I can make it easier for you. You want a better metaphor? Let's say you are a master gambler.<P>You've been playing in a Casino for about 10 hours. You arrived with $600, you win some and you lost some, but the pot for each has been steadily increasing and so has the ante. The pot is now $145,000. <P>You're playing blackjack. Your faceup card is a king, the facedown is an Ace. This is almost a surefire win. The people you play with (for all you know, they might be Verant) are not very good at Cards, you've been able to scam them several times. Suddenly the dealer tells you an Ace is now worth 15 points, new house rule. There goes that chance at the pot.<P>You have $20,000 left. The pot is now $150,000. You figure, what the heck, I'm very good at blackjack and these guys aren't, I can pick up some more cash, just have to remember the new Ace rule. The Ante is about $1,000 a game now.<P>Your next hand nets 14 points, you call for a draw, it's a 7 (which is 21, or Blackjack, a great hand) so you just made more money... except the dealer changes the rules again, and you lose. The Ante keeps increasing. At times you get lucky, and win even with the changing rules, but usually you lose more than you put in. You are good at blackjack, you have no idea what the house is playing, but you figure since you are a good blackjack player and everyone here sucks, you SHOULD be able to make an extremely profitable night.<P>It goes on and on and you get more frustrated. Sure, you've earned a lot of money, but no where near what you could have. A few strings of losses in a row and you're ready to call it quits, even with a half a million on the line.<P>That a better situation? Replace money with emotional satisfaction. We are extremely happy when we do well. We are insanely happy when we do exceptionally well.<P>--- End Metaphor<P>"In other games skill would seperate us, you or i may be different in chess, or basketball, but not this. As has been pointed out many times this game is merely a matter of time. I will be 50 just like you i had your TIME. I choose not to use that time, but it doesnt mean i cant bring perspective on the debate. if you think different, then by all means do so with my blessing (weither you want it or not)"<P>I'd be among the first to say this game takes very little skill. But it's amazing how badly some people play it... usually I pick on Druids at this point but I'll be P/C. Trust me there is a margin of skill, communication, and social skills required to play this game well. You want to claim you'd be 50 the same rate as me had you had your time? Newsflash: I hit 50 in just under 21 days. Untwinked, first character, no previous knowledge of the game. Half the people I know have three times my playing time at level 40. If you could do as well in the same time, more power to you, but apparently 90% of the server population couldn't.<P>"you know what your talking about, i just dont complelty agree with you because i HAVE talked with clerics in your league, and they DO say there is no problem. Coupled witht he fact it IS a game, you see how little of a footing you have."<P>No, I don't. I can express my opinion if I wish. I don't like the rules changed two years after release. That was not what I bargained for in a Dynamic game. I expected GM events, not dynamically altering my spell lines when they proved too powerful after two years of standardization. Perhaps it's just my opinion. And lately I haven't played EQ, because I have no wish to. There's really nothing for me to do in the high levels any more except help other people pursue their goals... once I got my Complete Heal, Rez, Hero, and Marzin my life was complete. I could get my epic stick. That would be fun, I could follow people around and cut their downtime by huge numbers.<P>That's a minor rant. The game has just started to lose it's fun value for me, it did a long time ago, and this series of nerfs is ... oh god I have to use the phrase...

</FONT><HR>First, I don't care what they change or change back.  I will be leaving when something else comes out that is decent.  I still log into EQ for chat and to resurrect people (not like I am doing anything else now, so it isn't a big thing).  Being freed from the experience grind and reagent grind has actually made it more fun.<P>Second, let me explain why the Velious Breastplate nerf was the final straw.  When I read about the Velious Breastplate, I wanted it.  When I heard the Plane of Growth was on Faydwer faction, I spent a long time thinking about going KOS.  When the drop rates in the Plane of Growth were nerfed, I decided that I didn't want to go permanently KOS in Faydwer, and decided to give up on the Velious Breastplate and just stick with mana healing.  I never expected to have a Velious Breastplate at all.  So, why did the nerf infuriate me? (I am no longer mad, I no longer care.)  Items like the Kunark Cleric arms and the Kunark Paladin helm were not items intended to heal, so I can well understand their being nerfed.  The Kunark Breastplate was something that limited gameplay for those without, so I can accept its nerf as well.  Other nerfs had similar reasonable reasons.  Verant should have learned from these items what NOT to put in the game.  So, when they put in the Velious Breastplate, it seemed reasonably balanced.  You could only have so much healing per target, so it was not unbalancing when they nerfed it to a casting time almost the length of the spell.  It simply gave a Cleric another tool.  Sounds reasonable enough.  When they nerfed it, they said two things.  <P>One, "We are too incompetent to know what we feel is unbalancing, so you can never trust us.  Let me restate this, even if this issue has come up numerous times before, you can still never trust us to know our own feelings about something."<P>Second (my feeling), "Clerics are overpowered and the other priest classes need to be as groupable as a Cleric, (all well and good so far).  Since we feel the other priest classes have enough healing as it currently stands, we will continue to nerf Clerics until they equal."  Perhaps I am overreacting.  I don't think so.  Abashi stated that Druids and Shamans would be happy to take over the role of healer when Clerics left.  I take him to mean that that was what was originally intended.<P>My trust in Verant has taken numerous hits in the past.  Statement one left me unable to trust them ever again.  Statement two said "More nerfs."  No thanks.<P>EQ is still a nice game.  I simply use it as a chat interface myself though.  Will there be more Clerics coming up to replace those of us who leave?  Sure.  EQ will be around another two years at minimum.  UO is still around after all.  For those Clerics that will replace those of us that leave, I will you all the joy that you can have in the class.  *** Salute ***</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Yes, especialy for the begining of fights, which is the hardest time to manage agro.  Is it being blown out of proportion?  Yes, very few encounters have hurt significantly by the healing changes in their current form.

</FONT><HR>Hmm...after I finished reading page 3, I skip page 4 hah...<P>Most of u ppl posting here doesnt have a clue of doing things at high lvl... You are not just facing 2,3 mobs hitting u for 100 points around.  We are talking about fighting a mob that can hit u 4 times in a roll for 850 pts each and have like 10 to 30k hp(or more).  <P><BR>...Talking about constantly challenged hah, is it the same meaning as constantly changing the same thing over and over just to make u lost?  or it should mean constantly "adding" new elements so to increase the use of real tactics and to build up more fun?<P>I hate those ppl keep saying "Stop whinning", or "If u dont like it, just quit it" or "Come on!!  It is just a game!"  Well...it is such a retard to have this thought I thnk...  So what u mean is whenever u see somthing wrong, u just gonna shut up and live with it??  U mean we can't be more serious playing game??  Dont mention about the dollars we spent on our account, it is the time we spent on it! (time is money)  To some of u, it may be stupid, but then to the others, that they choose to spend their time on this game, it is simply just a way to fulfill their life.  Just like some ppl like to play sport or go have a drink after work with friend, others will prefer to run back to their house and play Everquest!<P>Well, ok, even VI admitted that having those effect on donal BP or whatsoever was wrong, then does it mean that they can just go ahead and do whatever they want on the items that are our owns afterall??  <P>We are not a whinning bunch.  We are here to tell the true and try to make some senses...  Feel free to post and discuss... But then if u just gonna come and post somthing like "Shut up" or accusing us as something without a meaningful and thoughtful reason, then I think u should just go http://www.amishrakefight.org/gfy/<P>Cathom Demon<BR>Ogre Warlord<BR>The Harmonium, Xev<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I look at all the postings for the level 50 and below clerics and laugh. Do you even know what aggro is? Aggro is more than getting hit by one MOB for 30hp in LGUK every 8 seconds. Yes you love playing a Cleric now, but you time will come. <P>A few days ago I went up to the Plane of Hate. These MOB's for the most part do not hit very hard compared to Kunark and Velious. 80% of the time I cast a CH or Remedy even, I at at least 1 MOB on me. Thankfully enough we had like 6 chanters for crowd control, or I'd be spending a lot of time naked. This is just PoH, go try out some of the MOBs in Kunark and Velious and tell me how u feel. <P>As for giving Druids and Shammans Remedy and Sup Heal.......This is a complete waste. Try casting a Sup Heal on a warrior with 3K+ Hp. Yes you guessed it...MANADUMP! As for Remedy I only use it on casters or as a quick heal to keep someone alive that cannot wait for a 10 second CH. This puts the druids and shammies 90% useless compared to 95% useless before when it comes to healing.<P>I have spent almost 84 levels as a Cleric now. Yes I deleted myself once and quit. But then Verant made some changes and I came back. The last month I have seen nerf after nerf for Clerics. I am hanging on a thread now. And yes once the Clerics go, so will everyone else. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>cathom, yes i agree wholeheartedly on your decision to play everquest, i do it to.<P>I think the point is that while you have every right to say 'this aspect is wrong, here's why, now please look at it' you shoulnt go to the lengths that some go to on the boards.<P>Furthermore, weither it is liked or not, it IS just a game, it IS just a diverson.  No one can stop verant from making all clerics look like court jesters and only do things in 1 point damage incriments.  They have this right, and it seems to be lost on some people.  The way it is carried on around here no one even stops to think that it IS verants game.  You have no way of assuring that this game and its servers will be here tommorow or next year.  As far as 'my time is spent on here' get a dose of reality.<P>What will you say when this game ends? will you whine on other message boards because verant took your game away and wasnt supposed to?  Look at other hobbies in general (i dont consider this to be one really).  They have an almost infinite lifespan because you own everything to it, even playing computer games, you OWN it.  However you only own Everquest as long as Sony keeps on having the servers up, that will go away at some point.  When it does the whole game goes away.<P>What does this have to do with clerics?  It has a little to do with them simply because many who are complaining should keep some perspective.  Yes you spent alot of time and by virtue of that know alot about the game.  Yes you are proud to have a level whatever thingymcjigger and can quad kite hapymobs all day long.  However unlike other things to be proud of, all you will have is the memory.  What does this mean?  It means instead of spending ALOT of time on here constantly complaining that nerfA is ruining yoru game experience, just say your peace, let it see if it has support, and then go on and play.  <P>The points from the original poster and others are valid.  I do belive that in some cases it has been hard now for clerics, and i dont completely agree about the timming.  I support a few threads that state this and want it changed.  What i do not support is the constant 'nagging' over things like this.  It seems 'everyone' is quiting over this, 'everyone' cant play the game anymore and will cry, 'everyone' is going to hate verant for a long time.  This is just inane and silly simply because its a game.  It is one thing to do this with social issues, by all means post a billion threads on another website talking about your rl issues, beacuse its rl.  <P>Because of verant you have a board here to say what you will, remmeber that. if it wasnt here you coudlnt even say what you have over a small game with a short life that will go away at some point.<P>I think mostly its just odd that people go to these lengths on a game that they know that they do onot have the final say over, i dunno.  Just seems like you live with it and play, most people do that anyway.  Those who dont go on to other games, big deal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>By the way for all you blunt and dull morons out there that just don't get it.  You don't make a game more exciting and less boring by Nerfing players or taking away their equipment etc.  You change the monsters so that their AI is better in example.  To one sort of attack they might change to a different tactic or learn a different way to defend themselves against the players, maybe keep staying close to guards pathing around.  But what does VI do?  Puts up HP to 400k that quad hits for 850.  Players have enough wit and are smart enough to be able to take them down, then all VI does is nerf the players.  Why because they do not know any better and their test team is a myth.<P>Bulwei Grimshadow &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>Viciously Spunky &lt;The Harmonium&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lazarian, isn't there a nice thread on how Dorn should be gimped out of North Ro going on in a newbie board somewhere that you should attend to?<P>Honestly. This is the part where someone decides to be nice and take you off to the side and explain that all this talk here is big-people-talk. This is also where the nice person explains what "ignorance" means, and why you shouldn't open your mouth unless you have a solid soapbox under your feet.<P>I'm not shooting off at the mouth or trying to flame you, bud. Just trying to let you know in the nicest way I can at this point that you are Waaaay out of line. Partly in that you've taken up arms against a pro-CLERIC post that is obviously well-founded, and partly in that you have come to a forum that VERANT itself set up so that its customers could VOICE their OPINIONS and DISCUSS GAME ISSUES to b*tch at people for doing it.<P>DISCUSS GAME ISSUES.<P>Like the rangers did. They came here and they DISCUSSED GAME ISSUES that they felt were pertinent. Their problem was a post-50 problem. And for soooooooooooome reason, a butt-load of pre-level-50 rangers came out of the woodwork to state unequivocally and unerringly that there was absolutely no problem with rangers. Why do you people do this? You have no idea what youre talking about! We know you have no idea! We were that level and we know we had no idea then! Of course, the outcome was that after months of heated debate and relentless discussion from concerned rangers, and after Verant told us repeatedly that there was not, in fact, a problem with rangers and that they would not, in fact, be un-gimping them they took steps to un-gimp them. You think they'd have done that if no one had complained?<P>I still have no idea what you are trying to do in this thread, unless you are a troll (at which point your intentions become glaringly obvious).<P>I'm afraid, my level 20-something friend, that it is you who is are is are mistakenededed. Now, run along son, and kill some caiman.<P>Cam</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had a sad experience last night.  I was playing my druid when a friend logged on to look for me.  He came to tell me that he's quitting the game, because in the space of 24 hours his friends list went from 20 people to 0 people, due to the cleric nerfs.  He is a member of an uber guild on another server, and I wouldn't be at all suprised to see that guild slowly evaporate due to lack of clerical support.  Saddened, but not highly surprised.  I hope I talked him into staying in the game, and making a new character back on my server; I offered to help him get through the early boring levels with my druid.  <P>That's because my cleric is in retirement too.  Of course, many clerics will be powerleveled to replace those of us "old school" types who have finally, sadly, realized that all of our pleas will fall on deaf ears.  But I doubt they will have the same skills for heal timing, mana managment, etc. that those of us who played this class as our first love for so long have developed over time.  <P>Hmmmm. . . Now that I think of it, could this be Verant's aim?  The old schoolers are "too good" and need to be driven from the game to make room for the mediocre ones?  People won't be able to whine about lack of clerics, there will be plenty.  But they will be on an order of magnitude less effective, so the aim of "things taking longer" will be achieved.  <P>Drisanna Haelan<BR>High Priestess of Brell<BR>"Ready rez?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Now I just think you an insensitive pig (and I'm sorry to the boards for a personal attack on someone ). Many of us have family members that died and lived through those camps. Many of us remember our grandparents crying nightly over the loss of thier family just by looking at photos. <P>Your apology doesnt nothing for us. <P>How you got such respected players as Trelane and Bayerithe and (a few others) to fight along side you I will NEVER understand. <P>All I have to say to you is before you go using analogies like this you may want to read up on what exactly HAPPENED in those camps before you post here.<P>All I can say is you're a pathetic human being to even bring a GAME in even ths SMALLEST comparison to concentration camps and the holocaust.<P>Again, sorry to the boards for this personal attack on someone but when you speak on something that goes to the heart of my ancestry and my family be prepared for this kind of backlash</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, You know what... Someone brings up valid points and immediatly he's whining. <P>He/she is mad that a character he has been playing for so long is now being made obsolete. <P>I'm a cleric myself. I have been playing from Beta (Yeah yeah I know big whoop ;p) I've played a tank my whole time since this christmas when I started playing my cleric. I absolutely Adore my cleric. <P>Unfortuantly she is getting pounded on ruthlessly none stop, in PaW, in OverThere, in Frontier Moutains... You name it, the mob's leave the tanks and I'm running around kiting it because the Tank's are like "Umm we can't pull it off you" Grrrr <P>That annoys me, it hasn't been like this since the last couple of patches. Now that I got Superior Healing, I know I'm going to be dying... Because of the fact that "improved" Aggro will cause.<P>Needless to say it leaves a awful taste in my mouth. You can take this as whining or complaining.. I personally don't care. You don't know me, nor do you probably care... Hell, good for me. <P>However, if you don't like what this thread is saying, Good, Don't read it. You have that choice. Oh and another one too Smart guys, NOT POSTING in it! You think we care about your condesending, complaining about our whining posts?<P>No, I don't think so. So the lessson today Kiddies is "You DON'T have to read this, that is why IE and Netscape has BACK buttons on your browser" And "You DON'T have to respond. Just click 'clear fields' Thank you..."<P>And another thing that's irkling me ;p ***, how does RL age matter? This is the internet, no one knows how old you 'really' are. And it matters if your posts are mature or not. If you are 56 years old and post like a 14 year old, people will think you are a 14 year old no matter what. <P>sheesh!! People!!

It might be a sensitive subject, yes I agree to that but Baven didn't say anything that would let me believe he said it to upset anyone.

</FONT><HR>Excellent points made by Baven.  To bad its ruined by the natzi wordage.   Had you left that out you may have gotten some feedback from VI, but with that junk in there I doubt it. A shame =/<P>It sure would be nice if some of you people that only jump into threads just to "debate", and argue for no other reason than to argue, would  maybe work on your characters in EQ instead.  Maybe someday you would be able to see these things first hand and actually be able to make comments based on experience.

I'll say this again (because we know eachother and I like you) How a childish, selfish person like him can get you people .. wait yes I do.. phat lewt. nm<P>Point is.. dont bring up the past then. And certainly dont compare a past like that, something that STILL affects my grandmother 40+ years later, to an inconsequential game. <P>I didnt like his analogy. THere are a thousand others he could of used. Instead he chose to compare a game to the holocaust. You tell ME whos in the wrong here? No, let me tell YOU... it affects me the same way someone saying the holocaust didnt happen.<P>Dont blindly stick up for something that is knowingly wrong because you're in his guild Bulwei. Its not deserved here. He made that particular analogy for a reason and his reason is insulting.<P>a cleric leaving the game and being forced to quit is not the same as<P>My grandmother spending months in Sobibar.<BR>My great aunt and uncle forced into slave labor and then slaughtered. Their 6 and 7 year old children being carried out on a cart from the gas chambers naked and piled on topof other bodies being recognized by someone in their town (this is how they found out about their children's deat.). <P>Now you tell me was HIS analogy appropriate?
